I agree! Do it. I'm so frustrated with the lack of concern. Young women are the worst violators. They are talking on their damn phones or smoking and just plow through in their fast moving vehicles.  When I am first in line at a red, I have to double check to ensure there are no cars coming through on the red when my light is green. I'm fed up with this total BS from so many drivers who know they can catch reds!  Yellow means slow down and NOT speed up.
Who the hell is Chee Ho??  A woman leader in China???
Relegating white males to the "white trash"pile is the order of the day.  I get it.  The new paradigm is to get more women in all jobs.  I get it.  Women are 60% of college grads today.  They don't get it.  Inequalities exist.    The bad deal about the white trash pile is that it is growing,   angry about society as a whole,  and will be a  handful for the PC police,  the establishment.   Jabbing that tiger just to see it growl will have a bad ending.  It appears the liberals can't help themselves,  however.  White Trash are probably the Majority in this country.    Elites are quite  limited by the paucity of exclusive private universities where they are educated,  meet mates, and live their lives in association with each other,  yet attempt to govern this country from such a small base.  Money can't buy peace in class warfare.    Overuse of  the adjective/noun "sexist",  "bigot",  "racist",  "deplorable" and others,   will precipitate   no good,  and will shake our U.S. foundations.
Oh yes, that ago old debating tactic of calling your opponent the worst name you can think  of.   For the ex-Harperites that is to call Justin Trudeau by a woman's name.    Why do right wingers hate women so much?
So what are you advocating here, that we let serial rapists continue to rape because all women are liars?  I'm talking about a case that really happened. In fact, I could be talking about any number of cases where a serial rapist attacked multiple women before being caught.  What you're talking about is imaginary.  In any case, threatening to go to police isn't a crime.  If somebody repeatedly went to police to accuse men of sexual assault, the police would know from their investigation and act accordingly.  The bottom line is that most men accused of sexual assault will not have their name published, unless they're convicted.  It's a red herring.
Personally, I would much rather be vaporized by a North Korean warhead, then go to bed knowing that one of ours has  left countless thousands of women and children writhing in agony with radiation and thermal burns.  Once again, we have bunch of stupid white and Asia men who hurl cheap threats at each other, when their peoples are wondering why they don't even make the attempt to sit down and talk. Bush didn't help things by calling this kid's dad a Pygmy. I guess Pygmy's get their backs up, if 70 subs, 700 planes and 1,000,000 men and women ca be said to be a expression of hurt feelings.  In July 1914, every European monarch knew that a general war would have catastrophic consequences---you can read it in their diaries---but they were too weak and proud to avoid it. Today we have two buffoons at the controls, whose lack of people skills make them totally unsuited to conflict resolution.   As if we are not all exposed. Where is our PM on this? Ducking? When he should be mediating?
Its a good thing you are around to tell us what visually constitutes what is a sufficiently enough female body. Slow down and really think about what you are saying, that you are going to base the way you treat someone on the way they appear to you, wether or not that person possesses any value is subject to your opinion of their bust-waist-hip ration and wether you find them sufficiently attractive enough to make them sexual targets. That is just gross.
Oh well, they shouldn't have screwed with Bernie, pissed a lot of people off, which wasn't smart when you're running a woman who was more unpopular then Trump. Pure genius.   Clinton sucked, they knew that, depending on the fact that hopefully someone suckier in Trump would give her the White House was plain stupidity.  Elections have consequences, so does running one POS against another POS.
Simple answer. You have a penis. There's a male washroom for you. You have a vagina there's a female washroom for you. Not a hard concept to grasp, not much discussion there unless you have neither.
Well, let's imagine I create a new religion where I state the following in my holy book: - my religion is going to take over the world - anyone who does not believe in my religion is an infidel and should be killed (unless that person converts to what I believe) - anyone who joins my new religion then leaves it should be put to death - anyone who draws a picture of my prophet or insults my prophet should be put to death - my prophet was divinely inspired when having sex with his nine-year old "wife" - anyone who is gay should be put to death - a woman is worth less than a man  Could I then condemn those who disagree with me as being "phobic" about my faith?   Or, to put it another way, must we be tolerant of intolerance?
Let's stay in the rational lane for a few minutes to see where it takes us.  Priests seeking same sex sex with post-pubescents is entirely closer to "gay" than a male adult sexually abusing a girl infant.     Just trying to think through the logical consequences of these different cases.
And the Germans didn't want the Jews so therefore they can just exterminate them   Pregnant women can always give their children up for adoption  Otherwise they suffer the risk if they don't go to confession of possibly going to hell
He was getting fresh with the transgender woman, and she said "Cut it out!"
What a load of crap. Trump has been accused of sexual harassment or assault by a dozen women. I believe them and so do most reasonable thinking people.
We will see women as popes  when Islamic men stop raping women, playing tahharush, killing gays, forcing them to cover up, not allowing them to drive, stop performing genital mutilation etc. Jk we know neither will ever happen. Now run along and make my white self a sandwich honey!!
The MSM like all Religious leaders hate criticism and support anything that can reduce criticism of themselves. This is a ridiculous editorial calling for censorship - WHERE IS THE EDITORIAL DEMANDING MUSLIMS STOP HATING JEWS, CHRISTIANS, ZOROASTRIANS, ATHEISTS, WOMEN, GAYS? It is just crazy what is going on here, a total tyranny is being put nto place and we must fight it to the death!
Jennifer, are you on Clinton's payroll?  Why would any respectable, intelligent woman or man vote for or support a liar, thief and disreputable sexual predator enabler like HRC?
What rights of Muslims are being violated--that they need Christians to come to their defense? If anything, I think our country and government are quite favorable to Muslims, while being hostile to Christianity.  For example: putting a statue of Mary in urine is considered art, yet the person who wanted to burn Korans was called out and strongly condemned.  A professor who requested people to send him consecrated hosts was not strongly condemned, but those who desecrate Muslim sacred things are.  A professor has his students draw a picture of Jesus and tells them to stomp on it and nothing happens to him.  What would happen to a professor who tells his students to draw the prophet Mohammad and stomp on that?  Oh, and when have the Muslims been called out for their moral teachings and their teachings on women?   I don't think the Muslim community is having their rights trampled that Christians need to defend them.  I do think the rights of Christians are being trampled.
Yep. One Somali cop shoots a white lady and all cops everywhere are gunning people down. Well argued. I'M convinced.
Deadbeat Trump grew up in the 50s when the TV mom and dad slept in separate beds.  Pity any woman that has to sleep with that slovenly fool.
Again, much truth in this article, but very one sided. I spent many years in the middle east and there are some questions that need to be answered, and while these to not pertain to all Muslims,  they are prevalent enough to impact the societies they have settled in. What to do with immigrants that flatly refuse to adapt to the local culture (combine this with how women purposefully are forbidden to learn the language or even associate with the local culture and it's people)? How do we deal with the radical reactions when it comes to criticism of their religion (think the Muhammed cartoons) What about the priority of law...secular law versus religious based law? Whom should adapt to whom?  Are there haters of Muslims in Western country spurred on by media? Absolutely...the reverse is true for us "infidels" to tho. One idiot driving a truck does not signify a wave of western hate, as little as a knife wielding extremist represents all Muslims.
The article should read how these women will clustercuck NAFTA negotiations.  Women have no right to even vote, let alone attempt to negotiate anything.  Look what they did by voting in this man child feminist.
When Trump refused to call out Nazis and white supremacists even after a domestic terrorist killed one woman and maimed more in Charlottesville, Virginia—and then averred that “very fine people” were marching under Confederate flags—the extremists recognized the signal. When, only a week later, he pardoned Joe Arpaio—a man whom white supremacists had made a cause célèbre—they saw him in their corner again. When Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the administration was bringing the hammer down on the DACA program, he cited two lies popular among far-right nativists: That “Dreamers” take jobs away from Americans, and that the program prompted the surge in unaccompanied child immigrants (who, for the record, are not eligible for DACA status).
The Church's "definitive statement" is based on neither theology nor logic.  All God's children (male and female) are made in God's image.  That image does not reference genitalia.  Both men and women are equipped to function as priests, that is, servant-leaders.  To deny women one of the Seven sacraments because women shave their legs and not their faces is bald-faced injustice.  "Either ordain women or stop baptizing them."
I did it a little differently.  On my son's 18th birthday he asked me to take him to a titty bar.  I told him I would never go into such a place and I hoped that he wouldn't either.  Women were not to be thought of a pieces of meat.
Yes, he wakes up everyday thinking up plans how to pollute the air/water and how to hurt poor people! He hates "brown" people and women...blah, blah, blah. Boring and lame arguments.
Sorry Jonah--the straw man fails the smell test, he's rotten to the core. I dislike Pence because he's a 'Sunday go to meeting' Christian who has lost any sense of the god of love. His policies are aweful--he left the state for the VP because he was likely to lose reelection because the folks of his states knew and felt what he really believed...it's not the Christian God but the old Testament vengeful god he follows. So his cute and a bit strange bio wasn't the issue...although he wants to do things to Women;s right I think are a crime, he can act however he wants in private. Isn't that the real point Jonah? That he should be asked to be judged by the content of his actions, of how he chooses to love others, and the policies he uses to make life for all better. In this test he's a loser!
My brother worked for Canada Trust. He was told off the record that if it came between hiring a woman in her 20's-30's or a man, hire the man. That was 20 years ago. I'm confident the situation has only gotten worse for career minded women.  This is one of Justins dumbest ideas and will only create more so-called wage gap.
Did you GRAB his hand from his side ? Because that would, indeed, be assault (or possibly battery - the differences are subtle and only really important to lawyers). But if you held out your hand, and he reached out to shake it, then he DID consent to that contact.  Consent doesn't have to be verbal. If you claim non-verbal consent, the court will judge on testimony whether it was reasonable to interpret the actions of the person as consent. If he pulled his hand back, and you grabbed toward it-  you'd be guilty. If he shook yours - you're fine.  Much as - if you grab a woman and kiss her, that's usually sexual assault. If you stop a few centimeters away, and wait to see if you she comes in and kisses you back - then it is consensual. You tried to commit a reductio et absurdium fallacy, but all you managed to do is be silly. If you intended to show that the law is silly, then you failed, because it's not as your silly example is entirely legal.
My advice to the woman? Buy a gun and if it happens again shoot his sorry a**
the media is preying on trump's outright lies and psychotic babbling. What you call "inaccuracies" are outright lies and distortions and the press won't let him get away with it, thank god.   the few anarchists and women are way more than came to his inauguration. what does that tell you?  trump is a degenerate corrupt sleazebag who is mentally ill and the sooner we are rid of him the better.
Are you saying that lesbian porn is acceptable if you think the women are beautiful?
Yes.  We know children will act out to get attention.  All his life, Trump has been getting away with outrageous acts, from punching his 2nd grade teacher to his obnoxious behavior with women.  He may crave attention so much it doesn't matter whether it is positive or negative.
Deflection to all the other womanizers past, present and future does nothing but attempt to ignore your lying womanizer and his shill.  "I'm a thief, but it wasn't really valuable property"  is one of the worst defenses of a thief I've heard lately.  Try that one in a real court of law and see how much additional time you get for failure to acknowledge responsibility.  I wasn't aware that misogyny is justified if it is done by a wife.  Is that a legal principle or just your personal ethical view on the subject of misogyny?  Does that apply to Republican wives as well as Democratic wives?    As for 'justice', using that word in the same sentence with either Clinton is a mockery of the term,
Sorry, but I completely disagree with your assessment, and I think it is a form of age-old "blame the victim" mentality to dissect his (and by extension her) act as if there is only one correct reaction to physical abuse.  Unfortunately many women have to deal with a wide variety and level of unwanted physical behavior.  Someone like Taylor Swift is probably often faced with a question of whether or not to make a big deal of inappropriate behavior right at that instant or at a better time for her.  Her bodyguard would not have let someone do her serious physical harm, but he stood up and correctly took his cues from her on what to do with an obnoxious abusive scumbag.  She chose to wait until just after the event to deal with it, which was one of many totally appropriate ways to handle it.
Sorry but her history speaks for itself I didn't bash the victims girl did I? Besides if your so ignorant you can't agree with a politically incorrect person then that's your beef. All name calling aside she is mos def a tramp. And you can bay at the moon all you want, sticks and stones man/woman sticks and stones.
"Just" Planned Parenthood? Planned Parenthood is healthcare for women. And it wasn't "my" statement.  You're a shameless troll.
I thought taxpayers paid for education not women's sexual habits. What happened to I take care of my kids, you take care of yours. If you can't afford to pay their way until their adults why did you have them?
duh Allan? duh?  Allan?  how do you value female children by killing female fetuses because they are female?
…who gives you the right to tell a woman’s age??…I thought she was 46….damn...
Look like they won't be comparing notes on how to sexually assault female colleagues anymore.
It should also be remembered that that Trump family fortune was started by his grandfather, Friederich Drumpf, by exploiting women in the brothels that he owned. https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-trump-family-fortune/
All I see is a bunch of dumb bunny fems not realizing they are shilling for Justin.  Ladies , if you want to sit in the House of Commons;  go get yourselves elected. It is called democracy
Nope, just what we need a drunken old crazy woman who thinks the none of the rules apply to her.
' The Trump scam unravels more and more with each passing day.    The sheer level of incompetence is truly staggeringly stunning. . And Trump?  He's "trying to present a new 'sense' of competence" ?  Hilarious.  And pitiable.  And disgusting.  Trying to project a 'sense of competence'?  . That's as pitiable as this Trump quote:  "“I had some beautiful pictures taken in which I had a big smile on my face. I looked happy, I looked content, I looked like a very nice person, which in theory I am.”  Competent?  He'll tell you, in theory he's competent.  He'll also tell you he's like a smart person.  .   He failed so badly to show any shred of competence his own sycophants are leaking at levels unheard of in the history of the office.  Trump is a joke.  He's a belligerent childish buffoon.  And a failed cheap and petty con man.  . . Resist Trump.  Resist Trump's fascist incompetent agenda.  Call and write your Senators and your Congressmen and women every single day.  .
No,  doubting is fine, like I said. Denigrating, lying about, and calling the President every name in the book, isn't. Whereas Obama is doubted by many, he was never called names by any, even though patriots thought of many. You guys keep harping about him grabbing women back when he was in show biz. Where sleeping your way to the top, and the casting couch was what it was.  You might not know it but Muslims have been killing each other for a thousand years because each other sees the other as an infidel, worthy only of death. Now they are targeting Europe, who gave them refuge. Now they are targeting us as well. You probably don't even know what  Taqiyya is.  But if Hillary had won, we would be in serious trouble. The millions of unveiled immigrants would be infiltrated by as much as 10- 20%. We're talking hundreds of thousands fundamentalist Muslims who want to get to paradise and be rewarded with 100 virgins.But lets say only 1000 got thru & killed 5 apiece. Is that acceptable?
I agree, utilitas, that the pro-life side cannot (and, I think, must not) win and I also agree that we need pro-life push to force us to draw lines around abortion.  We need to work on making planned pregnancies normative - doesn't sound very Catholic, I know, but it recognizes that women who work and have families need to have better control over when and how many children they have.     The wider availability of effective contraceptives is most important to what has driven down the number of abortions, but so has better sex education.  Planned Parenthood is very important to those efforts and I want government funding to them to continue.  State legislatures have been "drawing lines" around abortion, with the 20 week limits.  They screw up with "bodily probes" and artificial restrictions on doctors, required waiting periods - obvious, stupid, wasteful.  I don't want abortions driven into the back-alleys and wire coathangers.  So we need to reduce it but keep it legal.
No, I'm saying punishing the millions of Muslim women who get an education because of the 1000s who are forbidden to puts, you on the same levels as those who burn down the schools.
I think it's a bit frightening how much time and effort Sylvia Stead has devoted to counting pictures in the Globe, and then deciding whichever day of the week suits the sexism narrative of the "picture gender gap"  This isn't simply garbage journalism...it's just plain garbage. What an utter waste of valuable page space. This is what happens when you view EVERYTHING through a gendered lens...all the time. It warps your brain.  I'm guessing next we'll hear yet more on the "gender wage gap" and the systemic patriarchal oppression of women in the workforce.  this is Feminist la-la land....utterly disconnected from reality.
Are the parents and the kids too stupid to deal with their lives? Perhaps. The average teenage boy in the US consumes seven to eight sugary sodas per day. The females aren't doing much better. Is it any surprise we have an epidemic of obesity and early onset diabetes?  While the tax is small, those average lads will be paying over a dollar a day to keep up their habit. The money raised will hopefully teach them and those younger than them how to make better choices in food and drink
You still don't know much, then. Sessions has a long, infamous history, most of which he was allowed to leave out of the normal vetting paperwork, something the Republicans stated was a felony when they accused a Democrat-who had produced far more information than Sessions-of not providing all of his relevant history. I'm so sick of Republican double standards and lies. As far as I'm concerned just nominating hating Sessions was a disgrace, confirming him would be a slap in the face to women, people of color and LGBTQ communities everywhere.  Appalling.
You have shown your racist side before and now here comes your anti gay side. So you think 5 gay male nurses huh? Lmao. I would bet there was both women and men. You just upset because no one ever wants to look at your package.  You trump people all have small units and that's why y'all are so hateful. Just sayin you gomer pyle looking clown
motley:  And yes, UNFORTUNATELY  there are Lotsa  smart Criminals in our City, County, State, and Federal Governments.  You stated, "Or you piss off your girlfriend by having sex with her sister and she 'drops the dime".  Nothing worse than a "Scorned Woman".    As far as the dime, that was back in the  day when a "HO" was a garden tool..........I  miss those days.....
I, Tiniell Cato comes now w/ a complaint & petition on behalf of myself, Alex Tsimerman, StandUp America,& all others likewise to stop democrat fascism in Seattle. Fascism is a idiotic phase controlled by Nazi Social Democratic Mafias (government & corporations) that is one-sided & literally sucking the life, blood,& money out of community w/ unfair unlawful practices pertaining to Equality.  As a Candidate & Community Leader, it is my duty to use our impact of power in the voice of all People. For all People to be Equal,open the Bertha room in City Hall during all elections/meetings in honor of Bertha who was women Mayor 100 yrs ago,once a week for open honest conversation unlimited to restore Freedom of Speech, Equality,& Constitution for Justice for all.  To stop fascism,this will bring all People, government, corporations, rich & poor to have a open honest conversation for a common ground so all people can live healthy emotionally & economically in our City.
Btw I watched a program on tv about this case that made me want the puke! This woman was despicable in Every sense of the word. And I don't understand why there isn't more reaction and outrage from this story..?? I'm the second person to comment! Guess Everyone Else is on FB poking one another instead of caring about the Real injustices. So Sad...
Democrats have given millions of US jobs to illegal aliens and are now importing thousands of young Syrian Muslim males who, under Sharia law, treat women like dogs, believe homosexuality is punishable by death, and that all "infidels" must convert to Islam or die.  If illegal immigrants can find work so easily in America, why can't young black males?  Maybe Paul Scott knows.  Why would any woman, black or LGBT vote for a Democrat?  Along with the Kennedy brothers, Bill Clinton is among the biggest womanizers in American history.
Trump does spend a fair amount of time thinking about pretty white women no older than 25. Just look at how he touches his daughters various body parts in public. What does he do in private?
Never did become a woman.  All internal male biological markers remain including jaw and pelvis, larger heart and lungs, and greater upper body muscle mass.  Left lunacy knows no bounds.
Plat, try actually quoting instead of riffing on what she said. By supporting her opponent, you should be asking the four sitting counselors how THEY will work to mending fences: they interjected bias, not she.  I assume, from your silence, that you approve of Kitty's tenure, the riot we just witnessed in Park blocks because of her lack of leadership? Further, you must love the invisibility of our city hall, the huge lease payments we're paying to house city employees in fat-cat developer offices, downtown?  You say everything except that she's "a nasty woman."
And you think it is alright for women to be allowed to kill their babies so you want the government to allow people to do what YOU think is right.
in my early 20s, i too had "the supernatural powers to breach the spiritual barriers that protected the area where women's genital parts were located."
Does this woman even know what she is talking about?  I would love to know where she was educated and what magazines, newspapers and books she reads.  She is just parroting someone else,  Should she be fired?  Yes.  I am not going to watch ESPN until she is fired!
I actually came to ADN to look for the article on the Kansas men who were plotting to bomb a mosque. I was interested in the article because none of the articles I found referred to these men as terrorists. They were clearly terrorists. They constantly drove by and harassed the Muslim people living in the area, and were charged with plots and weapons they planned on using. Every time there are Muslim men or women who plot to attack people for religious reasons, they are deemed terrorists. Instead of finding the Kansas article, I found this one. Again, white men terrorizing a person for religious reasons. The men are made out to be racist, but not terrorist. If a Muslim attacks a person for religious reasons, are they then racists or terrorists? Journalism can affect how the world is perceived. Please label all terrorists as terrorists, or else call them all racists. Do not change the label based on the religion or race. These men may be racists, but the are also terrorists.
Same-sex marriage doesn't "confound" orthodox Catholics whom you refer to disparagingly as trads, quite simply because it is an impossibility, it doesn't exist. Marriage can only be between a man and a woman so those who think otherwise are deluding themselves and deserving of our pity and God's mercy. It is the same with the priesthood, those who think women can be validly ordained are similarly deluding themselves and in like manner, deserving of our pity and God's mercy. All this will become clear on the Last Day.
You mean kinda like " I did not have sex with that woman"  lie?  Like that?  How did THAT impeachment go exactly?  Moving on.
Blame the fat failure in the WH. Supposedly we are in Afghanistan to hep and encourage young women escape the heavy hand of the Taliban that holds women down and insists they NOT go to school. Supposedly we are there to help and encourage. Then the fat orange terd does this? WTH are we doing as a nation? No wonder the whole world is laughing at us and shaking their heads in amazement at how stupid and ignorant we are as a country. Trump is taking this nation into the twitter/sh!tter and we are, thanks to the obese orange sexist racist clown, the USA is circlin' the drain. And all his trumpanzee supporters are simply too ignorant and hell-bent on some sort of revenge against the black president to see clearly...color-blinded by our national pastime -- racism!
Exactly!  You can't expect to integrate a LARGE amount of migrants whose culture is to rape women and little boys because they think it's within their right.
Hello GRWA,  Not sure why you think your post rebuts what I wrote.  Look, here are two scenarios that, to use your lens, happen in the north:  1. At a clinic, a smart female clinician teaches a smart female trainee in head cover who treat a white man who foolishly and drunkenly tore off his fingers.  2. At a clinic, a smart, white male clinician teaches a smart, white male trainee who treat a native man who foolishly and drunkenly got frostbite staggering outside after heavy drinking.  Look, you can bristle at my post all you like, but this is not about what is "pretty typical" up north, instead this is about what Canada's entertainment industry props forward as its CHOSEN samples of said events.  I suspect my reference to Liitle Mosque went over your head. Watch the first episode: Smart Muslim folks with insight face a bunch of stupid, ignorant white men in Canada. Ha, ha, ha, hardly tiresome political correctness at all (roll eyes).  Political correctness poisons entertainment.
Fortunately you are not a Christian.  Otherwise you would need to care about your fellow man (or woman).
What a knee slapper!!  Trudeau is somehow just like a woman !!Haw haw-so funny.!!A woman! What could be more debased!!  That Bob Fife tweeted out this piece of dreck changed my opinion of Fife but not of Trudeau. Trudeau has shown admirable restraint in dealing with those who  mouth self righteous platitudes while acting like the most ignorant of trolls.
Funny how skewed these polls are. I pers hav NVR been polled & can guar just like w/ US fed elect, all results skewed &/or biased. Trump has a lot of supporters in Cda, incl women like myself. His stupid "off the cuff" remark about grabbing women by the p***y was a JOKE! GET OVER IT! I've heard far worse come out of men's mouths. If gen pop can't see it as jk, just proves what a lot of us ANTI SJW/feminazi's say. They're precious little snowflakes who can't tk a jk! Also applies 2 members of my own fam, all thx to MSM propagating him as sick misogynist, while promoting Killary who's husb impeached 4 having sexual relations w/ intern! Not 2 mention flew multiX, even ditching SS, on CONVICTED PEDOPHILE Jeffrey Epstein's Lolita Express. - Fr Wash Times: http://bit.ly/1Wxqzv6 Wmn came fwd & gave testimony Killary threatened them if they came fwd about rape by him. Fr Daily Wire http://bit.ly/2cQDYNI Just do a quick google search, doesn't tk much 2 #FactCheck
Just like Jesus would do right man of god?  Bomb them back to the stoneage, what are you a thirteen year old boy?  I love the warhawk crowd that are well beyond the age to serve in the military. They seem to be very flippant with the lives of our young men and women.
Canada has a witch hunt of straight males, Azerbaijan has a witch hunt of lesbian women.  - The irony is not lost.
If Said I was seeing aliens I'd be labeled crazy, yet if your born with a set of balls and you think your a girl you need to be commited to api ! Your sick!
T.S., well said, but you're being too kind when you never once mention the word 'Catholic.' The church in 2016 was supposed to pay 25 million to help survivors but it got off on a technicality. The gang is still at it: some bishops ask Catholic girls not to get the HPV vaccine; many still anti-gay; women can never be priests--and it all gets pretty toxic this stuff in poorer countries. The worldwide sexual assaulting priest scandals...sigh.
Simple;  Canadians want and need politically correct content .  They particularly need and want content that show white men as backwards selfish stupid louts and women ,  coloured people and muslims as surperior human beings..  if you keep the focus on this approach as you have been doing people will continue to love canadian content
That is wonderful..!  You probably are a really good man, and your children sound well raised.  My wife as well is not a feminist, thank goodness, so we have lived a conflict free life, raised two adult children who are successful, and are so appreciative and happy in our GENDER roles and life together.  Gender roles today equal a crime to these rabid, family destroying feminists.
A female CEO? Zany!
The past tense of 'beget' is 'begot,' Comrade. If the Obama presidency was such a failure, why did Clinton, a candidate with much baggage and a woman to boot, garner almost 3 million more votes than Trump ? Maybe the begetting of Trump had much more to do with Putin's role in the U.S. election than did the imagined failures of the Obama administration. Maybe certain kinds of Americans are more loyal to their backward ideas than they are to the nation they inhabit and its democratic institutions. Maybe these pro-Putin dupes are the dregs of American society, their patriotism all show and no substance.
Lovely stuff! Please don't think though that Bell Pottinger will not live on. They will. As will Victoria Geogehen with her dark hole where her soul should be.  Andile, the Gupta dog, is threatening to take Rupert farm/s. The campaign about white people being trash and just stealing everything from black people (only black people as they deny that the Coloured and Indian people have any rights) is being stepped up on social media. So anyone who thinks they can rest safely now is sorely mistaken.  The Gupta's, the thief called Zuma and the robot that is Geogehen, are still at work, they won't stop until they die or are put away somewhere dark and mouldy forever.  Why? Because the money. Always follow the money trail. Methinks South Africa is small fry compared to what this bunch of terrorists did to other sovereign countries. We cannot stop now. We have to get that woman to reveal all, and from there, to The Hague.
They used to say that about gay people too. ("stop that nonsense") I've always thought conservatives starting coming out against transgender rights only because they were mad they lost the gay marriage battle. Funny how they whinge on about keeping women and children "safe," but when a football player rapes a woman or fellow student, suddenly it's "her fault!" (eg Stubenville). I don't know if this will keep women safe or not; but I do know it's the right who's more likely to debase women who have been assaulted ("Her fault!" "She lied"!). The stench of hypocrisy is overwhelming.
People here don't 'readily remember womens suffrage' because it's 2017 and we are in the United States. I'm not quite sure how marching around Denver, Colorado with your boobs out today is going to change the world we live in.
No matter how you slice it, Islam n Moslems are not compatible with western values. You wanna call me racist, Islamophobic and .... But that's the truth. As for head/ face/ body cover by moslem women, it is 1) a dark age practice ,2) imposed by moslem men due to the fact the women are possessions.
Watch your resources men.  As women get older, their single focus in life is how to acquire your resources.  Be warned.
What's ridiculous is women claiming to have any understanding whatsoever of what masculinity is or means to a man. Shall we call it womansplaining?  That's what's ridiculous.
"I've made my case" You haven't provided a single piece of factual evidence. Yet, you find it ironic that people label the President as "mentally ill"  without any facts, as well?  Hypocritical much?  Let's use your logic then shall we?  You don't THINK that a guy who's main selling point was a wall was going to be built and paid for by Mexico is mentally ill?  You don't think that someone who finds no ill will in sexually assaulting women is mentally ill?  You don't think that someone that sends out numerous tweets about Obama's golfing, and then exceeds the number of days Obama golfed in the first 8 months of his Presidency could be mentally ill?  You don't think that someone who has joked about having sex with their own daughter could be mentally ill?  You see I've proven my point with opinion so it obviously true!  There you have it folks, Trump is officially mentally ill according to fedup's logic.  So tell me, who's paying for that wall again?
This protest was as clear as Clinton's campaign.....  what was it about again? Oh ya, we are women hear us complain.   Perhaps that's one of the reasons Clinton lost, no clear message, just, I am a woman and that should be enough.   Lets go boys, put on your penis hats and penis signs and lets tell the world we are men.
I'm a male small business owner who saved funds in the corporation so that I could take time off after our kids were born to stay at home, help my wife and help look after the newborn. That was my "paternity leave". Now Trudeau is saying that I was a "tax cheat"...and he is going to close that loophole and make it only available to females?  What if I need that time to look after an elderly parent or to deal with a family illness? Lots of enlightened organizations make "family leave" available to all employees regardless of gender....they do it because because it is now 2017!     Now I'm even more enraged at these Liberal idiots! The hypocrisy is absolutely sickening.
Women's rights? Just a bunch of cry babies.
Remind me to never do business with the Binkley's.  Poor business decisions made with emotions rather than logic.  Just like a woman. You'd think a woman was running the paper.  Oh wait......
Wouldn't qualify for the women's olympics events.  Nuff said since this is the stupidest thing I read in a month.
Mr. Putin, a man who says what he means....and means what he says! How refreshing! No bag lady in the Oval office ranting and raving with her pant suit cabal of pointy hats and parked broomsticks! Thank you for bringing stability to Syria and preventing our Marxist-feminist, Islam loving, shiny pony and poor selfie excuse of a leader, from flooding us out with a few hundred thousand more future terrorists!
Again globe, why not a comment section on these cowardly  refugees. They should stay and fight for thier own freedom , we should not be sending our men and women to die for these cowards. They come here and destroy what we have  built for our country, not them. You love them pothead and you to globe,  pick up a rifle and go fight them yourselves. Oh, my had you to are gutless cowards.
"Same beliefs?" I'll take you seriously the day Christians make their own sharia police force, suicide bomb markets of children, throw homosexuals off the tops on buildings, and sentence women to die for wanting to learn to drive and read. Where do you get your info on religion in society, 'The View'?
Men seek to dominate the priesthood because they are jealous of female fertility
Exactly dixylicious!  It's called ACTING.  Originally, woman were not allowed in theaters and men dressed up as woman and played their parts too.  That's why they have ACTING awards, because it is not easy to act as someone you aren't.  People on these streams are so hung up on race.  Just silly. Ya, got to ask yourself who the REAL racists are?
Eh... sort of. There is a Harvard Business School case study on this used in law classes you take in business school.   McDonalds policy was to keep coffee at temp X but many stores, including store in question kept coffee at X+40 (or something like that). WAY too hot for human consumption, intake, etc. The reason the lawsuit stuck was because of this issue and the fact that this happened way more than once. I think I remember reading the cotton in her sweatpants actually melted into her skin it was so hot.   Additionally, the woman (actually her kids because I believe she was an older lady) tried for years to just get them to cover medical costs and McD's refused. It wasn't until much later that someone with a little more clout picked up her case and made a big deal about it. In the end she still didn't ask for, or get much, if I recall correctly.   While it seems like a "yeah, duh, stupid!" scenario or a money grab, it was actually far from.
That's such a ludicrous retort even Cassandra from Ottawa threw up in her mouth a little bit.  Canada is caught up in the spinning vortex of liberal ethics with this level of corruption and cover-ups.  I suspect Butts just booked Justin on a flight to Moldova, to champion the rights of the 2 spirited aboriginal transgendered women.
aa poor hating lefty loser, trump controls his message and your precious cnn is left out, keep crying bud!!! btw you hypocrites are pathetic ,that woman was vile, insulting and all around disgusting with her words on trump but thats ok for you lunatics on the left, since trump cant respond accordingly, but she gets the pass
He also evaluates infant girls on their potential breast size.
how many abortions has the p-grabber-in-chief paid for given his contempt for women and his lack of any self-control
Who am I gonna believe?  You or my lying eyes?   Do people who think this comment is racist not see that at a miniumum, Ozell is terribly guilty of leading the four black girls down a very very nasty path, too.  Unless they were chosen to hold the victim down because they were already familiar with that path.
Yep it’s because they’re Muslim women. People are finally waking up to the fact that Islam and Western values are largely incompatible.
......ah yes, that damn PC strikes again. geez, can't these women just understand that a friendly "pat on the rear" means no harm; a comment about their breasts is just a compliment; an invitation to engage in sexual relations is just a joke; a little unsolicited "neck rub" for the secretary is just harmless endearment; and that telling ribald jokes and stories is just socially accepting them as "equals"......gosh what's the matter with these "broads" today.... Gary Crum
what a silly woman, incapable of seeing it was HER and the DMC that lost the election.
You keep defending this by accusing CNN etc. of publishing "lies" and "fake news".  And yet, you seem to accept Brietbart as accurate reporting even though they have published such warped and factually baseless stories such as: "There's no Hiring Bias against Women in Tech; They Just Suck at Interviews" and "Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy" and "Racist, Pro Nazi Roots of Planned Parenthood Revealed"  If you actually believe the trash you write, you need help.
That was eight years ago, when we were a kinder country.  Donald Trump stirred up the rabble by going birther. Eight years of birtherism, questioning of his intelligence and credentials, and racial insults have inspired many of the obscene t-shirt brigade.   I'd like to change the subject.  During the primaries you and I had a discussion about Hillary Clinton's obligation to the women who accused her husband.  In fact, you thought it would have been a good idea if she had invited them to the White House for tea.  I'm curious, do you have the same expectations of Melania Trump? Is she responsible for her husband's infidelities and lewdness?  Should she have a sit-down with her husbands victims?  White House or Mar-a-Lago?
My word, so "sleeping with a white woman" (by marrying one) would automatically discredit a black politician? Gee whiz, how about Tokyo Sequale and many others?
Keep killing the big females!
Rule and Raven wants all miscarried women to be investigated for murder.
If you allow even one player to kneel in promotion of his cause du jour, then where can you stop?  How do you tell the next player he can't stand on his head to protest anti-Semitism?  The next player wants to lie face down to protest bias against women, and pretty soon you have players blowing bubbles to protest exploitation of strippers and hookers, and one riding around on a tricycle in a clown suit in support of underpaid telegram singers.  It used to be criminals who openly demonstrated lack of respect for law and country.  Now it is obscenely-paid athletes and entertainers, and leftist politicians.
He has the proper genetics to be "a pleasant sexual diversion for hard-working" women.
No, Tories do not view a woman's place as in the kitchen.  They simply have not found McKenna's positions to be very persuasive.  Also, it is somewhat hypocritical of you to be calling someone a 'country bumpkin' -- that is a slur aimed at Westerners and anyone residing in a small town.  It is just as bad as a sexist remark!
Emmonak, 816 people. But so much violence. The village keeps popping up in the news. Late night. Alcohol? Drugs? Over a woman? Stabbing a man 7 times, beating another man and slashing a women in the face. Is that the subsistence lifestyle we here about? And hopefully he will live a subsistence lifestyle in jail for a long time at State expense. The POS will never make the victims whole will he? Is this a good case for an eye for an eye? 7 stabs. Face slashing so he is easily identified as a stabber, bully and women beater. Let us give the guy who hit him with a log a medal. He deserves it, maybe, unless he was the one that gave them drugs/alcohol or whatever. Violent rage. Never good. Emmonak probably has many/mostly good people I am sure but you need to police your own and fix what ever is broken. Take anything and everything this POS has or will ever have and give it to the victims. Actually, I am tired of taking care of your village trash. Start your own subsistence jail. raise tax
There you go again proving that you know the best way to screw up a prosecutors case ensuring you cannot possibly get 'justice' from the 'justice system'.  Just stop already we get it you are an angry woman and willing to engage in criminal acts to try and get even with the person you think did you wrong.... totally screwing any case against that person and putting yourself at risk of going to jail for utter stupidity.   CONGRATS we get it.
A society that embraces abortion rights makes their women cheap, accessible, and exchangeable to wicked men.
The classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug was alw”ays bogus with no scientific justification.  Marijuana criminalization was a racist act. Harry Anslinger, Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics stated:  “There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.” “Reefer makes darkies think they’re as good as white men.
Hate crimes in Canada are virtually non-existent. Check Stats Can - for 2013, the average number of hate crimes was 3.3 per 100,000 people in major metropolitan ares. This means that the odds of anyone having a hate crime committed against them are extremely rare. We don't need a government motion (with attached government spending - wasteful!) to condemn Islamophobia (a vague and politically malleable term.)  We deserve the right to criticize Islam. Islam is not only a religion, its a political movement. And all Canadians should strive against the political arm of Islam. We don't want another Rotherham here in Canada due to hate speech laws.  When Imams constantly preach death for those who leave Islam, and the pratice of Taqqiya (lying to non-Muslims) is encourage, and women get stoned to death for getting raped, and gay people get executed just for being gay, then Islamophobia makes sense.  NO on M103. No on C16. Vote out Trudeau in 2019!
Completely agree--women complain that men are "superficial" but women today are just as bad--I can't tell you how many women couldn't wait to meet when I first talked to them on the phone but after they laid eyes on me in person-the look on their faces/body language made it clear they wanted to get this date overwith ASAP (one woman even pulled out her money to pay for the coffee that was served so she could leave in a hurry)--there was a study done in 2013 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (author Andrea Meltzer) that showed that the attractiveness of a man had absolutely NO effect on the success of a relationship/marriage---which means any woman who judges a man on his appearance is a LOSER
Hillary and the woman at facebook ARE THE PROBLEM!  Those two morons cant tell me how i am or what i need.  What we need is less man hating feminists and professors harping about their out of touch insane reality to our kids and inciting hate and violence.  STOP MANUFACTURING GARBAGE AND STOP RUINING OUR HOME!
Ah yes, those rascally women, holding Maya down.
My understanding is that the Burmese lived with the Rohingya Muslim presence for a century and a half, during which the Rohingya increased greatly in number through procreation. Troubles began when the Rohingya gained a significant local majority and started persecuting non-Muslims in their vicinity. Beheadings of Buddhist monks and, finally, the brutal rape and killing of a woman by the Muslims touched off the current violence. So it's questionable whether the Rohingyas are the victims here.
This stuff seems pretty crazy but I do remember some of this craziness when I was taking my engineering degree. Of course us engineers in training, whether we were white, brown, blue, male or female, were too busy working to be whining.  And given all the interviews we do of graduating engineers for our firm, it feels like these whiners do represent a loud but very much small minority because the candidates sure want to make sure we know they are not from the perpetual victimhood crew and just want to  be known as smart and hard working and won't start crying just because they make a mistake on a project and are held accountable.
Nobody has a right to tell you what you can or can not wear. It is like freedom of speech.  :  At first you might think it is the right who is Islamophobic, but now you can see it is the LEFT who are the real  extremists. They don't know what they are for or against, only money for women.  :  Feminism is only about Capitalism. They want women to give up their culture, their family to become money earning machines. Women in the west have no idea they are being manipulated and sold out.  :  The burka has many significances. The most basic being a way to protect from dust and sun in the desert. If these women's mother's and grandmother's wore them who is to say they can not?  It is also about the sanctity of women, of the mother, of the wife. Simply value that are lost in the west.  :  It is xenophobic, bigoted, ethnocentric, Islamophobic, prejudice anyone who tells them not to wear what they want. Everything women feminists are against. Oh the hypocrisy!
Right off the bat Dunleavy hops on the 'us vs. them" bashing bandwagon that people in Alaska and our nation are so tired of. No indication of working together for the betterment of all. More of the same tired divisiveness and blame game.   You, sir, have presented no vision, nor have you accomplished a single thing in your 5 years in the legislature.  And to say your "vision does not put the demands of special interest groups first" is an outright lie.  You are a hypocrite.  Your behaviors and comments over the years show that you are a hard right, religious, obstructionist ideoloque who refuses to listen to anyone who doesn't hold your beliefs - one of which, as my spouse points out, is to negate women's rights.    You are delusional if you think you have what it takes to lead Alaska out of its current fiscal crisis (caused by decades of your fellow Republicants), let alone towards a bright, forward thinking future not beholden to Big OIl.
An offender committed a heinous act against a women.  This was many years ago.  The offender "became rehabilitated" and had "turned into a nice guy."  He said and did all the right things and became eligible for parole.  The judge agreed that he had turned his life around.  He was going to grant him parole until he met with the victim.  The judge told the offender he would grant him parole when his victim recovered.  To grant him parole while the victim still suffered is not justice.  So,  Ingrid, your post is nothing but fluffy baloney.
The sentiments expressed by Margaret are typical of her gender. It's just evolutionary biology in action. The Globe and Mail will always call anyone with legitimate concerns of Islam "racist, bigot, Islamaphobe, xenophobe, etc etc etc". The real racists, sexists and homophobes are Muslims themselves and they'll openly admit that. It's in their holy book (the true word of god) after all.   Muslims should not be able to pray in schools. End of story. Accommodating a religion that hates western values is ridiculous. Everything about Islam is anti-West. Women have no rights, gays are killed, leaving the religion is punishable by death. At some point you have to say no, we will not accommodate this religion. Islam should be banned from Canada all together. Islam = terrorism. That's a fact anywhere in the world that Islam goes.
There are lies, damned lies, and statistics. There is no gender pay gap. Women get paid the same as men when doing the same jobs with the same seniority. However, if you examine what women and men take in university - where women outnumber men - you'll find that, overwhelmingly, female students choose the soft sciences and liberal arts. Where are they outnumbered? Engineering, computer sciences, and other 'non people skill' programs. And these programs just happen to be much higher paying, on average than say sociology or psychology. or English Literature. Too bad, so sad. Likewise, women in professions don't, on average, put in the same time as men. They care more about their families (for which, kudos to them) than climbing the greasy corporate ladder. Their reward is a better life, and fewer promotions. I'd take that bargain myself, to be honest.
If you go to that couple's FB page the young woman presents a VERY different picture and explains in detail what they have done and what they are doing. I think they thought the $$ they would get from the show would help them out a bit and didn't expect to be blindsided my Marty and Discovery.  Anything with Discovery's name on it now is dubious at best. And Marty is a buffoon who makes Alaskans look ridiculous.
Notey is obviously more concerned with garnering the votes of Muslim men than she is with the liberation of oppressed Muslim women.  Cynical.
PeaceHealth is definitely employing incompetent Emergency Room Physicians at RiverBend.   The woman that treated me a couple of months ago could not have been more incompetent.   Fortunately for me, it turned out that my condition was not serious ( despite the severe symptoms ), and had an extremely simple fix.     But they left me to suffer for 5 hours, struggling to breathe, before she finally called my doctor's office, spoke to the doctor on call, who then explained to her what the problem was. and that it had a super easy fix.  I would not count on their doctors being able to properly diagnose anything.
"Women are not all of the same affinity any more than all men."    I never said "all" women had the exactly same interests. Is that really what you thought I meant? Really? To say there's a natural affinity among women is self-evident. If it were otherwise, there'd be no basis for Women's Studies, or "Women's Rights." Women, in general, have similar interests. As do men, in general. Your resort to arguing about a hetero man going to a gay rights parade and proclaiming his affinity to the men there is pathetic, precisely because gay men have so little affinity with men in general, the vast majority of whom are hetero. Your hypo intentionally overlooks that I was talking about men and women in general.  As to you other pathetic hypo, the Church requiring private sex acts to be ordained.  Somewhere, there IS such a church. Does it oppress you?  Your DOJ hypo doesn't work, either. I have a civil right, protected by law, not to be discriminated against for such a job.  Like priesthood?  No.
Stop whining, girly-man.  Told you we're done.  I "win", if that's what you call it, because your arguments were emotion-driven babbling and tantrums devoid of facts which exposed your own fear and hatred for all rational people to see.  And you weren't paying attention.  I just conceded that I'd LOST the debate, remember?  Now go seek negative attention from someone who will take you seriously.  Khalas.
Have you heard the nasty hate the Bernie supporters throw around. Who in their right mind think dressing up as the KKK is a message of peace. Who the hell runs around call people racist and Nazi thinks that is a message of love. The left is the side of hate. Trump speaks of hope and strength.  How is a student club that supports the Republican front runner close to a active hate group? Trump is only candidate that treats women as individuals and not place the label of victim hood on them. Trump "famous" woman must be punished for abortions was a response to what if abortion were already illegal. If you break the law you should be punished ,(side note on the nonsense that pro life don't want to punish women for abortions is crap, A Tennessean woman is on trial for attempted manslaughter for a failed illegal abortion(bathroom abortion not at a clinic)). Same stance with illegal migrants Sorry you broke the law so you have to be deported.
Good morning, ducati, Moto guzzi, triumph and Norton. No hogs, not cheap and not female. Have a good day shark.
I wonder when the prime minister was a bouncer if he didn't say something stupid about women but wasn't caught on tape.
I recently saw a reporter randomly interviewing people at some political event. The female said "it's time we have a woman in the white house". I was amazed, but not surprised. Imagine voting based on anatomy - not accomplishments, not integrity, not honesty - just whether you have a penis or vagina.   This country is doomed.
So, it is not enough to refuse women ordain as a priest when you know women has more spiritual power because women hold more pureness in them. So historically, Catholic clergies used witch hunt to shut women’s mouth, I see! Fr. Reese, are you trying to shut women’s mouth by starting the old witch hunt trick? However, it is 21st century and women hold power throughout every fields in society now it won’t be successful to silence women like 15th century! Now you Catholic clergies lost trust and respect from just about all fields& level of people already! So stop your empty attempt of shutting women down with your not so holy attempt!!!   ROTFLOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fr. Reese, There are no other ways to have spiritual power except pursuing personal holiness, I am sorry to say! Try to stop raping children to start with!!!  :-) :-) :-)
It would be interesting to know how many of the useful idiots donning “pussy hats” at Saturday's massive “Women's March on Washington” had any idea—or even cared to know—who the principal organizers of the event were. The answer is undoubtedly close to zero. Linda Sarsour was one of the principal organizers, Sarsour was a featured speaker at the annual convention of the Islamic Society of North America, a Muslim Brotherhood front group that promotes Sharia Law and Islamic supremacism. The Brotherhood, it should be noted, is the parent group of both Hamas and Al-Qaeda. You bet it's far from over.
Another racist Democratic pig calling everyone else racist. This woman epitomizes the Democratic party.
hey X!  Top of this beautiful morning!  It's non of your business but:  No haven't had to medicate, my pain is bearable right now thanks! Am I moronic?  Well no X, I'm a graduate of the UofO and am fairly intelligent and a very perspicacious woman.......and my sugar pie: it takes more than just turning on the puter to get here.  You on the other hand must of really tied one on last night after I had to hang up on you for you to be so nasty.........oh no wait!  Your Xavier and you're always crunchy.     Lastly X, please don't call my house anymore asking me out to dinner.  If I have told you time and time again, I don't date nasty bloated alcoholics.    Have a wonderful day and smile bright for all of those you meet today will you?  L2G
no the organizer and these women are nothing but a bunch of hags with clipped hair and mustaches, liberals with serious mental disorders.
Agreed.  I think the real question here is not hatred, which really only exists in very, very few people, but the length to which we should go when accommodating groups and individuals.  Surely any religious practice that marginalizes any sex should not be encouraged, or even tolerated.  For me, it isn't, say, the wearing of a hijab that is the problem, I think they look stylish actually, but the reasons why: to protect her from being molested by men, limit extra marital affairs, so they be known as Muslim women and be considered off-limits to Muslim men. (Islam.org, BTW).   This attitude absolves men from responsibility in their actions, and  makes non-Muslim women targets for unacceptable behaviour.  Why every women who believes in equal rights isn't fighting against this is beyond me.   Worrying about this, among other things, and how it effects the rest of Canadians is not hate.  It is a valid concern.  We have to stop calling it hate, bigotry, or xenophobia.
Too bad...put that tenacity to work changing your Islamic philosphy of killing all the infidels...stop your Countrymen from chopping off victims' heads and stoning to death the women. Get into the 21st Century, then maybe you and yours would be welcome to visit America...not until!
His first move will be to sign an executive order making it lawful for POTUS to grab women by the genitals.  After tweeting out the nuclear missile codes, that is.
Right. A Church that says "women are inferior to men" is something for women to hold on to.
Anal between males is found a lot in evolution as a form of domination.  That it has involved into a loving consensual act is evolutionary progress.  Anti-homosexuality is a backlash against the second class sexuality of sex with women in the ancient world, but now I am repeating myself.  If you want to really go down the up with women road, support female ordination, a married priesthood and the ending of the practice of Continence, which shows just what the clergy really think about procreative sex.
Jan, in all honesty I could always appreciated a women who could suck start a Harley...irregardless of her politics or cooking ability.
Upper middle class white woman talking about "us" and "action".   Are you picking up a gun sweetheart?  Of course not. Upper middle class white women will do what they've done for a hundred years. Hand out white feathers to MEN. Men who are to shed their BLOOD to go fight in another middle eastern craphole (and defend our freedoms or something), because Lizzie's feewings were hurt after reading twitter comments from a "seven year old girl".
Amazing she uses this terrible pattern of criminal abuse of women as a opportunity to complain her marginal TV show never won an Emmy because "sexism."  Shows the complete detachment of the celebrity elite from the reality of the suffering they enable.
What a great idea! I think they do the same for women who've had hysterectomies, people who have mental health issues, people who've come into contact with the police, voted for the wrong political party, etc.
Mike Pence Lawyers Up  http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/pence-denies-he-knew-about-flynn-though-that-was-his-job.html  How was he to know that the candidate who invited Russia to hack the election and bragged about groping women would get into so much trouble.  He's playing dumb, but it was his job as head of the transition team to vet Flynn.  He can play dumb, but no one is buying what he's selling, so he lawyered up.  Tipped his hand when he did that.
What a complete idiot this reporter is.  It's obvious that you support Clinton even though her and bill Murdered the people at Waco Texas and the Pregnant lady at Ruby Ridge.  You are in denial if you think Trump lost that.  He sweep the floor with Hillary and her lies and deceit to the FBI and the American Public.  Your just too blinded by the lies and deceit of  the Clintons.   Wake up, the country will go down the tubes with Hillary at the Helm.
I would say I'm using "nobody" and "everybody" colloquially and pretty much literally. Yes, I am being righteous. I spent 10 years watching DanceHer. I had friends giggle while they talked about he "wouldn't take no for an answer" or how "if he decided he wanted to fuck you, that was pretty much it. He'd fuck you." I had other male friends discuss how he was the "perfect gateway or finishing school" for young women to enter into the Seattle hippie community.  That's only perfect if your ideal woman has been sexually traumatized and has difficulty asserting her boundaries. I had a trusted male friend tell me if I chose to engage with DanceHer, none of my boundaries would be respected. Condoms would not be used. My preference for sober sex would not be permitted to happen.  I had young men come up to me and tell me how "amazing" DanceHer was. I would respond with, "Hmmmm...yeah, he's a sexual predator." They'd look at me in shock and wonder why I was being so mean-spirited.
Old Soul states: "Trump spewed hate filled rants on women, Mexican’s, and Muslims."  Huh....Please specifically state the number of, and the verbatim quotes made by Trump on "women, Mexicans, and Muslims."  Can you Do it?
Problem with feminism it's proven to be like Hillary Clinton and the legions of women corporate lawyers - dishonest, hypocritical, half-hearted, selective, greedy, and corrupt. Conceived as a leftist counter to the rich white patrimony, it's now a force for the conservative status quo and increasing income disparity.
This man says nothing about holding predator priests accountable.  I hope SNAP continues to advocate for victims of sexual abuse in Alaska.  Silence from "church leaders" is why Alaska remains a predator friendly state.  And the leader in the nation for violence against women and children.
Nonsense, she didn't earn a place in cabinet.  She was appointed due to her gender.  If she was truly a feminist, she would have spurned such a patronising appointment.
Feminism is a hate group. Their mission is to tear down men and destroy masculinity. Feminists are hateful, sexist people. They go out of their way to prove it to the world at every conceivable opportunity.
Strong black women are needed, Stupid loud mouthed ones not so much.
He is a traitor pure and simple. His only allegiance is to himself and his crime family and the Russians pulling his strings. From the mouths of his idiot children comes the intelligence that the Russians were pouring money into Trumps enterprises. Paying triple for what a bullcrap mansion is worth to a President is a clear indication of his corruption.   Calling all congressmen and women to put this turkey in the corner for a 4 year timeout.
Funny, we can comment on this article but not the one on the guy who raped 10 women.
Feminism is state sponsored bullying. That's about it.
Your comment lacks truth.  No one should be groping women as Bill Clinton continues to do.  No one is allowed to attack another regardless of color, race, gender or creed.  Only the government and the Media is allowed to lie.  You may be upset that 'your' candidate did not get elected but your reaction is way over the top and foolish.  Please actually research that of which you speak first.
Quite a pathetic deflection, I guess I should go back to when the Irish came to North America and the women actually pulled the plow because they couldnt afford a horse or ox to pull it. I know my level of privilege but like a hysterical leftist I dont feel obligated to point out everyone elses'. Leaving out the fact that the comments she made would get any white anchor or someone speaking about like that about Obama sent to a gulag.
Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a great, courageous Muslim dissident intellectual, unheralded by   doctrinaire ‘progressive’ proponents of sanitizing radical Islamism and averting their eyes from such atrocities as female genital mutilation and 'honour' killings of secularized Muslim women by their hatefully patriarchal families.
Your such an idiot you dont realize how shitty a life ib prison is. Shanking him is ending his sentence earlier and you just want to police the world but I doubt you are some saint but let me take a wild guess. Your a single 50 plus white female. Most likely overweight.
Oregon is last in the Nation for graduating white kids from high school.  The holdover  "white trash" expendable honky from 1550 Great Britain to the Colony is still with us.  400 years of education research,  undeniable now,  says that boys are two years behind girls in emotional development,  brain development,  physical development,  than girls of the same age,  yet we still send them to public school to share a room and teacher.  98% a female teacher.  With female cohorts and administrators,  to try to give girls a boost in STEM and send rambunctious,  can't help themselves,  boys to detention for being much more immature than girls of the same age.  Doing the same thing,  over and over,  expecting a different result,  is institutional insanity,  and does not deserve a dime of public money.  Boys should be in class with boys,  girls with girls.  Education research tells us that both do better in single sex education environment.  Unions kill science,   not a President Elect.
Mariam Williams argues that men crave power over women. But she fails to note that Hillary Clinton craves power over defenseless children in the womb. She supports the "right" of women to abort any child--African-American, Hispanic, Caucasian, Native-American, and so on.
Educated women voted for Hillary. Why would any decent person vote for a sexual predator? You are "devious" if you think you can control other women!
What else explains Sarah Huckabee Sanders as DepPressSec? She has no discernible skills and, given Trump's vicious sexism, it would seem amazing he chose to be represented by a woman who doesn't look like a Fox female news anchor. But she represents an important interest group -- namely the Huckabee crime family and the many hayseeds who think they represent Christ on Earth. Besides, Sanders proved her value to The Leader by humiliating herself with that FBI bullshit. So this hiring is like the advantageous marriages among royal houses in old Europe; it's another way to buy peace. Trump could break into the National Archives, steal the Constitution and wipe his ass with it, and powerful conservatives would just pronounce it "troubling" and go back to dreaming about investigating That Bitch Hillary and doing it right this time.
What we have here is a failure to communicate.  We have two dogs with loud mean barks.  One has a very ugly haircut and sounds delusional and the other is able to grope women whenever he wants and is impulsive.  How do we get rid of both before they make a big mess?
Some guy who knocks the little woman around has no effect on me. But idiots who drive dangerously are potential killers of me or you. I say keeping the streets safe is a higher priority than trying to get dysfunctional couples to play nice.
woman wears a dress.... people start a big discussion about it... same idiotic obsession with useless meaningless things that looks just like useless waste of time on Kardashian bull crap...  also shows that many people have a lot of useless time on their hands if this is so important to them
Gee when it was Wonder Woman a couple of weeks ago, it was the best thing going to empower woman. Now becausE it's the wrong gender for these feminists, it's deplorable. Unbelievable.
As the mother of sons, I can only tell you what they say: women want it both ways. They want parity with men but they want the man to pick up the check, hold the door, be protective. They want advanced university degrees but, on average, get lower scores on SATs, MCATs, GREs, GMATs. Behind every man they see a rapist, misogynist. Having hosted many of these young women in our home, I can say they are often lovely and surprisingly traditional in their approach to life, motherhood, etc. but mention Women's Rights and they become uncharacteristically hostile and, worse, clueless. Look to the poisonous effects of universities and media. They have an agenda and most women don't realize they are being used as pawns.
This has-been washed up politician expected that the presidency be handed to her. I believe she truly thought the country owed it to her after she got her a__ handed to her by Obama. Her arrogance and disdain for working class people was obvious and now she's blaming everybody and everything for her loss. How pathetic. BTW, the thing that irks me the most is her claim of misogyny. I believe this country was/is ready for a woman president, just not her.
"The case has been complicated by the lack of Canadian diplomatic staff in Iran as a result of the former Conservative government’s decision to close down the embassy and sever relations."   Hypocrisy at its finest by the Conservatives who demand diplomatic action but did their best to destroy all diplomatic relations with Iran.  While this is a truly unfortunate case, there's likely little the government can do anyway since women have fewer custody rights than men in most middle east countries.
No one believes the "one-in-four" statistic.   I'd say at least 1 in 4 women or MORE---are bat-sh*t-crazy,  obsessed with feminism and hatred of males, however.
Oz  Islamists kill more Muslims, homosexuals, repress and genitally mutilate  more women than do all other peoples put together. Islamists terrorize and for the purpose of media & internet coverage behead, burn and torture other Muslims who are considered to 'liberal', Jews and 'Westerners'. Is it 'phobic' to be afraid of these people? Is it irrational fear 'radical' mullahs in Canada, the USA, the UK and continental Europe who preach and encourage this form of hate? How many Jews in Canada or Israel  behead and burn, are homophobic, etc?  German so-called 'Christians' killed 6 million Jews in WWII - or are you a Holocaust denier? Where's the parallel? Or are you also an "anti-Zionist" (code for anti-Jew). I say anti-Jew rather than anti-Semitic because Arabs are Semites. Or are you a naive pup like Trudeau or worse, a willing fellow-traveller like one of the other more active SJW apologists who posts regularly on this forum?
Would you rather see the current First Lady in the same pictures ...??? Do a mental comparison and hear your thoughts.... Damn my vomit bag is full... I'm listening.
Never heard of this woman.  This is so political is smells.   Brings to mind some group choosing a non-descript bird as our Canadian bird. The Americans have the mighty Eagle as their national bird. We choose a non-descript dull looking bird who I have never heard of.  For both of these choices...absolutely political bland Canadian rubbish! And dull. And politically correct. YUCK!  Do Canadians really want to be represented by a dull bland bird and by a non-descript woman who many have never heard of?
There isn't any common sense any more.  TSA is a total waist of tax payer's money.  You put all these agency's  under one name, Home Land Security and it's suppose to work.  What that poor woman should be doing is getting an attorney and suing the hell out of Immigrations.  Major problem, you have agency's within agency's, to damn many chiefs and not enough Indians.  Questioned about her school record......damn, that's a new one.
Yah but he has nice hair which bought him the election from the low information voter and the women who like nice hair.  His stopping off to pray the Shahada at every mosque within 100 miles of where he happened to be passing by sure helped too.  Too bad he's so stupid he doesn't understand that praying the Shahada with two muslim witnesses by Islamic belief makes him a muslim in their eyes.  He doesn't care as long as he gets their vote which he did.  It's a terrible thought that so many Canadians died fighting to save Canada so Justin could destroy it.
Trump is mentally insane , possibly a coke snorter . He and his sewer rats have no place in politics . Trump is a racist pervert who most likely has abused Ivanka and other women. His ass should be in jail and his sewer rat supporters should be air dropped in the middle of ISIS and left to die
I'm assuming you're talking about sending Bill Clinton back to the White House the only person regularly flies to a private island to have sex with children and who has great at least 40 women who have filed complaints... You are right we don't want that man anywhere near our children or our government
Roy! I thought we had a positive relationship and open lines of communication! I feel betrayed by you! I just want to dialogue with my community & you are bullying me with your mansplaining! Of course a straight MALE like you feels like it's OK to tell me, a lesbian woman, to be silent! That right there is cis heteronormative male privilege! Triggered!!!
Well, look he works for. A loser pResident who brags about sexually assaulting women ("grab them by the p***y"), playing childish games when merely shaking hands (toxic masculinity, not actual masculinity), taking to Twitter every time his delicate snowflake-like sensibilities get offended, etc.    It's entirely appropriate that this clown of a pResident surrounds himself with people like that.
Whaaaaaaaat the Duck:  Send ALL ILLEGALS back.  Male, Females, Children, Chihuahuas.    Clear up jail space.  Built the WALL, Keep them OUT.............  If you are here LEGALLY,  Welcome, Obey the Laws, Have a good Life...............
How DARE you reduce all people to only two genders (men/women).  Take your racist homophobic bigotry somewhere else.
My opinion is that every person is equal before the law, and therefore everyone's vote should count for the same amount. Why should anyone's vote be more important than the vote of any other person? Do you see that written into the Constitution, that a voter in Wyoming, wherever she may have been born, has three times the value of a woman in California?  Maybe you thought you were making a joke, but we live in the real world, where disenfranchisement is rampant, and causes serious damage, like the election of a mentally unstable president who lies about everything and uses his office to fill his hotels.
The Holy Father is under no obligation whatsoever to release any documents to anyone.  He answers to God alone.  He cannot change Church doctrine, he lacks that power.  As a result, he cannot do otherwise than to affirm that the Church has not authority to ordain women, that homosexual marriage and behavior is morally disordered and sinful, etc.  Pope Francis is progressive in many ways, sadly, but even he cannot alter doctrine.
You stated: "But as Trump inspired hate-speech, xenophobia, bias crimes, and violence toward women, the bishops remained mum." Trump did not use "hate speech" nor did he "inspire" xenophobia, bias-crimes or violence toward women.   Expressing a legitimate opinion on    the  problems surrounding immigration is not "anti-immigration". What does "anti-immigration" mean? Nothing. The ban regarding certain countries with Muslim majorities are not "anti-Muslim". Again what does that mean? Trump is not anti-Muslim, he could care less about the purely religious beliefs of the people from the 6 countries covered by the ban. His ban is based on a prudential decision reflecting valid national security concerns. He is responsible for the safety of the American people and when some insane Muslim terrorist kills a member of your family who are you going to blame, not some Judge in Hawaii, no you will blame Trump.   So there is nothing for the Bishops to say on these matters.
Ramadan Chokr is a hypocrite when he claims concern for the safety of others, given that his own organization officially endorses spousal abuse.    The imam of the Sammamish Mosque, Wassim Fayed, published a video of one of his lectures (http://www.popmodal.com/video/7382/US-Imam-Allah-is-clear-you-can-hit-your-wife) in which he explained to the men of the mosque that they should hit their wives if they refuse to wear the hijab.  This video demonstrates that wearing hijabs isn’t as voluntary as Muslims (and their American aiders and abettors on the “multicultural” left) would like us to believe.  Muslims need to learn that hitting women is unacceptable, illegal, and immoral.  And when you see Muslim women wearing their symbols of oppression and second-class citizenship at the local mall, don’t criticize or harass them.  It is likely that they’re wearing their hijab involuntarily and under threat of violence.
Well for such a respectful country they sure abuse their women.
Let's not fool ourselves. Canada quietly rewrote the rules governing the export of arms to other countries. No longer do such exports hinge on whether the recipient nation is a human rights abuser. Instead, the Canadian rules now strive to "balance the economic and commercial interests of Canadian business" with this country's "national interest." What does that tell you? It doesn't matter if its 'legal', it is abundantly immoral, the Royal Saudi Air Force are bombing Yemini hospitals, ports, warehouses, factories, schools, markets and homes.  Not only is SA committing atrocities, but these are capitalist wars, and have nothing to do with the working man/woman, it is disgusting SA is an ally.
And yet, Trump women are so used to being denigrated, that they actually enjoy Mr. Trump and think he's wonderful and apparently wouldn't mind a little crotch grabbing themselves.  "After all, what does it hurt?  Silly women being so sensitive, men will be men."  I wish the lot of them would go away somewhere far far far away and live happily ever after.  And then the Trump men are here, like most abusers, blaming the victims.  Gee.  I guess the definition of 'greatness' has changed a lot in the recent years.
What a mean little elf. He's angry that he's an elf.  It would be nice if in America we did not need laws to force us to be civil and tolerant...  Is it evil to prevent a person from making a living because of how they wear their hair or the clothing they choose?   Is it evil to prevent women from access to family planning services?   Is it evil to try to prevent people in love from marrying?   Is it evil to lie, cheat and bully from the Oval Office?   Yes. It is...
Being called "Climate Barbie" is quite generous and civil compared to the gutless comment PM Zoolander mumbled under his breath while in Opposition  referring to Peter Kent as a "Piece of sh!*".  At least the tweet was open and honest rather than a gutless and cowardly mumble.  Oh wait.   Peter Kent is a white male Conservative so its perfectly fine to make these cowardly comments while in the House of Commons back then by our now substandard "feminist" PM and three ring circus government.
Father Gil Gustafson's desire to be a convicted pedophile healer reminds me of Cardinal William Levada's desire to place an indicted pedophile priest Father Gregory Ingels  in charge of the clergy sex abuse policies for the United States. Levada was promoted to Vatican's CDF  shorty thereafter, so Father Gustafson has lots of example to call on as precedent. Coverup for pedophiles, work with them, promote them, and you will rise in Vatican importance. Adult men who sexually torture children and still believe they are healers are dangerous indeed, and the men and women who believe these appointments are about "forgiveness" do not understand the evil nature of sexual dominance of kids and the corrupt religious authority which facilitates it. And all in the name of Holy.  AW
Fully agree, as I replied to someone else just a bit ago. The pill is essential because male condom use is hard to control. Guys don't use such things if they can get away with not doing so, but that penis is not going into their body. The person being entered has absolute authority to make that call. Not the man, not the Church. Indeed, it bespeaks the flaws in the Church that there are no ordained women controlling these teachings, but the irony escapes most of those dolts and when it does not, it is all the more evil.
I am really referring to a biological man going into a women's bathroom for any reason (lathering and sex included), We as a society do not need to be nearly as concerned about women invading women invading men's bathrooms for the purpose of sexual self gratification.
It just goes to show that feminism can't produce a future or tell the truth. Stick to humanism if you want to live in a better world.
So, this community, or at least courts, basically condone kidnapping and raping women on the threat of death.  27 months. He'll sit about half that. It's like a nice vacation.   Port Angeles is a community where extremely violent rapists can feel safe and secure to engage in whatever dark desires they like.   Welcome to Port Angeles, rapists.
That's because no one in the LEGITIMATE media world will hire Ezra! He obviously has no respect for female politicians! Is that how he treats his fellow female STAFF at Rebel ('loser') Media?! His career went into the garbage years ago.
Exactly.  It never has been.  Trump has surrounded himself with Pharisees,  scorpions,  blasphemers,  money changers,  oppressors and other kinds of creeps.  Like Jesus would talk about women like that.  Jesus wasn't hung on the cross between two sexual predators.
Trump made fun of women's appearances. He made fun of women's periods.  His infamous line: "grab 'em by the p****"   And despite all of this:  He won 53% of the white female vote  45% of college educated female voters  42% of women's votes overall  And 9 million more women than men vote in the US election.  Women had the opportunity to break the biggest glass ceiling in the world and vote for a female candidate that was also the globe and fail's preferred candidate as they have constantly reminded us after the election, but chose not to. The biggest whiners, Ms. Renzetti, are reserved for those who participated in the women's march the day after he was elected and could not accept the result of a democratic election.
Trump's supporters are now faced with the reality that they have been conned, duped and defrauded. One woman told the press, "I wouldn't have voted for him if he was an idiot." She assumes that Trump is therefore not an idiot because she voted for him. In other words, rejecting Trump means she has to reject herself and her own judgement.  This is how tyrants rise to power. They promise the needy and the overburdened the world, things they cannot deliver. They fall for the con and turn a blind eye to the transgressions. Then it's too late.
This must be someone who used to go by 3rd gen AK., who also said white men were the Earth's alpha males...LOL...I offer to wit: From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
All terrorist bombers have not been "all male" as his"largeness", Mayor Nenshi has suggested  Many have been women , or men dressed as women. When a very public mantra of these Muslims has been to  "KILL the INFIdels" it is very understandable that  one would not want them in our country. The problem becomes - how to tell the good ones from the bad ones.  So one becomes inclined to err on the side of choosing life over possible death. Some religion!- more like a club for thugs and thieves.
Wow.  Giving the middle finger salute is "obscene"?  If so, then how do you describe the behavior of a man who uses his stature/power to justify grabbing a woman's g3nitals?
Who are you to call me a troll?  First off, your report is 14 years old. Hardly pertinent any more.   Second, your OBSOLETE report is talking AVERAGE prices.   If we were talking about an 18 year old male, you may have a point.  But in fact we are talking about a 50 something female. Compare two identical 55 year old females with good driving records in BC vs AB.  I'll bet that the price will be 50% cheaper in AB.   Now, I am still waiting for an apology, or do you not have the self respect to treat other posters with civility?
Gee ... To echo Richard Roskell's point:  Where is the U.N., U.S., U.K. French, German & Canadian "outrage" over the slaughter of 80 children and 13 women? All of them innocent civilians. I guess it's because they were pro-government. No "red lines", ultimatums or retaliations are forthcoming apparently. The U.N. has devolved into the U.S.'s lapdog and the other countries mentioned are simply puppies in its litter.  Am deeply disturbed that Canada would follow along with such blatant bias and hypocrisy.  Our foreign policy is one aligned with ISIS and other rebel mercenaries on the Saudi payroll.  Quite disgusting to say the least.
I guess it depends on whether you think stupidity is a kind of violence. Women are getting fed up with this kind of stuff on all levels, especially with being told not to be so sensitive. Locker room talk, and all that, boys will be boys, isn't going down so well.
I have always voted Republican in the national elections. This year, I am voting for Hillary Clinton because of Donald Trump. We have never witnessed a candidate more dangerous in his dictator-like characteristics. He has complete disdain for freedom of the press. He has complete disdain for our judicial. He has complete disdain for our electoral process and claims, "RIGGED," except when something is in his favor--then it is right on. He is a laughing stock for our nation in the international realm--except when he talks about his disdain for NATO, which has kept us from multiple wars and protected us from harm time after time.   He has complete disdain for women and sees them as objects for his own pleasure. Anyone who would let him in the room alone with their wife or daughter is a lunatic. He is racist and divisive, and typical of the Know-Nothing crowds of not so long ago.   In short, he is a dictator wanna-be who needs to be stopped before he destroys us.
That tape proves Trump right, "In Hollywood, if you're rich, famous and powerful, you can do to women anything you want."  That is so very true and so very sad and even sadder  that feminists have looked the other way  and still do!  Does anyone know why? They get half a million women out to march against Trump, how about a march on Hollywood now?   They won't because they are, above all  else, hypocrites!
Marching to be able to painfully kill innocent, defenseless humans in the womb is atrocious. Marching because you are a bigot and are fearful of Trump because your party lies and creates boogeymen to get your vote is appalling. Marching against a legally elected person because you erroneously say he is illegitimate is foolish. Marching for women's rights when your party treats the serial rapist and sexual assaulter Bill Clinton like a rock star is hypocritical. Marching for women's rights when your last presidential candidate got a child rapist off (and laughed about it) who had raped 12 year old Kathy Shelton is disgusting.
All children should live in communal villages, 24/365 for as long as they want. The money should come from the banks and government. The communal villages should have the most money in society. All crime, poverty, homelessness, drug addiction etc. will be eliminated. The children will grow without all the jealousy and dysfunctional family crap we have now. They will be truly accepting of other and know how to get along with other. They will succeed in life and give back to the village because of all they have received. They will have real male and female models and equal brother and sisters.  This the only solution moving forward from the nuclear family which is obviously a  95% failure in 2017.
TSA and HS full of stupid uneducated idiots. Can't even detect explosive residues at all. But good at groping female body parts and stealing Rolex watches. Try this. Take the laptop battery off and give the traveler a fire suppressant bag to carry it in their carry-on along with all their camera batteries and cell phones. Ban all aerosols period and re-allow scissors so we can help the stewardesses fight the terrorists ourselves. Oh yeah, those duty free alcohol and the little whiskey bottles the stewardesses serve along with soda pop. Is anybody aware they are flammable and make good improvised Molotov cocktails?
Well feminism has destroyed what it means to be women. Now we have women with no sense of accountability or sense of responsibility to LIMIT themselves as our society shuns upon such actions. What happened anyways? You feminists were running around 3 years blatantly advertising that you don't need men. Have you ever seen a man stupid enough to run around and say that ever? You reap what you sow ladies, now stop being brainwashed and look within yourselves to find out how to be and what makes you happy, you are more women inside and out, then society can ever make you.
No, the problem in this case was the judge's interpretation of mens rea, whether the accused knew that what he was doing was wrong.  Given that the only point y'all have fixated on is "women lie" I do think Victimitis is right about the board being full of bitter divorced men.
Sex is bad, mmmmmkay?  LOL  I don't know what the stink is, anyway.  There are many examples where a woman is wiling to have sex with a man because he has coin.  Sometimes it's even dating and turns into marriage.  How is paying for it in those situations any different?
Are you kidding me?? It's called CIVIL RIGHTS. And guess what? The idea that "marriage is between a man and a woman" is NOT "no big deal - it's bigotry. So at least own your bigoted beliefs. Your ignorance is blowing my mind.
Boots>  It seems to me that you have it reversed, where it is surprising that people would vote for "crooked HRC."  As the latest in the real world, depicts a woman and a colored man sold out their country, for what apparent reason, did they do it for, huh????  The POTUS will be the POTUS, but how can you stand with criminals????  I just don't understand you, Boots, they made all of you look like a bunch of baboozes!!!!  Blind leading the blind, right????
And who are you - an old white guy, I'm absolutely sure - to tell any woman what she should or shouldn't protest? I doubt you actually care about Muslim women but use this as a convenient way to express your anti-feminism.
WTF Schor & Sponberg?  Get real- Levoy Finnicum was a fundy Mormon terrorist who is now considered a martyr by a movement characterized by extreme racism (Aaron Campbell was marked by Cain and can never enter Heaven).   Some nut job can and will try and kill the officer and his or her family.  Remember  that Bundy supporters threatened women, children and clergy at their homes in Harney County.  Both Schor and Sponberg are advocating a position that has a great chance of ending in murder of an Oregon law enforcement officer (or two).   They are accidentally siding with Bundy supporters on this one.  As always, Wheeler is the only sane person in the room. Portland cops shooting civilians will still be identified.  But what is chilling is Schor's and Sponberg's willingness to let some idiot from Arizona show up at a deputies house and kill him.  That is a real problem folks, because the Bundys are actual terrorists. And Schor and Sponbergs are idiots.
Given what her former secret service detail is reporting---she is worse than The Don himself.  At least with The Don what you see is what you get.  Hilary on the other hand---what you see is not what you get--not in the slightest.    I don't think someone who is prone to fits of rage, and someone who does not treat their protection detail with respect is suited to be president.  I also don't think someone who cannot be trusted with classified information and lies about it is suited to be president.  Forget the fact that she is decidedly unlikable and is totally unable to connect with people.    This is understandable however--given the bubble she has lived in for the past 40 years.  Hilary is not entitled to be president just because she is a women and thinks she should be the first women president.  Hilary is not entitled to be president just because she is married to Bill Clinton.
The "mechanics of sex"--lol. You actually have to "teach" your male children "not to physically violate" women and girls? HS, that's really weird. And you say all of your evangelical friends do this too?  This is an interesting. I've never had to teach my son anything like this as sexually violating someone would not even occur to him and marriage or a "lifelong commitment" would in no way change his aversion to physically violating someone he loved. Do you think there might be a problem with some of the ideas evangelicals espouse that predisposes their male children to do violent things to women and girls?
"Everything his nasty flock have hoped for are already morphing into their worst nightmares"  Perhaps your hatred is blinding you to the actual facts! Maybe you should take a 'time out' from kissing Hillary's image and actually pay attention to what is happening NOT SKEWED BY THE LIBERAL PRESS OR CRYING LEFT!   After 8 years of a disgusting failed president, Trump is like a fresh breeze. Hillary would have been a female Obama! We are extremely lucky that the majority (ignoring CA) of Americans realized having a lying career criminal for president just because she had a vagina was NOT what america needed!
You're a mean girl, Monica.
"Clinton lauds women's courage in wake of Weinstein allegations"  What???? This is the same Clinton who accepted Weinstein as a friend? His behaviour was far from a secret? Where was she? Why wasn't she attacking him years ago? Was she too busy cashing his fund raising cheques?  You know what's toxic. Feminists like Clinton who use feminism to push their own agenda but when it hurts them in the wallet they back off.
In this woman's opening line she calls republicans "anti-Muslim, homophobic, misogynistic, racist and rejecters of science." Shannyn,.. The accusations of the accuser are most often a true reflection of their own selves. Your words are hateful and judgmental.  A.D.N you disclaiming that her opinion doesn't reflect yours is a weak attempt at giving her a free-reign pass at saying extreme and hateful thing like the accusations in her opening statement.  Furthermore - if I were a republican business person - I wouldn't spend a dime advertising with A.D.N and supporting hate like this.
Can our twit of a Minister of Police please start to do his job rather than looking at lie detector tests to prove his loyalty to Zuma? Use those same lie detector tests to get to the bottom of what appears to be yet more corrupt and narcissistic attitudes of those who hold the real power in the country. The most vulnerable in our society needs this woman who undoubtedly to has the victims best interests at heart. How did SA become such a shit-hole?
But that men who engage in sex with prostitutes are putting their wives/girlfriends at risk of potentially fatal STDs, and that sex trade often involves under age children.
What do you expect from a woman who boasted before her AIPAC handlers in 2008 that she was willing to murder 70,000,000 Iranians by nuclear immolation?  How's THAT for a 'right-to-life' question?  Funny how I never hear these born-again hypocrites bring that one up...
until they cut the genitals of a little girl and marry her off to some old creep with 3 other wives. full stop.
With many tenets and branches of Islam oppressing rights, womans rights, democratic rights, human rights and gay rights, what EXACTLY are you referring to when you say "far-right" Shaista?   Your Imam or Donald Trump?
Funny, when I make comments about angry, white males I'm supposed to be ashamed of my "sexist" language.  I have a feeling some broflakes really love their double standards. Women belong in the dentist's office because tee hee, but when a woman makes a statement about men and how they behave because testosterone? Interesting.
There's been ugly women through out history - but Clinton is not only ugly through and through down to the bone - she has a vile hideous personality that's like acid to those who have to watch, listen and deal with her.  What is so disgusting - is that she feels so entitled, owed, and expects the world to kowtow, genuflect and kiss her ass because she's Hillary Clinton... while she demonstrates a penchant for a complete lack of respect for human life, the  willingness to break federal laws of the USA and the world, she's a thief and a shyster, an Electon fraudster and will rig and buy votes if not outright black-mail or kill individuals that stand in her way. What she is really owed is a federal prison orange jump suit with a date scheduled to face a Firing Squad.
You are right . Because women aren't strong enough to just say NO we get saddled with all those costs.  IF women would learn to just learn to control they're bodies our whole nation would be better off.  Killing the innocent nearly born should be the very last choice . Instead , women take it as the easy choice of convenience because they weren't strong enough to say NO if they didn't have birth control on hand. And liberal women shine them on and encourage all they're sisters to get abortions. Isn't it odd that they claim to want to control they're bodies , yet do such a terrible job of doing it ? 1400 abortions last year in Alaska are proof positive of what a terrible job they are doing.  Instead of marching against everything Trump suggests , they out to be out buying birth control for all the women who need it. Doing that , would make a difference . They're protest marches accomplish nothing and make them look silly.
Theresa May is Britain's answer to Kim Campbell.  The Old Boys' Network invariably leave some helpless woman holding the bag trying to clean up after their messes.  "Although it is not true that all conservatives are stupid people, it is true that most stupid people are conservative."  - John Stuart Mill  Poor old girl !
In 1968, the evening news was showing, in the southern states, naked black men lynched from trees for being seen with a white woman, some being set on fire, alive. In 1968, the evening news was showing US soldiers in Vietnam, mostly white, with necklaces of 'slope' human ears and fingers, and tobacco bags made of 'Charlie' human scrotums.  In 1968, you would see Huntley and Brinkley on the evening news, curls of cigarette smoke to the side or in the background. In this 2nd decade of the 21st European religious century, there is a tendency to white-wash the past, for emo-cringe reasons. In Hawaii, with the overthrow of the Kingdom in 1893 and the following annexation in 1898, the Hawaiian language was entirely banned from schools and government, and discouraged elsewhere. The Native Hawaiian culture was squashed because it was a "terrorist threat" to the Religious Republic of Hawaii. The ban of the Native Hawaiian language and culture in schools and government wasn't lifted until 1978.
I was there. I can assure you that the Premier was unaware of the actions of the two accused, which issue had its genesis solely at the hands of Laura Miller and her dimwitted LCSB accomplices. Miller's mantra, re Ministers and the Premier, is/was, "Treat them like mushrooms: cover them in shit and keep them in the dark". Another example of this is choosing to not address the groping and propositioning of a female EA by her male MPP boss, as, "We don't want to embarrass the Premier". I hope she goes to jail.
Univ'y. Judicial systems have ruined many young lives, and resulted in huge expense---through their extreme bias, Always Assuming Any female who cries "sexual harassment" and even much lesser complaints....is telling the truth. Those university records have prevented male students from getting licenses, getting into law school, etc. The university's pure stupidity and bias should be a crime.
The number of stories surfacing during Women's Month of men beating, murdering, and raping women, suggests that every day, every month, is Men's Day and Men's Month. Men are not being brutally oppressed by women. When women are no longer treated brutally by men then we won't need a Women's Day or Women's Month.
This is so ridiculous. Take the lousy government out of our bodies, sex lives and bedrooms. Let the religious right clean up their own stoops and get out of birth control. I don't agree   with abortion. I don't think many women do, but religion has a double standard. The legislators are pushing beans instead of fixing tax credits.
Sue is my favorite on the show she is a tough old broad and I hope she gets every dime she has sued for. And for all u jackass haters out there u don't have a clue what this lady has been thru and all you want to do is hate .
Whoa... Talk about superficial and divisive! You know nothing about this woman. She didn't even say that she voted for Trump (only that she hoped he would win) and all she said to her friends was that she was "comfortable" with "how the election turned out". These people have been friends for YEARS, and you're honestly condoning them cutting her out of their lives entirely? And you say Trump is the childish one. I have friends who voted for Hillary, a lying, manipulative woman who left four Americans to be slaughtered. Did I cut them out of my life? Absolutely not. The choices for this election were awful, I think most people agree on that. Both candidates have done and said terrible things. Unless you know someone who actually agrees with the specific horrible things Trump and Hillary have done/said, most of us recognize that everyone was just trying to choose the lesser of the evils.
They want a bunch if Islamist  tyranny states that  execute gays, conduct genocide on  other religions  and stone women ,  to help their claims of maltreatment in Canada.
"do you trust that crazy woman Rachel Maddow? She is simply biased the other way. "  You're right, R_2D2.  The opposite of something stupid (O'Reilly) is something just as stupid (Madow).
You are always so very quick to bash Americans. Yet "racist" Americans elected a black president twice. Also, a woman came within a hair strand of winning and the only reason she lost is because she was her own worst enemy. Canada? Want to tell me all about the minority leaders and women Prime Ministers our "morally superior" country has elected? Im waiting.........
Utter and criminally irresponsible lies.  You put human women and children at  risk to protect bloody feral CATS.  An infected cat shed tens of millions of oocytes with each defecation.  They persist in the environment and remain INFECTIOUS from 1.5 to 4.5 YEARS.  The oocytes currently exists at densities of from three to 434 per SQUARE FOOT.  They contaminate vegetable gardens, row crops, pastures, livestock pens (and tissues), children's play areas, parks, beaches, drinking water and filter-feeding marine organisms in nearshore marine habitat--the latter is what is killing the seals.  And all it takes is ingesting or inhaling ONE to blind, permanently debilitate or kill a child.  All your invasive, disease-ridden "community" vermin are not worth ONE child's eyesight.
I expect a lot of  pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel remarks from progressive Canadians here so we will give you some facts.  The Palestinians in Gaza and on the West Bank are ruled by Hamas who are proxy terrorists  trained, armed, and funded by Iran.  The Islamic states will never allow the Palestinians a homeland as they are are more useful as a proxy terrorists who have vowed to destroy Israel and kill every last Jew.  The Palestinians strap munitions on their own women and children and send them out into public places to kill Jewish women and children.  And for that the Iranian government has Hamas give the family $25,000 EU dollars.
If  the signs at the Women's March last week had been truthful they would have read like this:  *I think killing my own children is great! *59 Million Babies dead is not enough for me. *My future daughter should have the right to kill my grandchildren. *18 Million Dead: #BlackLivesDon'tMatter!
Toronto City council needs to clear out these Neanderthals. Same old same old. Can't work with women.
Preach it, Brother!  The ONLY people who like it are freeloading bums! You should ask someone who couldn't even get insurance before the ACA how they feel about being bum freeloaders who should be scorned.  Shame on you cancer "victims" for being the reason insurance carriers charge more for their premiums.  Damn you women for having more body parts and making insurance more expensive for us men.  Let's publicly parade children with birth defects who should have just made better life style choices and make them pull themselves up with their bootstraps (when they get big enough to wear boots of course).  Why can't that old crippled bum who purposely got dementia just die quietly at a freeloader shelter without costing the rest of us more?  Sick people just plain suck and are a drain on the lives of the rest of us.  We should make them ALL wear some kind of patch on their shirts so the rest of us can easily identify these bastard humans.  We hate you lazy freeloading "victims"!!!
I had met the woman when she first started, and have seen her a couple of times since. SHE HAS CHANGED. I to voted for her in the beginning, will NOT do it again. I didn't think she was going to be be the typical moronic Democrat. It seems I was wrong, she is becoming like the rest.
I was beaten on my way to school, beaten ruthlessly the whole time I was at school (and raped... the teachers, both men and women, beat and raped me.  They passed me around like the little whore I was and just used me, and made fun of me as they beat and raped me), then beaten, punched, kicked and finally, brutally raped AND beaten at the same just as I got home.  Then the real abuse began.  My parents continued to beat and rape me, all while making fun of me as they did so.  This lasted all night, then back to school.  This went on day in and day out all day every day w/out break for 18 years.  And did I complain?  No.  Kids today have no idea how good they have it.
And it's funny that this long ago ceased to be a campaign of issues, but rather a contest of who is hated more---A true Evil of Two Lessers.  Our shackles as a voting public have never been more obvious, or heavy:  If we don't vote for one, the other will win.  Regardless of who we vote for, one of them will be president.    Who will it be?  The current flavor of the Military Industrial Complex and the multi-national banking establishment?  (We tried the first African-American president, now we'll try the first woman president...)  Or the "wrecking ball" (who by the way has all the credibility of a class clown, and would still represent the above interests)?  Whatever happens, the rich will get richer, the poor poorer; public money will still go toward maintaining a world-wide military empire defending the interests of a few, at the expense of our sons and daughters; and our liberties will still be siphoned away by what amounts to a police state.
Partially??? The driver is wholly at fault for leaving the scene and not rendering aid. The woman may have been able to live. Partially??? I can already tell you're an "old white guy" as one of my editors used to say. And don't get preachy at me. I don't need nor do I want or deserve it. And yeah, you'll probably call me racist for taking a stand here.
The man is repugnant.  The woman had 3x the legal limit of alcohol in her system, she was inebriated and was passed out when found by the police.  If she had shot him in that state, she would not be criminally responsible for his death.
just shut it down. Indigenous women ARE NOT more important than missing non indigenous women and they DO NOT need their own inquiry. Want to know why these women are missing? BOOZE, DOMESTIC SEXUAL ABUSE, POVERTY and DRUGS, DRUGS, DRUGS. Done
Skinut, this is not about gays, lesbians, bisexuals, trisexuals, X-sexuals, transgenders and others with weird ideas from serving open in the military.  There is no question about many of them having served with honor and distinction, but they did so serving in positions aligned with their sex at birth and wore uniforms consistent with their biological sex, of which there are only two, male and female.  However, Obama’s lifting of the ban on transgenders went much further than simply allowing them to serve.  The Obama administration recognized that transgenders suffer from a mental disorder called “gender dysphoria” and directed the military services to develop and implement plans to provide transgenders psychiatric and other medical care including sex reassignment surgery.  Under Obama’s policy, transgenders will spend much of their time on active duty being treated for a pre-existing condition.  That is transforming DOD into a social service organization.
"Woman does not possess the image of God in herself ..." St Augustine, bishop of Hippo (354-430) . "So men possess the image of Devil in his devilish act of raping children? " YJIN117, (2017) ROFLOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,  The whole world are LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Have you ever thought that maybe he is sick and tired and fed up with the liberal agenda? Maybe he liked bathrooms that had girls and boys on them instead of it's, confused and not sure. Maybe the confederates were part and parcel of this countries history and right or wrong, acknowledged. Perhaps a man and a woman equaled marriage. Owning a gun or guns used to be simple and we got along just fine not even being checked. The national anthem was sung with pride, nobody sat. Immigration was for people who went through the process, studied and worked for it and passed the test. Health insurance was optional not mandated. The list goes on and on, the pooh gets deeper and deeper. And frankly, people snap when the world as they knew is no more. They worked for that world all their lives only to have it pissed away by, fill in the blank to comply with the civil bs here.
Is anyone surprised that it was the Republican party that foisted their less-than-fit candidate upon the nation? They've been extremists for a long time. Their choice in Trump reveals they'd put anybody in the office as long as he was willing to undertake their extremist agenda. Trump is the epitome of today's racist Republicans. His agenda is the summation of what Republicans stood for for decades. First and foremost, they are women-haters and racists. Now they've exposed themselves as neo-Nazis to boot.
Notice how the article only compares blacks to whites and leaves out other major racial/ethnic groups like Hispanics and Asians?   https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/racial-gender-wage-gap-persists-asian-american-men-top-average-n602076 "White men earn a median $21 an hour, making more money than women across all races, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. They also earn more than black and Hispanic men, who make a respective $15 and $14 median hourly wage. The only group that out-earns white men is Asian men, who earn $24, according to the report."  If there are factors such as "discrimination" as the article states, then why do Asian men earn more than white men? Could it be that Asian men work harder, value education and family more than white and black men and that discrimination doesn't have a GD thing to do with it? This article is a great example of how the leftist media tries to misinform the public in order to push its agenda.
Here in Calgary, two police chiefs hid 2 independent reports 4 years apart (2nd chief was in charge of HR at the time)  of improper behavior by their own officers against female officers from the police commission.  The police union would not protect their own female officers after they made complaints.(btw an example -- sending a photo of your genitals to your female partner immediately after the shift is improper behavior).   Is anyone suspended, anyone fired -- NO.   . What does the police commission do, criticize and reprimand a councillor on the police commission who was approached by the female officers and implement a 7 point plan and everything will be ok.  Talk about sticking your head in the sand.  No follow ups, no checking.  What a croc.
Just a matter of time for all women to be obligated to get covered up and hidden up veils to not offend Muslims. They are winning .
I am amazed that a multi part rant from a misogynistic, homophobic racist is allowed on 'Civil' comments. It seems someone who wears the mantle even larger than you, will be taking the lead and your are giggling in your closet!  There is honestly no reason to waste time arguing with you, because you are either a troll or a total idiot.  Most likely the latter.  Just want to let you know if you gleefully rub your hands together in your delight they will turn raw and bleed!  WOMEN STAY UNITED AGAINST THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT!!!  I will see you at march.
More complete and utter nonsense from Balki.    There is no problem with masculinity, males, powerful males, straight males, etc.  NONE WHATSOEVER.  There are a few PEOPLE committing illegal, unlawful, immoral and unauthorized acts against other people.  End of story.  Stop labeling all men, or all powerful men, or Geeks? Really Geeks??  "Deep down the Geek knows?"  Are you f&cking kidding me Balki?  Now you are labeling, berating, mocking, discrediting, vilifying, STIGMATIZING an entire class of people, young men who work in technology, because a handful of people acted inappropriately?  Out of millions?  Do you read your own crap?  "Empowered after centuries of having sand kicked in their faces, too many tech geeks are asserting their newfound dominance over women repeatedly and repulsively" ????  You are a sick person.  Your stories are garbage.  This entire discussion is sad, pathetic and symptomatic of the spiraling demise of the mainstream media as it will soon be formerly known.
Has anyone blaming Mueller  taken a look at the so called incriminating photo? Not one damned piece of evidence is in that photo as Taylor claims, Taylors skirt is not up as she says it was in the photo, Muellers hand is not on her rear. In fact Swift, Mueller and the third girl are all smiling. If Swift was in an upsetting assault situation why the hell is she smiling in the photo that is supposed to be damning. this case reeks of a spoiled damned celebrity whose Mom snottily insisted this DJ be fired. 'HE GRABBED NY BARE ASS." Do these words sound like they are coming from a classy woman? It is too easy nowadays to be accused and convicted of a sex crime one did not commit. I have a relative in similar situation as Mueller and my relative is damned innocent. This jury that heard Swift's case did a poor job and ruled in favor of a celebrity because they were a celebrity without heeding proper evidence.. Sound familiar? How about OJ Simpsons original trial?
Oh but they think they are enlightened, so does the media...........time for a few of them to look at a truth based, not politically corrected revisionist history book.   Muslims are still murdering Christians and other faiths just because they are not Muslim.  They still repress their women.   Not as innocent and worthy of over the top fighting for as they think.
My mother attended UAF in the 1950's, she was assaulted. I attended in the 1970's and spoke with several women that were assaulted. One of my children was assaulted at the university in the 2010's. None of these were ever resolved, it is considered part of the cost of going to the school. Yes, the son of a bitch was acquitted, and when finally we have administrators willing to try for women's justice they are told they cannot. I guess women should not be out of their kitchens, and why are they not pregnant? Rulings favoring assault are the problem and those who find male privilege proper need that horsewhipping mentioned earlier.
How many times does a perverted president have to grope women, get weird about women going to the bathroom, and verbally fantasizing during debates about what they're doing in there before you call him a pervert?
and kidnapping women and young girls and forcing them into sex slavery for the army is not cowardice?  Grow a back-bone...Bombs work so much better when distributed from aircraft!
Trump, bunt, he is our man, our man with the bright orange tan! He will show you what hes got, trump hair - cause damn it's hot! Islam, Mexican, African, Women, Fire Chiefs, POWs, Media exclusions but big tuffs of hair oh how he wears it! Big mouth, stupid face, O lips, sucking *bleep* 'say what?' Not Putin.. Oh drop the mic right there lol!! Treason, lying, misinterpreted reality, hateful, spiteful, narcissistic personality, ohhh man America, so f*c*ing lost. We are now represented by: "Dunta Dun - Honey Boo Boo Clan!!! The new representation of the United States of America! *insert clapping here* Cry me a what? Oh wait.. Crimea, hu?   Ohhhhh.. "I don't know anything about that" - thought it was a Justin Bieber song - "loosers"
"I’m going to be OK. And if you’re are a white heterosexual male with a decent job, you’ll probably be OK too." Do we need any more proof that 'Luke' is a bigot and who knows what else? Hit tirate is just that - garbage being spewed because his feelings are hurt, the career crook that he supported - that accepts money from countries that Murder GAYS, treats their dogs better than their women and thinks nothing of murdering Christians.... THIS is who HE thinks should be our President... His 'whole belief system lost' I'm crying for him....   NOT  AND Not getting my business any time soon...
What better way to do a little kitty grabbing? The ladies are lining up to to be groped. Believe me.
I like that you separated Muslims into a specific subset, the ones that believe  the fundamentalist values you mentions.   You know that not all Muslims agree with those specific values.     I know that not All Christians think of murdering their son, beating children with a rod, offering their daughters for sex, believe that a woman worked with a snake to corrupt the origin perfect human - a single male made from dirt, or that women were createed from the rib of a man.    ================== It seems part of our human nature is  to 'rank' ourselves in comparison to others, in our personal life, our work life, even our spiritual lives.   It's impossible for a diverse culture to completely eliminate that conflict of human ego's.     When people must be 'ranked',  you can believe it creates anger and hostility.  LOL, look at this room!
Tamaqua PA sex education 1962.  At the age of 5 my mother told me all about the birds and bees and sex.  In 1972 at the age of 15 my father told me if I get a girl pregnant he would break both my legs.  Simple but straight forward sex education from my parents.  And guess what I never got a girl/woman pregnant out of wedlock.  Sometimes all it takes is good parents who aren't PC.  Oh and this system of sex education worked on my son as well or at least the threat of breaking his legs did, :-).
Especially since it's a woman calling me out. No holds barred for this brazen hussy - dead husband or not. I'm the President of the freakin' U S of A, by gawd!
You probably spend your time cyber stalking women/girls online to even have a wife.
this whole thing is about the poor women and her husband and the police, dion isn't an arsehole because of this gesture, he's just an arsehole.
Insulting anyone, not just women, is a Trump personality trait.  It's not a weakness for him, it's just part of who he is.    An arrogant, loud-mouthed bully.    The ultimate "Ugly American."
Your claim is incorrect.  We are not talking about priests that were cloistered away with no access to female victims.  Pederasty involves victims  that offenders are sexually attracted to,  which in this case were post pubescent males. That would suggest the vast majority of offending priests were homosexual in nature.
You do not decide when a sentient being becomes from the quickening. You know not when self awareness begins. You do not have the right to determine God's conscience. You do not have the right to tell a woman she must carry an embryo to fetal stage and then birth, even when she knows the embryo is drug/alcohol effected and she cannot afford to raise it, deal with it emotionally or medically, or was raped or used while unconscious. Where is your pious :Christianess" (because that's what Is) .......when you talk about the lessons of Jesus, yet won't live amongst the prostitutes, alcoholics and criminals. Jesus doesn't save hypocrites.
Ever since former justice minister Alan Rock feminized the custody laws and now we have a feminist PM.  The product of this are lost men who don't know their way because they know that their future is screwed.  Most recent opioid deaths (actually suicides) are men but hey who cares right?  The only gender issue on the federal radar is the MMIW inquiry.  Besides our parliament is filled with "old white grandpas" as stated by our now racist PM.  So yes the hate is on for men especially if you happen to be white.  So today's men are the product of marriages where the best advice for the man is "if you're right then shut up".  Yes we have to shut up - or else the obvious consequences.  And if things don't work out because the woman is always right - it's still the man's fault for being passive aggressive. Forget about sex, and let's focus on the family law system first.
SMH. "The world wuz better when wimmen couldn't vote or have a job!" Good lord.  I'm sure you're not interested in facts, but many cultures have been comfortable with TG people for millenia.  Transgenderism wasn't created by "feminism" just like feminism didn't create troglodytes who think anyone but a cis white male Christian is inferior to them.  The troglodytes always existed, but now we hear more from them due to their death throes. Bye trogs! We won't miss you.
There are some who will say that the church can never change its position on homosexuality because the church's teaching is part of divine revelation. I say it's as much a part of divine revelation as not eating shellfish or men not cutting their hair - after all, those prohibitions, like not wearing clothes made of mixed fabrics or not eating meat with dairy products, all come from the same book of the Bible: Leviticus. And yes, St. Paul did condemn homosexual acts but he also told women to be quiet in church, and yet no one observes that rule anymore. Cherry-picking the Bible has a long history that will probably never end. But the people who mention revelation never talk about the fact that Jesus himself never said a word about homosexuality. In the end, as a gay Catholic Christian, I take great comfort in that. The church has been wrong about many things in the past. It is wrong about homosexuality, and it is time the church change its position - out of charity, if nothing else.
Trump shares those values. Rape your wife and treat women like sexual objects.
farmers, fishermen and female entrepreneurs are protected??? WTF!  It is amazing to me how the government can discriminate against men, other small businesses and get away with this.  Where is the CFIB to file a lawsuit against the government for a charter challenge???  These Liberals are closet Marxists. See you next election Trudeau as small business people pour election dollars into the conservatives to throw your sorry butt to the curb along with your gang of Marxist bullies
"As an African-American Muslim man, 'I don't have that freedom,"  You don't say.   Oh, sorry; I forget facts often get in the way of the taqiya victim narrative.  It never ceases to amaze me how pseudoliberals who purport to be champions of women's rights and GLBT rights are so ready to enable an ideology that is FAR more anti-women and anti-GLBT than the Christians that they hate so much. And I'm saying this as an agnostic who frequently criticizes Christians for their anti-rights stance on women's and GLBT issues.
You had better watch your mouth young lady, or you'll get a severe tongue lashing from gary crum for being so nasty.
This pretty well sums up my iron-clad conclusions that white privilege for too long - 200 years at least - has created these animals. And gives credibility to Lisa Bloom's findings of fact hereunder offered. From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
You've got one heck of a conspiracy theory going. I found the following in the NY Times: Merkel Is Its Leader, but Germany Has a Woman Problem By KATRIN BENNHOLD Chancellor Angela Merkel has led Germany   What do you make of it?
Likely what happened is that some HB91-obsessed corrections officer(s) took it upon themselves to punish this young woman since like you they have a hard-on against it. No doubt they got satisfaction from tossing this lawbreaker out into the cold at 7am without regard to her state of being. If the law won't punish people then we can count on DOC cop-wannabe cowards to do it.
Mrs. Cafaro, I regret to inform you that your humble opinion is way too biased and hypocritical, not to mention out of context and absolutely not based on reality. As democrats, you pride yourselves on SAYING you're striving for equity in all aspects of life and doing exactly the opposite. You fill your mouth yelling about diversity and inclusiveness, except when it's about opinions and ideology. Your diversity claims show that you are really the racists because all you care about is skin color and not about integrity and moral character. You don't fight as you say for reproductive freedom but for mass extermination. You call for equal pay for equal work except when yourselves are the ones paying the salaries. Like it happened at the presidential campaigns of Hillary and Bernie Sanders who paid their workers $10/hr spite calling for $15/hr for everyone. You also fight to justify and protect abusers in spite of the victims you say you want to champion, like those women raped by Bill C.
Liberal minded writers are desperate to not include women celebrities  and  females stars as sex addicts who use sex as a sport and for business negotiations. All of a sudden they are all Victorian maidens of virtue true, Polly Purehearts every one.
I'm not surprised. Is he even gay? I mean, we have to take his word for it. And does he have a Jewish grandmother, or is that fiction?  He is so full of hate for women, gays, Jews, Muslims, liberals, blacks, and others, that it didn't make sense that he claimed to be gay and part-Jewish. Now, pedophile makes sense.   The alt-Right often confuse pedophilia with homosexuality when they are, in fact, unrelated. Was Milo abused at 13? That would make sense. But then he should be in therapy and not lashing out.  Then again, that's the cycle of abuse. The abused becomes the abuser. Milo thinks he's being strong by spewing hatred of women, gays, Jews, Muslims, blacks and others. He's just compensating for his own lack of self-worth.
The "creepy yellow haired clown" certainly ends up with better looking women than the "smooth talking Bubba."
You don't watch much TV.  The man from Mars would think that most people here are black, in the power positions, and dominant over those around them.  What few white women exist are red heads and children are worshiped.
He should have just bragged about grabbing P's and walking in on naked girls, he could've been President like The Twittler...#MAGA
This is possibly the most ignorant and over-simplified thing I have ever read.   "Men needed access to sex. Women needed access to resources."  .... how do you even respond to something so idiotic and baseless?
This is quite a mouthful Rob. I've been a feminist for most of my 82 years . I can't count my early childhood!  I have to tell you that it would be difficult for a practicing catholic to be a true feminist. Such a person would have to support no abortion rights, a ban on contraception, no women priests & a ban on there ever being a female pope. To say that women who support free market capitalism would not be welcome in feminist ranks is untrue &  that the same is true for women who work in the energy industry is ridiculous. Many feminists feel aggrieved at times but 'resentful'? Not the ones I know. If you really believe the world is not run by a patriarchy, you should think again. Third world countries are overwhelmingly anti- women - how else do you explain honour killings?, the niqab? We`ve made progress in the west but not enough. As is stated in the article & depending on Trump's pick for the next supreme court justice, American women could lose their abortion rights.
You come from the 'veins of polygamy'.... is Zuma your father?? Polygamy is wholly primitive, debasing women!  OK, not certain about paternity, but I am certain that Mbabula is a crass racist e=who has enriched himself while, so far, making an idiot of himself as a Minister in his 'father's' Government.  It's very clear whe know where you stand Mbabula, and Law and Order doesn't come into it!
Sure .... everybody knows they exist.  There are lots of different kinds of mental illness.  Thinking you are a female when you have junk hanging between your legs is one of them.  Delusional is the word that comes to my laymen's mind.  Not all mental illness is debilitating and as long as these people are otherwise functional I'm not sure that it does much harm to allow them to indulge their fantasies.  But the rest of us should not have to go along with their particular form of insanity.
Can you name any woman who wrote a manifesto against men and then targeted them in a killing spree?  No you can't.    But if that were to happen -- or the times when men have written a manifesto against women and then killed a bunch of them -- I'd call it a hate crime.  Just like that white supremacist who shot a bunch of black people in a church was charged with hate crimes.  Yet strangely, there's a lot of resistance to calling it a hate crime when women are the hated group and the target.  Why is that?
Joe Dick writes:  "Don’t let the trolls win. So the feminist troll author, is extolling the virtues of ignoring other trolls. The irony is thick and rich and oh so hypocritical."  --  The mind-boggling irony and hypocrisy here is that engendered by Joe Dick charging someone else with being a troll.  .
I completely agree that he has mental health issues. All terrorists obviously have mental health issues.  Plotting to mass murder women and children is proof of that fact.
No but I was on the rebel media! 24.9 million views last month and growing spread the word.  Nothing wrong with calling out the G&M for what it is.  If you are Jewish, part of the LGBTQ community, a white female you have major concerns about Islam and sharia.  Rotterdam anyone? Maybe you are in favor of young girls getting gang raped but I can tell you, most of us are not!
Who are these girls who are having sex, but are too scared to ride the bus?   If you can't get to the clinic by yourself how are you going to make it to a pharmacy?   And just to be clear, I'm not arguing against contraception. On the contrary, I'm pointing out the people you don't want reproducing.
I got to play Bottom the Weaver in a local production of 'Midsummer Night's Dream', and I'm a woman; indeed, we had so many more women than men audition that all the 'rude mechanicals' save one were played by women. Apart from playing Aunt Abby Brewster in 'Arsenic and Old Lace' last year, playing Bottom was the most fun I've had as an actor (and yes, I did ask people, at the first read-through, to get all the 'bottom' and 'ass' jokes out there early so we could move on).
No, It's not.. gawd do you Trumspters hold any value to your own country women at all? This is just sickening- makes me sick! So they should walk off stage after the years of training to risk being what, being talked about like how? Gross! And you and your cronies think they should have to be abused?? In public? There's something very wrong with you people!!
Sanders, unlike many, is not stupid enough to be entertaining this ridiculous nonsense about Hillary being indicted. Sorry kids, it's just not going to happen. Sanders is an egotistical person with a fading grasp on reality, so he's staying in the race, and that's the only reason.   The reality is that we are electing our first female president. We are really doing it!  The male tears are going to be pretty epic.
That is a really foolish position to take. Ageism? Really? Because in reality, a 66 year old woman winning a sporting event like this is amazing! At 60, I work to stay fit. From my point of view, Roxy is an inspiration. Its sad that you see her as an embarrassment!
"Black men and women in Denver are twice as likely to die from gunshots — and five times as likely to be murdered by gunfire — as white men and women"  And why do you think that is?  Perhaps it's that they commit more of the murders and crime than whites proportionally?  Perhaps it is that their communities foster this type of behavior?  Perhaps they need to look inwards and fix the problems with their own communities and people, rather than blaming everything on the white man for once in their lives?
I would rather work with a Hillary supporter than a Trump supporter any day. Trump is a proven racist and misogynist.  Examples for the weak minded who forget too easily (or just don't care):  Racist = pointing to one of the only black people at his rally and stating something along the lines of "Here is my black guy"; asking the a black reporter if she knows the Black Caucus in DC and if she can set up a meeting between he and them.  Misogynist = bragging about sexually assaulting women and then stating that this was only "locker room banter".  Please defend any of these statements if you can. However, first place yourself in a black person's or woman's shoes and ask yourself how you would feel if either of these examples happened to you. The irrational out there, will likely state that this is not a problem and would be OK or even proud that Trump would show some attention to them. The rest of us understand that the Idiot in Chief is just that and his supporters are much the same.
LOL.  A true blue  politically correct feminazi!!   I will continue using the terms firemen, history,  and policemen, thank you.    No go back and say hi to your female partner that you think is mated to you.
No kidding:  "Jesus made Peter a Pope and told him to go set up an opulent royal court in Rome. I don't care what Scripture says. I know it's true because I want it to be true!"  "Through the merits of her Divine Son, Our Blessed Mother was miraculously preserved from Original Sin. I don't care if it doesn't make any sense. I know it's true because I want it to be true!"  "Mary was a virgin her whole life long. I don't care what Scripture says. I know it's true because I want it to be true! Women who have sex are yucky!"  "Laypeople owe their priests filial obedience and big wads of money. I know it's true because I want money and hate working for it!"  "Jesus says priests are too ontologically precious to be subject to secular law. I know it's true because I don't want to go to jail!"  Some religions are upwards from ninety percent truthiness.
"It’s a new level of hypocrisy to advertise you are raising funds for the ACLU while simultaneously, very likely, violating public accommodations laws." Thank you Megan for being a voice of reason. While I don't care about "women-only screenings", especially for a film I don't plan on watching in the theater, it is illegal to ban a particular sex from entering a public establishment. What's funny is the same women who defend this "Women only" screening would be outraged if they made plans to get together with their girlfriends and buy tickets to see the next "50 Shades" movie, but were turned away at the door due to an exclusive "Gay Men only" screening.
Gary:  You stated, "and the adult male who sexually molests young boys is not likely to be homosexual".  Whaaaaaaaaat the Duck?   So what do YOU call a Adult Male who has Intestinal Intercourse with a young male or male??????    Can' wait  for this answer.........  Ever Read the Bible.  There is scripture there like, "Men will not lay with Men like they do with a Woman".......There are many many more DENOUNCING Homosexuality, and God's plan against this DISCUS-STING Behavior.
I THINK THAT IN ORDER TO WIN ANY FUTURE WARS WE SHOULD ONLY SEND WOMAN, TRANSGENDERS,LESBIANS,GAYS,AND PEOPLE WHO CAN'T MAKE UP THEIR MINDS, TO THE FRONT LINES. DOING THAT WOULD INSURE THAT WE NEVER LOSE ANOTHER BATTLE.  THE REASON BEING, THE ENEMY WOULD LAUGH ITSELF TO DEATH!
Nick,  Hillary Rotten Clinton is vile and evil.  She is an embarrassment to all women of integrity.
Which only proves the stupid rabid homophobia of both Russia and it's bosom kin, the Deep South, that except for the revelation of a minor character's possible same sex attraction,   it's okay for the female lead to fall in love with a talking buffalo/wolf hybrid.
This man ought to be going to work for the woman for the next 5-9 years and pay for her care for the rest of her life. Instead, we pay for him to live in prison and her to live on disability. My heart goes out to the woman who has to live with this idiot's actions.
The names of everyone charged with a crime is public.  That doesn't mean that every name is published in the media.  Generally, if it's a case of simple sexual assault where the victim and accused know each other (as opposed to aggravated assault where there is injury) the press don't report it unless there is a conviction.  But I can see the purpose of reporting sometimes.  For example, a case recently in my town where there was a serial rapist who assaulted 3 women at random -- the media reported his name with photo, because if there were other victims or witnesses, that would encourage them to come forward and help make sure the guy was taken off the streets, which he was.
Woe is me.  Oh how I long for the good old days when she would be forced to live with me and be miserable or choose to leave and become a penniless scorned woman.   Go find someone better and make twice as much money and stop moaning. She gave you a gift and you're too pathetic and bitter to realize it.
It's almost like Target wants women to get raped.  I don't think many girls or women will want to walk down a dark hallway to a bathroom with no one in it but her and a "man".   All the sexual predators are salivating right now.
"You claim to have an open mind, yet think Trump's a creep."  Sexual Assault is creepy, among other things. Naw, Drumpf said he can do anything he wants to women including sexual assault.
JenW, you're flat out wrong. I'm talking about their own stated beliefs. "We believe that Christ's gifts are equally given to men and women to build up His Body," the church website declares, "but that God has designated men to fulfill the primary role of spiritual leadership." That belief is a big load of stinky, misogynist bullshit.
This is HIGLY DISTURBING. Who in their right mind would vote for someone accused of raping a 12 year old girl? Sheesh! You'd have to be sick in the head to vote for him. He is also indicted for FRAUD for trump University. And has groped dozens of women inappropriately.  "Witness: Trump also raped 12-year-old"  https://www.rawstory.com/2016/11/witness-trump-also-raped-12-year-old-and-used-her-disappearance-to-threaten-another-victim/
Michelle Obama will run against Trump in 2020.  Why do you think they bought a $5M House in D.C.? Barack uses Slick Willy as his template; he seeks to build a dynasty. The mass media has already started her campaign : pics of her looking skyward ("Visionary") and the Headline "Michelle's Legacy".  For "The Liberals" it is too sweet of an idea  Not to have her run! "Ahhh Yes! A Black Woman (with the same views as "Barry") running against that evil p***y grabbing racist!" I can hear it now!
Stupid people doing stupid things, still doesn't mean that no one should own firearms. This sounds like a party of goobers who should have had supervision if they wanted to play with scissors. I hope that woman heals (I'll pray), what a BIG stooopid thing! Dancing with a gun you stupid tard? Why???!
What is the matter with you globeandmail? Do you expect me to ever pay for your newspaper again when you put out such baised stories.  When a driver is intoxicated, they are  guity no matter what. When a young woman becomes intoxicated, everone else is guilty no matter what. Such a blanant double standard is systemic positive discrimation. Everything thay your saying is hypocritical!!
Right next to the house where the Arab female genital mutilation and honour killing is taking place.
I just look at the headlines and think to myself "when did the Globe and Mail become the Leftwing Broadcasting Corporation?"  Complain, cry, weep, throw your hands up in the air and proclaim the end is near, but none of it matters. There is nothing you can do or say to change it.  Time to put on your big girl panties and move on G&M.
This from woman that comes from the dirtiest country in the world
Wow..."Muslim refugees behead them in public one day for supporting LBGQ, pro-abortion, womens' rights and other highly anti-Islam ideologies!"...Aren't those ALSO the things Trumpers are also against???...Sounds like you guys have a lot in common with these Terrorist...#MAGA
"These trans people" just want to pee in peace. Funny thing, if you've ever used a public bathroom its quite likely you've shared that experience with a one of "those trans people" without  even realizing it.  On the other hand be careful what you wish for. When the transgender men return to the women's bathroom with their dashing masculine looks complete with facial hair remember ... under this proposal their birth certificates forced them to be there.
"Call me a spoiled, selfish western female ..."  Okay, you're a spoiled, selfish, western female and I'll add paranoid to boot.
Treat women like crap and you should have your life ruined...except they haven't had their lives ruined and, in fact, are playing for schools right now. We need to start creating a society and culture where men don't feel entitled to sex, women's bodies, or women's subservience. We could start with teaching boys and young men that, hey, shocking, women are people and not sexual objects that exist for your pleasure. We could start with teaching mutuality and equality; that gender is a societal construct unrelated to biological sex. The very least we could do is mandate that male athletes go through consent and anti-violence programs before they play.   The other thing we could do is challenge pornography--what they did was right out of misogynistic porn.
It is Illegal to pay people differently for the same work. Which is why your assertion that people of different genders see it from their first job offers is rubbish. http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/downloads/legislation/acts/employment-equity/eegazette2015.pdf  Regardless, if businesses could pay women 17% less for exactly the same work that men do, why aren't all companies staffed entirely by women? The company would cut their wage bill instantly by 17% and increase profitability instantly.   The reason is because the gap is bullshit and you are not comparing apples with apples.
I think it's great. In the long run, it will hopefully teach both sexes to respect the other more, perhaps preventing future Weinstein & Trump like pigs from taking advantage of women. However, their enrollment is down significantly, which could make one suspicious of their motive.
David Nees shouldn't be elected to any public office including dog catcher.  Need inappropriately posted a female bloggers personal contact information on this very site to encourage other anti-liberal haters to contact the female blogger and harass or stalk her.  Any public office candidate that can stoop this low as to encourage stalking or harassing another community member because of their beliefs and opinions needs to be barred from running for office.  Nees failed to win at least four different school board elections and now we must shut the door on him at the Assembly level.  Nees appears to be another Demboski that wants to take up a valued Assembly seat by being a naysayer and obstructionist.  No thank you, Nees, but hell no thank you!
Really? An "eye for attractive woman " is your pathetic excuse for trumps Access Hollywood video capturing his bragging about sexual assault? Yeah, very masculine! BTW - tired of LOSING yet?
Utter NONSENSE.  Why isn't Trudeau forced to denounce the FLQ, the guy that murdered all those women engineers, the guy that murdered Muslims in the mosque??? They were WHITE CHRISTIAN MALES...   You are just a racist  with nothing else to show for yourself. SHAME ON YOU spreading such FILTH.
if a trip wire or sensors could be hooked up to sprinkle only when someone enters the yard, it may not be so "offensive"   I don't what the woman in California's issue is with the water left on - perhaps all the to-do about rationing water, especially in the Stockton area. I feel the pain of the homeowner or resident of that yard.  it would be horrible  - like coyotes going through garbage and cats pooping in the flower beds.  but unlike wildlife -  these opportunists/parasites go through mail, back yards, cars.... anywhere they see a "score". and will deliberately mess a yard with their own feces in a last act of disrespect and disregard.  I haven't had any human poopers as far as I know but have had these guys rummage.  first with consent for recyclables, IF there was no mess left.  big fail. one guy actually tried to open my garage door as well....
Alaskan girls KICK ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! when they're not dead from a heroin overdose.
And since we're talking about "tranny porn" since you brought it up, you can confirm for yourself.  It doesn't matter if trans-women do not go through male puberty, their hips and other features simply do not match real females, they tend to have less of an hour glass figure, and many times they will use fillers to achieve that hour glass figure.  And this isn't all fat, it is also skeletal geometry.  If men and women were simply so similar that not going through puberty was enough these stark differences wouldn't persist. Even in one of the most impressive transitions using blockers, Andrej Prejec clearly shows a body without curves or wide hips. http://i.imgur.com/b5vtseU.jpg Beyond that the ethics of hrt treatment before people reach adulthood is still questionable. Hrt does not reverse bone changes, and its noted that even male reflexes are faster than that of women.
Getting shit-faced drunk isn't a good idea for man or woman.  But that doesn't excuse rape.
.  "The Proud Boys""  --  How to describe these guys?  Doofusses? (Doofi?)  Embittered white males tortured by their loss of privilege and lashing out at their perceived enemies?  Refugees from the 1950s?  Obsolete at 25 years of age?  Whatever, they are classic fodder for the far right/white supremacist/alt right/nationalist fringe.  Crushed that simply being male turned out to be not enough to put them at the front of the gravy train, stuck in dead-end, no-hope careers while they watch women(!) and immigrants who were smart enough and hard-working enough to educate themselves for the 21st century cruise past them in the line, they dress themselves in their prejudices and expect to be taken seriously by anyone other than their similarly self-burdened brethren.  Let them march around with their little uniforms, their smaller ideology and their non-existent self-respect.  They are their own punishment for their own failures.  .
It's going to be fun watching the mean white men beat up on the poor little girl. Polis will crush everybody with all of his money!
Trump is such a chump. He spends a few short hours with China's communist leader and thinks he understands him completely. The Trumpster gushes about Xi like a school girl carries on about a new boyfriend. He feels like they've known each other forever. Young love...  it's so magical.  It's not surprising that he'd want to meet Duterte, who is without a doubt a tough guy. Duterte is what the Trumpster imagines himself to be. But the Trumpster is no tough guy. He has never been in a bar fight, let alone street fight. He's never served in the military or been a cop. Verbally abusing the help doesn't qualify.  The Trumpster is infatuated with authoritarian dictators for obvious reasons. It's the way he dreamed of running his presidency after he stole the election with the help of Wikileaks and Russia, which is further proof that he didn't, and still doesn't understand how our democracy works. He and his inept administration have run head on into our democracy. So far democracy has won.
The Human Rights Tribunal/Commission is as out of touch as the UN and doing way more damage than good.  Just another RIDICULOUS ruling.  And the Liberals fall in line just like they do with any UN demands............what a messed up world we live in.   And when it comes to women Judges, most of the again ridiculous rulings seem to be coming from them, no common sense, heart over brains.  And I am a woman.   I feel very sad for young men who do not fit the quotas.    It is reverse discrimination, being carried out by our government.  Whatever happened to Canadians being treated equal?
Clinton molested women, obama traded 5 terrorists for a traitor and Trump sent a few tweets...WTF??? This hack who hasn't done anything meaningful in 40+ years needs to retire and leave politics to the men and women of this country who don't whine every time someone retaliates against the liberals threats and violence.
Well thanks for standing up for the women in your life against pu**y grabbers, they must be proud lol!!
You need to check your reality and echo chamber.  You are so polarized I would attempt to refute what you have to say, but the "but but but Bill Clinton" crap is getting old. He is not running for president and has not been for a long time. Trump said he grabbed them by the p***y. He joked about sexual assault. He is going to be the president. You elected him, own it.  Also nice of you to tell a woman to get back to work and shut her mouth. Did you puff out your chest and pound on it to ensure your testosterone was at max level when you told those women what's what?
You can keep repeating that feminism is about "fundamental equality of men and women" until you're blue in the face, but the reality is that the very terminology used by this hate-cult movement -- "patriarchy", a male-based term used to describe everything bad and negative in society, and "feminism", a female-based term used to describe everything good and the "savior" of society -- is the core of a dogma that is rooted in sexism and gender-hatred. It's in all of your academic writings, all of your media writings, and everywhere else throughout the movement. People aren't stupid and see right through your dismissals of the truth. The very premise of your hate-cult is patriarchy theory, which ignores much of the inequalities that remain. This is because your theory has no place for this reality, and therefore it fails. Bravo for William Shatner in calling attention to the gender-hate that is rife throughout feminism.
Ms. Wilde: I hope you're kidding. Quite obviously, Mr. Weinstein is a sexual predator. If he were just power-hungry, he'd not have had sex as his objective. Rape and sexual harassment primarily are about sex: forcing a person of less power to accede to an unwanted act. To some women, I can understand how this mistake can be made, but a mistake it is. If it were just about power, he'd have them bow down or kiss his shoes or wash his car.
I have no idea what he's talking about nor do most people, I'm sure. But what I do know is the NFL has an odious reputation of ignoring brain injuries and violent crimes by its players, especially against women, all in the pursuit of ever-greater profits and has no business lecturing anybody about anything. And besides, football is boring as dust--especially the American version.
Maybe you don't remember just a year ago when the Access Hollywood tape was released and about a dozen women came out with allegations of groping/assault by tRump. He's been outed as a sexual deviant and harrasser, too, and still accidentally got "elected" to the WH. Why are you failing to speak out about that?
What type of person would vote for  Hillary Rotten Clinton? The one who admires a sexual predator enabler? One who supports a woman who tried to destroy her fornicating husband's victims?
Alan Parson's Satanic Babylon Working Ritual succeeded in 1946. 1947 a female Bitch was birthed.
Just imagine that there was a knock at your door at home. You open the door and there is a handful of people who ask permission to enter your home. You ask logically "What reason do you have, that requires entry to my house?" They reply "We want to protest the color of your house, the way you prune your trees, and the way you treat your spouse. We want to hang posters on your windows and march up and down on your lawn".   I'm sure all you women and men would be cheerfully greeted and the door swung wide open.  Are all activists brain dead... is the question of the day?! GK
Utilitas,  he doesn't like that I won't respond to his trolling messages with more than the "funny"  emoticon and has taken to stalking me insulting me non-stop.   In the Cardinal Ravasi thread on women deacons, he even told me to have intimate congress with myself.   Funny thing is, in the email I got from CC it was spelled out completely, but in the posted comment, it was f#### ed out.  LOL
these women complain AFTER they have had sex with this clown. They got paid with success making them prostitutes.
You claim there is a lack of media coverage about women raping men while linking to a newspaper article about women raping a man... uh, ok!
Ummm... I think we got our wires crossed somewhere. When I referenced his private affairs I meant his home and marriage etc. If Dean doesn't want to marry a black woman, disowns a gay son, or wont let a Jew in his home that's his business. If Dean wants to block certain people from public accommodations like pools or restrooms or refuse service to someone because they belong to a minority group he dislikes then no, he no longer gets to claim a right to free association and the courts should absolutely step in.
"He loves it and I am happy he has an opportunity to practice his faith in a safe space"  - Praying to god should be like masturbating, you should do it in your private place - HOME.  Freedom of religion means you can do it at home, at your church/mosque/temple BUT NOT IN PUBLIC PLACES. Next thing is Islam will put out their GIANT speakers (like in Middle East) and say that is your way of spreading the goodwill. And consuming alcohol is evil, women not covering their body are sluts to seduce others, eating pork is guilty to death and it's ok to murder your son/daughter/nieces/nephews if they married to non-muslim ... I'm old enough to witness ALL the above in the name of Islam and the craziness of "My Religion is peaceful" BS.   Freedom of religion means you can do whatever the F you want in your head while not disturbing others.
That woman is so hateful. It's sad to see a human being behave in this manner. Why does she get so much media attention? She needs professional help instead of a chance to spread her evil.
All that blather and you still have yet to address the need to keep tabs on real pedophiles (who target prepubescent children not ovulating females) and rapists.  Just because some bureaucratic nonsense put public urination and near-age statutory rape in the same category as monsters does not mean the monsters ought be let off the leash, and your suggestion otherwise makes me wonder why you spend so much effort finding ways for monsters to avoid detection by going so far as to suggest Jesus was a rape baby?  What issue do you have with such an intimate and powerful experience being reserved for consenting adults, and not twisted to give an advantage to those who take it with power and despite the trauma done?  If you cannot acknowledge the distinction, I suspect you to be monstrous.
"I also teach them how to honor the ladies they are attracted to by respecting them enough not to want to violate them physically and waiting until they are ready to make a lifelong commitment."  So once you and your "lady" made a lifelong commitment did you physically violate her? Now I see why evangelical Christians like you AlwaysThere, have so wholeheartedly embraced Trump--you have similar values--you wait to "physically violate" until after marriage while Trump doesn't. "Grab ’em by the p***y. You can do anything." Donald Trump
Whether that is true is the point on which our foreign policy turns.  I believe your statement is true, and that the majority of Muslims, because of culture (a terribly backward one) and religion (a terribly intolerant one) are natural enemies of the West, and would like nothing better than to see Satan --- the West --- destroyed. Many Americans on the left are so self-loathing that they actually do hate America, and will not allow themselves to recognize the truth of what I just said. For example, look at the American Left's brand of feminism. If a man so much as looks at a woman in a bikini contest, he's a loathsome pig who "objectives" women.  Fair enough.  But where are the voices of these women against the culture of Islam, where women would be literally stoned for working at Hooters?  Silence.  They didn;t even raise their voices against one of the most sexist pigs ever: Bill Clinton. The American Left is one of the most incoherent political forces ever to grace Western politics.
It says so right in the Koran: "Strike the neck (behead) of non believers."   It also says to throw homosexuals off from tall places, like buildings.  and to stone adulterers(who is defined as women who have been raped, a double indemnity for being female)   You can Google search pictures of such events.    These things are  Islam in action..
I'm wondering if anyone calling this "racism" (or good grief "reverse racism") even read her post. Have none of you heard of Jonathan Swift? This was a blog post, not a policy proposal to her department, for crying out loud. Sure, the idea is extreme on its face, but she discusses some very real issues faced by underrepresented groups, and she challenges those in academia to think deeply about how they approach hiring and diversity. She challenges all of us who identify as progressive or liberal to think about whether we are genuinely making effort to create more equitable institutions in real, tangible ways: are you walking the walk or just talking the talk? Yet rather than taking an opportunity for a thoughtful discussion, we have a bunch of pearl-clutching over the fate of a bunch of cis white guys...who are going to be affected by this post how, exactly? C'mon, progressives - we need to better than knee-jerk reactions of the O'Reilly crowd when a black woman calls out inequality!
yeah, rape is hilarious isn't it Wavey? And not just the woman that Bill raped/molested and Hitlary persecuted. How bout how Hitlery laughed at getting that 41 year old guy off with just a year in jail after raping a 12 year old? Fricken sweet eh? Yeah rape is hilarious but raping children mo bettah mo bettah eh wavey?  Your the best man, what a stand up guy!
GC:  "I do know of instances where the condemnation of family has destroyed the lives of young homosexual men and women".  Yes Gary, there are MANY, and there should be MILLIONS of  young and old homosexual men and women that realize  that their Sexual Lifestyle is WRONG.  REMEMBER, I Believe in the Bible and God and Jesus.  I know you do NOT as you have stated this numerous times prior.     I personally  do NOT and WILL not have any association with a Homosexual or Lesbian because of  scripture in the Bible.   I think  that's a Huge part of being  a DECENT person governing your day to day behavior as per the Bible.      Thanks for clarifying your sexual status and I am happy for YOU and your WIFE, and Good Luck with your Homosexual Friends.
Jane, but if a transgender has to use the bathroom - born a female, and now a male - that "male" has to use the womans bathroom if Minnery gets his way.  How, uh, uncomfortable do you think that will make your granddaughters?  They will be running out of the bathroom screaming "bad touch bad touch".   Yet, if the transgender who is a male, goes into the male bathroom, and uses a stall, no one will notice.    so.... which do you want?  Or want your pastors to keep molesting kids, because that seems to be happening a lot more than transgenders converting your granddaughters to "the geh".
Who will marry all of these boys who have no girls.  107 boys per 100 girls and boys die earlier for a multitude of reasons.  The 107/100 ratio is mother nature at work to counter the early death of boys.   Now we will have all of these boys who have no corresponding women and they will have to marry out side of their culture, which is okay by me, but an anathema to their family, and they will vilify the young man for dishonouring the family.  Simple yet valid conclusion,  people are stupid.
Disgusting, clueless lack of any respect for the name that they are supposedly representing , our name Canada, let alone the strong, men and woman of the past and future that have served and be killed, maimed. How could even the in conversation be brought up, let alone implemented for a space of time. What planet is this person from ? Me thinks that someone is trying to justify their job and do not deserve such a position in this company ! Indeed Air Canada, please feel free in the future to drop the name ! Shame on this classless person.
You sound like a part of our problem not a solution. The slur on gay folks and the Pepe the frog  cartoon showing Trump forcing himself on a blond woman (Hilary?) give you away. Go spread your hate elsewhere.
Glad you voted for someone who wants to go back to the days of separated schools and when women just were in the kitchen looking pretty. Idiots like you are dividing this country and that's what Chump wants. So got to say good goox job on having y our own views instead of being influenced by a clown. When your idol is a clown then most likely you, yourself are a clown. Birds of a feather flock togethe.
While most murder victims are killed by people they know, you're still assuming an awful lot. Especially the shooter being female. Men are much more likely to be killers.
"Custody" is defined as "the protective care or guardianship of someone or something". Part of the responsibility of the state when they take "Custody" of a person is to ensure when they are released that they are safe. Doing anything less (and this article indicates the FCC as a default just pushes those released onto the street) is an abrogation of their clearly defined responsibilities. If this poor woman was the first shoved out into the cold it would be one thing; but she was far from the first.  Hopefully, this woman's family has a sharp lawyer and the patience to win a multi-million dollar lawsuit. The FCC is obviously a craphole run by idiots who employ thugs and psychopaths. The public sector isn't going to correct this awful crap, civil court on the otherhand can force changes.  Fire any and all involved.
Give me a break.   They are afraid of the truth.   The Women and Gender Studies Institute has been peddling hatred and nonsense unopposed for years.  Now someone has the courage to espouse an opposing view, and fight back against the hatred and vitriol that left-wingers throw at someone who does not agree with their views.   And they are afraid.   They cannot fight with the truth of their ideas. So to go to daddy to tell the nasty man to go away.   Pathetic.  And it will be really pathetic if the U of T caves in to this nonsense.
Making oneself a painted target for every low-life in viewing distance is hardly a way to keep oneself safe, just like flashing a fat wad of cash around probably isn't a good idea either. One can be legally right and still wind up dead or badly injured. Life isn't always fair, but if you use a little common sense you increase the odds of avoiding bad outcomes. Why is that so hard for some to comprehend? Encouraging women and girls to be blissfully stupid is a strange way to show you have the "best interests" of them in mind. Not only does it increase their chances of being accosted or worse, but if a trial does occur their attire and/or consumption of drugs&alcohol will certainly be a point of interest. Encouraging irresponsible behavior, as Nelson is unwittingly doing, actually makes it worse for those women who practice responsible behavior to receive justice when they are assaulted.  There may indeed be a "rape culture" here, but equally there is an "idiocy culture" as well.
"Did you just Google that?"  A comment that could just as easily have been made to a man and has been.  "You don't have kids and are not even married" I am struggling with this one. If anybody had made a statement like that to an employee in any organisation that I have been involved with there would have been serious consequences.  "stuff it up and sink the office" This is often said of men. The biggest challenge for a newly promoted person is to get their peers who were competition on side. About 25 years ago I heard of a comment around promotion time "No balls no brains" and the guy who made it didn't last very long at all.    The younger person is usually the one who pours the coffee.   "I think of you as my daughter" Never heard that one before.  "Proposals in meetings" Obviously never seen the way that guys sometimes stab each other in the back.  "You should smile more" I have undoubtedly been called a miserable git by my staff. It's tough supporting The Kings.
"The woman is basically a slave."  Well, that just convinced me to vote for Trump. Yup...
The problem is that both men and women are silly and immature in their 20's and 30's.  They should be grown up by then, but, sadly, they are not.  Young women: do not spend your time with men that are not good candidates for marriage and family, if that is what you want.  Here's a clue: men who are ready for a family will say so and they will visibly have their life on track.  Young women often like to go along without saying what is on their mind.  Try this: say to a young man exactly what you want.   You will have less dates but the few you have will be with men with the same goals as you.  This is the advice I give my daughter.  Absolute honesty  with yourself and others will turn some people off.  But it's an essential filter for quality people.
Of course I meant to write "trying to make the point that it's OK to bash men but not women" ..
I'm not sure what world that Mark lives on but I must have missed the 'man meeting,' that told me what 'being a fag', was just a phrase of encouragement?    I have no comrades that would use that on me, or me on them.      I will say that I believe men and women are built differently.    Most people have grown to understand that mind and body are inseparable.   If your bodies are not built the same way, our perception of the world around us will be different as well.    And there is good reason to believe that some behaviors are 'encoded' from day one.    There is probably a construct of 'normal' attributes to men and women, but it's bias and ignorance to believe that those attributes are common to all men or all women.     Mark's opinion of what is 'natural' for a male, may not be natural at to every male at all.     And while our biology may influence our behavior, we are not bound by our biology alone.
We rightly are outraged by Assad's use of chemical weapons on children but we overlook how many more chidlren and women have been butchered by USA forces.  100 to one ratio of US killed to Assad's chemical strike.  Trump never mentions that as he lies to his ignorant voters.
Absolute power does what?  Refresher: corrupts, absolutely. Piercy and Co. may not truly be corrupt, but that means their incompetence, lack of reasoning, and gullibility are truly gargantuan.  What's amazing is the hubris of the Council. Zelenka, a perfect example: he keeps hammering for his ridiculous green build even though years and years of data show the savings are dependent on energy costs frozen in the studies and that the projected fiscal savings may never arrive because of the cost difference between restoration and new-build. What's truly astounding, though, is a supposedly green "authority" pitching a building that appears largely to be walls of glass. This is like the retired guy building a 5,000 sq ft home for him and his wife, alone, but it is LEED! Another great one is the 99-lb. woman driving a 5000 pound hybrid pickup truck; grocery store, bridge games, golf club--- yup, she needs all that weight and size!
What people don't understand is that he said that as a trap for Crooked Hillery Rotten Clinton to dive into head first and of course she did.  Why would she be the least bit concerned if her yoga and wedding plans emails were exposed to the public view?  But she is very worried that they will release the ones she tried to dump and hide from the investigators which she had long said didn't contain any state secrets in them.  She also claims to be the first women selected as a Presidential candidate in our history but a county in Ohio has a plague from their state's historical society stating that a resident of that county was indeed the nominee of a political party due to her life long activism for women's rights.  Look it up on a google search.  That bitch just cannot tell the truth about anything and you think she will keep up safe and allow us to prosper.  Your a fool!  Also Alaska is home to an ISIS training base why don't the paper investigate that?
This woman is Bat feces CRAZY!  Thank GOD she is nowhere near the nuclear codes!
3rd wave feminist nonsense.
Mr. Johnson,  Rarely are there witnesses to sexual assault. The perps oftem claim that the SEX was consensual. Sexual Assault perps generally only as much force as necessary to get what they want. Sometimes they don't even get DNA evidence.   I was not there (trial) but it!s my experience in similar cases that there had to be more physical evidence that was brought up into the cases. Jury's take their responsibility very deeply.   I don't know if you know what it is like to go through a sexual assault exam but I can tell you it is NOT pleasant. Nor is the interrogation, where police officers ask all sorts of questions. Then you have friends, family and sometimes your class mates or co-workers who look at you differently or question you and blame you for what happened.  Not something that many women or men want to have happen.  My guess, and that is what it is, something important and was brought to the court to question if the error made is something the communities want to see.
im not a lawyer i dont know if a comment is civil or not. i think you dont know what civil means. and that woman looks like she was born under a rock.
If gender were replaced by race in this clueless memo, there would be no discussion over his firing.   Explaining why another race is not "biologically" equipped to work at Google would be outrageous, sadly people on this comment board are defending a memo stating just such a thing about women.  How does this memo make women working at Google feel?  By writing such a stupid memo, this man, ironically, reveals himself not fit to work at Google.
Giving women control over their bodies could only be described as you did here by a complete idiot.
We're paying this fine specimen of humanity $9000.00/month to be a POS and beat on his woman!!?? What an a#$%hole
I find there's a certain dark comedy in that subset of sorry white males* who hold libertarian and/or 'survival of the fittest' beliefs while simultaneously angrily blaming their lack of success on those nasty females, queers, colored folk.  * not necessarily referring to you, BrfY. I'm much too polite to do that.
ericnorstog,   IF, and I say IF,  I was God, and when you come before me for final judgement,  I would cut off your dick, and if you are a woman, I would stitch up your pusey.
In addition to arguing a point I didn't make (people who stay in challenging marriages are losers)you also come up the euphemism of the year referring to the Clinton marriage as challenging.  I made a simple point about the relative good looks of the women each of these scumbags chose. Disagree with my taste or call me a chauvinist but please don't try to take the moral high ground with Bubba as your leader.
How did you know I was talking about grabbing women's pussies? Why you must have heard your master bragging about it on audio. And you still voted for him.  Excuse me while I go wash my hands. With bleach.
Disgusting, primitive, grubby thieves the lot of them. #Zumamustrotinjail  Time for the (few) good men and women left in the ANC to form a new party and leave the criminal syndicate they currently find themselves in. "ANC" is just a name. The ANC of Mandela, Sisulu, Tambo, Gordhan, can be recreated in a different guise, guys! Just pack up and leave the syndicate.
“We are not going to be treated that way, and we will wear our pussies, as it were, on our head,”  “One thing I like is taking back that word. He wants ‘pussies’? We’ll send a million of them to the National Mall for him,”   As I recall it wasn't all that long ago the Register Guard was reporting that women on the U/O campus were [perhaps still are], referencing a kind of "Rape Culture"?   Way to go ‘Pussyhat Project’  [or is it Code Pink?] either way doesn't matter you just threw respect for women from others [noting the "Rape Culture" protest]   under the bus.
We have to have different Oscars .One for women,one for black ,one for Latinos ,one for gays. Everybody are happy
A Hamas sympathizer, truly pathetic. Hamas doesn't want peace, they reward the families of rabid terrorists who stab pregnant women in grocery stores. Interesting how the left jumps on the anti-Israel bandwagon despite the fact Israel is an island of ingenuity and progress surrounded by regressive zealots who murder homosexuals through summary executions in the streets. Gaza is run by unapologetic fanatics and the left's silence is deafening - it's inexcusable ignorance. Tell me Dante, I missed the pride parade in Gaza this year (and last year, etc.), I suppose the BDS calls that cultural relativism? Talk about shameless.
The rethuglicans have an unnatural fixation on their wives and mother's genitalia. What, you say? WHAT? They are female. We are the females. You are the males. How is it your authority to make laws about our bodies, when we make no laws for your bodies. Pedophilia should be punished by castration. Why are you not calling for that? Cuz you want more children to prey on? Where is your outrage at that, males? You do nothing when your priests, pastors, friends, and donors defile children. NOTHING! They are out walking the streets, teaching, and in our own government! WHY is abortion your only talking point? When will castration be discussed out loud and in your face for those men who rape women and our children? Is it any wonder abortions exist? Who the hell wants to raise a child as a ward of YOUR state? Ask yourselves. You high and mighty men are mice. You get scared to death when you can't get it up. Call me a Fembot, if you'd like, but I can't say on here what I really call you.
I can assure you, I hate Hillary / Dems more than all of you obsessively absorbed tunnel visionists combined, and the mere thot of a fully qualified / vetted woman with comparatively minor email issues becoming President truly terrified me as well..., but do your ill gotten happy dances while you can, it certainly won't be long, and be sure to check back in a year so we can review to see how much massively destructive Trump / rethuglican guilt and blame you and fellow ilksters try to dump on Obama / Dems, k?   The rest of the typically bizarre conboi drivel espoused here isn't worth my time to reply.
Good - I am glad you feel that way, but your hypocrisy is clearly showcased by you telling Ed he needs to "mind his own damned business" and needs to "keep his nose out of his neighbors garden". And he wasn't even making a statement on abortion Eric, but since you bring the matter up we are 100% in favor of a woman's right to choose, as long as it does not interfere with the babies right to live.
What a disgusting, hateful old woman.  Someone who deals in lies meant to divide us should never be given a platform to speak.
Hillary's a ball sack..STFU already and die, if their is a god above he will strike this evil woman down in her tracks...
The fat lady is warming up.
The Portuguese didn't marry the Africans. They exploited them sexually. There is a large difference. In fact, the caste system in Latin America is based on the amount of European blood one has.  Trinidadian Indians married Africans. Many West Indian cricket players show that.  Habshis, who came to India from Africa, intermarried local women. Malik Ambar, the Prime Minister and general of a Deccan state, who resisted the Mughals successfully (and inspired Shivaji) was one such example of a Habshi.  And as I reiterated earlier, one of the causes of the Bangladesh civil war, outside language, was the discrimination against the darker skinned Bengalis by the lighter skinned Punjabi/Pathan rulers of West Pakistan.  The slave trade from Africa, by the Arabs existed till a couple of hundred years ago.  The Gini coefficient in China is higher than India's.  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2172rank.html  And the murder rate in Pakistan is higher than India.
Apparently my visceral reaction to this guano was not considered civil. Whatever. Hard to figure out what that means in respect to a "man" who refers to a woman as a "hole".
This is Trumps base , the pile of shit that the Republicans are scared of pissing off . They arent the ones the Repubs should worry about . What happened to the woman in this story ... the ones making threats are Trump birth defects  http://www.rawstory.com/2017/07/i-was-offered-a-22-bullet-mom-who-shared-sons-surgery-bill-online-got-deluge-of-death-threats/#.WV_oCjJb7uw.twitter
Yep! Criticize a black, gay, Jew , male, female, immigrant, certain illegal immigrant and you are racist, sexist, homaphobic, anti Semitic, xenophobic. I apologize if I missed someone.
The article mentions that the bomb was placed on the side of the church used by women.  Mighty brave of these Islamic terrorists to target Christian women. Mighty brave of them.
I can understand why clergy fight so hard on this issue. Conceding to real natural law means that papally-approved natural law assured to be error free would fall. In this case, the natural order would be shredded as well as a concept (no more Catholic relativism). Finally, it would lead to the rethinking of everything sexual from masturbation to pre-marital sex, to continence and celibacy (both) to what they fear most - female ordination and parish elections for deacon administrators and elected bishops. They have finessed Masturbation and turn mostly a blind eye to cohabitation, but unless they start quietly blessing gay marriages (which Catholic hospitals now honor), they are about to eat a big bite of humble pie regarding the state of doctrinal formation. What are all the weak of faith who mistake certainty for trust in God to do?
As a cabbie once put it, "another woman trying to be a man"
Explain why you still beat your wife and kids?
What Happened?  well, what happened is that a sleazy, crooked and nasty woman (and her sexual predator husband) with all their money and corrupt practices were still unable to get her the Presidency. Good riddance to bad rubbish.
Gender inequality in the Canadian economy remains highly visible. Women are paid less than men in 469 out of 500 occupations monitored. -—---------------------------------2-  Complete garbage. In the same position women earn exactly the same amount of money as men. This distorted stat emanates from the fact that men tend to occupy more senior executive positions. Nothing is stopping the female gender from pursuing senior executive positions other than their personal choice to have children and not return to work after their maturity leave.  Many return, others, BY CHOICE, stay at home or find other positions that are more flexible for a young mother.    There is literally nothing more to it.
NO thanks.  I don't need to trade a sexist woman hating bishop for a racist hating bishop.  Both would be terrible popes or bishops or priests or Christians. Either bad choice should make anyone who is not misogynistic or racist explode and demand another Pope for the equal sake of human dignity of all members of our church.
Jackie:  actually you should read the coverage of the case and the police report on the incident. Your "reading" is really quite mistaken.  You're spinning this to be a racist motivated incident.  You state "white chick gets drunk, has consensual sex with black kids"  Two issues here: a) the young woman involved was not a "white chick".  She was AfricanAmerican. b) ", has consensual sex with black kids".  This, of course, is the central issue of the incident.  The young woman claims the sex was NOT consensual...the young men claim it WAS consensual.  .......a classic "she said, he said" incident.  ADGardner determined the woman would not be a credible witness and, therefore, decided to not prosecute the case.  The coach, the AD department, and then the University administration each instituted disciplinary actions based on, first, athletic code of behavior, and, then, the University disciplinary code.  All the info is readily available.  Read it and educate yourself.  Gary Crum
Yah whatever. I’ll be impressed when women there are allowed to walk into public wearing nothing but a dress and shoes without having to fear a beating by their infamous religious police.
Arguably, based on the Catholic definition of sin, the answer is that voting for a particular politician could be a sin.  II. THE DEFINITION OF SIN 1849 Sin is an offense against reason, truth, and right conscience; it is failure in genuine love for God and neighbor caused by a perverse attachment to certain goods. It wounds the nature of man and injures human solidarity. It has been defined as "an utterance, a deed, or a desire contrary to the eternal law."121  Equally arguably, depending on your own values and beliefs on reason, truth and right conscience,  voting for Mr Trump, Secretary Clinton or Mr Duke, could be a sin.  The decision this year is between a boorish undisciplined man with frat house language, and a lying woman  whose documented actions are far worse than anything anyone has said.  Which vote is actually a mortal sin won't be known by us until we are discussing with St Peter what we did on Earth to justify getting into Heaven.
This is an insult to all immigrants who took the time, trouble and spent the money to become legal citizens.     There was an article about tours in China which would bring over pregnant women to the U.S. so they could give birth in the U.S.  The tour companies were advised to enter the U.S. through Hawaii because we were easy to get through.  I guess word gets around that people in Hawaii have lots of Aloha, but we're stupid.  Our useless congressional delegation, just made that point even clearer.
I guess we'll see that when  we see white males protesting when one of their own rapes a woman or child, shoots up a theatre, church, school, mosque, etc. You know? Those things which happen DAILY?  I mean, it's just right, right?
What the Democrat Party does best:  Panders to the poor to get their votes, gives them handouts, and keeps them poor so they can get their votes.  Creates bills for taxpayers--government salaries. Tells Black people they are too stupid to succeed by their own initiative and need special privileges to get ahead because their great-grandparents were slaves, or not.  Although Black people and others are smart enough to get a photo ID to claim their freebies or fly, they are presumed too stupid to get a photo ID to vote.   Tells people we must do things "for the keiki" and future generations while paying for abortions that kill the keiki/next generation.  Tells women they can do what they want with their own bodies but they are too stupid to keep their legs together and thereby deny admission to a penis. Democrats think those who vote for them are stupid, and the party likes it that way.  Heaven forbid Democrat voters should start thinking for themselves.
You are wrong. Hating white men (and women) is a sign of social justice. Please apologize for being a racist denying the right of the non-white to hate you
Many people on this site, no doubt, voted for Bill Clinton as President, and still think he is wonderful, and he did abuse women, why the double standard with Trump?
According to the order, the US “should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred including “honor” killings, and other forms of violence against women.”  In Russia, women’s safety is also under attack when the Parliament just voted 380-3 to decriminalize domestic violence in cases where the perpetrator does not cause “substantial bodily harm” and does not attack the victim more than once a year.   Do you think this hypocrisy came up today when Trump and Putin had their phone call?
What an ignorant comment would you be happy if some guys open your daughters cadaver to "admire" her genitals?
The Longmont Chamber of Commerce is no doubt cringing, between this clown and the "good woman with a gun" saving the town from the squirrel threat. (See adjacent Article.)
Chances are she won't even know if a former man is in the ladies room. I worked with a man who had been a woman for three months and NEVER had a suspicion until someone told me after he had moved away. Also, a friend of mine was born a man and is now a woman and …………. well, she has boobs. That said, you would probably look pretty silly beating up a woman in a woman's rest room.
Are you delusional?? forgive me but when did President Trump ADVOCATE SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN?  Do really think that Americans would Vote for someone WHO ADVOCATES SEXUAL VIOLENCE?
I get the point of the editorial, but for me, I fear I cannot find much to be exited about in the church anymore.  There are SO many places where serious, and absolutely fundamental work on the church itself is needed.  ANY of those areas (women, homosexuality, etc.) could in and of themselves be considered a major problem.  But for me, I continue to see the scandal as that point of entrance/departure.    In the US, many places have "sexual predator" laws, that  place limits on where a sexual predator can live, and that require (depending on where you live) varying degrees of notice.  I understand the need to offer compassion and support to these kinds of people, and see good in doing just that.  But at the same time, they are not likely the first people I consider inviting to dinner, a backyard BBQ, or my everyday life.  I can imagine a predator who might also be a wonderful artist, or have great skills in some area.  That doesn't erase the problem.  Same with the church...
Evidently you hold Ms. Swift in disdain. Would that you and the others that have jeered her could find her strength and courage. Then perhaps you would see a young woman that was groped in a sexual assault, and who responded very appropriately. Her attacker suffered consequences. (Awww....) then he mustered up the idea he could get money from her. He and his lawyer misjudged Ms. Swift. She is stronger and smarter. Meuller made an even bigger fool of himself. Ms. Swift has earned a lot of respect for her effort to resist and fight back.
I seem to recall a bunch of Hillary's emails that were un-deleted, and shared on Wikileaks, right before the Democrat convention. Much of what's in her emails supports the assertions that the Dems, Barry Hussein, and Hillary are as corrupt as can be, and then some. I especially liked the new batch from earlier this week from George Soros, giving Hillary her marching orders for Kosovo, back when she was the Secretary of State. That was definitely a very nice touch. Can't wait to see what comes out this week. Call it morbid fascination. This whole argument is pretty silly. People are all torqued out of place because Trump shoots his mouth off, meanwhile people associated with Hillary are dying like houseflies in winter. Do I like it when Trump says insenstive things? I really don't care. Do I like it when he shoots off his mouth and is wrong? Certainly. Trump talks trash, Hillary will get you killed. Hillary covered up Bills abuse of women, including rape, for decades. ETC.
Women are trying to be the men and the men..well they have to the be women. Feminism is a fad and eventually it will die out but until then these millennials are some sad puppies in socialigical-experiement gone mad.  :  Women are told to reject men, reject being a mother, a wife, a nurturer then even reject sex because you know, men are rapists. And now they must compete with them men at everything. This is no communist love-in, it is pure 3rd reich capitalism - work will set you free! But will it make you happy?  :  The guys, what do they need to do anything for, who are they working to impress, to provide for, to be the man of the what house? Are they suppose to be the protector of women or in competition with them?
Typical liberal two faced tools. If they can't have their own way call everyone racist, woman. haters any yellow lie. 2019, these tools are gone. I'd surrender to Trumps US. than live with cowardly snowflakes who lie constantly.
'Women' who should be at home cooking dinner for their husbands.
I agree - the sooner the sexually focused frustrated confused male can get his hands on his masturbation toy, the females will be able to breathe a sigh of relief.  Unfortunately, most of the males can't think with both their brains simultaneously and thus perpetuate the spreading of STDs, rape and divorce suits.
Your "family of faith (whatever that means}" prevented a pathological liar, thief, and proponent of infanticide and homosexual marriage from ascending to the highest secular office on the planet. The Donald is far from ideal, but he is exponentially better than the woman who slandered the victims of her adulterous husband's deviancy.
Denouncing hatred is not a brave moral stand, it's a sentiment.  There's nothing morally serious here.  A totalitarian political ideology is professed by hundreds of millions of people globally.  But this naive woman believes the appropriate corrective to mistrust of Muslims is to pretend it isn't happening..   Wente's treats religion as a quaint anachronism.  These precepts which have been carried out for over a thousand years are inextricable from their eschatology.  That law cannot be domesticated by an ape or a pig.  I think we all agree you "have no idea how this will work out",   but this culpable ignorance is damnable Margaret Wente. Your ilk will be cursed and despised in the agonies of coming generations,.  The More innocent "neither does anybody else" does not extend to hundreds of Millions of Muslims nor to me.    I am not Mohammed who would drag you kicking and screaming into paradise.  I would be content for you to choose damnation.  I am but the warner you fool.
So assuming the suspect is like the victim, around 18 and female, what goes through the head moments before doing something stupid like this? "Gee, I've had enough of not being incarcerated, let's get behind bars for life I'm bored."
"...the day of the massive Women's March on Washington — was a heartening day..." YES! YES! pray God it is a sign that women of the world have had enough of male ignorance and over-reach. May women's determination persevere in confronting the insane religion and politics of exploitation and pretense in the face of Mother God! The future of life on Earth depends on deep-root female sanity!!!
"This is a human decency issue."  It sure is, so please explain to me why Casinos are up and running while large parts of the Island are without electricity or running water? That's certainly not appropriate for Women, children and elderly who are starving and suffering, now is it? Priorities are all out of whack, even after the Island has been destroyed. It's ridiculous, as well as unbelievable.
I should have gone to Wendy's today!  all the hypocritical, nasty feminists were busy actually doing something!
Traditional Europe changing to Eurabia has just been accelerated dramatically by an incompetent woman in way over her head as Chancellor of Germany.  She has flooded her country with hundreds of thousands of illiterate Muslim men who are hard core unemployable and will never assimilate,
"Pretty much everything LfS2 writes is either drivel or meaningless."   Sounds pretty personal to me.  I've heard 'drivel' from folks that are professional writers.    The future is unknown and a change of events can alter our expectations very quickly.    Did living through 9/10  prepare us for 9/11?   I think not, yet it was an event that shaped at least 16 years of our foreign policy.  We can't change the past or forecast the future perfectly.    This is an opinion site and not a crystal ball.  There's plenty of room for interesting speculation.  I don't know where the  Republican party is headed, but like you, I think the Trump influence will end when he loses the election.    What survives from that  party is beyond me.    Legal abortion is at it's highest level of support ever.   Women's power in our culture has been on an upward trajectory for at least 4-5 decades.     LFS isn't making you angry, you're usually angry when you write.   Where's that coming from?  Carry On!
Because castration doesn't remove his ability to rape more women.  Castration is the removal of the testicles, not the penis.
I guess you are talking about the beheadings of infidels in the Koran?  Or maybe how raping women who aren't muslin isn't rape it is 'war spoils'?  Or maybe you are talking about how if you leave Islam you should be killed.  This isn't radical Islam, this is straight out of the Koran.  How the left thinks they can demonize Christianity and defend Islam at every turn is hypocritical and dangerous.
The Nazis showed up ready for battle with helmets, shields, clubs, and even firearms.  It was a Nazi who killed that woman and injured more and a score of other people.  Stop making excuses for these racists.
No I am not in favour of that but unfortunately and tragically numerous women in Canada and the US are gang raped by white Christian men but we are not about to make sweeping generalizations about all white Christian men bases on the terrible behaviour of a few.
MJ, you are absolutely a useful idiot, heres how, Donald J. Trump is a liar, no one not even you can deny that. Donald J. Trump has cheated thousands of Americans out of their hard earned money not only by his multiple bankruptcies, but by his FAKE university. He is a serial adulterer and a serial sexual predator of women. Mr Trump, does not speak to me or any one " directly" he uses a tax payer funded liar spokes person to do that and twitter which I do not have. Mr Trump IS the epitome of the ruling elite, what do you and he, have in common? Finally the PEOPLE did not elect him, the Electoral college did. More people voted for someone OTHER than he, I am one of them.
Yeah, you represent Muslims well, Minshall. Not. But then again, maybe your caustic, superior demeanor is pretty typical of Muslims. Muslim MEN, anyway. The women have to be more careful lest they trod on some sexist Muslim law regarding what women are allowed to do or say or not do or say.
Garrison Keillor, you are a hypocrite. You condemn cruelty yet you senselessly heap cruelty upon the masses. You expect tolerance yet you cannot tolerate those who are different. You detest judgment yet you blatantly stereotype others. There is no logic in what you write. You are simply encouraging division which you so passionately say you detest. Stop insulting those who do not want women to kill the children in their womb. Stop belittling those who support legal immigration by not encouraging illegal immigration. Stop erasing the progress we have made with reducing racism by purposely encouraging racial revenge. Stop confusing people about their gender identity under the guise of racism. Stop discouraging unpatriotic behaviors. Stop 🤔 and think about what you are doing.
I am sad for the victims that the wretched women did not receive more prison time.
So you think that sexist pigs like women?
Mr. Hobson is mocking Burke's hypocrisy with this.  Burke is so upset that Amoris Laetitia allows a few remarried people to receive Communion without an annulment; these people tend to be the most innocent people in the divorce.  The classic case is the abused and abandoned woman who remarries and finds happiness but cannot get an annulment for a myriad of reasons.  Burke wants to deny such a hypothetical woman Communion without examining the particulars of the case, but he is totally okay with aligning himself with a thrice married Catholic who is alleged to have abused at least one ex because he serves Burke's odious political purposes.   And while I am generally against Catholic priests denying politicians Communion for political judgments, I think Bannon's case is one of the rare cases where Canon 915 does apply.  The man is clearly a racist demagogue who is using his position to spread hate.  It is scandalous for him to receive Communion.
Your comment smacks of your ignorance of the inequality women HERE still experience. And your utter indifference to this fact. Your type of 'argument' is called a "biased sample" and is absolutely worthless.
It sounds more like you are projecting your biases and ideology onto others. Clearly, your post showed a lack of understanding American culture these days. Your assertion is not a fact at all. For some silly reason, we idolize dullards like the Kardashians who are rich white women you think we vilify.
This is deplorable, and the same people who oppose abortion also oppose contraception and women's reproductive health services. This is Texas, after all - Hang 'em, and hang 'em high!
When have you ever heard President Trump advocate sexual violence? You are fake news. How about black lives matter chanting "what do we want dead cops when do we want it NOW" hows that for the left wing hate speech. Another question what was the March about? do you know the the president can not stop abortion? that's up to the supreme court! If you are really interested in helping womens causes why don't you march at the Saudi embassy. They seem to have a very low view on women!
Amazingly the media has not emphasized the obvious hypocrisy.  The USA has killed thousands of innocent women and children since 2001 in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.  Moreover, we have never agreed to the bans on most chemical weapons ourselves.  Don't get taken on this one guys.  Trump is as phony and as inconsistent as they come.
Outsider77 : Yes...exactly.  How would you feel if you encountered a mean, 'heavy', ignorant  woman and said to a bystander, "OMG! What a stupid, fat, pig."  Then you read the next day: "Outsider77 Calls All Women Stupid Pigs".  Trump NEVER said that...nor did he Ever Call ALL Mexicans "drug smugglers,  rapists and Murderers".
Typical libtard drivel from a man who has his head up is the DNC's backside and is all too willing to comment against the POTUS knowing very well that he doesn't all the facts. His desire to trash our President is just a knee jerk reaction bent on scurrying favor from a soulless group of Hollywood elites who defense pedophilia, sexual abuse and human trafficking. Tom is part of the old Hollywood and sooner or later his bubble is gonna get busted when someone tells the story of his sexual abuses against women in his industry.
Clinton is an embarrassment to all women of honor and integrity.
Regardless of whatever psychological illness you are submitting I posses (while in the very next breath stating "you do not know me" -> love the delusions of grandeur)...I wonder if you are also going to claim that I cannot read.  Because I do take the time to read your diatribes, no matter how disgusting they are, against women.  You never miss an opportunity on articles like this to demean women and support predators.  And pretty sure I don't need someone who hates humanity as much as you to start lecturing on treating everyone equally etc.  The hatred for women is so ingrained...that in your world "equality" actually means devaluing women and the people who don't share your hatred/devaluing of half the population are close minded and have "psychological illnesses"
Now the Young American Terrorist are trying to take out our innocent beautiful young American women...When will this stop, are the politicians and judges going to do something about this??? Trump needs to stop distracting us with the Islamic threat and focus on the American threat to us, these American Terrorist are harming and killing Americans daily...#MAGA
Yes, it was a good day.  But he's 69 years old and was able to predate all the years he was at Fox, and probably for years before then.  I can just hear the Trump Bunnies now "Oh, that was just locker room talk and behavior." Right. Out of the locker room. In a professional setting, only involving women. And it was more than just "talk," just as if an unidentified person calls you at home and starts saying filthy things he wants to do to you.  That happened to my sister years ago. It was devasting to her.  Picture how you'd feel if he did it to your mom, your sister, your unsuspecting daughter or grand daughter.   We already know how the animals that do this kind thing feel; they brag about it often enough. Heck, some people even voted a sexual predator into the White House. A man who predictably came out and publically defended his fellow predator.  Repugnant.   So no, O'Liely's behavior wasn't "just" talk of any kind. It was a series of sexual assaults, violations and verbal rape.
"Terroristic threats"?  Come on folks, this woman has mental health issues or addiction issues.  Let's not put her in Bin Laden's shoes.  We have two presidents threatening to rain nuclear hell on each other.  Now those are threats of terror.
How many of you who knows what happens during a fire investigation, pls raise their hands? How dare you question the fire investigator, who has many years of experience? Do you think he has "STUPID" on his forehead?  Cut the guy some slack. He cannot go blurting out all kinds of accusations. If you think you can do better then you go apply for the job.  As for the woman that occupied that apartment, maybe her lawyer told her to keep her clap shout
Transgender identity is a mental illness.  So to be fair and inclusive, there should be three bathrooms: male, female and mentally ill.
The person that gave her permission to make such a ridiculous statement should be fired. Maybe not, perhaps it is the parity minister that needs to be fired. Sad times for Canada with this failing government of women, and the PM who fears and hates men.
congrats, but old story, stop writing the same damn thing.  get out there and report on other stories.  geez, isn't there other players on the team or other teams that are doing just as good as she is? enough!! i love what she has accomplished, but there are others on the team and there are countless other all around the island who also deserve some recognition.  give other their due!! would you be writing so many articles if a male was to join the female volleyball or cheer squad and excel!! i don't think so, why? because there was many males who contributed to a all female cheer squad but we never get to hear their story, but oh wow when there is a female who breaks into male sports we have to endure weeks of the same ole story, come on be fair to others out there, they all work their butts off male and female.
When Gretchen Carlson and Megan Kelly and a dozen others accused Roger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly, and Eric Bolling of sexual harassment, we learned that for decades it was an open secret at Fox News that they were predators.  The sanctimonious right kept quiet.  Even when these whales were harpooned, they stayed silent.   When an anti-abortion Republican congressman was caught demanding his mistress have an abortion, Caldera was dumb as a post.  When Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was accused of sexually abusing 3 underage male students, Caldera was dumb as a post. When Trump was accused by 17 women of sexual harassment during the campaign and bragged that because he was rich, he was entitled to sexual assault any woman he wanted, Caldera was dumb as a post.  Could it be that Caldera and the right have a double standard on acceptance of sexual harassment?
No one cares about this trailer trash race ....Men and women die everyday for OUR freedom and you Dbags are talking about a bunch of tools on snowmachines ....OMG so gangster
"We will arrest the dogs who kill our women‚ Mbalula tells victim's mother" (TimesLive).....  ....but we will reward those who slap our women...after all, they are our Minstrels.......
Hypocritical oath actually. He lied plain and simple..But then again people, especially women voted for him because of his hair and bad boy image. You got what you deserved.
It was only a matter of time.  I'm not blaming the women for the husbands' infidelities.  But I am questioning why a woman would allow a man to do that to her.   Fair question that has been asked my many, I'm just dumb enough to ask it for others to read.  And earn you poor judgment award.  It's always the idiot that questions the obvious.
Wow, all these girls like a lady that accepts money from radical Muslim countries that treat women like slaves. My guess all the news they get is from their teachers in school and they don't read things themselves. Granted Trump is no saint, but to vote for a woman that defends rapist including her husband is deeming to themselves.
Marxism and feminism have ruined society.
Your attitude toward Protestants is ridiculous.  Or do you think that the Holy Spirit ONLY guides the Catholic church and NEVER Protestants?  Christ want ALL to be ONE---therefore the Holy Spirit can guide Protestants, or anybody else who wishes to do God's Holy Will. Looking at these young women, who are willing to serve God's people, God is guiding them.  God is not S L O W in operating to meet the people's spiritual needs, but the Catholic Hierarchy IS.
a story about a woman who was too lazy to search google about a common lawn problem but has the time and energy to write a banal story in a national paper about it. i certainly hope no trees were cut to publish this garbage.
Your pathetic false equivalence is breathtaking.  Whatever President Trump's faults are they do not include murdering close relatives with VX nerve gas or anti-aircraft guns, running a totalitarian, racist, fascist state with no free elections, completely controlling all speech, press and assembly, drafting all men and women, running slave labor camps, gratuitously murdering three generations of a person he does not like's family, engaging in: counterfeiting, kidnapping, human trafficking, illegal drug and weapons trade, money laundering, insurance fraud, and terrorism.  You belong in Pyongyang.  It would serve you right.
Seriously ? She must be referring to the snowflakes? Intelligent women equipped with common sense & the ability to see through bullcrap.,.. DID NOT VOTE for Ms Clinton !!!! Ms Clinton SCREWED HERSELF by her own words & behaviors. She is only validating the decision was the right one, (not to vote 4 her) by her childish behavior & her inability to admit her mistakes !!!!  Grow up you spoiled brat...AKA .... Ms Clinton
This is a silly article. The long-standing dress code is for "appropriate" wear. If I look up the word appropriate in the dictionary, I don't see with sleeves as the definition.  Instead, I see "suitable or proper in the circumstances."  Which allows for the code to change as times change.  (Get it?  What is appropriate in 1917 will be different from what's appropriate in 2017). When you see the president's daughter showing up at meetings sleeveless, the first lady greeting foreign leaders sleeveless, it means that sleeveless might actually be appropriate or proper in the circumstances today. But, instead of consulting with current fashion experts or even--gasp--women, the Speaker has decided to define appropriate himself. Because that's the way the GOP rolls. Remember when 13 men when into a room to decide on healthcare?
All these protests stem from Kaepernick's stand against police brutality, white police officers against black. Google a list of fallen police officers, google how many have died at the hands of others, to include black assailants. Tell me there isn't a great disparity between the two lists, one more honorable than the other. Our own Celena Hollis of the DPD, a black female police officer of Denver was gunned down by a black assailant. Is she, a fellow community member on any of these football players lists of protest. She was in a park giving security to everyone, race exclusive and was shot at for no other reason that she was a cop. Keep this in mind when you see a player kneel, our police deserve it.
Another Horrible G&M article based on Toronto, Sexism, Feminism and the evil white male . If you added some anti-trump rhetoric you would of had a Globe and Mail daily all in one article.
Look at the picture at the top of this article.  Two women barely out of puberty that have no clue what they are protesting about.  The only pre-existing condition they have is stupidity.
send all the useless mouths back home, put women back to work raising high IQ white children stop the jews from robbing us and problem solved
Yes, their friend. Who actively was involved in setting up their arrests. For the reward money. Which makes her no different than the kids who knew and did nothing for weeks. Worse in the mind of their circle of "Friends" because she "Ratted" for money.  I was attempting to articulate Gin's mother, grandmother seems like involved, caring, respectful women. They are trying desperately to guide Gin into a positive future.  This girl though, she is playing stupid games. She certainly is going to win all the stupid prizes too.
It's kinda of like the idiotic "war on women" that they fabricated to use against Romney. Sadly, a lot of people bought that one also.
Yes, feminism does affect all of society.   Feminists continue to push for erosion of basic due process where crimes against women are concerned and lobby against punishments for the many women who make false accusations.    They continue to lobby for laws continuing the antiquated custom of alimony in divorce and biased maternal preference for custody - that might account for mothers being the primary perpetrators of child murder and child abuse.  Women's groups continue to push for board quotas to focus on gender rather than qualifications  - a potential disaster in the making that degrades the achievements of women who really focus on their careers.
Hillary is a mockery to the institution of motherhood, and to the institution of marriage.  She enabled her husband to use and abuse other women and then conspired to destroy the lives of the women.  There is very little respect for Hillary in the world.  Hillary is responsible for the debacle in Libya,  accomplished nothing while the Senator from New York, or the first lady of Arkansas.  She tries to claim Pennsylvania, Illinois, Arkansas, New York as her home when out campaigning.  She handled classified emails and documents like dirty tissues at the bottom of her purse.  She's a disgrace.
Nope - if you had actually paid attention I wouldn't be asked this... And I know MANY women that have NO issue with the way things are today, they work hard, achieve their goals and are happy... Hard work DOES pay off... NOT everything is equal yet, may never be - remember HILLARY paid her female staffers less than the men.. NO i am not going to find the link for that... Hillary is blaming everyone BUT HER OWN STUPIDITY for Trump winning..   Trump is the president, we can argue for the next four years makes no difference. Obama proved to be a failure, it's Trumps turn to show what he is really made of..
??? Really? Women have been enjoying their own sex robots for almost a century, and they axed everything but the genitalia.  So I don't see how Modern Feminists can make any demands when they've been doing this for a long time.
Fake News! The GM does not mention that it is mostly men who are overdosing not women. If it was women they would  put it in a huge head line. Men are overdosing become of the  culture of shaming.  :  https://youtu.be/5q2tZa1gp8Q
Victoria Leon Guerrero is a stupid white girl who pretends to be a native Chamorro.  She also pretends to hold a PHD, when, in reality, she has a terminal masters degree and will never have a PHD.  Stop playing Dr. Chamorro and go back to being stupid white girl.
As a life-long Democrat who voted Republican for the first time in 2010 (Yes, I voted for Obama's first term!), let me tell you my perspective of what I've learned since Trump's election:  - Democrats are the biggest  dividers of this country, using race, sex, sexuality, religion, immigration, and political correctness as tools to lure voters.  Donald Trump's most racist, misogynist act was that he was a White male who won the Presidency following a Black President, and he beat a woman.  Democrats are sore because they believed that they could win elections based on identity (race, sex) without substance. - Establishment Republicans (now on the way out) like Flake, are no better than Democrats, legislators becoming fat and rich by taking taxpayer money, selling out the country, and throwing crumbs to their voters.  That's just a start of what I've recognized.
Dick, you're being deliberately obtuse. Christians = Muslims. Same control over women.
Trump is a “businessman”, but a lousy one. If he hadn’t been born to money, he wouldn’t have any. Sure: Trump has employed a lot of people, including a lot of women.  He probably even employed some women whom he didn’t grope; he says that some women are not attractive enough to merit a grope by “The Donald.” But for Trump, people are merely a means to an end -- disposable when they no longer advance the end for which he is using them: the personal aggrandizement of Donald J. Trump. Thousands of people lost their jobs and livelihoods in his several bankruptcies, while he stiffed the small businesses, contractors and their workers who worked for him in the naive expectation that he would pay them what he owed them; Trump never missed a meal or an hour’s sleep.  The Republicans could have nominated a decent human being with at least minimal qualifications for public office; they didn’t. They nominated instead an openly racist, defiantly fascist know-nothing boor.
Vincent Belanger-Mercure, so you were ENTERTAINED? You found the murder of a fine young woman to be entertaining? Well how about the next time you and your friends and family have a get together, someone comes along and drives their car into your group? Will you be as entertained? Will you get a kick out of seeing one of your loved ones die in front of your eyes? You are nothing more than an ignorant fool and a waste of oxygen.
That might be true but I keep remembering the stupid lady who put scalding hot coffee between her legs :) :) :)
If you read more carefully and without a partisan glint you will notice that she indicts the entire culture, meaning primarily males, for forcing her to adopt feminine ways and short skirts.  There is more here than your knee jerk impression.  But I cannot have this discussion because it will be lead to and be ended by appellation of the m-word as a substitute for meaningful discussion.
I once complained to VRC corporate because Victoria Secret had a sandwich board with teenage looking, half-dressed girls with porno looks on their faces. I had my daughter with me.  This is the US, a trashy, misogynistic nation by most standards, and now the objectification of young girls is mainstream. It's an important facet of the hatred of women program the Republicans have going. Look at the Republican candidate Trump. He's on record admitting to being turned on to a twelve-year-old Paris Hilton. He's been formally accused of raping an underage girl.  Trump and the Republican party represent this trash culture well. They subscribe to a sort of Madonna/whore version of femininity where women and girls' humanity is suppressed or obliterated and most importantly, women are objects for men's pleasure and ultimate disposal. Make no mistake, the Republican party kills women.
Thank you for that mr jpz. Indeed unless you've been in a cave of disinformation you would have been observing the idiotic insults that trump has been braying for decades now. This run most certainly wasn't his first run at the crown and he has made sure to always be in the limelight whether in campaign mode or not. Hells bells he spent five years bellowing about the tremendous evidence his investigators had turned up in Hawaii that proved President Obama was not a legitimate president. He was lying of course like he does so routinely that his followers have to keep moving forward under a cloud of fake/right wing news in order to deflect attention from that steady stream of lies and insults. The fact that all the women came forward with their descriptions of how trump had sexually assaulted them in the last couple of months coincided with his own descriptions of how he felt he had the right to barge into the dressing room of naked teenaged girls because he "owned" the pageant. A pig.
Trump should be impeached immediately by the Congress of the United States to demonstrate that the American Constitution, for which men and women have fought and died, can withstand a heinous moron from the world of reality television. How did this creature ever finagle his way into the presidency?  And this is happening in several countries - populism. BS!!!
It just amazes me that a person who has almost always owned his own private jet would all of a sudden decide to fly on a commercial airline and then grope a women in the crowded first class cabin. This crap that the media is coming out with has been fed to them by the Clinton campaign and all has been outed by the Wikileaks disclosures!  Believe them then bend over and kiss your butt goodbye since this country cannot survive a Clinton in the White House one more time.
And the rancid  stench from your  imposter past of impersonating a woman  for years renders every word that comes off your ignorant keyboard as alt-left flatulence, jjp58.  You stink and everyone in this forum smells it.  https://disqus.com/by/jamespierpont/
Trump's insults everyone; he believes we are so ignorant we'll believe anything he says and miss the contradictions.  He doesn't even bother with coherent speeches, he just mouths some words and listens to the cheers.  There must be a disconnect between the ears and brains of the women who hear The Donald's put-downs and swoon.  Or maybe they just think it applies to all other 'fat, ugly bimbos' and not themselves.
Allies are important for any marginalized community to have. I was a gay rights activist for 20 years, and some of our biggest allies came from other movements like the women's rights movement, anti-racism movement, labour movement and the peace movement. It's really great to now see corporations supporting us, as well as religious  groups and governments. Lots of straight people attend the Pride Parades to join us in celebration.  While much progress has been made over the decades, we should never forget that homophobia still exists in our society, and thee are still many people (albeit a small minority), who would take away our freedoms and rights if they ever had the chance. We must all be vigilant and confront homophobia where ever and when ever it rears its ugly head.
So fox just paid out $13 million for the heck of it? How many women came out when Aisles was accused? Fox own lawyers found them to be truthful. I love how repugs refuse to take responsibility for their actions. It's always a conspiracy when they get caught being pigs.
Mitch McConnell's hypocrisy and sexism is blatant.  Telling a women basically to 'Sit down and shut up!' when he subsequently allowed 4 males to read the exact same document is shameful. Shameful but - sadly - typical of the GOP.  First they stole a seat on the Supreme Court and now their misogyny shows them to be the grand old chauvinist party they've always been.  Disgusting!
She's an illegal immigrant and a felon -- 8 years here and still no English?  This woman clearly has no intent whatever to become an American or to assimilate into our culture.  There are plenty of honest, non-felons waiting in line to come here legally who DO want to assimilate.  She should be deported forthwith.
That one night stand you had 25 years ago, in fact you have forgotten about? She is about to become your worst nightmare. "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned." She is going to name you, ruin your career, brake up your marriage, bankrupt you, make public enemy number one, your face will addorn newspaper front pages, sympathy seekers will suddenly recall other things "connected" to uou dastardly deed. My advice to any man going on a date, take your lawyer with. Cosby and Hewitt was found guilty after detailed evidence by an unbiased court of law in accordance with millenium old legal principles. Furguson must also take her case to court. We cannot allow conviction by public opinion. Can you remember where you were 19 September 1993? If you cannot you in deep shit.
So your point is that this time period now , this era , the construct of masculinity is sexually assaulting women ? Garbage
Same here...  We had our roles (arrest me under Feminism 101 for providing), and they were different along gender divides - oh my, what a crime today.  These feminists will have a lot to answer for one day.  They think they are against the imagined patriarchy, but are really against families, children and husbands.  i hope they grow old and die by themselves for all the hardship they have caused so many, which such a toxic ideology to our families.
White women voted against Hillary because they have a brain! She is an embarrassment to our nation. How has she helped the women of the Middle East who are persecuted? She has given government money to those nations AND taken money from those nations to her family fraud, oh I mean foundation.
I am upset that the two Women pictured, both with positive identities and relevant platforms, were overshadowed by two old white men, who neither followed  the rules of the panel, nor had positive messages to contribute to the event..  Yes the headline was direct in stating the two men were "Two Cantankerous Old White Men" but did that need to be the headline in the first place?
The lack of credibility is evident with the ridiculous claim that women in the workplace get paid less than men for the same work. This is illegal in Canada as well as the U.S.A. There are myriad logical reasons why women on average earn less than men which eludes Mr. McGinn. After this pandering to the radical feminist groups who continue to spout this nonsense he goes on to spew anecdotal garbage based upon personal experience which any first year Sociology student (used to be taught) should never be used in research as it is biased.   Personally I feel men get shafted because Fathers Day is essentially another mothers day. Men I know get suckered into things they neither want to do or be dragged places they do not want to go. Perhaps if D. McGinn phrased the article as his feelings rather than some sort of fact as I have done above he would not come off as such an uneducated milque toast.
One-on-one with a strong woman...and the wanker wilted. Too bad she is a corporate war-hawk.
Yet she was not an advocate for the woman (and there were alot of them) who found the courage to come forward against her husband. Quite the opposite, she made it look like Bill was the victim. She had the now infamous "sluts and nuts" campaign against them.
If a person of one sex can self-identify as being of the opposite sex (transgender) with all the rights and privileges of that sex, why shouldn’t a person of one ethnicity or race be allowed to self-identify as being of another ethnicity or race with all the rights, privileges, and government handouts extended thereto?  The federal government doles out millions or billions of dollars annually to women and ethnic minorities to start or operate businesses, for education and who knows what else. If we must treat transgenders based on their self-identified sex, as liberals say and as some liberal judges have ruled, it seems to me that Caucasians like Rachel Dolezal should be eligible for federal grants and loans intended for minorities. That may seem silly, but so did it seem silly a few short years ago to allow people of one sex to use restrooms of the opposite sex based on sex identity instead of biology. .  What now is a slippery slope could quickly become a vertical cliff.
Maybe you should ask the women who are heads of state if the like being called cute. I think it's sexist bullshit to diminish a strong leader to simple cuteness. And Blacks see far less justice than police, which you must be able to see. So many stories in the past few years of trigger happy cops, afraid of someone just because they are black. Anyway, I'm done with you. Have a nice day.
Nor will trump ever apologize. He's too immature and petty to understand when he exhibits sociopathic behavior. Apparently, his parents never taught him how to be socially acceptable. He's one sick twist. The most offensive thing I ever heard Obama say was "jackass" when he described Kanye West's behavior to Taylor Swift. trump has mocked handicapped people, described grabbing women by the "p*ssy," mocked his opponent's wives, made up childish playground insult names for everyone who crosses him, and curses freely on national television. He's a boor. Why would we expect decency from him?
You know, you say the threat isn't about trans committing crimes yet you go out of your way to vilify same people as having some sort of mental disorder. Why aren't you vilifying cis rapists and pedophiles as having mental illness? This is clearly nothing more than bigotry and hate masquerading as concern for the safety of women and children.
RD is saying "You can't call me a liar because you are a liar". Even if I am a liar, it has NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with YOUR lying. It is an excellent example of the Tu Quoque logical fallacy. Would you come before a judge and say, "You can't say I'm a thief, since Joe Doaks is a thief."?  Since I have disposed of your fallacious response, how about you doing what you say others should do and apologize to me for your having lied about me? Do you need to be reminded of your lie? It was when I called you on having said that the Turing machine was another name for the Turing test in the "Pope Francis discusses married priests, women deacons with German newspaper" thread. You replied in the "Delve into the Bible during Reformation anniversary" thread "Except I never said 'the Turning [sic, Turing; he got it wrong twice] Machine is another name for the Turing Test.' That my dear friend is a falsehood, a lie."  It was, in fact, the complete truth, as shown by actual quotation. You lied.
Laughable. Israel is singled out regardless of this article. Just have a read of all the BDS activities internationally and nationally, at universities and in protest marches. Nothing stale about standing with Israel as most legislatures and parliaments and university administrations would attest to. In fact, the only crocodile tears and wolf-crying that is falling on deaf ears are left-wing, commie-pinko whiners, and Jew hating fascists and extremists. Israel continues to rank in the very highest on the Human Development Index. The wolf-crying Palestinians at the very bottom. Apparently, terrorism, honor killings, gay torture and apartheid, female genital mutilation, chronic Jew hatred, extrajudicial hangings, don't rank very high. Talk about a stale culture!
"I will surround myself with a staff that is reflective of the diversity within this city," was Multnomah County Commissioner Jules Bailey's answer.  Bailey  continues:  "I  will also paradoxically attend and tithe to an almost all-white fundy church that demands that my female staffers submit to their husbands, unless those female staffers are lesbians, in which case they are bound for hell along with gay guys."
As a father I spent countless hours with my son, raising him with my wife in the most loving and supportive way we could. We had different roles, but those roles were equally important. Our son turned out to be a fine young man with good morales and ethics. Contrast that to my upbringing by a neurotic single mother who wed three times to drunks and charlatans, screwed around with a few other men, and who was physically, emotionally and psychologically abusive to her children. This male bashing is enough to make me puke particularly when it's done by an insecure male. What drivel.
Don't be a misogynist bully by picking on a females looks!
I disagree with the verdict.  The woman was septic. I do believe they dismissed her because of her drug taking history. She begged for help and they threw her away like trash. I never go to Mat Su if I can help it. All they care about is money.  I've seen Dr. Lee be an asshole before. Completely inappropriate.   For those who are defending him, wait until someone you love dies because of someone's bias and prejudgment.  I've seen it happen more than once. This is a travesty.  You can't fix Stupid, and Palmer is full of it.
Show me any Imam that says homosexuals, women, and Atheists are equal to Muslim men...and I'll show you an Imam with a Fatwa on him...
Dennis, I remember well a very bitter older woman who was really outrageous in her condemnation of others in the parish. She attended everything, daily Mass, Rosary, Benediction, everything. She was a one woman brood of vipers.   Then we had a parish renewal weekend. I deliberately engineered it so that she would be in the same sharing group as a young, single mum. Over the course of the weekend, the older lady heard the very sad story of the young Mum. She changed. She got a glimpse of her own cruelty and stupidity. The two women became close friends thereafter and it was such a joy to see. The poisonous words stopped.  I believe that, that older woman had been disobedient to her very self for decades, disobedient to her God given feminine inclinations and natural instincts. She had been taught to disregard the Christ within her. The result was that she became miserable and brought misery to those around her.   The one common denominator for all of them is a lack of joy.
Some interesting and really creepy quotes by Richardson here: https://youtu.be/-OMkqQ9-ZQE He reminds me of Trump because he says really ignorant things and feels entitled to violate women. I hope he chokes, literally and figuratively.
The US murdered 3 million poor Vietnamese men, women and children,( thousands of them by dousing them with jellified gasoline and lighting them on fire, or left to a life of terrible suffering from their burns (google "napalm girl)). They have "Black OPS " secret torture centres in a dozen countries and yet the corporate media and their Presidents refer to the US as "the world's policeman".   Russia takes back a small territory (at the request of the local ethnic Russian population) that is vital to their national security, having their only all season Naval Base , without killing a single person and the (coup plotting)  US and their western sycophants  start screaming that Russia is about to over run Europe.      What a sad, willfully blind double standard.
You stupid woman. The Provinces debt is at the highest level it has ever been and soon it will be the largest expenditure your government has. How are you going to pay for your idea?
WOW you are amazingly ignorant. I have volunteered at First Place Family Center and worked as a teacher for the homeless preschoolers whose families receive services there. I have met the child in this picture and worked with him first hand. Families are suffering everywhere, all the time. More then often due to the recession, being laid off, going broke due to the high cost of medical bills, or from an untreated mental/ physical disability, NOT due to drug addiction, or "laziness" as many people think. The majority of these good people are hard working parents, some even with college degrees. You would NEVER even know that they are experiencing homelessness because they look like average citizens. These parents- women AND men are of all ages, diversities,backgrounds, and upbringings. I would love to know where this "number" you speak of came from. Because I can guarantee it is not factual, or accurate. Get out of the smal bubble you live in and take a look at how the real world works.
You're not reading my posts; or maybe you are. Who knows? I've said repeatedly that I think our constitution and institutions are strong enough to resist Trump's fascist inclinations.  However, history confirms that fascism insinuates itself insidiously, as it did, for example, in Germany. You seem to know nothing of history; or maybe you do. Who can tell?  You seem particularly defensive about the word ‘fascist’. Let’s describe Trump without that word: Trump is a vulgar boor who built his presidential campaign on xenophobia, racism, misogyny and nativism. He ridicules  women, mocks the disabled and attacks racial, ethnic and religious minorities. He is the first, and God-willing the last, presidential candidate to use a presidential debate to brag about the size of his penis. His is a unique combination of corruption, incompetence, and instability. Yet he is president-elect of the United States. There: is that better?
You have LOST YOUR MINDS if you are advocating more import and defend a man that beat the crap out of a woman. You sick people.
I'm not sure what your point is. That he doesn't want to subject her to seeing a male penis? If that's the point you're trying to make, him taking her into the men's room and a transgendered person using the women's restroom are two totally different scenarios. A male who identifies as female isn't going to have his penis on display in the female bathroom, because the stalls are all behind closed doors, so only a pervert who's peeking under or over stalls is going to know that the female in the next stall was actually born a male. If it's not, an unintended consequence of the ordinance would be that it would be difficult for him to take her out alone because it will prohibit her from entering the men's room because she doesn't identify as male.
The comment "He supports sexism and the belief that women are inferior to men. (The magisterium used to be honest enough to admit that was the reason for not ordaining women." is unmitigated rubbish.  Your attributions of reasons why the Church teaches as its does, like your "translations" of other people's comments, are simply long ways of stating you have an opinion gussied up as "facts".
Like a lot of people, Jonah misses the point and the joke of the "female genitalia hats." The marchers were wearing kitty-cat ears. They were responding to our our President, who used a vulgar term to refer female genitalia.
To care about women is to condemn Islam. As a Christian I do not believe in slavery. A moslem finds justification for slavery in the Koran. "You can enslave for sex and work Qur’an 4:3, 4:24, 5:89, 33: 50, 58:3, 70:30". Calling people Islamophobic , only shows that the name caller is totally unfamiliar with the KORAN. I care about women so I must reject the Koran which states, "You will need 4 Muslim male witnesses to prove a rape.Qur’an 24:4".  Of course, those who chose to opine on that which they do not know, have that right in America. Or maybe Islam supporters want to own slaves and abuse women. It is understandable that many agree with the Idea that "You can beat sex slaves, work slaves and wives. Qur’an 4:34".  Personally though, find those practices abhorrent.
Your use of the word "female" rather than "woman", especially contrasted with your use of "man" rather than "male", tells us all we need to know about you. Women are not people to you, and you blame everything wrong with yourself and your life on women, distancing yourself from any psychological connection to women by using clinical terms. You are a troll.
It is appalling that the disgusting liberals showed up to denounce the ever peaceful white nationalists.  It's not like white nationalist are some extreme, violent subset of the population like women.  Remember when women actually had the nerve to march after almighty trump was elected - now that was a violent demonstration.
Campaign Life, your name's a lie. You don't care if women die.
Many Muslims claim their religion does not advocate violence and praises diversity! Isn't it about time that we saw a large group of Muslims start a "reformed" Muslim religion that eliminates the passages of the Quoran that relate to violence against the "infidels" and advocates the equality of men and women.A religion that enshrines 13th century dogma that is questionable today, is not suitable for the 21st century!
Every year, nay, every week that goes by with the Church maintaining that priesthood is not for any woman seems more and more like nothing more respectable than hideous, close-minded obstinacy. And, yes, this does boil down to the word "bigotry." Every year, every week, this position seems more and more foolish and ossified. This negative image is so strong and reprehensible that, for those in the hierarchy not to be aware of it, makes me wonder about their sentience, let alone any wisdom or moral understanding.
Pull on your big boy pants Justin and tell Grandi that you are not the sucker he thinks you are. We are up to our armpits in immigrants that are a on going burden to Canada, the last thing we need is a single women or wife dragging her 6 kids along, plus her ailing mother and invalid father.
The point is: Imago Dei has doctrines that are repugnant to me and other Portlanders.  We hear the all-male "Elders" arguing for 1. female submission 2. unmarried households are living in sin 3. gay sex is sin.  This is not a flawed doctrine- it is a homophobic misogynist doctrine that your evangelical church wants to spread.  You are no different from a Santorum supporter except that the Santorum supporter is more honest and will not deny their church's doctrine.
No, just a remote island with no means of evacuation or safe shelter while a deadly storm barreled down on them threatening to kill everyone.  Did you attend the women's conference dear?  Justin was well prepared it.
Typical female chauvinist response.  Women have to take responsibility for their actions too.  Yes, Weinstein was obviously a lech, but everyone apparently knew that, so why did these women continually put themselves into situations where something could happen?  Why did & do they continue to dress 1/2 or 3/4 naked all the time? Women spend a crazy amount of time and money trying to attract male attention, then cry foul when it's the wrong male who is attracted.   Not saying that some men don't need to learn to control themselves, but the time has come to accept that many times, women are the authors of their own misfortune.  Until we address women's responsibility this problem will never go away.  Sadly it seems that the more men are lectured on avoiding anything sexual with a women and resist their natural instincts, the more women dress and act like whores.  No woman needs to wear an almost see-thru dress with no bra, no underwear and thick war paint, not to mention their actions
"Mr. O’Leary also gets three things broadly right. He’s focused like a laser on economic growth and jobs. He’s positive on immigration. And he’s indifferent to divisive social issues, which are a bedrock of U.S identity politics."  And she goes on with more positives.  But to millennial voters & media, those are substantive issues - we are interested in surface, so we'll vilify him because he can be a (trigger word!) "bully".  And the also-wealthy Trudeau will continue to drip with sanctimony (when he does stuff that is jerk-like the Globe makes sure we soon forgive & forget) and Canadians (especially, as Trudeau knows & shows by almost every word he utters, females) will identify with that "idealism" and re-elect him to a majority.  Canadian youth is indoctrinated to be rose-coloured glasses socialist activists, Canada does not have the constituency Trump tapped.  Without a smart, millennial (preferably non-white) female as leader CPC has zero chance, based on my read of Canadians.
The fact that you show outrage over a politician getting a bj in his office - and show no outrage or concern over Trump saying he grabs women by the pu**y and forces himself on them - and that he admits cheating on all of his wives - proves the point of the author. That many Trump supporters will stay that way no matter what and turn a blind eye to his horrible conduct.
I don't think she's genuinely racist either, but damn, the woman only opens her mouth wide enough to change feet. As Greg says in the article, she is now a liability to the DA...
If Trump makes it to the Office of the Presidency how will he apply the Violence Against Women Act?  Will he tell the frat boys that it's okay,  they're privileged?  It's "locker room stuff?"   For the Alaska Republican Party to stand by their candidate sends a dangerous message to women, girls and the vulnerable.  This is no laughing matter.  Rape and rape culture is not okay.  It is a crime.
Why is asking what you would call a female priest a stupid question? The church, if you haven't noticed, has titles for everyone. I think it's appropriate to ask what that title might be in the case of a female priest. If you're saying it's no big deal because the church will sort it out, fine, but they will be sorting that question out, and so by doing so they will be "stupid" as you said that it was a "stupid question". I wonder if any of the bishops would be called stupid for asking that question in the deliberations.
Dan singer, the man being sued is my cousin. Believe me when I say he is a horrible human being in so many different ways (he is racist, homophobic, abusive to his wife and children and apparently animals as well). I sincerely hope this girl wins her lawsuit! He was negligent. What kind of scum leaves their dogs in a hot car?!
Agreed, that's absolutely disgusting.   But that's Liberals for you.  They love to preach about tolerance but they are among the most intolerant and hateful groups on the entire planet.  They also harassed and sent death threats and rape threats to the female MP that Trudeau elbowed.
ANd Dems support the wife of a serial abuser/raper of women for President, who went after and destroyed the women who had affairs with her husband - a real champion of women
Feminists do not believe in evolution.
KTVA is running a story about Gin Berry helping trap the five murders.   Her mom sounds like a great parent trying her very best to save her kid from teenage stupidity.    Gin whines and complains about her mother making her own up to her own responsibility. Mark my words Gin Berry's motive was the reward money. Her peers are taking notice she is about to profit. Gin didn't aide out of a sense of decency. If that kid ever gets her hands on any of the reward her mother won't be able to stop her incredibly terrible choices. There is another tradegy setting up. Innocent lives with the likes of Gin's immaturity are coming into play. When it goes bad, it'll be really, really awful.   If you go to Erick Almandinger's Facebook and select friends you see Gin Berry's. Damn.  Mad respect to Gin's mother for trying to raise her daughter to be a responsible person.
A female god would have aborted the entire human race long ago.
If Israel had been built on secularism it would have ceased to exist a long time ago and certainly as a Jewish state, becoming just another Arab state and we know the disgusting dictatorships that they all are without exception, honour killings, gay torture, and female genital mutilation. Nice.
"If the guy is as drunk as the woman and they have consensual sex at the party, you can't later blame him. He was drunk too and not responsible for his behavior, like her. Right?" Wrong. Oh Yes, you can blame him! He is "Mr Man"..."Dirty Bird"...a sexual predator. She, on the other hand was just looking for some harmless(?) "fun"....and is a poor Victim of his Lust!
I'd love to see equality in Canada--not for women, but for men.  A white male in this country has been reduced to crap you find on the bottom of your shoe.   In the USA, you hear nothing but talk about creating jobs, not for women, not for minorities, but for AMERICANS.     Maybe one day, everyone in Canada will be equal, but not before this joke of a Prime Minister has been tossed out along with his white, male bigotry.
TomZ calls a sexist sleazebag "a traditional image of masculinity, patriotism, and eye for attractive women." Aww, Tom, don't you wish you could just grab 'em by the p*ssy?
It was more cost effective to rape black, female, slaves and enslaving their children, than buying adult slaves. Rape was just a business decision and fun. The memoirs of Mary Chestnut mentions how white wives of slave owners didn't like the fact that so many of their slaves looked like their husbands.
They also may have been particularly unlikely to share their views with a visibly disabled, ethnically-mysterious-this-must-be-some-kind-of-brown outsider.  His ties to Imago Dei sank his campaign, IMHO. I am not alone in that opinion, as I do talk with a lot of other "Portland Progressives"...I'm more of a crotchety center-left sort. I'm not car-free or skinny or "not in East Portland" or "educated" enough to be a Real Progressive. And yet, in living rooms around town, those of hetero couples and gay ones, PoCs and white alike, the three big strikes against Bailey were his uncritical support of his creepy church, that he's done little for many of his platform elements like affordable housing on the County Commission, and, out here, his utter ignorance of East Portland.   I know, and am friends with, Mormons, Southern Baptists, etc. I used to be a Good Mormon Girl. I know shifty hate-filled churches when I see one, and Imago Dei is just that.
You might have a point there, what we do know is the Pope is OK with grown men in his religion touching little boys and with his visit with Trump, it appears he's also OK with grown men sexually assaulting women, regardless of age...#MAGA
"I don't think it's based on Catholic women's perception that Trump is a "predator," because, frankly, if these women are at all informed, they know on the issue of sexual predation, the track record of both candidates is at best a wash."  So Hillary has been repeatedly accused of sexual assault, including the underaged!  Where did you hear that?
Good for all women.  Good for her. Good for Canada. Shame on all the negative comments here. Shame. Shame. Shame on you.  What horrible people.
I've also heard of the Church's position on masturbation.  However, I have never seen the Church financially and politically involved in stopping divorce, pre marital sex, masturbation or illicit sexual acts between heterosexual couples.  I have seen the church get politically active against abortion and birth control which effect women, and gay marriage.  Not much concern there for those poor adulterous heterosexual males.
It is an out and out lie to refer to these hysterics as a 'women's march'.  It is a Liberal Womans March designed to show just how unhinged these people are. Of course the narrative fits hand in glove with the fake news so prevalent today.  Something like 30 million women voted for Trump but in the increasingly unhinged mind of the left, they don't count.Like everything else associated with the crazies, they are totally unprepared for the unintended consequences of their  insane behaviour.
it sure is our job to judge. we do it all the time. i will not tolerate perversions being forced in my face, or my grandchildren's. i will fight back. enough is enough. men: stay out of the ladies' room. we know that most of you angle for females. you are wicked.
Just how do you see what girl is on her cycle?  I have been trying for years, but my wife's sneaks up on me every time until I hear about it loud and clear.         Sure it is stupid and backwards that girls prey at the back, it is stupid only men can become priests, it is stupid some Evangelicals call for the death of homosexuals.....   It is not stupid however to try and understand and get along.  Kind of irony here Chuck but I am assuming you are defending liberal Muslims :)  ...If they are shunned by their conservative Muslim's then we have their backs don't we?
Newt is certainly one to lecture on loyalty He was banging a secretary while his wife was home with the kids, fighting some disease, and ironing his fat-boy shirts.
Woman have had dildos, what's the difference? Men don't care about that.  It seems woman are getting paranoid that men may not need them anymore? Hmmmmm.
Disgusting predatory pig! I truly hope that this is the beginning of more equality in this industry for women and for any men that too have been abused.  He has been behaving as disgusting as the POTUS. All the very best to my southern neighbours. I feel for you and I wish this President would stop attacking his own people and start to behave with even a little bit of modesty and compassion. Best wishes to you all. The women that reported on TWC need to be given all the support and encouragement for their bravery. I'm with you!
Feminism is a hateful ideology and I am just tired of reading this sort of story.  I have a trial subscription the the Globe and Mail and I will be canceling it.
Gary, it's human nature to want to feel good about ourselves. If someone doesn't have self-esteem, the only way to feel better is to put someone else down. Indians, Blacks, Chinese, Jews, Mexicans. Poor people, women, diff-abled. There will always be groups of people whose only sense of self-worth will come from targeting someone they feel is lesser-than.
What!?  Hodad I am so triggered by your comment.  Everyone knows that Europe is full of WHITE MALES.  I have to go to my safe space right now and call the feminist crisis hotline.
Que the fake outrage in an attempt to deflect.  Give us all a break Gene...Drumpf brags about how he can do whatever he wants to women, including sexual assault because he's famous. <---FACT  I wonder now that he's POTUS what he thinks he's entitled to.<---SPECULATION
Sounds like Gobbledy Gook. This woman has no authority to speak about anything. She has personally overseen the destruction of a State Owned Institution. She is an academic imbecile and a waste of fresh air. She must go along with her comrade JZ - the sooner the better.
You say:  "But for all the men who are in the trenches every day subtly or overtly supporting women’s equality, I’d like to say, for the record, that Alamo Drafthouse is wrong to exclude supportive husbands, brothers, fathers, sons, friends and colleagues from this women’s empowerment event."  I'm pretty sure that the "supportive" guys who "are in the trenches... supporting women's equality" are more than fine with having a ladies-only showing of a movie. It's the idiot guys who like to play the victim and kick up a fuss where no fuss is called for who are ruining this for everyone.
Pigs at the publicc trough. Anyone who believed that millionaire elitest Trump - of all people - was going to "drain the swamp" (whatever that means) by putting elitest, self-serving men and women who've spent their lives ripping off America is just plain stupid with a capital "S."
Should women be prohibited  from having sex if they have a blood alcohol level of  perhaps .08.? She poses a danger to any man who has sex with her, and he needs to be warned she is off limits. Is there an app to tell drunk women to go home? Certainly no man who refuses to have sex with a drunk woman is considered a hero, not even by the same feminists who  call him a rapist if he does.
Iv personally been to one of his partys hes a fucking creep and i was kiked out for protecting a 16year old drunk girl that he was trying to have sex with. She left with me and i got her on a bus to some where else. Dude belongs in jail let alone on the sex offender registrie. He took advantage of girls like that pile of shit mayor did to little ass boys. Ask me he deserves to be locked up.
We have Trump on audio/video tape bragging on "how he does it to women."  "When I see a beautiful woman, I can't wait."  I'm a star and I can do anything.  Women like it."  "I grab them by the p___y."  Pop in more tic tacs.
Here is an idea.  Don't want a baby?  Don't get pregnant.  It is completely within the power of the female human to make that initial choice, and once said choice is made, either for or against conception, they own said choice.  We men are pigs, to be sure, though not as many as one may think, but it is the female that ultimately decides whether she shall be impregnated or not.  Women are indeed within control of not only their bodies, but their biological ability to give birth, and if they do not want to become a mother, than they should take whatever steps they need to so as to prevent said action.  THAT is the female power.  THEY decide whether they shall bear a child or not.  Abortion is for those that do not own their personal decisions, or are simply too obtuse, or lazy, to own said decisions.  And do not even get me started about Planned Parenthood and its eugenics based beginning.
HRC made another stupid assumption.  Apparently, women who are not married to men are immune from all male  mind control.  So I guess that means Bill is controlling her.  LOL!!
I bring Hillary up because everybody still tied to her skirt strings  are crying 'But she won the popular vote". Which of course denies there were over 5 million illegal motor voters in NY and Cali. alone. And remember, she got destroyed in the E.C. race. You know, the one that counts? The traitor I'm talking about is the one that keeps ranting about how he colluded with Russia. And of course they tried to interfere with our election.  They're our enemy.  But affect the Electoral College?  Not a chance. AND, of course its correct and proper and even mandatory to question the President.  But your mind is already made up, Trump is a misogynist, Islamaphobic, homophobic, pedophile, a piece of s**t and on and on and freaking on.  In case you haven't noticed we are at war with a bunch of Muslims who seek paradise and 100 virgins by  committing suicide and killing a bunch of women, girls and babies. Or maybe my defending the president of the United States bothers you for some other reason.
STUPID ARTICLE  READ DCLEAKS HACKING OF GEORGE SOROS.  SOROS IS THE FUNDER OF EVERYTHING THROUGH HIS FRONT OF NONPROFITS.  EXAMPLE - THE "WOMEN'S MARCH ON DC" WAS FUNDED BY SOROS THROUGH 150 DIFFERENT NONPROFITS HE SENT MONEY THROUGH.  SOROS BUYS ANYONE AND EVERYONE FROM EU OFFICIALS THROUGH PRESS MEMBERS.   SOROS, STEYER, HOLLYWOOD, HEDGE FUND BILLIONAIRES, AND MORE EXIST. WORRY ABOUT DEMOCRAT MONEY - HAHAHAHAHA. JUST LOOK AT THE RACE IN GA.  THEY MONEY IS THERE - THE QUESTION IS, DOES IT MATTER. JUST ASK HILLARY.
I'm not. Ive paid up for a 2 week holiday in Maui for me, my wife and 2 kids....and I dont plan to delay or cancel any other US trips either as I have friends in Bellingham, Seattle, DC and NYC. The USA is a lot more than just the presidency. Meanwhile the question is, is it ok for the US to ban Muslims temporarily because millions of them - while not Jihadists (although thousands are) - are Islamists and/or support Islamist goals of establishing Sharia Law everywhere...including throwing gays off building tops, establishing that a woman's testimony in court is worth only 1/2 a man's, codifying blasphemy as a criminal act....need I continue?
The reason? Because the majority of legal voters saw that this woman was just as corrupt as any man out there, maybe even more than Bill.  And with The Oversite Committee launching a formal investigation into the lies Hilliary told the American people; Benghazi, her secret depleted uranium deal with the Kremlin, Saudi pay for play, ... we have seen Hillary stick to the Left-wing play book, accuse others of what she is most guilty of herself.
I have four daughters, all of which played volleyball and wore the uniform.  I've known the man who is having his character assassinated in these comments for 30 years.  Most of you are entirely ridiculous in your assumptions.  I forgive you for your ignorance...  however that is what is on display here.  Complete and total ignorance in a public comment thread on a newspapers website.  I don't normally comment on such an article, maybe some of  you should take a cue from that example and shut your ignorant mouths, you know nothing!
NO NO NO  This appears to be just another 'slight of hand' people w/power and money pull all the time. NO Brian, you may NOT have the MULTI tax breaks if you're not going to set aside 30% w/capped rent.  Why?  Because rich people don't want to have poor folk anywhere near them.  I live in a new development (Hayden Homes, Veneta) and was an early buyer.  One day I'm at the mail boxes and a big ole fat woman was mouthing off that if she'd of known folks were going to 'rent' in this development, she'd of never bought.  LOL  I looked at her and stated "There are a lot of really good realtors in the area if you need help leaving"  She huffed off.  I can't stand prideful morons.  It's just sickening.
Why are black women dispropotionally represented? Excellent question. I would suggest that it's because they have less access to contraceptives given the fact that they earn about 17% less than white women. They probably are less likely to have insurance as well.  Ironically pro-life attacks on Planned Parenthood will increase the number of abortions.   http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/
Sam Wallis.  If Trump were a Democrat (which he once was), the Democrats would be singing his praises--his success, his business acumen, his tough negotiating, his renegade methods to shake up a calcified system of government.  If GOP President Trump walked on water, they would criticize him for not swimming.  If he found the cure for cancer, they wold criticize him for ignoring Alzheimer's.  Democrats can't accept defeat, especially when they trusted the polls, ran a poor/corrupt candidate, and expected to be able to take credit for the first woman president along with the first Black president while continuing to play the race, gender, and all the other cards against the GOP.  That's what they can't get over, their own stupidly poor judgment.   Trump is struggling to find his way, but Americans who desire his failure aren't patriots.  They are the enemy within.  It's long past time for the Democrats to grow up and help Trump govern instead of inventing faux news and obstructing.
So the lesson learned is if you are a slime ball that breaks the law, lets/causes Americans die over seas and use your public office to enrich yourself, your husband and your daughter, just make sure your exposures of reprehensible behavior is tainted by a foreign government that you failed to negotiate with and in so doing made the world and America far less safe. That way instead of being held responsible for your actions you can create a smoke screen and maybe just maybe stay out of jail.   By the way where is the investigation of the criminal that stole and released a citizens tax return with out their consent?   It will never happen but its ok because Hillary the criminal although still free has lost all power. Hubris is a bitch eh?
I sure hope 64 that you are kidding.  I mean come on, imaginary fears are something, but this is beyond the norm.  Did you really mean to say:   " the majority of the people who voted for your qualified candidate woman were illegal voters in the millions and voters who are not citizens voted for a woman so you see trump won the majority of electoral and the popular vote..."  Not sure what you really mean but there is no way that illegal voters voted.  But that is so typical of phony conservatives.  Can't admit that they can't get a majority so try to discredit the people who did form the majority.  i suggest you concentrate on why you losers voted for a clown for president.   This idiot will probably soon be removed from office for incompetancy and then what will you say?  Well, we really wanted Pence?  lol    You guys would be funny if you weren't so sad.
I really have to ask just what kind of mentality would try and enforce such a ridiculous policy? This reinforces my attitude towards Air Canada in that they have some of the most stellar employees I have ever dealt with and the most neolithic corporate culture to ever have dragged their knuckles across the world stage.  I would seriously suggest terminating this woman's contract based solely upon proven incompetence and an utterly pathetic understanding of Canadian culture.
Of course none of those people you list ever bragged about sexually assaulting women, just saying.
Lesbian chicks are OK as long as they are HOT!  This one appears to be marginal.  Anybody got any tapes?
"Texas had said its law, passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor in 2013, was aimed at protecting women's health."  Small-government Republicanism: government small enough to fit in your uterus.
After reading through most of the comments I continue to be horrified by the people defending Donald "Grab Her By the Pussy" Trump!. They continue to defend a man who may be the biggest piece of white trash America has produced yet! His accomplishments are: Lying, cheating on wives, lusting after his own daughter and calling her a piece of ass, groping his daughter in public, scamming investors out of millions with fake real estate deals and fake Trump U, multiple bankruptcies and failed companies, bankrupting many Mom & Pop businesses by not paying his bills, not paying employees, lying constantly about anything he doesn't know about; which is EVERYTHING, racism, misogyny, bigotry, vulgarity, bullying, sexual assault, narcissism, fake charities, insurance scams, tax evasion, stupidity, ignorance, brutality, the mental maturity of an 8 year old, , etc., etc., ad nauseum! I'm sure I left a lot off the list. Ran out of room!  Is this POS really your hero?
Boo-hoo...a bunch of left-wing radical feminist nuns who are/were a CANCER were brought on the carpet.  The nuns are why the Catholic Church must divorce herself from social justice baloney.  It's an "attractive nuisance" that is like human feces:  it attracts flies.  Get rid of the social justice garbage, and liberals will be less likely to join the Catholic Church as it resembles more of a fundamentalist Protestant Church in theology and politics.  Liberalism is a fungus.
You have to be utterly blind to have missed out on his previous attacks on women. You think it's okay for a man to walk up to a strange woman and grab her by the genitals? Or to fire a woman  because he doesn't find her sexually attractive?
I see the globe printed a piece on the refugee matter. They just did not show a commen section. WHY?  They don't give a damm about Canadians feel.     So to you globe and pothead. Send these cowards back and don't allow anymore in. They have not the guts to fight for thier own freedom, yet they expect us to look after them  and send our men and women to die. They are cowards and when we stop giving them welfare will be killing Canadians from our Gov. stupidity.     We need Donald Trump.
Check out Fox news now. The new Muslim mayor of London wants to ban from public display pictures of women in bathing suits. Read it ladies this is just the start he has many suggestions for women. Point is terrorist attacks are only one of the tactics available.
Cont. “...As much as Trump, Jr. and others on the right would like to shrug this off as irrelevant to Weinstein, Trump, Jr.’s vocal response to the Weinstein scandal really only makes these facts more relevant. Because, after all, if your concern for women who have experienced sexual harassment, intimidation, and assault is contingent on the political leaning of the perpetrator, your concern certainly isn’t with women’s rights.”  You have to be a mighty stupid woman to be a Republican.
You were not being facetious.  You were intimating that two particular women are too ugly to engage in lesbian porn, according to your high standards.  I wish I could see what you look like.
Well, Blue, I think that you and today's fellow Globe guest columnist, Summer, have quite a bit of work ahead of you.  Perhaps tomorrow's columnists, Sky and Moonbeam, will expand on this vision even more.  You see, Blue, what grownups understand is that populists like President Orangutan do not arise just from "entitlement", and "racism", and "hate".  Now, populists do indeed take advantage of those "worse angels" of our nature, but those alone are not enough to bring them to power.  What is it then, you must be asking yourself Blue?  It is a little thing we grownups call fear.  Now, this is where you chuckle and snort and pat all those silly white men and brow beaten white women on their heads and say: "get over it".  And then you offer us your bright vision of the future. One that meshes with the numbers. For example,  rationalize how Canada will be better off in 60 years as we become an Islamic majority nation.  Do that Blue. You and Summer and Sky and Moonbeam get right on it.
So women and minorities can do whatever white men allow them to? SMH.
Trophy Hunting. Not quite yet a remnant of the past. Killing for sport is nothing but killing for ego. It's fun to kill things, and then look as if you conquered them...with your powerful weapon. I'm in the least impressed.    Designs are now available for the 'woman cave' too.
The Dems are desperate.  They are imploding  with stupid women.
I still would like to know where was the outrage when Bill Clinton raped those women and did things with Lewinski? And lied about it under oath?
I'm sure Jim Minnery and Co. will have church volunteers ready and willing to check birth certificates at restroom entrances around town.   Funny thing is, most Transgenders no longer look anything like the sex found on their birth certificates - they look exactly like the sex they identify with.   Soooo, Jim and his cult will be steering big hairy guys with massive pecs over to the ladies' side simply because that's what their birth certificate says they are, and vice versa.    Amazing, the idiotic hoops fundy Christians will go through to "protect" whatever religious ideology they claim to identify with, and no matter how much it hurts good people.  Jesus must be spinning in his grave.
As puns are to humor, criticism is to thought. There is no equivilence between 'little d' and Hillary Clinton. She has a resume intelligence and experience, and is the most investigated female in the world. He is an idiot. So where do you stand? Oh I know, you are angry, someone took away your ball, throwing it at the wall might be the reason. You see jobs going elsewhere, gays get to marry, there's a African Amercian President...so the world is going to hell in a handbasket and you're angry. You listen to am radio, rant Fidos, gets your blood boiling, and your dander up. So who's your guy? Not Ted, or Jeb, or Marco, or John...it's "the Donald." Of course he's your guy, he's a guy. Of course you support him 'cause he's angry too...why? Good question. I'd be angry if I were him too.
"Why would any woman sympathize with Islam, Bill Clinton or Bill Cosby….. all womanizers?" Islam, Democrat, black. Are there any other womanizers of note?
I have seen it in my own family.   My brother figures that any one educated is an elitist and he figures that they need to go.   He celebrated the Ford win, the Trump win.  He thinks its great. All his friends see it this way too.   Its incredible.   They don't care if the guy is as dumb as a rock.  If a guy says they can have it for free ( lower taxes) they vote for that guy.   In fact they prefer that their politicians are dump.  The feel they can relate.   They all believe global warming is a hoax.  The scientists are all in the pocket of the elites.   They all remind me of the woman on the radio in 96 who was crying because Harris cut her mothers allowance.   She said she voted for him. The interviewer said "he is doing what he said he was going to do. Why did you vote for him?"  The young woman said.   " I didn't think he meant me!"
"Only the light of Christ can quench the torches of hatred and violence. Let us pray for peace," said Bishop DiLorenzo in his statement. "I pray that those men and women on both sides can talk and seek solutions to their differences respectfully."  DiLorenzo goes the Trump route and blames everyone.  What a profile in cowardice!
You make a repugnant sexual innuendo to a woman in a public forum and cowardly hide you identity.   You are a self-righteous embarrassment to your chosen faith and found abusive by any civil standard.
You can tell the story of Susan (the woman in this article) to the people of Congress and some would feel sad and want to change the way COLA is calculated for seniors from CPI-W to CPI-E and eliminate the cap from $118,500 a year that FICA tax is paid on BUT the majority of them would still do nothing to change either one and let seniors live like this.No one should live like this but what does Congress, who makes $185,000 year with great benefits really care?  So my point being is I see the way the world is, money being more important than people, and I have little use for this world and would not miss it at all for whether I am here or not, this same crap will go on and as long as I do not have to deal with the world's BS, I wish the world well but I would no longer have to care.
I would also add that dating during this time hasn't been a fun experience. Most of the women on the dating sites are unrealistically choosy. They won't date shorter men (I'm 5'7" and even though I'm fit, love culture, own my house and have a great job, it doesn't seem to matter) My personal observations indicate if you're short, women want nothing to do with you regardless of other qualities. They seem to idealize tall, rugged dudes who drive bikes or trucks and are manly men ( in Alberta anyway) So find it hard to sympathize with "why can't women find good men" when my personal experience shows women chasing after the shitty men and ignoring the good men.
Another arch Liberal blames someone else for his hate speech. It's not unlike Hillary blaming the women her husband abused. Or Barack Obama  when he blamed White people for Black crime, or when he blamed Americans for Muslim terror.
What about all those Catholics who do not believe that women should be allowed to become priests, oppose gay marriage and a woman's right to choose when it comes to abortion? All of those beliefs are not in keeping with Canadian values. I bet the author of this simplistic article would never dare to oppose immigration to Canada by Catholics. His is a cowardly, racist argument.
Per the video, because he's a' celebrity', Two Tone Trump can foist himself on someone else with impunity, without respect to the individual involved, and without regard to consequences to himself.  That would put him on par with a 18th century plantation owner.  In order to garner the 'women' vote, he then takes a tactic that will attempt to make the lives of his female accusers a "living hell'.  The GOP seems to have the capacity to back a low life scum like Trump and to back the most stupid campaign tactics imaginable. Make America Great Again led by the most  stupid low lives imaginable. It's hard not to be sarcastic.
Your son will grow to be a man.  I hope he is proud of that and does good things in the world.  I fear he will be ashamed of what he is because of positions like yours.  My experience is that an equal number of women do selfish, stupid things.  A woman is as likely as a man to judge other women harshly.  I do not call that femininity because that would be insulting to half the population.  I prefer to treat people as individuals and judge them by their actions, rather than assign a gender stereotype to half the population.
This is ridiculous, hiding Hilary behind her sex. I will attack anyone who has done what Trump did (which I didn't need to because he got chewed out earlier), and I will attack Hillary for what she has done. I don't care if they are a girl, Muslim, black, Christian, Mexican, gay, or anything in-between; I will never withhold criticism of actions. I was pointing out the hypocrisy of the statement Trump is bad role model so we should elect Hilary. I believe Hillary is worse, you can disagree and that's ok. But both are terrible role models, and her being a woman doesn't change that.
What's ridiculous to most people about it is the impression created -- that entitled white men have nothing better to worry about than being excluded from a few screenings of a Wonder Woman movie.  Seriously, do you really think this is a hill to die on?  I mean put this in perspective:  Black men in the US are protesting being routinely killed by police, indigenous men all over NA are protesting treaty rights and land claims, and entitled white men are protesting not being allowed in a few screenings of a movie.  And then they wonder why people are mocking them.
Planned Parenthood was created by Margaret Sanger who said she created it to kill black people off. An organization that was created to kill members of a certain race calling someone a racist for supporting a black woman kinda speaks for itself.
I met a woman with a master's degree in social work who interrupted a conversation I was having with someone else on the subject of AGW, and she stated, "So Alaska will become like Hawaii. So what?!!"  For many years I was deeply confused by such people, and they are everywhere.  I didn't understand how anyone could be so dumb and mean.  Now I know there is no "how" to it.  It just is.
Ridiculous.  Of course it's sexism.  The man oozes contempt for women.  You're as bad excusing it and pretending that it doesn't exist in this case or anywhere, for that matter.  It's sexist to dismiss or ignore sexism's existence.
There is a very significant backlash in Europe against the wearing of face covering. Initially it was just a few women (the argument made here) but over the past 25 years it has increased exponentially. The problem is that Islam is not a religion where any compromise is possible. It is impossible to question Islamic doctrine (and questioning carries very severe penalties) thus it is a religion that is incapable of evolving. If Muslims were interested in compromise they would ditch the niqab and promote the hijab. So why continue to cling to this awful piece of misogynistic clothing that shuts off women from the world? Please tell me... the vast majority of Canadians are comfortable with the hijab but we reject the niqab as completely contrary to western ideals of equality. It denigrates and debases women. So why fight for its use??
Possibly, but that's a pretty sh*tty response Ben. Even if that were true it doesn't warrant the deaths of these 2 women.
I am non-Muslim Canadian man and I would vastly prefer a Muslim woman in a headscarf than a proud feminist who is triggered by things.  Not that I would end up with one when there's always the option to get with another woman and thoroughly enjoy Ontario's new non gender specific parent reference
As a feminist I don't want a fringe party like Muslim Brotherhood to ever get a foothold here.  Ever.
That one CEO had no legal power to suppress the wages of women in his emloye. I don't care what he did or how he ran his company, all women and men got the same wages doing the same job.  He may have been a sexist pig, but there are many women out there to match him.
'“I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it,” Weinstein said in a statement. “Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.”'  WAAY too little;  WAAY too late. BTW, Harv, where the apology to the women you violated?
Trump does far more than speak of women.  He also rapes and molests them, and violates their privacy.    Trump is the perfect pervert, and should be locked up.  Only God knows what disgusting sexual perversions are going to go on at the White House, once Trump assumes office.
Why ? Probably no self respecting successful professional business man/woman would put up with the mostly spoiled brat voters and political three ring circus ! Thus we get to elect the wanna-bes ....
how any woman would vote for trump is beyond comprehension. may she wants him to grab her pussy!
So you're saying that he's a just a jerk... And ignoring all of his previous attacks on women.
I AGREE 100% with your statement NOW !!! It ain't the substance, it's the intoxication and negative results. Also, some people CAN handle pot, MOST people CANNOT handle alcohol. I've always contended alcohol makes you stupid !! Makes a small guy like me think I can beat a large Polynesian up & wonder why I'm in a hospital bed the next day. Makes women sleep with guys they wouldn't give he time of day to. I guarantee you, no fights result from pot !!! And women still have their brains when stoned .....
Well paul, most of us don't have that nifty wingnut decoder ring that she puts in her Cracker-Jack boxes. This woman is total bat crazy.
Actually it's a gender-neutral practice.   Same reason that men go for nasty women.
So what you're saying is that you, a female, googled naked photos of Trump's wife.  I'd call THAT low class. People like you have way too much time on your hands. Let's try being intelligent adults here and stop this juvenile crap. Trolling for nude photos is just very disturbing.
"GROPER IN CHIEF"  ABUSER OF WOMEN
Oh, I see Nancy. Unlike "bend over Barrack" Obama's red lines that kept disappearing (and is why NK feels so safe to threaten us today) and "I didn't have sex with that woman" Clinton said that we would never be threatened by NK again after he gave in to their blackmail in the late 90's. Now that Trump said it straight, you are finally coming out of your coma. And showing that, yes, you are insane.
As long as intolerant anti-women religious bigots of Edmonton and Calgary are on Notely's side, she can win elections after elections.  She doesn't care about others.
You forgot to mention a few other differences. American Christians don't force women to undergo genital mutilation; they don't stone people to death; they don't behead 'infidels'; they don't hang gays from construction cranes;they don't engage in "honour" killings; leaving Christianity is not punishable by death.....
I have no hope left for America.  I have witnessed the 'scorched earth' strategy of Trump and Republicans to feed their endless neediness for power and might and the rest be damned.  I have watched as woman have been continuously humiliated and now will be robbed of their birth right to govern their own bodies.  I have been dismayed and sickened to witness the un-Christian turning their backs on desperate refugees and Mexicans.  I have been disgusted to see how Trump has used his candidacy to enrich himself at all cost.  My patriotism has withered as I saw the head of the FBI put his personal career ahead of this nation's best interest and rules of governance.  It is time to secede.  Leave the red states to close themselves off from the world, protected from immigrants, gays and lesbians and liberals, but no rule of law.  I am happy and proud to be a part of a new nation that holds dear freedom, liberty. sound governance and democratic principles.
The "seal of Confession" is/was supposed to be a protection for the penitent, not a wall of silence to shelter criminal predator priests with impunity.  Priests who weaponize the confessional as an opportunity to rape and sodomize children and vulnerable adults should not be able to use "the seal" to dodge and conceal their criminal assaults - ever.  Part of any reform and renewal of the priesthood Catholics should restrict the faculties for confessors to those men and women who have received special training in psychology and certification of their probity.   Priests have been abusing the confessional since the early centuries of the church.  The sacrament of Reconciliation is suppose to be a source of mercy and peace - not an occasion of rape for sexual perverts:  Time for reform!
If what you say is true, it's pretty pathetic that the millenials main understanding about the Catholic church is its teachings on sexuality.  And ironic that the only ones talking about the Church's teachings on sexuality are secular homosexuals and feminists in the media, not the Church.  Meanwhile, countless young women are being pressured into being sexual objects by a culture that equates recreational sex with freedom and equality.  And the guys LOVE it:  No more having to take a girl out to dinner a few times to get into her pants!
What a horrible man bashing article ! Many men and woman work together in the household while men, let's face it, in many cases work long hours at work and bring in the money for the household. That's reality, especially if the woman, are indeed, looking after the household. Let's put some balance into these never ending gender stereotyping comments of men being lazy around the house and woman being the superior parent. It's getting tiresome.
There is no such thing as 'islamophobia'  There is just saying things muslims don't like and so they whine and complain about it.  Grow a spine.  And stop treating your women like chattel.
GET OVER IT!!!!!! IT WAS AN EFFING JOKE!!!! Quit being so damn hyper sensitive.   YES, it was funny... It was funny because MOST nurses are indeed FEMALE! FACT. When I hear the word "NURSE" I, and statistically 100% of other human beings picture the woman with the white dress and hat. THATS HOW IT IS. DEAL WITH IT!  2) Statistically 100% of straight men WOULD NOT want gay men OOGLING their genitals and "admiring" them. FACT. That is NOT "Anti-Gay"... Its just FACT. I certainly would not want some gay guy checking out my private parts...   And you Leftists wonder why we cant stand you guys... You are NITPICKERS!!! You take apart EVERY DAMN sentence and analyze EVERY word... You take the fun out of EVERYTHING.   MAGA 2020.
Forget about it.  Every woman marching would need a steel crotch guard!
these women should be fed to red ants.
The woman is sick deranged and generally despicable.   However should she and her attorneys choose to appeal this conviction they have substantive proof that the judge should have tossed the case on lack of evidence that the charging met the criteria set forth in the law.   Texting someone 'kill yourself' has never been illegal (until this case) and for very good reason.   NO CRIME has been committed by saying something dumb (politicians be happy).   This case was yet another good (terrible) example of emotions overriding logic and a tough case making bad law.
Demento - you don’t make.  Please refrain from commenting on religious matters if you have zero knowledge.   Now thong or full nudity is the answer to women liberation?? You must be one sick person to advocate that
Right.  I see honesty is not your forte. At the very least in the context of your reply you strongly inferred that Trump is a great role model. So no, I'm not  going to take debate tips from the person who wrote "Look girls, to win anything you need to cheat. To get what you want you need to steal. And when your cornered with no way out delete everything and lie your face off and pretend to be stupid." Stop being a whiny hypocrite ."
The battle cry of the ignorant.  The suspected meth, in ocent until proven guilty in America, was a tiny amount. Maybe it was given to her.  The point is your government should not spend thousands to jail a non-violent woman that should be released on her own recognizance.  I guess you support government waste and the war on the poor. Hmmm.
He will tell you that God is against abortions knowing that Numbers 5:11-33 details a forced trial by abortion for a woman thought to have cheated on her husband. They have an aborticide that they add dust from the Tabernacle of the Temple. If God hated abortions, why let them use dust from the holy of holies? This little clown is dumber than he looks.
She wouldn't be qualified if only she had been a long-standing leader for women's rights. Is that all you know? Why "crop" her résumé? I won't do your homework; a cursory search will show her involvement in other issues: "In 1977, she co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978, and, the following year, became the first woman partner at Rose Law Firm. As First Lady of Arkansas (1979–81, 1983–92), she led a task force whose recommendations helped reform Arkansas's public schools, and served on the boards of corporations including Walmart." MInd, that is but a short period in her life; many more accomplishments lay ahead. Hillary always has been ambitious: why would you think, viewing her amazing bio, that she wouldn't have a stellar political career, independent of her husband?  Anyhow, here she is, unpopular among many, like you, who believe what idiots spout off about her.  She is amazing.
Is this hateful, hate filled, anti-American old woman in the USA legally?
"Playing the victim." Ever work in the feild you will hear those words out of abusers mouths like clockwork as justification. That's standard abuser lingo. I agree it's time to stop playing the victim lol, my personal opinion is to cut them down but I don't think my personal opinion should dictate to others situations I know nothing about. As stated by the amazing woman this article is written about, "it's not black and white." At 18 and a parent what were her options? All I know if you just made an abuse victim feel that much worse about herself. WTF man, have some compassion.
No. R or D doesn't matter. What does matter will be the results of Mueller's investigation, as well as his remarks about Mexicans, women, disabled reporters, white supremacists (or his lack of remarks, in that case), etc. I think he's corrupt - not sure if he's a idiot. He's clearly challenged in some fundamental ways, but he has enough smarts to have managed to brand himself and convince others of whatever inchoate wish fulfillment that brand represents. As for evil-incarnate - that's a bad concept. But he is yucky!
Listening to a hypocritical cretin like Yiannopolous is the price we pay for living in a tolerant democracy.  I am glad that he seems to be getting his just desserts, since while I firmly believe even wingnuts deserve a voice, I also believe that we have the right to treat said wingnuts in the only way they truly deserve -- with contempt.  This doesn't mean violence or personal slurs that aren't rooted in fact.  But if a man like this decides to hang himself with statements that approve pederasty, or claims that birth control renders women unattractive, we are free to call him out for the odious little troll that he is.  It's early yet, but I am very interested to see the comments of those who approve of men like Bannon and sites like Breitbart here.  My guess is that we will enjoy a refreshing silence.
Ughhh...how traumatic for her. But yeah, you know how he feels. He told us about his privileges of "being famous," and what women will "let you do." He's a boor.
Thank God every day that this Commander in alternative nostril breather Is not the President. Seriously? What a mess she is! She is an embarrassment  To women everywhere.
Boy, li'l czar Putin the bully boy whining about international law being broken, paints the Russians for what they are, hypocrites of the first order. Too bad about the warning, maybe some of Assad's supporting cast would have seen some action instead of bombing defenseless women and children wherever the Russians invade, eh? The faux Canadians, Putin apologists, Russian trolls can go to.... Trump finally did what Obama should have years ago. Canada and Canadians support the action!
Well Gary, If being tired of the ignorance those on the left constantly display and being annoyed by the lies they propagate defines me as a 'bigot' so be it... I don't see a genuine reason to buy into the term. As far as being a racist - NOT a chance. Most of the liberals we are hearing from during this election and post election time are the true racists. It isn't a 'black or white' thing anymore, it's gone far beyond that. For the RECORD - I care about the 2nd amendment and so do millions of other people... The CRAP about women being 'second class citizens' is just that. Trump has a great track record towards women, do some research and actually check it out instead of believing all the left wing garbage. Of course there are racists across our country - I'm betting more on the left than right. Every time i debunk some crap a left wing nut posts they end up calling me names - including racist - they don't seem to like the truth for some reason so using the 'R' word is their defense.
Calm down liberals.  Trump isn't going to trample on women's rights, civil rights, gay rights, or implement slavery........after all..... he isn't practicing radical islam.
So from this we are to determine you are female, stupid, or likely both?
Ranger - "Too stupid to read, breed a British Whore."  That pretty much sums up your view of women doesn't it? I didn't flag your comment and approved it, btw but this comment regarding stupid women is right in line with the typical abuser of women. Women don't matter, their man has to keep them in line?  Out of all the DV cases you know about, you are focused on the one that the abuser says he was innocent. BTW, how do you KNOW this guy did not abuse the victim? Because your good buddy said he didn't? Hmmmmm.
Russian hacker have compromising blabla..  Really? Dont need to go that far. Most if woman in a 100 km radius around him apparently does as well.. And several who did busness whit him, and, and, and... The list is probly endless.  Fact of the matter is: you were dum enough to elect him pls assumate now.  I am not confortable whit the clown.. But still he won. So let him at least get in the chair so he can fail miserably andthings can move on.
Holding Mr. Trump to higher standards in how he speaks of women is good.  According to economics historian Thomas Sowell, when corrected for experience level women earn more than men. Trying to get even higher pay seems unfair.  If by reproductive rights women mean the "right" to abort their child, please consider that the most basic right of all rights is for a human to live their entire life cycle without another human killing them. Without this right, no other right matters. Both science and God (in the Bible) tell us that the human life cycle begins at conception, even though our Supreme Court has to date not recognized it. You and I have been given that right and we were protected and nurtured during that most vulnerable time by our own mothers. To deny that same right to your own child is therefore hypocritical and immoral. Please use your choice earlier to prevent conception, or after conception to protect and nurture life,  with the help of the man who helped you conceive.
My favorite is the piece done on two women that said Trump harassed them. The reporter made up a whole bunch of things that the women said they never did say. The NY Times is the slim of so called reporting. There are no respectful news outlets left in this country. They get a story and add all their own views and not telling the real stuff. The news these days is just a hunk of crap. Except when the Post says the Bronco's are gong down the toilet.
As Europeans have discovered, such muck-in integration is very difficult to do because of their faith. There are restrictions on what women can do and the men refuse often to work as equals with women. This makes integration into workplaces very difficult. There is a program on the TV in the UK where Muslims are placed in a house together. The disputes over sex roles are illuminating and show how difficult it is to reconcile this belief system with modern life. Some even express very violent views and wish to launch attacks. None of this is helpful for integration.
You cannot compare miscegenation with same-sex unions. Marriage between couples of different races, man and woman, cannot possibly be compared to the parody of marriage which takes place between people of the same sex. The civil law may have forbidden interracial marriages between a man and a woman, God, however, does not. To equate African-Americans with active homosexuals is disgraceful, it is actually worse than racial discrimination as it implies that they are in a similar spiritual state. I'm not an African-American, I am English but were I an orthodox, African-American, Catholic, I would be appalled that the liberal intelligentsia considered me to be even remotely similar to an active homosexual. African-Americans unfortunately may well suffer discrimination because of their race or colour but not because their being African-American was intrinsically immoral.
Yes, the VAGINA negates everything, unless it's being used for making more rethuglican rugrats, pleasure, or, on rare occasion, shooting Ping Pong balls.  At least that's how the GOP view women.
This woman is as fake as her perpetual tan.
Disrespect invites disrespect.......   Hypocrite much?  Sore loser democrat because a woman didn't get elected dividing the country much like Trump did.  Get over it and yourself Meryll.
LOL Women who hate feminists are like black plantation workers who hated abolitionists. Maybe feminists are trying to put some light into the darkness and keep the Church from emptying out.
Misogyny exists everywhere, including in Canada.  However, unlike Canada, Muslim states have elected female leaders at least seven times, including Benazir Bhutto (twice), Sheikh Hasina and Khalida Zia.  Your fear is irrational because of your ignorance.  Just because you don't want to learn about the topic doesn't entitle you to declare that your ignorant condemnation is not irrational.
I was wrong in stating he takes hormones--there is no confirmation that he does. You are correct in pointing out that surgery is not always used to transition.   There is a highly controversial diagnosis known as autogynephilia, which doesn't totally address Wolscht's disorder but seems to partially--men who are aroused by the idea of being women. In his case, the arousal appears to depend on being an underage female/child. This also explains his shacking up with a couple of polyamorous swingers, having sex with "daddy" at a sex club, and so forth.  This notable deviance is the reason why that diagnostic label is no longer in use when talking about transgenderism broadly--it simply doesn't typify the vast majority of people who are transgender.  See my note on the clovergender hoax appended to one of my comments below.
Hahaha, its better than saying Hillary is an example for women. "Look girls, to win anything you need to cheat. To get what you want you need to steal. And when your cornered with no way out delete everything and lie your face off and pretend to be stupid." Stop being a whiny hypocrite .
"Except for the racial element" --- my friend, you just answered why your point is incorrect about my thoughts pertaining to the 1%. And, being a Right-winger, you can't claim anything related to anti-Semitism, considering that Donnie Moscow has inspired the white knights to claim that Jews and other religions—along with many ethnicities—do not belong in white America.  Your points about Bezos and crew are off-base. You name a few of the "good guys", when the vast reality is that many of them are nothing but hedge-funders like Robert Mercer—men with undiagnosed gambling disorders—or they are techbros. Techbros are white guys who pride themselves on being an asshole like Steve Jobs, only techbros don't possess Job's God-given talent. These are fellas who open-source meaningless apps, then hold an IPO to get cash before the public realizes how useless it is. And tech is legendary for hating women and being racist. The people you seem to idolize do nothing for America.
they also need to lighten up.  Having sex is no obstacle to holiness.  That is what this is really about, including the belief that women tempt men into sex that they do not want - a belief that celibates are incapable of seeing as ridiculous.
What a pathetic woman. She had the opportunity to be a good person by forwarding the gift to those that could use them but instead chose to pen a diatribe espousing her twisted beliefs and pimping herself as being superior to others in her profession. Congrats you scumbag you apparently learned the Dewey decimal system after 6 plus years of college.
That ship has sailed.  IMO, no intelligent, decent woman with an ounce of class or pride should vote for this pig.
They are not pro-life, they are pro-birth. And America like many societies on this planet is misogynist to the max. They don't like PP because they are authoritarians who want control of women's bodies and sexuality. That's why they hate contraception!
No, he clearly had the "ideal" parental dynamic: mom and dad.  Think of how different this may have been had he been adored by two women.  You're a jerk.
Don't you get it yet ? Hillary is the anointed one, she could literally shoot someone and get away with it, The first woman, the continuance of a dynasty, America's Queen, Women are going to cringe for generations that of all the smart competent women in this country Hillary Clinton was chosen to represent  :  (
How is Trump racist when his ex gf of 2 years was black?  Sure a racist will go with a black woman for 2 years.  know your facts
There is no part of the law that says a man in the woman's room has to act or dress like a woman. Get a fuckin clue you dumb broad.
Anti-Muslim hate?  Hmm.... I used to support Islam back in the 80s when it was popular to demonize it for abusive attitudes toward women.  I thought that westerners lacked cultural understanding of Islam.  However after many recent years of Islamic terrorists murdering thousands of innocent people I no longer support Islam.  Islamic terrorism is a daily event (Russia is soup-de-jour today, I believe).  There are many countries with large Muslim minorities like France (how has that been working for you lately?).  There are Muslim countries like Turkey (which nightclub do you want to celebrate New Year's Eve in?).  I think Islam is a blight.   I think that Islam is a stupid and barbaric religion forever frozen in 7th century violence.  If I said this in a Muslim country I would be murdered.  If I said this in a European country my life would be in danger.  I believe that in Canada I can still safely say what I think,.... but for how long?
Trump is Hitler incarnate.  The Fourth Reich begins Januar 20, 2017.  He has already announcedhis targets:   Mein Trumpf Vol. One: A Reckoning 1. The Hispanic Peril 2. The Arab Peril 3. The Black Peril 4. The Female Peril ...
What a hypocrite you are! Unbelievable. When there is an article which is void of facts that support your arguments who cannot stop ranting about it. Yet when there is an article void of facts which might contradict your arguments, you just pretend they do not exist. In this case you make a bunch of ASSUMPTIONS...with silly comments referencing "sperm donors" and wondering what this says about the woman in the first place. Even suggesting a visit to Planned Parenthood. Maybe she was divorced...maybe her husband of the first two children left her....or died...you have no clue but that does not stop you from ripping her to shreds. Maybe you should try cleaning up your posts before worrying about Eugene. Incredible.
That woman deserves a much more severe punishment. Unable to have animals for 24 months? Big deal! What happens after that?!!!! The laws protecting animals are so pathetic.
You sound like the Pre-Vatican II Church was against "normal psychological  development," and put rules ahead of souls, fears ahead of joys, and sick repressions ahead of healthy expressions.    You'd have us think grown men were calling the rectory to ask if a 1 a.m. aspirin broke the fast for the next day's 11 a.m. mass and that a grown woman was literally worried sick because her priest saw her enter the theater to see Peyton Place with her husband on their 15th anniversary.   You talk like many innocent films, books, TV shows, art works,  music, and dances were condemned by name from the altar and going to the Episcopal church with Grandma or participating in your Presbyterian uncle's funeral were called grave sins.  Who'd believe you?   Who'd believe the Good Old Days were condemned as Evil Modernity as they were being lived by good, holy, and kind Catholics?  "C'mon Baby, Let's Do the Twist"--Who'd believe you if you said Fr. O'Brien called that an invitation to Hell?   Anyone?
Huh.  I suppose that's one of the reasons that the Church encourages marriage, isn't it.  Sex does not have to be a difficult issue; if you have trouble keeping it in your pants, then don't put yourself in the position where that would create a problem.    Sex has always been a temptation of our species; thank God we have the reason and the will to resist it for the benefit of women, for the benefit of children, and for the benefit of our civilization.  Don't fornicate, don't commit adultery.  Oh, but it feels so good!  What a weak excuse.
Wheeler and Bailey go to vastly different cafeterias.  Jules bailey worships at the same denomination as Falwell/Huckabee/Franklin Graham/Ted Cruz.  His church preaches female submission and that gays are sinful.  He titthes to this church and also does Bible study with them.Even if his conservative fundy evangelical church pretends to be cool- they are the same homophobes as you would find at Liberty University.    Wheeler goes to a more inclusive church, and his sky god is not as scary.  Wheeler and Bailey have some similar policies, but I find Bailey untrustworthy & wishy-washy.  Note that he won't defend the church but still gives it $.  What does Bailey believe and what will he stand up for?  Why does he listen to a Pastor who preaches that Jessica Bailey should submit to Jules Bailey?  I can understand voting for David Schor- but Bailey? Bailey? What a weakling.
When did Shotgun Willie’s become a shooting range? Silly trigger happy fellas! That's the way to get the ladies!
You said Hillary has "no respect for life in the womb." This is simply untrue. It confuses support for Roe v. Wade's protection of privacy with support for abortion. They are not the same thing.  Many of us here are ambivalent about abortion, if not completely opposed to it. I certainly think it's a morally fraught issue. But outlawing abortion is also morally fraught. Look at El Salvador, where women who suffered miscarriages rot in jail because they're suspected of having had abortions! It's a nightmare scenario that should never come to pass in the United States.  I have no sympathy for one-issue voters. I do understand that for some people abortion is such an affront they cannot vote for a pro-choice candidate. But this is no ordinary election. Trump is dangerously unfit to be president. That is simply the reality of the situation. It's incredible that anyone would trust Trump's word on anything, because he's a proven, inveterate liar.
Minority women need to stay at home to take care of their children. Obamacare is for the minorities. If people don't want to pay the higher premiums then don't work.
There are so many things wrong with this article that I don't even know where to begin, this is truly a CNN level of fake news.   The rapes at the Swedish music festival were committed by immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, which is the reason police are investigating the immigrant connection. Muslim men have been committing huge numbers of rapes since Sweden made the mistake of admitting so many members of a 'rape culture' into their country.  As far as violence being committed against women and minorities every day by white men, the group most responsible for murdering black men in the US, by a wide margin, is other black men.   The wage gap is a myth. More men are raped every year than women. Far more men die every year in war, industrial accidents, murders and suicides than women. The 'testosterone empire' you're whining about really isn't a great advantage for men.  Yes, female-only screenings are sexist. Try having a male-only screening of Batman, and see how that goes.
Shameful behaviour from the audience.    Meanwhile the article repeats this lie:  "a video surfaced in which he boasted about grabbing women’s genitals."  He boasted that famous people like himself *could*, not *did*.
The players are employees, and the owner can introduce a new policy.  ESPN, not a conservative network, suspended one of it's host for violating a company policy, regarding social media. What's the difference form suspending an employee, or benching an employee? Oh, the ESPN employee is black and female, a doubled protective class.
I hope you don't have kids if you see this woman's actions as acceptable. And I applaud the den for kicking the kid out.  She brought unwanted negative attention upon them.  However, she will, and is already likely, pay the the price for her stupid stunt.
Show your facts.   No screening would be going backward from today's screening, you're delusional.       I'm not concerned that Hillary would make homosexulaity a crime, or allow American Muslims to discriminate against women or gays.   If they live in this country then they follow American Civil law, she has never suggested otherwise.  You on the other hand supported businesses that discriminate against gay people based on their Christian religion.     http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hypocrite
Give me a break!!  Only now do these two women speak out.  They stayed silent, because they were willing to do anything to achieve fame and fortune in Hollywood. They had a choice and they made bad decisions.  If Reese Witherspoon was assaulted by a director, then why did she choose not to report it?  If Ms. Lawrence had to lose an unrealistic amount of weight over a short period of time, she chose to do so....but she obviously wanted that role so badly she was willing to endure their tactics to lose the weight.  These two women are hypocrites.  They did not HAVE to work in Hollywood, but more importantly, they stayed quiet while others were abused at the hands of these same people.   This type of abuse should never happen, but there's a reason they've used the term "casting couch" in Hollywood for as long as Hollywood has been in existence.
Easy lady . No one is condoning choking a person's wife even if she burn's the husbands dinner or runs over his dog . Even if she votes liberal doesn't make it right to choke or abuse her.   Taking away her car keys , not letting her watch the View , and taking away her weekly allowance money is all fair game. Men make 20 percent more than women doing the same job for a reason. And don't get me wrong---I'm all for women's lib---as long as she's home in time to cook my dinner and rub my feet.
No YOU will get what YOU deserve with a criminal in charge of the country. A woman with no ethics or scruples, one that will violate the law anytime she sees fit. Congratulations! I can't see why anyone would vote for such a terrible person, if you all feel Trump is so bad then vote libertarian, but you won't. It's always party before country with Democrats.
This has nothing to do with sexism, but observation! I saw it yesterday and I was pissed. When I see it, it is mostly a young white woman - however, this past weekend, I did see a young Asian woman do the same.  From what I've seen, it is the women who are the biggest violators. I've seen guys do it also, but 80% of the time, it is a woman. I call it as I see it.
You are not allowed to have something just for men anymore.  Only women can have events on their own these days.  Any attempt for a men's rally or parade would be met with cries of intolerance to women. Our society has officially become ridiculous.  The government doesn't help.  They just apologize to every special interest group and marginalize the average working Canadian.  The majority of the complainers are not valuable contributors to society.  Then the hard working Canadians who pay the tax don't have time to go out and protest and whine, they are paying the bills.  Just sad how we are treated.
Must  be hard to prove, just like when he is verbally and video recorded saying he has sexually assaulted women; like grabbing their private parts, etc. Just "false news" right??? Among many other actions which would land the majority of Americans in prison for a long time, if not, life. All these have been reported long before the donald considered running for public office; and therein lies why the donald hates the news industry as much as he does; just like Putin and othe Dictators of the world.
Yes, it is indeed creepy and a symbol of the commodification of sex and the degradation of women in our culture. All that is over Pattison's head.  Pattison does many good things with his money, but I cannot forgive him for being a dirty climate change Denier. He should be ashamed of himself for being so ignorant.
Just keep beating on the woman who dared to run for president against the wishes of all of the women-haters in the nation led by Trump and the rest of the Republican misogynists and JetRx.
ADN is to politically correct to state the obvious... puke! A minor female was sexually assaulted on Alaska Airlines by a lowlife scumbag pervert. Tell it like it is.
Yes, Trump is a spoiled rich frat boy and a sexual predator who gropes women and boasts about it ..........................
I am far less inclined to focus on their reflection and instead i would insist, as part of parole or whatever, on people being studied electronically..brain scans, pupil dilation studies etc.  I would get a history on everyone..well, I guess that would be reflection.  Two questions:  Yes, but I don't know how much and yes. And not just training, but the selection process.  And yes, the whole culture for a really really long time.  There is a reason that there has been so little shock about this in some clerical circles, because somehow it became normalized.  The really really bad sin was seeing a woman and dealing with children, especially boys who could not get pregnant, avoided that.  That is the key to the stupidity of the bishops, popes etc...it is NORMAL to them, even if they do not do it.
ericnorstog: "Did you read the letter? It talks about rape, not consensual sex." Ahhh...but "therein lies the rub"- The evening's festivities may start with consensual sex, but AT ANYTIME , during, or even days or weeks Later, the woman may decide to reclassify the entire incident as "RAPE"!  To be a young man Entrapped in such a situation is something I would not wish on an enemy! But we instill in the youngest females that "It's Ok, honey, you are not responsible for anything!" EX: A very young (10) girl crawls out a window to meet a 21 year old man, She is completely blameless? and her Parents?
Conversation between trump supporters:  there are videos and recordings of trump talking of demeaning women and groping, clearly the news media and Hollywood made it up!-my 4th cousin was at a bar and read on a napkin that someone said Hillary was mean to bills mistresses, throw her in prison!
It's sad that women support and celebrate their ability to kill a nearly born baby as fast and as easily as possible.   Liberals lead the charge in their efforts to take away everyone's guns to save lives , yet lead they the same charge to kill the most defenseless among us.  The nation mourns 49 innocent people killed in Orlando , yet half the nation celebrates women's right to kill the nearly born babies on demand. We are pulling our hair out trying to figure out how to stop that one nut in 100 million who might be the next mass killer----yet the mass killers are in every town across America---they are our girls and women.  Abortions kill innocent tens of thousands every year in America.  We think of all women as compassionate , when in reality---they are the mass killers we should fear the most. The stats don't lie .  Today isn't a day to celebrate , it's a day we should feel ashamed about. If your reading this , consider yourself lucky---your mom didn't abort you.
Really?  I see it all the time and I don't care. It used to be considered correct etiquette, not so much anymore.   So, how do you feel about a president who brags about  grabbing women's pussies, walking unannounced into teenage girls dressing rooms, plays footsies with the Russians, defrauds paying students and a host of other things.  Or do you want to talk about using CAPS some more?   Yes, I can see that you're all about getting rid of political correctness.
He bragged about doing what these women claim he did... so either he was boasting about his assaults...or he was making up a   story about assaulting women to look like a big shot...I realize this isn't dispositive, but it sure paints an ugly picture anyway you slice it...  Either he was sufficiently stupid and arrogant to think this wouldn't backfire on him...or he wanted it because as long as this stuff is swirling around the bowl he doesn't have to talk about anything else...because he has nothing else......but if this is any indication of how he manages a crisis he needs to be at the daycare center with the other 4 year olds...
And I can give you a whole history down through the centuries with popes, cardinals, bishops and priests who had sex with women, girls, and boys----they didn't care which.     Because Pope Sixtus IV [1471-84] collected church tax on prostitutes and charged priests for keeping mistresses, it's believed that this was what increased the clerical homosexuality---not being homosexual.
Men are just as greedy and nasty as women.   I'm female and I was the bread-winner.  While I was out of town on business my then-husband emptied the house and bank accounts and moved in with his old flame ... and then sued me for spousal support (because he could not work - he was "disabled" because he was an alcoholic).  It cost me a huge amount, financial and self-esteem.  But it was the best thing that could of happened to me - I will never let a man walk all over me again.  Any my ex?  He spiraled down and out of control, and then died.   The way I see it - I dodged a bullet.  A very painful lesson, but after decades of being a door mat I will never let that happen again.  It's now etched in my brain forever.  To ALL young people today - earn your OWN money and get a good prenup.  Take care of yourself.
You think there is no company that only hires women ?  You're not living under a bridge, you're apparently living under a rock.
Anyone who intentionally uses the wrong bathroom has issues . Just saying " trust me , I won't hurt anyone "   or  " no one has harmed anyone yet " isn't good enough .  It's sad we have to make laws to address what should come as common sense and decency to everyone.  What do you say to your young daughter who says some guy is walking around with nothing on in the women's shower ?  That guy deserves to be behind bars or an old school lesson decency .   What the heck is so terribly wrong with society that anyone would defend this insanity and be will to put young women at risk ?  Bruce Jenner went from an American hero to American disgrace , and some people applaud him ?  We have become sick that we think his behavior is to be celebrated .
Given that men back a form of media that dehumanises us, shows us enjoying violent attacks on our genitals cloaked as 'sex' and promotes gang attacks, rape and paedophilia, i think women are right to point out how being objectified, ie stripped of our humanity, effects us and our ability to live our lives. White men are used to keeping women, children and poc down by the judicious use of threats and violence, often covered up as humour. Without looking at the wider picture of male violence against women and children you are deliberately taking this comment out of context in order to strip it of its nature, ridiculing a human by comparing her to a sexualised doll.
I would not want someone like the character Trump representing me regarding this Nation nor the World.  I do believe you have to have a quality of diplomacy to engage w/leaders of the world.  Whatever message Trump has on policies is lost due to his temperament and lack of humility and especially his moral degradation.    I abhor HRC as much.  The fact that so many focused on her being the first woman president sickens me.  Who cares!  She is a liar, thief and well experienced at talking from both sides of her mouth.  She's pushed fracking world wide and bragged about it.  Just too much nasty baggage for her to hold that office.  She is so fake w/the public and a hawk in private.  I really, for the first time in my 60+ years, do not have any interest in voting.  If I vote for anyone it will be for the green party.
Clearly they are sexist and biased against men. This man was fired because he used logic and deductive reasoning to understand a pattern occurring in his work place. Not only did this poor man not say anything negative about women or men he just expressed facts. It's so sad that a company like google can use their power to suppress the opinions and positive strides towards understanding a simple concept such as patterns in workplace environments. You can't voice your opinions men or the feminazi's will get you!
The one thing DEMS had in common is they didn't care THEIR candidate was a lying career criminal with obligations to countries that murder gays and Christians AND treat their women worse than their dogs... Guess that tells us a LOT about the LEFT and THEIR lack of values.
Why would single women in their 20s want to settle down?? That's dumb. Boys apparently don't become "men" until possibly their early 70s.
Then you spit on the men and women who died for your country Shame on you
A neophyte like myself might make such a comment, intending to compliment the women working for me, but this guy is a politician who should have honed his stupidity filter into a world class instrument by now.
Cosby gives Blacks a bad name, no? After reading so many techniques he used with his star celebrity status, he is the BEST rapist I have ever heard of. Wonder if someone will write a crime story about him when more facts come out in the trial. It's going to be a challenger to the OJ Simpson trial. Please do hurry up and start it. I don't want him or I to die of old age too soon. It's going to be a fascinating trial. What I'm curious about are these questions. Were these women given monetary gifts afterwards? Were they looking forward to an adventure of being "raped" by a black man, especially a Hollywood celebrity? But were angry that they fell asleep and missed the fun? Why did they continue to stay if they realized they entered a room full of only well-dressed black men? Were these victims angry because they gave sex thinking they were going to get glamour or well-paying jobs? Prepare yourselves. He may just get ACQUITTED.
What a bunch of crap ever since we had a Black Muslim President from Kenya for 8 yrs. These jerks trying to follow the Jive Man ways. { Oh it is o'kay a male can go into a woman rest-room, It is okay to use drugs, all the bull crap he spread thru our nation some people are still trying follow  his ways. Enough is Enough People back our old respectful ways of America.
Woman that are bent on condemning the male gender are usually bitter disgruntled vile trollips who are bent on vitriol and guile. Case in point..... Payrollgirl
Why come here if you hate white people so much? Funny how everyone wants to come to White nations though isn't it! I mean Mexico for Mexicans, India for Indians, China for Chinese, Japan for Japanese, ME for Arabs but White Nations for everyone?? Your anti white hatred shows? Why come here if you don't like music, pork, beer seeing women dressed normal, dogs? There is lots of room in the ME for you. Oh I know why they come here, it's for the welfare! I do miss the old days of European migrants who worked their butts off and made this country great! Built this country, defended this country against that dictator you seem to associate us with. You are anti white, please leave you aren't good enough for Canadian values, why don't we let smart hardworking Latino's or Asians in ?
Tell you what, when white women form the The Right Ladies, we can vilify and openly mock them. Deal?
OMG can't you come up with anything original?!  What are you doing?!  Using the newspaper as your crib notes?!  Stop talking!  I'm embarrassed for you!!!  First you talk about googling nude women, then you can't even make an intelligent, unique statement!  You aren't very bright are you.....
OH my god. A woman divorced the nation's least funny actor. She should be BURNED ALIVE.
Sure, it's actually a left-wing liberal conspiracy. But it works the other way too for you  on the right .  You for example probably believe the one about Hillary giving birth to an alien baby, and the nonsense about Benghazi, not to mention the one about the cover up of her having MS. And you don't believe that Trump cheats his workers, cheats on his wife, cheats at golf, sexually assaulted women, etc. etc. etc.
Hillary is so far removed from the Real World.  She is still living in the past.  I would never DARE to tell my magnificent wife HOW to vote or WHO to vote for any office.  Geez, Hillary just because you married Bill and put up with his indiscretions (to keep moving up the political ladder) tells a lot of ladies, that you are not too bright.   I mean, I do not know any woman in her right mind who would put up with his crap.  So no respect for you.
The ultimate irony with the Hebdo cover is that literally thousands of Texans fought and died in WWII, many on French soil including during D-Day to help liberate France from the real Nazis, Hitler's Nazis, not some imaginary fake Texas Nazis who don't even really exist. Many of the dead flood victims were poor, African-American and Hispanic Texans who didn't have the means to escape, including that woman whose poor kid was clinging to her floating body before being rescued. That kid is black. Oh, but she "deserved" to see her mother die, it was "karma" because the state she happened to live in leans Republican and Trump got all their electoral votes. That's the sick, twisted logic of ignorant liberal-progressives.
Why not Clinton?   I'm starting to wonder how much of it is based on latent misogyny or at least unconscious fear about a woman being in charge.  I mean, I have felt a lot of the same misgivings about her but when you look at the charges...without a paranoid, tin-foil hat on....and imagine a man doing exactly the same things, minus all the hoopla and outrage that are part of the feedback loop of the unconscious aforementioned....HE would be a cake walk over Donald "only looking out for one person" Trump.   Seriously. As a country, we have a dark history of racism and misogyny (women couldn't vote until 90 years ago!). The only reason people are willing to even consider handing our country over to that ridiculous man-boy...is because we're secretly scared of a woman being in charge. Like letting a girl be the leader of our tree fort! We'd rather have the class bully even if he'd burn it down and steal our lunch money.  I'm voting for Hillary!
Thank you and I agree. The accusations Bell made were unfounded and unsupported by facts. We all watched trump encourage his supporters kick out of his rallies anyone who disagreed with him and encourage violence against them. Trumps actions were not hidden but in plain view when he made fun of the disabled, war veterans, women and admitted to being a sexual predator when bragged about grabbing women's privates. Trump has shown over and over he is a bully and a narcissist. Those who try to defend him end up using unsubstantiated claims Or deflecting to Hillary and Obama. I feel sorry for people like Bell who, if trump has his way, will suffer the most. It's time the republicans put our country above their party and became patriots.
It is not Islamophobia Its a deep and logical distrust of the Muslim religion because we have the damn good right to be suspicious of a religion that kills innocent people, kills women, kills children, then subjugates billions to an orthodoxy of hate Muslim surrender their freedom to a god that doesn't exist.  That ain't racism you Marxist dog Its common sense!!
Why are papers like the Toronto Star failing. Maybe because they have been hijacked by radical feminists and anti-white militant.
It's jusy a small group(again)  screaming to have everything their own way.  I don't believe it is healthy for children to be taught that women must take the back of the room when worshipping,  but can they not do this at home? Why does the school board only focus on the rights of a minority,  fear of being labelled that old m-103 islamophobia name.  So now this trumps any other religion,  or human rights?  What a bunch of useful idiots!
Sex is often used by a low status woman to gain access to resources that she otherwise cannot gain. Women use sex not only for financial gains but to advance her careers, to develop her intellect, to enrich her experience. That is often why title IX in university campus makes sense (although some denounce it as a kangaroo court) because we do not want to make a university campus a cesspool dripping with genital fluid where nubile students are blowing their professors during office hours for fucking reference letters for graduate school. This is an insult to cleaning staffs. However, historically female students have been dating their professors and gained a helping hand in career promotion. This pattern of trade between female sex and male resource is common in other industries (especially in arts) where nurturing is required by people high in dominance hierarchy.   The bad part is much of deal making is left in the dark and stuff of rumours, cryptic messages in the bathroom.
What the bleep is with this crap?  We're celebrating a culture that enslaves women, beats them if they show any skin and marries them off at 9 years old?  Get your heads out of your asses Globe!
SpekAK: Totally agree.  Where are the Leftist feminists on this one? 80% of illegal immigrant females are being raped while illegally crossing the boarder- and the perpetrators are other illegals or Mexican 'coyotes.'  Most of them have neither heard of that term or would do anything about it, because the media will never publish it, and they wouldn't listen, even if they did.
Interesting dynamic emerging.  The Bully is getting bullied back.  When that occurs, it tends to mean the end of the Bully.  Clearly, America, and thankfully, the GOP leadership, will not follow Trump's lead and try to downplay or cover for the White Supremacist movement.  My compliments to the men and women of conscience holding positions of leadership in America, who have stood to condemn White Supremacy, White Nationalists, Neo-nazis, KKK, etc.  Are you watching your TV, Mr. President?  Take notes.  True American Leadership is on display, while you hide behind your in some cases anonymous, cowardly and "loser" (as well, alarmingly as potentially White Supremacist) spokespersons.
Trump has been around this long only because he’s a white guy with tons of white privilege. He should have been gone a long time ago, especially after screaming “tell ‘em to go f**k themselves” at a campaign and bragging about being able to grab women by their pu**y because he’s rich and famous.
The little girl with the sign also believes that homosexuals must be killed, Israel and Jews  must be  eradicated, Christians can have their heads cut off, and women including herself are the property of men who may  beat them.  Ain't she sweet?
my pastor says they go on white girl rape frenzies.
female assassins for kim
Norman...hey we lost and so did 275 million Americans...you have company in the loss. Women lost the most as they got to see sexism cast it's ugly pall. Young people lost because they had thought that civil rights and a civil society protected them from evil...the moral code is broken, again, and they are in danger. Of course anyone who reads, listens, thinks and follows science lost because again beliefs trump reality..flat earth, young earth, anti climate science, clean water, clean air all lost. A healthy new economy lost as we change to sustainable growth, energy policy, real jobs for the future. Truth let big time, or biggly' would be better...as we are overrun with garbage from trolls that looks real but doesn't pass the smell test. S if ou want to tell women what to do, you won. If want to crash the dreams of children, you won. If you want to ruin the good work of the last 8 years, you won. But please know that you own this idiot and we are watching!
Thank goodness there was another individual sitting next to this girl and did what was right.  Disgusting.
"Or, the RCC could promote unity by ordaining women."  Ordaining women to the priesthood in the CC has to be on principle, otherwise we will look foolish, especially among the Orthodox, who don't ordain women to the priesthood. But ordaining or doing anything to "promote" something or an agenda never works
Interesting... To me, it is surprising how much the feminist contingent of the regressive left "stand with islam" despite their absurd treatment of women.
Gee, women have no sense of humor and are calling all men that don't kowtow to them PIGS.
here's another Fine Democrat for you today: http://www.opslens.com/2017/08/14/when-the-left-eats-its-own-white-female-gov-candidate-shouted-down-in-georgia/ Basically:  Protesting a Democratic White Woman candidate for the same seat, #trustblackwomen  it's sad, seeing Democrats condoning racism within their Racist Party
"the only woman in my house is intelligent and has a brain."?  Hmmm... seems apparent 'Crooked Hillary' knows another crook and apparently not everyone is as in the know as they believe which is the point.  "Hillary Clinton’s newest surrogate is brushing aside reports, gleefully trumpeted by Trump supporters, that she was involved in an attempted murder in 1998 and subsequently threatened to kill a judge. “You know, I have my past. Of course, everybody has a past. I’m not a saint girl. But that is not the point now.” [New York Magazine]
If you knew his real story you wouldn't spout the "silver spoon" crap. After Nick disappeared, his Widow picked quite the second husband. I used to work for him. Many years later, there he was on America's Most Wanted for gyping rich ladies out of their money. I almost lost my cookies. You think that was a picnic for Markie? If you knew what we called him in school, you'd shut your trap, Cheechako! He's a Good Man who tried to his best for him home: Alaska!
“for every ethnic group without exception, incarceration rates among young men are lowest for immigrants.”  How many times will this statistical ploy have to be discredited before activists and special interests stop reciting this nonsense?   Lawful immigrants are carefully screened for criminal backgrounds and potential to become contributing members of society and consequently have a lower crime rate than natives. Those who have crossed the border unlawfully are indeed disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system.   We could include enough nuns in a pool of hookers to construct a statistical model showing that these are virtuous ladies.
This is absurd and that teacher should be fired immediately. Who would ever trust that crazy stupid woman? Teach the girls to use Lego's too! Not just the boys... She said Gender equality... She's being being racist against the boys and that is called sexism. No way to sugar coat this... Indeed She does have an axe being sharpened for 5 YEAR OLD BOYS! She is making CHILDREN VICTIMS OF SEXISM. She's even teaching the girls to be superior to men by limiting the boys in their choices, That's not the education I would want my child to have- that is Embarrassing!!! Because of her own personal feelings, she will sacrifice those children's education?!   I'm supportive of equality... But how dare she take what all women have fought YEARS to obtain and urinate on it? How could she be sexist against those innocent boys?! Is she going to start separating them by color next?!
Richard my only request is people that make comments have to use their real name. You have something to say, then be man or woman enough to stand by your statement with your real name not this crap you see now.
How could there be a stigma attached to something that is private--who would know if someone uses birth control other than the people involved. Only in an idiotic society like America would such ideas as "only nice girls get pregnant, others use birth control" prevail. If one is sexually active one needs to find as reliable a method of birth control as possible in order to reduce recourse to abortion which is inconvenient. In most other countries that can be compared with the US, such ideas as those expressed by Dejain would be considered a sign of a intellectual deficiency or lack of education. Religious sentiment still runs deep here in backwards America.
Sarah...sickening article.........with the only U.S. president to have bragged on video about grabbing women by their genitals. ....you forgot to include our PM,the first pm to elbow woman...he's no better...and you want  to talk about windbags, how about whaling sophie...please she's a bigger whackjob than Trump.
The people attacking and smearing Trump with nasty insults like Mika and Joe have done can dish it out but they can't take it. I'm glad he gave them a taste of their own venom; they deserved it. And no, this has nothing to do with "attacking women."
Where are all the shrill women libbers. 80 yr old marries 12 year old.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9XlMYVrB8
So are you. It is called freedom. Love it or leave it is old and never made any sense anyway. Just a stooooopid quip to put down people who don't agree with a life of pre-meditated war. We need less citizens who feel privileged and less men who want to play with big, dangerous, lethal TOYS. And we would be better off with a woman president............. thank God Hillary wasn't the first FEMALE.....ruthless. Bye Bye!
It “turns men into louts”?  No, sexual liberation, pushed and promoted by women and women alone, turns women into sluts (I mean that in a sex-positive, SlutMarch kind of way).  Well done, er,....ladies.  Well done.
Yes, I used it. I'm not blaming anyone for anything, just pointing out your hypocrisy for calling me out on it while you have nothing to say about the protestor. You also called me out for racism, but my only mention of race was the white woman driver. I think you're just wanting to post something so you can write "cheeto face von clownstick and the handful of deplorable miscreants," sort of like Beavis and Butthead.
I'm a staunch, hardcore dirty stinking anarchist feminist weirdo (also a straight, white cismale, for the record). I hate AVFM and the entire disgusting MRA/PUA/MGTOW misogynist circlejerk. Their efforts to downplay and minimize the harm society still does to women is utterly heinous.  But I have a bit of an issue with the tone of some of this article because I feel that it supports behaving in a similarly crappy way to how a lot of anti-feminists behave. If a group wants to start men-only shelters, who cares? If they're not obstructing women's shelters or other useful projects, I don't see an issue. Yes, their rhetoric is misleading. And yes, their stats are incorrect compared to more recent sampling. So we can criticize that.  It's just rather noxious to me when a group that is purporting to do good (misguided, perhaps, but hey, there might actually be a need for a male shelter) gets obstructed. Let's let them create a shelter. Let's support positive acts, k?
Fox was just pure sleaze.  I hope they clean up the place.  I urge any woman who has assaulted to sue for millions.  Of it costs them enough, the guys will stop.  Just a horrible network full of lies for the imbecile trump
ah yes, the inevitable mixing of pedophiles and homosexuals in an effort to say they're all the same.  It's every bit as insulting as claiming all heterosexual men are girl fondlers.  But hey, whatever it takes to do the Christian thing and smear others, right?
Are the Muslim women protesting Islam and Muhammad for relegating them to lower status than men?
That's is just too bad.  Any man who thinks that women are collateral damage and should not be administered remedies to terminate a pregnancy because of life threatening conditions is, in fact, a sadist.  I, personally, do not take men's opinions on pregnancy and birth control seriously, because they are totally ignorant.  I always encourage women to ignore men and their dictates.  We have a conscience, and our first priority is to save our own lives, and not obey men who only care about females when they are in the womb.  I've been around a long time and I've spoken to hundreds of men like you.  You want to control women with pregnancy. You want to deny them a satisfying sex life by denying them birth control.  That's why we don't listen to you anymore.  We know that God is not a sadist.
isn't  a  feminist   either  a  rich   white  woman married  or  divorced  from a  rich  white  man or  a  hairy  legged, manless  lesbian?  Certainly  looks  that  way  to  me.
Dear Mr. Biden,  I know your puppet in Canada won't be brave enough to tell you, but somebody should, so I will.  The "Canadian" government has been running some serious deficits lately.  The combined federal and provincial net debt has increased to around $1.3 trillion. This debt is about $35,827 for every man, woman, and child living in Canada.   In short, we're already hurting and we don't want to dig our hole of debt any deeper. So please, Mr. Biden, please meet with whoever you are going to photo-op with when you come to "Canada" via Skype.  It's perfectly secure and the already-maxed-out "Canadian" government won't have to shell out any more millions of future "Canadian" taxpayers' money on something as shamefully wasteful and useless as your visit.    Thanks very much for your understanding, Mr. Biden.  Sincerely, Karl Marx Jr.
"You throw like a girl"  does not equal "You're a f**g".
Are you referring to brother Bill and his many "conquests" ? Or, was Bill getting BJ's by a intern like "not inhaling" ? Oh, that's right, "he did NOT have sex with that woman"! How about the longer term affair,  20 years or so, wasn't it ? Bill continues to have his feet kissed and awarded honors by everyone, even got a fish named after him.  But then we had JFK and his women, is that who you are referring to? I guess old Dwight had a problem before he was elected.....does that count ? FDR we know had his love affair outside of his marriage bed. Frankly, I do not have a problem with sexual relationships between consenting adults, where power and control is not used.  But that is where the problem comes in for Billy Boy.  So, Bernie Sanders looks better everyday.  For me, it's the hypocrisy of the Democrats!  We all know the Republicans are liars but the Democrats are better at lying and fooling the people.
You can have all of those things, without the self-gratification of involving the sex organs, right?  In fact, I've me a lot of women over my years who were quite satisfied with all of the above, less the sexual penetration.  On the flip side, I've known few guys who were interested in more than penetrating and leaving as quickly as possible afterwards.
Some of us actually believe that it's common sense that woman are human beings...and should be able to go jogging if they wish - without being raped. Crazy right?
I think it was grievous. Lewinsky was an intern and he was the President. Just as a teacher shouldn't be in a relationship with a student because that would be a misuse of the authority and trust that comes with the position, Bill should have made sure there was nothing going on with an intern. He was also cheating on Hillary. So not much good going on there.   I'm not making excuses for Donald, though. Walking in on naked teenagers,  groping women, allegations of rape, sexual harassment suits all paint a picture of a nasty man.
Woman. What a bunch of gossiping dirty birds.....they're all alike... Any curious group of men would be excoriated for this conduct.   I dont think this enters the "neckro" relm though. I also dont think these dirty birds need to lose jobs over it. Maybe a wrist slap.  There I said it!
Yeah instead they should let some dumb hick or burned out crack head beat the shit out of the women their with.
What took so long? Her record of lying, stealing, dishonesty  and vileness have been known for decades. She is a despicable person and an embarrassment to honorable women.
yaah this is good posting for women  <a href="http://www.adultvibes.in/index.php?main_page=page&id=9l">sexual</a>  feeeling
If progressives and feminists and the Globe want to allow columns like this one that attacks masculinity they need to allow comments like this one and not delete them.  "Clinton lauds women's courage in wake of Weinstein allegations"  What???? This is the same Clinton who accepted Weinstein as a friend? His behaviour was far from a secret. Where was she? Why wasn't she attacking him years ago? Was she too busy cashing his fund raising cheques?  You know what's toxic? Feminists like Clinton who use feminism to push their own agenda but when it hurts them in the wallet they back off.
Great. Demographics are changing, that's like pining your hopes on a glacier melting to put out a forest fire.   The same states are in play as the last four elections, nothing has changed.   As a liberal, I will go on record now that unless Hillary chooses some kind Vice Presidential super person she will lose.  I'm sure you will post some meaningless poll that says she is super woman but we all know polls this far out are pretty much junk.
Instead of saying "I'm sad and will kill myself," these entitled, misguided men say, "She made me sad. I'll kill her and myself. You don't see women lying in wait or going to a workplace to kill their exes.
anytime you think your woman enough for your Geronticide come get me. Just saying. Pinhead.
Silly ASAA, if the parents of a girl who was beaten by Ice, sue they will win, based on international track and field rules, the rights of female atheletes were not protected
Robbers look for weaknesses like females and slow walkers carrying purses or large bulky shopping bags. They follow them until they're in quiet lonely places with less crowds. Grab and run. Beat or stab if resists. Soon one will die.
Yup, she is a girl and it is disgusting that the ADN is allowing these hateful abusive comments to stay up. Would they let comments calling black men "boy" and use of the "N" word to stay up. They would not, but because this story is about a transgender person and whoever monitors these comments doesn't have the proper amount of knowledge to discern abuse in this instance.
Makes me wonder if anyone has tried to create a safe space for Congressional staffers to report the behavior of members. If these guys are stupid enough to act inappropriately with their female colleagues, what do you think they're doing to the young women (and men) who work there?
Sure, the product of the true sexual union between a man and a woman in marriage could very well be  another unique person with an immortal soul.  The ONLY product of the sexual union betwen two homosexuals is spilled seed or eggs and some fecal matter.    Pick 'em!
You can warn them all you want but there are so many men and women in society that are just plain IGNORANT and STUPID.  Its like the warning on cigarette packages, This product causes CANCER, and people still smoke it.     Read the Sign:  IGNORANT & STUPID..............
Her pro-choice voting record and policies notwithstanding, Clinton has done more to reduce the number and the rate of abortions in this country than Trump ever has or ever will. Donald Trump is a vulgar boor who has built his presidential campaign on xenophobia, racism, misogyny and nativism.  He ridicules  women, mocks the disabled and attacks racial, ethnic and religious minorities.  He’s a serial adulterer and accused rapist and molester. To associate such a person with the 'pro-life' and 'pro-family' movements is to make a mockery of those movements and of the people who genuinely care about them; to vote for him on those grounds is an exercise in hypocrisy designed to rationalize a vote for a racist, for a fascist. Deplorable.
The so-called 'scientists' are prolly just like the Puszy Marchers who violently attacked Pro-Life Women's Groups.
Fine. Look for talented women with the competency to serve. Don't just do it for gender balance.  There are too many examples of incompetent women gaining leadership roles: just look at the BC and Ontario premiers.
Well here's some lyrics from one of his most recent hits "Rap God":  I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table Over the back of a couple of faggots, and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact  You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'? Little gay-looking boy So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy You're witnessing a massacre Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy "Oy vey, that boy's gay!", that's all they say, looking boy  Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad Singin' to a man while they played piano  But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons, make lemonade then! But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?  One for good measure: Don't be a retard – be a king? Think not
Was Kathleen Wynne in the March?  She didn't support women's right?  Coward!
“You don’t go through a six-month period like we just did and (not have) some people jump off the bandwagon, or mistrust you,” he said at the time. “I understand that. I’m not that naive.”--Altman  Wow. Is that what he thinks happened? That people jumped off the bandwagon? Hey, Dana Altman, you recruited a player who was under investigation for sexual assault at his previous school and then you either lied about knowing this or were incompetent for not knowing. Your pathetic and embarrassing press conference after those three players were kicked out was the epitome of ignorance about the realities of rape and sexual assault that women face. Now you want to play it off as people just didn't believe in you? Go to hell, you selfish bastard! 1 in 4 women will be raped in their lifetimes. 1 in 10 women at the U of O will be raped in their time at university--this is a true horror. And you're whining about "bandwagons" and not being "naive." Damn, but I hate you.
Andersons' pants are dripping wet in orgasmic excitement over the dear woman in his presence. #FakeNews
Mr Mbalula. You are the Minister of Police. When can we expect your corrupt colleagues to be prosecuted? I believe charges have been filed. So stop pretending to care and take action. Your words are meaningless hypocritical drivel until you do. Oh, and please refrain from commenting on economic concepts. When did you ever run a business? When did you ever contribute a single cent to our GDP? You clearly think only of taking from the people who do to give their hard earned income to your buddies and voters...and then you call it redistribution. Is this form of organised theft to buy you votes really the only policy you can offer? Maybe you think your black colleagues are simply too useless to compete in an open capitalist economy ? If I was one of the many highly competent black businessmen and women in this country I would be quite offended by you.
This past weekend I saw on television footage of a woman marching against fascism and racial intolerance.  She was carry a sign that said, "White People Suck."  Which "side" do you think she was on?
So now it's a global conspiracy of women; at the rate Two Tone Trump is going, on a trajectory between a greek tragedy and a shakespearean farce, it wouldn't surprise that some women start calling for a National Lysistrata Month until Trump gets exiled. Something like that  would make Saddam Husein more popular in a poll!  Dissing on women in attempt to get more female voters has got to be the most stupid campaign tactic of all time.
'Mericans suck.......they like too pre judge EVERYONE ELSE! Look in the mirror 'Merican You dropped nukes on innocent women and children BUT NOW your SCARED of North Korea??? Hahahaahahhaahahahahahahahahha
You're an idiot! Period! As a 53 year old woman, I love Bruce's music and him and his music is still relevant to me today as it was in 1980. Thanks for putting our guy in the media again. Idiot!!
What kind of "investor" forwards their money to an organization reborn from a bankrupt partnership,  to become a brand new entity with the exact same business model?   Sounds like there's a sucker born every minute.   And we don't need more government regulation-- just throw this woman in jail for breaking laws that we already have.   Meanwhile, let her "investors" kiss their money good-bye for being so gullible.
Irrelevant Rightonleft.....I matters not if all people are nicey nice....what matters is that cultural values are different and that will always drive a wedge between even normal people.  When woman in Europe are accosted by muslim men for merely walking ahead of their spouse, things are bad.  I don't believe those muslim men would behead anyone, but the fact that they take it upon themselves to 'police' others around them to their stoneage standards should scare everyone.  We are not immune here.....
Justin  treats women as pretty little things to take his selfie pictures with because they make him look sexy. No ugly  chicks in his selfies.
This MOTHER of 2 young men, who he has chosen to blatantly and shamelessly discriminate against would not and most certainly will not ever vote for this joke of a PM EVER.  If you think women are fawning over him because of his ridiculous targets, you are seriously mistaken.
Polls strongly indicate that most Muslims are for Shariya law -- that means, laws that gays should be killed, apostates killed, women killed.  This matters.   More than pretty smiles.  There was another election, as it were.  Polls show Muslim sentiment just as I describe it.   They voted against your ideals.
Who is Kahn to tell US lawmakers what to do!? Were they voted in to represent Mr. Kahn??  As for loosing sons in Iraq many, many ,MANY Americans lost their sons and daughters  that way, I don't see THEM trying to dictate US policy. I see the Kahns USING the death of their son to whatever they hope to gain .  My own research revealed that true muslim women are PROUD to sacrifice their sons, they are happy to HAVE sons whom to sacrifice As far as Trump is concerned: These "reporters" spin and twist the facts. And you, ADN, are so rabidly against Trump, you lost any claim to objectivity.
I don't CARE WHAT RACE this dingbat is. Anyone who heard her ridiculous rant of "Reclaiming my time!" will be convinced she has egg salad in her brain. I just could NOT believe when I heard the audio of this on the Hannity radio show. I thought the show was playing some kind of joke by playing the recording over and over, but then I realized SHE was speaking "Reclaiming my time!" over and over. I looked this up: 14 times in two minutes. Is this how "strong" smart women are supposed to argue back with a man? That's 42 words she wasted. She sounded like a total idiot. I kept thinking, "SAY SOMETHING MEANINGFUL ALREADY!" A three-year-old could have argued back better. You don't show your strength or intelligence by yelling "Reclaiming my time!" over and over. Someone should have put a sock in her mouth after the third repeat. Go ahead, google it. Maxine Waters needs to step down. She's lost her marbles.
Yes, it is groping tape, Muslim ban, McCain not war hero, illegal rapist immigrants, Obama founder of ISIS, Hillary nasty woman..........  What more?
I don't particularly care if Margaret Sanger was a racist, spoke a KKK rallies, and ate black babies. I do think abortion should be an option to women in almost every circumstance. I also think women AND men should be responsible for preventing unwanted pregnancies. In this day and age, unwanted pregnancies can pretty much be avoided. Fund Planned Parenthood!
Wife Ivana Trump in 1989, under oath accused Trump of violent rape. In the divorce settlement, she then said she felt violated, but not rape in the 'legal' sense, whatever that means. Jill Harth in 1997 accused Trump of sexual assault in a federal lawsuit. Trump settled out of court. Child rape case 1994, filed in April 2016. The case is quite credible given his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, who pimped children for rich guy parties. Trump praised Epstein on occasion as liking to surround himself with beautiful women, and some of them are young...  Tiffany Doe in the case said, her party planner duties were “to get attractive adolescent women to attend these parties.”   She stated, "I personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform various sexual acts with Donald J. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were advised that she was 13 years old."
Will you people stop! It's a goddamned job - get over it. This circle jerk of cuddle this , and fondle that because a women did it - is for wimps.  Business is about eating what you kill. I sold 40 million in services one year. So what? You start the next year at zippo.... You do a great job - you go for a beer, have a laugh - move on Leave the circle jerk for teenage boys
Geez Ms. Harrop, aren't you a bit late to the party?  Like REALLY late?  Mainstream media have spent a TON of time minimizing and excusing the behavior of drug addicts in general, both white and black and brown etc.  I agree this is a matter of a pregnant drug addict being stupid and paying the ultimate cost for her stupidity.  And for those who might come trotting along to decry the judgmental nature of your column and my comment, let me point out that this woman was the perfect example of how nothing is going to help these addicts until they help themselves...this woman was court ordered into treatment which she promptly ignored.  In other words, you can lead an addict to treatment but you can't make them participate.
The photo for the medical show has a female health care professional earnestly guiding a female medical student wearing head cover.  It looks like the show is boldly going where no politically correct show has gone since...  ... Little Mosque on the Prairie.  But am I correct to assume that they cast a white man as the moron who tore all his fingers off while drunkenly snowmobiling or something?
Donald - Islam equates women with dogs and they execute homosexuals.   Donald doesn't mention how many Syrian lepers he's welcomed into his home, but I'd bet ten dollars to a stale donut hole the answer is "zero".
It's called cognitive dissonance. Trudeau claims to be a feminist, yet he accuses anybody who questions Islam's attitude towards women's rights to be Islamaphobic.
Letterman is a partisan hack who had successfully alienated half of his prospective audience- just like Colbert, Kimmel and Fallon.  Obama was off limits to ridicule and granted a pass, while Trump is excoriated every night.  Is it really that hard for them to be equal opportunity bashers and make fun of Dems along with Repubs?  Letterman was also accused of sexually harassing his female staff, something that conservative entertainers routinely get canned for, but here is Letterman getting a brand new show.  Where's the outrage?  As always, IOKIYAD.
I used to think there might be some method to Donald Trump's madness, but it becomes clearer every day - as he alienates Mexico, China, women, minorities, disabled people, the media, his own intelligence service, war veterans such as John McCain, parents of fallen soldiers and on and on the list goes - that he is just a lying, bullying and self-promoting jerk who has no idea how to lead a country. The posters here who think this is all about negotiating and leverage have a gigantic blind spot regarding Trump's true character. His behaviour is not a reflection of his deal-making skill or his intelligence but rather of his pathology. There is a long and detailed record out there of Trump's chronic lying, deception and self-aggrandizement and his first few days in the White House are merely continuing his shameful record - only now his  pathology is having global consequences.
comedy, here the author condemns some women being referred to as bimbos' etc, but has no problem calling trump crazy. Not one of these people with pseudo anger at Trump remotely had a problem with Pelosi shamelessly exploiting a women's issue just to say republican's hate women.
You're a funny guy, Debbiedowner.  When did a person with a third grade education at best become qualified to criticize an accomplished woman of letters?   Answer: never, until the Trumpnuts found their idiotic "voice."
I can't help but wonder your opinion on the sort of art that Carroll Dunham, Lena's father, paints. Just butts and vag from behind, big boobies, no faces. Is this male gaze acceptable because he yelled "feminism!" before painting a woman with a gun stuck up her anus and vulva exposed?   I guess I'm just wondering why battle history when the present contains the same.   https://www.google.com/search?q=lena+dunham%27s+dads+art&biw=1252&bih=602&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjvtsPbnqLSAhULxmMKHVlCCVsQsAQIHA#imgrc=U8vpK6XebwdxOM:
Why do they allow the purposefully targeting of the breeding stock which is done by derbies? Not only does it encourage people to do it, but it pays them money on top of it.  People who kill the large female halibut don't deserve a prize, they deserve a fine. Same goes for the towns that organize the total stupidity of derbies.
Being a homosexual is not a behavior, agreed.  I do not feel that particular affliction is a choice.  Alcoholism is not a choice.  Drinking alcohol IS a choice.  Engaging in homosexual behavior IS a choice.  The homosexual act IS a behavior.  The heterosexual act IS a behavior; a natural one, and within the confines of a marriage, which is a union between one man and one woman, perfectly valid.  Outside of a marriage the sex act is sinful.  The homosexual act is not just an adulterous sin, it is a sin against nature.  To support “gay marriage” is to support those sins.
db wants to sell books so she takes the typical gop stance and 'beats up on the closest easiest to identify WOMAN who is: Former Two Time First Lady of Arkansas, Former Two Time First Lady of the United States, Former Two Time Senator from New York State, and Former Secretary of State Obama Administration  trashes her.    She sides with bs (pope stalker) who is the reason we have pussygrabber and calls out Hillary and Debbie Wassermann Schultz for somehow duping the Democratic Party during the last election.  Dona, dona, dona...you wrote your book....SELL YOUR BOOK, but not at the expense and reputations of others...makes you look like a loser leach who can't climb up by herself, but needs to climb over a woman twice her stature/experience...not a pretty site....i won't be buyin your book, honey....sounds silly and stupid!
Why defend him? Because she CHOSE to shoot him instead of drive away or and call the police.   As for her dad's words, “She didn’t try and kill this guy,” ?!? So she was trying take his leg out by closing her eyes and shooting a gun at another human!?! That bullet could have just as easily hit him in the head. I don't know much about guns, or TN gun laws, but I've heard many many times that you don't pull a gun unless you plan to use it and you don't use it unless you plan to kill. Sounds like she could use a brush up from her conceal and carry course. The whole thing, imo, not by facts, just stinks of entitled young woman that settles her inability to control her emotions in a situation through violence. Besides, that smug look on her mugshot needs be slapped off her face.  And JSB1, you asked a question and people are answering that question, yet you seem to get defensive over their answers?
In Canada the most acts of vandalism are still directed at the Jewish population although cases of vandalism of mosques is growing. Overt acts and words of intolerance are felt by a number of visible minorities including aboriginals, blacks, Sikhs, Muslims and Asians. Those bigoted acts however seldom reach a level which could be described as terrorism. Our white Christian majority is far from perfect but there is no comparison to attacks by Muslim extremists in Europe and the UK, attacks on Coptic Christians in Egypt or the more numerous attacks on Muslims by Muslims in the mid east and Africa. So far Muslims are much safer than blacks in the US or aboriginal women in Canada or Christians in Egypt. We should be ashamed of small acts of bigotry but let's not pretend that a single death in London totally counter balances all the deaths on 9/11 or throughout Europe in recent years.
Nice to see ESPN's hypocrisy on display.  Either all broadcasters are allowed to give their personal opinions or none are.   Frankly, I lost it with ESPN when a person with a penis was awarded with an ESPY..  Sad that the person who won was not a biological woman  and hadn't been a celebrated althete in decades.
This woman is a menace!! Another example of violent career criminals who have no intention to change and will continue to hurt anyone they  feel like hurting.  Get this lowlife scum off our streets!! WTF is wrong? People, wake up! Our justice system is a joke. Punishment for crime is a joke. Repeat offenders are a joke. Sentencing is a joke. Bail is a joke. Bottom line, people the joke is on us! We are the ones that pay for these asshats. We are the ones they hurt. We are the ones that live afraid to go certain places at certain times out of fear of these people. Nothing will change or get better until we realize our justice system, laws, punishments and how victims are treated is addressed and completely changed. When is enough enough? When are we going to take back our city and protect our people??  I am so frustrated by the way American society has changed into a haven for criminals and victims don't get justice. By God forbid we don't give sexual predators & rapists free lawyers!!
After today announcement on small business, women will be the only ones with jobs or businesses so I get your point.  Now of course this sisterhood has never negotiated with a trump but who cares right? Your article is both laughable and sad as you still don't get it.  Trump is a killer who wants to cancel the NAFTA not negotiate it...  There is no counter to a position like this other than dropping your pants No pun or sexual act implied or intended.
Remember when that sad palooka of a young cop was crucified mercilessly in the progressive press for innocently telling young women at York U that they could avoid sexual assault by not dressing "like sluts"? What followed was the usual strident outrage from fem commandos programmed to "stick it to the man" by clamoring that women can self-objectify all they like, and men had just better suck up and mind their P's & Q's.  Ms Wente's sobering piece here suggests that when one woman sells out the sistas by dishing out cheap sex as per tenets of s&m [social media] "culture," it's the entire pool that gets tainted by another degree of commodification.  You won't read politically incorrect talk like this at The Atlantic, WP, Times, the CBC, Bit*h Mag or among LGBT hardliners at the Globe. It's double-down time there as Atwood groupies mouth platitudes about the "liberating solitude" of the golden years. As for men, our victories of the flesh are Pyrrhic ones. What a messed up time.
Such a nasty woman.
"Trump’s national security choices reinforce his unapologetic views on terrorism "  "F" Trump - he's not my President!  We've got enough racists here all ready - we don't need one in the White House!  As far as I'm concerned, from here on out, the Federal Government has no authority - smoke that bubba (Sen Jeff Sessions looms large - Boy)  How many women will Trump appoint; no women seem to be on any of his lists?.  How many African Americans, indigenous Americans or any other "skins"  that are not White will Trump appoint to high office?   Brace yourselves folks - there's a "new," actually an old,  world coming.
Really,are you serious? Larry  Flint,The King of PORN ? C'mon now!  It's funny  that the Libs want to go after Trump  and this supposedly indiscretions,like Misogynist, Rape, and Sexual harassment, when the Democrats are the very ones who wrote the play book on being a sexual predator... Right? Bill  Clinton,don't forget the Kennedy's and now Senator Robert Menendez. Did anyone noticed  the many women Trump has picked to be in his Cabinet or notices his  most recent pick to run the Homeland Security,Kirstjen Nielsen? Anyone?  If Larry Flint wants to do something great and honorable with this 10 Million dollar bounty he has on President Trump, I suggest he  donate it to a worthy charity,like maybe the Salvation Army, Saint Jude or even "Meals On Wheel". Guy's beginning to sound like, Al Green Maxine Waters and MSNBC all rolled up in one. Haaaaaaaaaa! IMUA!
The problem here Michael, is that Bill Clinton isn't running for president. Trump is. You have the tape of him saying how he grabs women. You have women that say they've been grabbed by the Republican presidential candidate. That isn't news? That isn't being a sexual predator?  Newt was upset that Kelly called little hands a sexual predator. HE IS. You know Republicans keep saying Hillary has done worse things but all they have is millions spent and Hillary running for president.
Rappers demean and belittle women far more than Trump ever dreamed of.  You're clueless as usual.  http://elitedaily.com/music/music-news/the-20-most-misogynist-lines-in-rap-history/
you are ignorant of women's issues.  I hope your dog doesn't think too highly of you, he'd be disappointed/"May I be as good a person as my dog thinks I am"  Get over myself over what exactly?  Having an opinion.   Reading and understanding a fricking sentence differently than thou?  AND?  I AM as cute as grasshoppers.  You're NOT  l2g.  It's men like you......................................................................................................................................................
Dennis, One of the most blatant hurts accorded to many men and women was when Benedict opened the door for married clergy of the Anglican Communion to come into the Catholic Church as priests. God only knows how hurtful that was to many men and women. To sit there in church while an Anglican said Mass with his wife and kids in the pews while, in many cases, a catholic priest sat in the same church and wasn't even allowed to take communion.  Someone is on here demanding to know when Benny or JPII ever changed Church teaching. Well there's a big, fat, juicy one right there. He changed it at a whim, opening the door for every homophobic, misogynistic, reactionary right wing cleric who felt that their own church wasn't hating homosexuals and women enough.  On the upside, Benny showed that you can change anything and 2000 years of tradition can be dropped like hot cakes, and I hope that Francis makes full use of the precedent set by him.
Seems to me this woman has earned a special place in hell.
"On a new batch of recordings from Howard Stern’s radio shows aired Saturday by CNN, Trump said that he would “have no problem” having sex with 24-year-olds, that he “couldn’t care less” if he satisfies the women he sleeps with, that “it’s checkout time” once women reach the age of 35 and that he had engaged in three-way sex."  “Haven’t we all?” Trump told Stern on his SiriusXM satellite radio show in 2008. “Are we babies?”  "Trump also described barging in on nude Miss Universe beauty pageant contestants in their dressing room, characterizing his visits as inspections by the contest’s owner."  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/more-trump-tapes-surface-with-crude-sex-remarks/2016/10/08/7129cea2-8d92-11e6-bff0-d53f592f176e_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_howardstern808pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory
Stories like this always get me thinking that we could've had a world-class Senator in Linda Lingle, who is respected across the board in DC, instead of this feeble, incoherent moron who can barely string together a sentence without s...s...s..stuttering through a litany of incomprehensible liberal garbage that some 20yo Women's Studies major intern probably wrote for her.  HOW and WHY a useless imbecile like this gets to be a Senator is far beyond me, because for all of her faults, Linda Lingle would have AT LEAST represented our state in a manner that gained us respect, rather than confusion, pity and awkward acceptance of a geriatric wannabe radical who is better suited working the reception counter at a nursing home.  Only in Hawaii.
"That still does not mean than today someone from a country or culture who believes that a woman's testimony is only worth half that of a man, or that believes that female genital castration is just part of Sharia Law or that Allah demands the death of all Infidels should not be looked at most carefully prior to being allowed entry into the US. Religious bigots need to be ID'd and excluded." Motley  This is what I was meaning to reply to Motley.    Civil sometimes organizes the conversation in very strange ways.   (That's my story and I'm sticking with it!   lol)
I was a Denver Bronco fan since the first day they stepped on the field for the first time. I was born an raised in Colorado, but even after moving to Michigan after 47 years I had remained a Broncos fan. I am so disappointed in the Broncos, Hickenloopers and other fools hypocritical comments claiming it is wrong for Trump to mix sports and politics... what the heck do you think these moronic players and the NFL are doing. What is wrong is for these over-paid self centered idiots to show disrespect to a flag and country many fellow servicemen and women have fought and died for, in protest of a completely unrelated issue. I will not watch another NFL game. From now on it is college football only, Wolverines, Buffs, Rams, and Spartans. I will not show respect nor loyalty to an organization that fails to show respect to the country I spent 20 years in the Army defending.
That's what I thought, too.  What a wuss. It's a little cold, you can see his ears are red, but still.  Girly little mittens?
Planned Parenthood deserves our scorn and zero taxpayer dollars . If everything they do is so vital to the health of women and abortion is only a tiny part of what they do--why do they risk losing 500 million because they refuse to stop doing abortions ? It has been reported that last year out of around 1400 abortions performed in Alaska Planned Parenthood was behind 1340 of them . Why on earth can anyone other than the killers themselves support any organization that was responsible for killing 1340 innocent nearly born Alaskan lives ? On top of all this killing of the innocent , Planned Parenthood fights to keep parents from finding out what their under age daughters are doing. Women always scream no one has the right to tell them what to do with their bodies .  Why don't these same screamers accept the responsibility that comes with that ? All they have to do is use birth control and they won't get PG and find the need to kill so many innocent nearly born kids . Face reality ladies.
Bombing the north Australian towns of Darwin (more ordnance than Pearl Harbour) Broome, Townsville and Cairns, killed plenty of Australians, woman and children. The Americans saved my country from being overrun by maniacal killers, and we can't thank them enough. Maybe you'd change your tune if the japs were putting British Colombia thru the shredder.
Don't be silly. The correct translation is "Jesus no like perch fish with romano cheese." Which is why women can't be ordained. All very logical.
yes -This is so true.  You read his statements on women and its like he wants to pet all the  silly women on the head and that will make everything all better.  It is a bit stomach turning.
Women are not deserving of anything. We are all equal, we should all expect our ideas and actions to be challenged especially when those pro-lifers are footing the bill for them to kill a baby. People's taxes are funding full term abortions. They have the right to protest in font of any institution collecting tax dollars and they have the right to protest in any public space. If women want the right to be to enter and leave these institutions without criticism, than privatize them, and remove government funding.    We should not be exalting  decadence over the rights and freedoms of the people, otherwise......bans like this will have a disastrous unintended consequences.
It is feminism that has campaigned for laws that hold men financially responsible for children they never created. And to try and say our society, where the deck is so heavily stacked against men, is misogynist is frankly ridiculous.
Every Muslim headscarf you see states "I am not one with you. I reject your culture and your people. I expect you to accept me, but I do not accept you."  Why do only the Muslim women wear these clothing that show separation? Why not the Muslim men?  This is the same story in every country that has Muslims. They do not integrate. The women are inferior, their clothing keeps them in place. They multiple at an extreme rate, most marry their first cousins, resulting in real problems with their children.  May Geert Wilders succeed.
No, he's a dumb kid whose parents did a poor job of raising him to respect rules and common sense. He actually was in a group of 4-5 teenagers who had nothing better to do than toss what the witness called a smoke bomb into the vegetation.  It just happened the woman who saw them saw him toss one while the others laughed. It's likely others in the group had thrown other fireworks that contributed to the fire. All of them need to do community service in the forest with USFS  for the next 10 summers, give speeches at high schools during the school year, and serious fines assessed on their parents.
What a stupid column. Lots of people , men or women would want to be Trump Sec of State to have  power prestige and influence on the world stage.  Really?? It escapes you why?
Women also want cheap frequent free sex.  Until they get serious about settling down, that is.  Then, good luck to them.  Because there are always other women who will continue to want cheap frequent free sex.  Lots of women also like porn too.  And sext. And make homemade porn.  Don't fool yourself.   Women are just as guilty as men in this modern world of ours.
Mulcair is wrong, she never paid her debt to society.  She is a liar and a murderer of young women.  She should be treated as such.
Yes, Klastri, defend and celebrate these professional athletes and hold them up as role models while overlooking the criminal records of many of them.  Great attitude for a lawyer, former lawyer or whatever kind of lawyer you supposedly are or were.  Almost 900 NFL players were arrested since 2000.  More than 40 also have been accused of sexual assault or domestic violence against women.  Nice tough guys.  Almost all of these professional athletes are or were college graduates.   I doubt there is another profession in which so many “well educated” people get in trouble with the law.  They may not be “ignorant pawns,” but many are working very hard to demonstrate that they are ignoramuses.
sounds like self-punishment to cholo. you skip work and don't shop for a day. then you may lose your job and not being able to shop period. that's what some women want? is this some kind of political statement? how's that working out? thankfully most women aren't this dim-witted.
It didn't mention anything about the ageing of the men in the country and the loss of so many young to wars and other stupidity. Maybe it's the new low cut jeans so Levi manufacturers can save material and charge more for Relaxed Fit and so having to wear them around the waist tightens the crotch and beer bellies don't help. Maybe it's why there are getting to be so many trans genders, who knows but the birth rate causing more women to be born then men will show up in the evolution of politics in the country and in the military.
It is sad when such a large number of people (who read the Globe, not the Sun!) find justified the killing of a Muslim woman by a bigot, and find hatred towards Muslims acceptable. (No, I am not Muslim, I am very Christian, but I know quite a few Muslims and none of them is a criminal or a jerk.)
Wow, you just can't get any more ignorant than this!  Mohammed was a child molester who married a 9-year-old girl. He had multiple wives, divorcing some of them who displeased him and left them destitute. He advocated the rape and killing of women Jewish and Christian women simply because they didn't choose to join his cult. If that's raising the status of women in his time ... well, your definition must be different than mine.  If you turn to John 3:16 and read the verses following, you would know that Jesus did not define love as accepting the immoral behavior of others as normal. But, of course, that would require actually reading the Bible.  Jesus quoted extensively from the Old Testament (every book but Ester) and made it clear that the Law was of value for knowing how to live a moral life. Before you say what he would have believed in, you might want to know what He pointed His followers to believe in. He expected them to show love without compromising morality.
If anyone can post a SINGLE Muslim nation that treats women and gays as equal in law, I'd be very curious to hear it.
Shannon, just because you say something does not make it true.  You say that abortions are lower where women have cheap birth control. This is what is called a LIE.  Do some research on welfare and other poor women who have access to free birth control - they have a larger percentage of abortions per 100,000 than any other group.  Abortions are a convenience.  Personally I don't care if you commit murder, abortion, or other evils to your children.  Keep them from reproducing please.
Yeah, those Discovery shows are so much crap. What a waste, but what isn't nowadays on TV. Hollywood is doing its best to socially re-engineer and indoctrinate the stupid sheep to better control them and lead them around by the nose. I've never seen so many women put in commanding positions and trying to turn men into irrelevant in-subordinates. Way beyond reality. I'm not trying to put women down but just pointing out what's on Hollywood's and the media's agenda. You gotta admit---It's true!
The Israeli's like their combat females..a lot.  They also have no issues with transgendered military personnel.
There's no doubt in my mind that this woman and her followers will be the ones who are hateful, and potentially violent.
.  "President Donald Trump on Thursday ridiculed the brains, looks and temperament of a female cable television host "  --  Apparently His Orangeness doesn't realize that Brzezinski is smarter than him, a lot better looking than him, and sane.  Well, the rest of the world does realize it and he has just confirmed it.  Is he on some kind of medication?
No wonder that there are so many lonely cranky women in western society.
Tragic that any South African would still regard this awful woman as leadership material.
don't look now adams, but the country is embarrassed by the woman known as dullary. her felonius behavior, lies, and deceit add up to a worse choice than the trumpster.
you sound like a pussy cat, afraid, be a man or a woman.  you like to criticize others but you are afraid the those people wlll come after you.  you if are a scared cat, then don't attack other people personally.  where is the cajones.  lol.
Unless there is a specific dress code, the woman is allowed to dress in an attractive way without being accused of being a slut.   I didn't think you were religious Out?   Yet your personal values align with the 'moral' of Adam and Eve  that often comes out with EVE being the temptress.  Women are the cause of the fall of 'man' into sinfulness.  Oh my.   It's cultural/human mythology that reflects the cultural values of times, not historical fact.       How about the woman tempting men outside of her home?   How about Lot offering his daughter to the angry crowd so they wouldn't rape his male guest?   (it gets worse) Women fair very poorly in the old testament which has everything to do with assignment of power only to men.    Religious law was created to serve human hierarchies, not a direct line to a universal God.  It is interesting how religious mythology, (and what I used to think were common sense sayings), become part of our social conscious even for those who are non-religious.
To bad the trumptards aren't bright enough to understand what this bankruptcy lawyer scum that Trump picked straight from the swamp will mean for the US.  Be prepared for an escalation of the unending violence in the Middle East and more propaganda about our military men and women bravely fighting for, and dying for our freedom. It's been many, many years since any US military personnel died fighting for our freedom. Make sure your children, and grandchildren understand when they're sent off to fight and die in foreign lands they're not fighting and dying for our freedom; they're fighting and dying for your stupidity.  Trumptards, I wish you were bright enough to understand just how badly you've been trump'd, and that your collective stupidity will see us all trump'd.
tRump has relished calling women “dogs,” “slobs” and “pigs”. He’s taken lifelong joy in objectifying women. When Tucker Carlson once mocked him on air, tRump called the pundit and left a voicemail: “It’s true you have better hair than I do. But I get more p***y than you do.” He’s ridiculed the appearance of a female opponent (Carly Fiorina) and an opponent’s wife (Heidi Cruz). His campaign openly acknowledged that it disqualified all women for consideration as his vice-president.  Trump has a long history of debasing women he’s worked with, crossing the line on a regular basis. He’s taken lifelong joy in objectifying women, including his proclamation: “Women, you have to treat ‘em like s**t.”  tRump tried to rape Jill Harth. His ex-wife Ivana, under oath, accused tRump of  a vicious rape  in 1989.  A woman filed an April 2016 lawsuit claiming that when she was thirteen years old she was held as a sex slave to Mr. Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein.
Justin is going to have some explaining to do to all his feminist followers.  He painted himself into a corner with that "because it's 2015" comment. If he backs out now, he will look like a huge liar.
Mr. Earth, So if your-ex girlfriend -wife or date didn't like the way your relationship turned out, that you (the male) should be penalized or terminated in your job? Do you know how crazy that sounds? Do you know that Carl is in fact a scumbag? Do you believe, if a woman posts negative comments on social media regarding a previous intimate relationship (where the guy wanted weird stuff), that the man she dated should lose his job? What about women's conduct?
Okay, lets end this here.  Katherine is obviously a schizophrenic with a dissociative identity disorder  In short she is detached from reality with multiple personalities.  She probably believes everything she says depending on who's speaking.  You are building a psychiatric defense for this woman.  Interesting to see how affectionately Alison Lee Wong regards Katherine Kealoha.  Kathrine, unknown to her herself, is in love with herself by way of Alison Lee Wong. Wow, there has got to be a name for that.  Could be a touch of narcissism because she does admire her own attribute and has a huge ego even though her accomplishments are few.  The other option is that Katherine Kealoha is just an unsophisticated crook and Louis is a moron.
Rookie girl is going to get spanked so hard it isn't funny.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should remain the anti-Trump.  I am not a liberal.  I am a person with a spiritual heart and conscience.  Whenever Trump is on TV, I turn it off. Those who have normalized Trump have no integrity. They have no guts. I could never see our Prime Minister try to grab a woman between the legs and brag about it. Trump is a racist. Trudeau is not.  As for 'Tweety', I quote Queen Margaret's curse from Richard the Third by William Shakespeare:  "No sleep close up that eye of thine, Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!"
Global Thinker: According to Trump, when women reach 35, they're no longer worthy of his attentions. Poor Melania; sucks to be over the hill in Trump's world.
You accept as a President it's OK for Trump to lower himself to even lower levels. Below is how much Trump shows his respect. . "You know, it doesn't really matter what [they] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass." . “Why do people think it’s egotistical of you to say you could’ve gotten with Lady Di?” Stern asked him. “You could’ve gotten her, right? You could’ve nailed her.” “I think I could have,” Trump said. . "you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever" (NOSE).  .  "You've called women fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.  . "A person who's flat-chested is very hard to be a 10, OK?" . Trump: I did try and f... her. She was married.  I moved on her like a bitch. But I couldn’t get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything. She’s totally changed her look. . There is sooooooooo much more.  . Saint Trump!
You raise an interesting point. But is it true that women are prosecuted for drinking heavily? It is illegal to use certain drugs while pregnant in only one state, so I am surprised that drinking would be treated more harshly than drugs.  As to any law, I doubt it was written by pro-choice advocates. Kinda weird to use the actions of one group to call another hypocritical.
Stupid waste of life. Truly sorry this girl didn't get to enjoy her future.
It doesn't get better than when Leftist animals eat their own. I especially enjoy it when one self- identified victim group like BLM gets into a game of "whose-the-bigger-victim" with another self-identified victim group like the nonsensical "women's" march.
This woman is losing it.  She embodies the hysterical female stereotype.  If you wanted proof that men and women aren't the same, I present to you exhibit A -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Maybe you should read his 'Harm Theory' first and connect it with what you wrote.   Also his famous dictum never grows tiring.   "Although it is not true that all conservatives are stupid people, it is true that most stupid people are conservative."  JS Mill  Of course he was also one of the first to promote the rights of women to the disgust of conservatives.
"I am concerned that, whether they are conscious of it or not, the white men who would vote for Trump have never fully accepted women and people of color as equals..."  Not only these, but also LGBT folks and Jews, two other groups many of these white supremacist types hate.
"pussyhats" really? And, they demand respect for women from others?
They still throw gays off buildings and stone women.
The woman whose twins attended UCC knows how to play the fools among us.
Good for the Border Crossing, no doubt they were going there to protest, being from Montreal what else?  Why would they allow citizens from another country in to protest their New President.    To bad the lunatic women weren't stopped also.   ( and I am a woman)   These feminists are out of touch.
NOTHING to do with being a nurse... More to do with being a female perv. Despite the fact that men are usually the one's maligned as 'perverts', women can be just as bad and oftentimes far worse.
motley:  There is NO question HE is an OLD FOOL, and OLD Druggie.    In his mind, HE is supplying a 25 year old woman with METH, and getting that young woman Bang Job, just what ALL of us OLD guys fantasize about, right????   Both these people need Drug Intervention and Mental Illness Intervention.
You are suggesting that there are a huge number of female Muslim misogynists.
The only place I can speak to first hand is Paris. I go relatively often, and there isn't one part of it that is unsafe to walk in by male or female, day or evening. My last trip, some time after that Fox News apology, I stayed in a hotel on the edge of one of the supposed 'no-go zones.' No problem whatsoever. Those articles are alarmist crap, written by a professional anti-muslim propagandist, in one case.
Those stupid liberals are just awful!!! I mean, how can they think that its fair to infringe on our rights to shoot the gay and latino and black people, and keep the women in the kitchen!  I mean, isn't it just an outrage to assume that these people have civil rights???
Bill Clinton rapes and Hillary helps him hide it. Hillary lies to many women's groups about her flight to Bosnia. Hillary broke the law with her emails. Hillary has a record of deceit and theft. Hillary lost because she is Hillary.  And Celine Dion is proud to support her. What a sad day for Canada.
quote:"..noting that black women are more likely to be victims of domestic violence." And why? Because the number of violent crimes committed by blacks is triple the average per capita for non-blacks.
Depends on who you are and who your victim is. If you are a youngish female and you run over a native kid or some guy on a bicycle its no problem.
I agree with the writer's assessment of the sad state of current affairs.  Politics is a bloodsport.  Alaska Governor Bill Walker won with the support of the general population. He promoted a fiscal plan that fairly spread the pain of the fiscal crisis.  He wrote it in pencil. He solicited input.  He marched it around the state.  He got broad public support.  The cornerstone of his plan is fairness.  I know this first hand; I spoke to him about it myself.  Then, the Body, which created the fiscal mess, comes back with SB128- putting the fiscal burden on every man, woman, and CHILD in the state. PFD reform is not a good stand alone answer. The public will not abide a PFD raid; perceived or real!  To make matters worse, the Governor applauds the enemy when he needs to go right back for support to his strongest constituency, the general public and demand a better fiscal plan.  This constitutes a sad political strategy to shift the blame from the GOP, to the governor.  Paybacks are a bitch
It's 2017.  So how can people still come up with names like AlaskaMAN Extreme Triathlon?  How sexist, and clueless towards sexism.  Dumb.  Why not Alaska Extreme Triathlon?  Drop the"man" and drop the offense to women.
The headline for this piece could as easily read "Misogyny linked to definition of masculinity" Traditional masculinity derides most feminine attributes. "Runs like a girl" "Cries like a girl" "he's so effeminate" "she must be on her period" "that's women's work" "a woman's place is _____".  Was it some time in the 70's that we saw the emergence of the new, sensitive man - the man who helped with house work and allowed his sons to cry, or not play football, or pursue ballet?  I think that gay boys and gay men have a much harder time than gay women because of their perceived feminine behaviours. No one cares so much about me wearing jeans and being able to use a skill saw as they do about the meticulously groomed young man with soft hands and an elegant walk who adores ballet....
You must be female?  Real men don't "giggle."
You would want your wife or daughter to be talked dirty sexual comments  and propositioned each day while working. Or worse be forced to choose sex with  flabby ugly old  men in order to keep their jobs and make a living or be blackballed by same for not putting out?  Twisted beyond reason. They got off easy. Should have to entertain prison inmates and see how they like being shamed.
Neither a Democrat or a Republican should support this. Not being a woman, maybe you don't know that 1 out of 5 women are raped in this country. Low estimate in a year 300,000. High estimate 1.3 million. Only 54% report a rape. Judging by the judges lately, I can see why. Did you know it's legal in 31 states for a rapist to try to get custody of the child produced from that rape? WTH! Btw, 32,000 women a year get pregnant during a rape. So yeah, it must have been politics that got Shannyn to write this article.
Seems to me that the largest cause of abuse -- sexual, drugs, etc. -- are heterosexual males. Of the many thousands of rapes and sexual assaults, how many are female perps? Ditto drugs, war crimes, etc. So it makes sense to me that we should immediately ban all straight men.
Ducksoup:  I agree with you about Japan but you are forgetting that Japan does not have the populations of black men and women, white men and women  or any men or woman  that have PTSD, mexican men, latino men, Huge numbers  of Mentally Ill etc.  ALL High Crime folks...
Am I really the 1st female responder to this article? A big thank you to Denby for bringing this to the attention of your readers.  I haven't marched in protest since the Vietnam War in the 70's, motivated by my classmates being enlisted and killed in that hated war.  And now, nearly a half century later, we find ourselves in an equally torn America we don't recognize - one that voted an idiot into power because - why?  He has money and people think that will rub off on them? White supremacy that captures the imagination of more idiots parading around in their KKK robes? The unemployed who kid themselves into thinking the orange haired guy cares whether they feed their families?  People claiming 'change' as motivation when they really mean destroy everything the alt right doesn't like?  The Russian puppet-leader will not be allowed to remove women's rights as if we are at worst slaves and at best window dressing. If you want to see angry women just stay tuned as this disaster unfolds.
"first black female state court judge in Las Vegas, Nevada"? What took so long? Already got lots of Japanese, Chinese, Hawaiian, Koreans, Hispanic, and planty hoales.
Nice try! False equivalency.   First, what is "alt-left" except a made-up term by those desperate for excuses for the alt-right.   Second, funny, but I haven't heard "lefties" suggest that segments of the population -- namely, African Americans, Jews, Muslims, oh, and women -- need to be exterminated or segregated.   The only thing that decent Americans want segregated is The Orange Creature, which needs to be caged and periodically tarred and feathered.
Some sexist remarks below from people that don’t understand that banning veil is banning the right the women chose for themselves and adhere to. This is the total assault on muslims and religious beliefs and is the start of the shift from democratic values to that of dictatorships. Shame on Europe who would allow nudity but would not allow women to cover
Or maybe their afraid dear leader will launch the nukes if someone makes the mistake of telling him that 3 million more Americans voted for his opponent,  a nasty woman.
With a third to half of all priests gay, their banning shrinks priesthood even more.  No married, no gays, no women.  Sick.
Eid holidays will be coming soon and Easter will be gone.  The collateral damage will be on women and homosexuals.
Why do Muslim men not have to cover their heads? Why are there no female priests in Catholicism? Why can women not pray at the wailing wall in Jerusalem?  Most religions are not unisex.
I love the comments below.....a black woman speaks and the crap comes out of the wood work... Trump produce your proof.....other than that, STFU!!!!
"These "white men" you speak of seem to have very limited experience of anyone other than themselves."  I agree! Not to mention that they seem to fear the "decision-making" that may "be different based on their experiences with women and Jewish people".  What the heck would be wrong with that? We need input from all our citizens, yes, including straight white males, but not only straight white males as if they were the only ones whose "decision-making" was valid or of worth!  This is a very narrow-minded way of looking at the vast diversity of the people of the United States, a country that is great because of it's diversity, not in spite of it!
Sounds like more of a march of petulant female Democrats.  Sorry kids, you should have done your campaigning before the election.
"The retweet immediately fired up accusations that the president was promoting violence against women."  I bet it did. It's stuff like this that mutes reaction to true violence against women. Just crying Wolf because​ people don't like the guy, seems stupid.
Your Mom's comments aside. I don't think most of us really noticed or cared what colour Ms Freeland's dress was. Most of us have evolved our thinking of women in the workplace decades ago. Perhaps it is old feminists who are still in a rut.
Rodney King jeopardized others when he was driving drunk but in fact the only person harmed was King himself when Officers Powell and Koon beat him before witnesses. I assume Find Truth did not use "like a wealthy black man/woman" since even wealthy black Americans are frequently treated like social inferiors by racists whites who are unfamiliar with their celebrity status. All the prominent African-Americans you mention have spoken and written about their experiences of racism in the U.S. Your claim that the experiences of white celebrities are the same as the experiences of Black celebrities, therefore, is entirely specious.
The Left will do anything to elect a minority or female candidate simply because they are a minority or female.  No other qualifications necessary.  This year it's the Republicans vs. the Children.  Ok, so let's elect the known liar, who has shown her dereliction of duty as Secretary of State while setting fire to the Middle East and not providing our personnel in the region with adequate support to defend themselves.  Good plan, Pitts.    Let's elect the Democrat who has knowingly sent guns and ammunition to "rebels" that unfortunately turned out to be ISIS.  The lady who supports Black Lives Matter, you know the movement that is actively targeting police officers across the country and currently dividing our country?  How about we make every excuse possible for a candidate for the sole purpose of electing a female?  Before that how about we whine and cry about a candidate with a proven record in business, you know that thing that makes the world go round?
And the bishops dare to blather on about being pro life! Humiliating these pregnant but unmarried women was egregious in itself ... allowing so many foetuses and babies to die, and covering the situation up, is apalling! The foetid stench of hypocrisy lies rank over the hierarchy. Their credibility is NON-EXISTENT!
Exactly what did Trump say that wasn't accurate? Mika and Morning Joe are imbeciles. Nobody watches them so they call Trump all kinds of names just to get attention. They dish it out so they should be able to take it. All this stuff about Trump disrespecting women with what he said is ridiculous. No wonder Mika's face looks like plastic. Her and Morning Joe deserve each other. I just hope they don't have offspring.
Couldn't he have just used his hands? Just make up girl's names like Rachel for this right and Lavona for his left. Too dumb to use his imagination and stay out of trouble? Gives blacks bad name.
OK.  You say tomato, I say tomahto.  Just started reading another poll (and I'm not going to check if you're right and I'm wrong because I'm pretty sure I can read numbers; not good at math, but I can read) that soon will come out and darn it, they're actually going to run the numbers again, because it has Trump at 90% after the video of one of your rabid red diaper doper baby leftists ambushed Spicer while shopping.  Very rude.  I bet she was at the women's march and also took off on a day w/out females.  Casting aspersions aside -  The analysis of the 90% showed that the more people (and news outlets) trash our President, the more people are sure and confirmed in their minds that they made the right choice.  In my lifetime, I have experienced that when you are REALLY trying to do something great, the level of resistance rises exponentially.  I just accept it.  That's the rule, and I didn't make the rule.  So again...what is your plan?
This article is especially hilarious in light of the DEEP HYPOCRISY and DOUBLE STANDARD of the right when it comes to this. They voted for the p****grabber in chief! Anyone that voted for Trump has to sit down and shut up and hang their heads in shame when it comes to stories like Weinstein. They VOTED FOR a man who was KNOWN to BRAG about assaulting women because of who he is.   Everyone and anyone who is on the left has distanced themselves from Weinstein once they found out about him. What happened when O'Reilly and Murdoch got caught? Deafening silence from the right. Faux barely covered it. And they had to have known, for YEARS, about the Loofah King and his antics. Did they boycott him? Hell no.   At least one conservative woman realizes this:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3sfy0C6hWQ
They will protest Trump but allow a Muslim man to kill his wife, daughters, sisters because they are women whiteout batting a eyelash.  Beating and killing women and children is not our way or is it compatible with our culture, our laws, nor our morals.  Subjugating women to wearing coverings, silence, and making them walk 15 feet behind the man is OK??  Yet you walk with a PU$$Y Hat?  Then a Muslim terrorist kills a bunch of people in a shopping mall and we are racists.  The Female and Male Left are really sick and weird people. You lost yet you refuse to obey democracy. Obama and Clinton killed millions and you do nothing.  Explain how you can stand back and do nothing about that?  Good luck explaining your hypocrisy
If you have male genitalia then use the boys / men's room.   If you have female genitalia then use the girls / ladies room. Quite simple.  Its been that way for hundreds of years but now a few want to change so that a few can be in touch with their feelings.  Very typical of today's society change our ways for the few minority over the objections of the vast majority.  When my little girl goes into a woman's washroom I do not want a man with a hair on his face going in the door right behind her.
Maybe Scheer just has no respect for women?  If that is his stance, then beware at the voting booths when women take him out back for a severe beating.  Another huge fail for the Social Con that he is.
Hey a Eric...talking to the supporters of little d is like me talking to my dog...he likes it but there no real grasp of what I am saying. And he's saying, 'when are you going to feed me?' I am amazed at how willing they are to makes statements that are demonstrably untrue as if they were true...again my dog says, 'you haven't fed me' when I know I have, recently. Michelle's criticism of Hillary, not true, that any of the woman's story have been shown to be untrue, not true. That little d has a plan, not true. That his experience makes him a leader..well he has marketed his brand of stupid really well. Makes me wonder why?
"Sexual assault" has come to include lots of innocuous things that don't involve actually having sex.  Remember the gal who claimed sexual assault on a plane because the guy next to her touched her thigh?  And people looking in someone's window has even been categorized as "sexual assault."  This all is not helping us in any way.  It diminishes the real meaning of the term, in which someone is actually violated.  And then those perps are put on a registry for life.
Would the transgendered adult male who now identifies as a prepubescent girl suffer from a psychological disorder in your opinion?
a 45-year-old male student, who dresses as a woman and goes by the name Colleen Francis, undressed and exposed his genitals on several occasions inside the woman’s locker room at Evergreen State College.  Students from nearby Olympia High School as well as children at a local swimming club share locker rooms with the college.  According to a police report, the mother of a 17-year-old girl complained after her daughter saw the transgender individual walking naked in the locker room. A female swim coach confronted the man sprawled out in a sauna exposing himself. She ordered him to leave and called police.  The coach later apologized when she discovered the man was transgendered but explained there were girls using the facility as young as six years old who weren’t used to seeing male genitals.
""""national strategy to prevent gender-based violence"""  Apparatchiks saying that through government strategy they can stop a women from raping a man or vice versa  The end of the Marxist era is coming. This never ending Marxist dogma that government can control how a man or women interacts with their opposite sex is idiotic at best and really really creepy and dangerous at worst.  Government is endlessly trying to control every thing in this country. You can't legislate how a person acts.  Your never ending attempt to take over our souls is shameful
TRUMP: Stop the Nightmare (aka: "Dreamer's") program. Do NOT reward bad (criminal) behavior. Pregnant ILLEGAL women came here solely in hopes their offspring automatically becomes American citizens. Kick them all out !!!
hollyweird and democrats knew weinstein was a sexual predator decades ago. weinstein included a clause in his contract that allowed him to sexually assault women and stay employed. who writes that into their employment contract? . weinstein is not going down quietly. he will expose high ranking democrats that shared his vulgar hobby.
the only U.S. president to have bragged on video about grabbing women by their genitals ? Oh the only one who bragged - without actually doing so !  Because we know that Clinton and Kennedy both regularly had their hands in the honey jar .
You conflate the authority of theologians/historians with the Magesterium of the Church.  An analogy:  Often times the SCOTUS makes some very bad decisions.  They use very bad and very stupid arguments to support those decisions.  Roe V. Wade is but one of numerous examples.  Their arguments are so bad and stupid--it does not even take a lawyer to drive a truck through them.  Even a person without training in law could drive a truck through them.  That does not unmake the decision, that does not change the decision.  The decision is what it is, no matter how bad it is and no matter how stupid the arguments used to support it.  Whether the Vatican uses good or bad arguments to support their statements, whether theologians can drive a truck through them, whether we like it or not, they, like the justices, have the authority to judge between competing opinions and arguments and render decisions.  That is how it works.  Some decisions are irreformable.  Women's ordination is one of them.
It was the best he could do! Strong being relative. The snake's revenge was nearly complete. But who pays for his medical bills? We do (insurance). He should have to pay a fine, much like the people who do foolish things and need mountain rescue. Love the Doctor's remark about women not being so dumb.
The accompanying photo of a blond, white girl as the prototypical Canadian is racist and xenophobic.
Hillary defended a rapist against a 12-yr old girl. Anyone watch the Facebook Live session before the last debate? A few of the women Hillary mistreated after Bill Clinton had his way with them spoke out. Hypocrisy at its finest, aye?
Well, its true that the perp is an attractive young woman and therefore less subject to the knee-jerk lock her up forever as pond scum reaction, but still you might be asked to leave this comment board as I have been for suggesting that humans can make mistakes and still move forward to learn and contribute as a productive citizen.
The more Hillary opens her mouth the more she shows how stupid she really is.  Will she ever go away??????
Yet when one mediocre white girl doesn't get in to UT Austin, it's a Supreme Court case because of reverse racism!
The Klan thinks Donald Trump is a racist?  Who cares what the Klan thinks, other than bigoted Trump haters?    Hillary Clinton won't use the term "radical Islam" because it "sounds like we are declaring war against a religion."  Hillary Clinton could permanently resettle close to one million Muslim migrants during the first term of her presidency alone, according to the latest available data from the Department of Homeland Security.  With no screening.   Islam teaches that a woman is worth less than a man and that homosexuals deserve the death penalty.  Apparently, that isn't a problem for Jeff and Hillary.  The Klan is Junior Varsity.  ISIL is a major league enemy.
Yet another, " Women are awesome but unappreciated," bunk article. The proof is in the number of genuinely successful women CEO's. And I don't mean the p&ssy passed Carly Fiorina/Meg Whitman failures.  I know one.  This is a great red pill comedy article, however.
Muslims should stop painting themselves as victims. They should work to reform their faith so that it is no longer synonymous with violence and intolerance.   Any Muslim who does not explicitly and publicly disavow all violent jihad, sharia slavery, child marriage, unequal rights for women, hateful religious rhetoric towards non-Muslims, hudud punishments and polygamy does not deserve goodwill from the civilized world.
"There’s a phone message we play during workshops that never fails to evoke reaction. It’s the recording of a woman who called our office last fall to express her deep suspicion of Syrian refugees, Muslims and women in head scarves." ~ `` ~ . . . what's with this Overgeneralization of 'Bigotry' based on "a woman who called our office last fall"??  What a pitiful excuse to stir up more s***t -- be sure to drag in others to suck up full sympathy.  Enough Of This Bull..   Would you like to know how many Indignities have been experienced by Women who DO NOT wear head scarves & do not belong to the above groups named -- All Women Experience Indignities, Madam -- ALL..!!  For your edification -- Muslim men can be Exceptionally Ignorant & Rude to 'White, Non-Muslim Women' & that Friend, is drawn from Familial Experience. Obviously a Norm For Muslim Men.  So, Do You Hear White Non-Muslim Women Whining???? Nope!.  Say, how about giving this over-wrought cry-baby whining a Big Fat Rest.. !?  / .
Trump wants to keep women in "their place." If they get all uppity, how is he going to get away with grabbing pussy, even bragging about it, without consequence as a role model for our children?
As does Islam genius. Oh and subjugation of women, and the KILLING of non-Muslims. So your point is slag. Could me and my transgender bf get married in a mosque? Get a grip.
In the words of a revered Republican, just say "NO" to the Trump agenda!! I urge you to fight for the truth, human rights, the rights of women and children in the United States.  Do not help him install a cabinet of unethical, unqualified and racist billionaires!
Aren't all gays female friendly?
Good question! Why the hell aren't the other 2 adults that were in the ho8me being charged?? Such bullshit!! This woman is a monster and should NEVER be allowed anwhere children!!!! PERIOD!! She is a monster!! Omg this poor little boy! I would fucking kill this sick psycho bitch if it were my son!!
What's better?  A flip-flopping professional politician who votes for the same big-money that continues to further our wars, debt, and garbage medical system, or a friggin loud-mouthed idiot that won't get anything done?  I'd argue the idiot that won't get anything done, but I couldn't sleep at night voting for him, either.  Sanders would've been a huge stretch for me since I'm more Libertarian in spending and government social programs, but I would've compromised significantly and voted for him to keep Trump out.  But Hillary?  Please.  The only thing Hillary could do was slick-talk, deflect blame, and flip flop to ride the poles.   Remember when she trash talked all of the ladies that were coming forward about her adulterous husband, but suddenly when Trump's a misogynist, she's protecting the women?  And she gets away with it....selling the stupid sheep with her garbage.  Sanders runs next time, I'll swallow half my Libertarian policies to vote for him.
Bet his Mama wen take him to the woodshed and den wash his stupid mout wit soap. "For God's sake, you're a millionaire businessman. Act like one ya stupid SOB!"
Pussy grabbing. Adultery. Raping his wife.  Forcing himself on women. Lusting after young girls. Lying. Cheating. The list goes on.
Oh, come on.  She's got a popular voice and style.  She would have been a hit if she was an orphan.  You're being catty.  She certainly didn't become famous because of her boobs.  "A misogynist is a man who hates women as much as they hate each other." - H.L. Mencken
No, white males committing mass shooting are almost always connected with some organized violent group including white supremacists, so called men's rights activists who harass women reporting rape, anti-choice on the abortion issue extremists and other hate groups.  The vast majority of them also have a history of domestic violence.
Women should never drink because they might get raped. Whereas if a man gets drunk and rapes, well, he's just drunk. Being drunk means you can't consent. She never said yes.
No Jim, the worse thing about this case is this:  Scammers like this woman will cause people to become much more leery and hesitant about giving money to people who are really in need, and do indeed have cancer.    That is the real tragedy here.  Real cancer victims will now suffer, because of this evil witch.
Minister McKenna got called a barbie in a tweet by an outgoing inconsequential MP and she feels that she was "forced" to respond...rather than talk about what she wanted to talk about...what she believes to be an existential threat to the earth.  Margaret Thatcher once said, " power is like being a lady, if you have to tell people you are, you aren't"...she also said.".if you want something said, ask a man, if you want something done, ask a woman"...she also said..." if you want to cut your own throat, don't come to me for a bandage" ..s  Minister McKenna was handed a gift to show she was an influential and powerful woman...and she wasted it by appearing wounded by a fool...does anyone have the slightest thought that Margaret Thatcher would have altered her intended itinerary for the day to be " forced" to respond to being called a " climate barbie"
I'm not a fan of Trump. But the Democrat congress woman is worse, and so is the media.
Eminem is a performer.  If what Trump said about sexually assaulting women is just "locker room" talk, then so is what Em says.    I bet you defended Ailes and O'Reilly, too.  Hypocrites.
A breeze??  You're too willing to dismiss justice for victims of sexual assault as though we as a society shouldn't be troubled by having to convict rapists because, you know, it's just the women who are the victims (mostly) so why should anyone care? The only one doing the flapdoodling here is you.
http://samuel-warde.com/2016/10/trump-said-deeply-troubled-teens-best-bed-2004-howard-stern-interview/?  His own words compell me to believe these women. Just watch his interviews on Howard Stern. He's a pig.
Doyle puts Trump’s tweets and Brzezinski’s in the same category, although hers were clearly worse. Trump tweet about Brzezinski’s facelift was in poor taste, but he was making the point that she enjoys a lifestyle most Americans could never afford. It was legitimate for him to note the hypocrisy of a woman who would accept the hospitality of a man she claims is a threat to democracy. Brzezinski mocks Trump, not for anything he did himself, but for having small hands. How is this any different from making fun of someone for being black or having Spanish as their mother tongue?
Approximately 100,000 Americans are killed each year by the medical profession. So if you believe it's morally equivalent to kill people due to medical errors (wrong medication oops!), medical malpractice (what's a chest compression?) and preventable infections (simply washing hands between patients), versus erroneously handcuffing a upper-middle-class,  Caucasian professional female?
The point isn't whether "goo" is a person, but the fact if the "goo" wasn't disturbed by termination within weeks major organs are created and growing. This "goo" definitely becomes a person. Interfering with nature by going into a woman's body and yanking out or chemically melting the fetus causes the "goo" not to form into a person like it was meant too. You were "goo" once and obviously your mother left you alone to grow. "Goo" is a baby, keep your ridiculousness (and non-medical "goo" term) to yourself.
Saying Shoji recruited badly to throw the next coach under the bus is the most stupidest thing I ever heard.  You feel Shoji is that type of a person to do something like that?  Why would he sabotage women's volleyball and destroy everything he worked hard for?
this guy is an idiot. I'll disclose I'm male. but my wife had continual, high levels of "morning sickness", as did her sisters. You don't have diclectin, they're sick and miserable.  You swallow it and wait the few minutes to digest, and they're normally functioning pregnant moms. The relationship is as straight forward as having a shot of tequila and feeling the buzz in your head 5 odd minutes later. Not sure what this fellow has missed.
yeah, now listen to all the Clintonites whine about how horrid O'Reilly was.  I watched a TV program the other day where an attractive but slightly overweight black woman said, while nearly in tears, " O'Reilly came right up to me and said "How's it going Hot Chocolate?"" She then nearly broke into tears. WOW  It kinda sounded like a compliment to me. And not nearly as outrageous as Bill Clinton getting a blow job in the oral, I mean Oval, Office.
True but some clarification here: this has nothing to do with race or a white person shooting a black man...it was a black cop. So go protest blacks i guess. Or in tulsa, go protest white woman since it was a white woman. The caricature of the yosemite sam white cop attack blacks is just as stupid as the caricature of blacks as  crackheads and thugs...
She lies under oath, destroys evidence, sells out our country to the highest bidders, kills opponents, supports countries who execute gays and treat women like 3rd class citizens, laughs at getting rapists off, turns Libya into a hell-hole, lies about Benghazi after she left them there to die, smears the women her husband has raped and she calls Trump supporters "deplorables"?
So you must have voted for Harper because he was cute? Is that how it works, or is it only silly little women who vote on looks?
This clown Bishop McElroy along with quite a few others apparently, just doesn't get it:  A Muslim's primary purpose in life to to exterminate Christians, or anyone else who doesn't think like them.  Sweden is now the rape capitol of Europe and second in the world in rapes per capita, all thanks to the Muslim invaders.  They don't think like we do.  They do not share our values.  They have no respect for women, the environment, animals, or human life.  McElroy is naive and a fool.  Hopefully Darwins principle removes him from the picture because what he preaches is cultural and religious suicide.  A war is coming over the fate of the earth - Islam or Christianity.  We all need to pick which side we want to be on and quit consorting with the enemy.
So that that very same Liberal government could import loads of Muslim males to keep muslim women barefoot and pregnant and in the kitchen.
Is he transgender? I don't know. He takes hormones but no gender re-assignment clinic would accept this guy for transition because he refuses to live as an adult female (mental health is evaluated when you transition surgically). I doubt that he is so much an "embarrassing" example for the LGBT community as one you can get your teeth around and relish because you condemn the idea, period. You realize that many LGBT people have also denounced him as a hoax? His fetishes seem more sexual than anything else--wanted to have sex on "daddy's" lap, etc. Not a good sign.   I don't know if Jenner is a narcissist. Because she is also a celebrity and comfortable with attention, it's hard to tell. You can't judge all transgendered people on the basis of celebrities. All I know is that the REAL transgendered people I have met convinced me that they were meant to be the gender they were living as. In one instance I was duped for years. . . that's how real she was. She was more feminine that I was!
This is just an outright lie!  The congresswoman has apparently told this woman to bash our good president.  Do any of you think our president would call a grieving woman and tell her something like this?  'well, he knew what he was getting into'  Really?  It just doesn't make sense to any thinking person, left wing ideologue or not.  Please stop the rubbish.
You neglected to mention "MUSLIM".  Was there a reason?  If he had called 911 and screamed his allegiance to Jesus, I'm certain you would have emphasized it.  Am I right?  Why would any woman sympathize with Islam, Bill Clinton or Bill Cosby..... all womanizers?
Agreed.... another silly commission.  Just start ordaining married men, ordain women deacons, and then get on with it and ordain women (there is no good reason to not do so).
Of course she can't comment. She made Monica Lewinsky, a victim by HRC's own so-called standards, practically have to wear a scarlet letter on her forehead because of the original predatory sexual deviant, Bill! HRC talked total trash about ML. Remember his tv broadcast ("I did not have sex with that woman")???. No way can HRC be trusted to tell the truth or protect these victims-she's too busy protecting her sicko, pervy husband, which is a way bigger priority in her life than protecting women she doesn't know or care about. When is SOMEBODY going to tell the truth?
Spanking is a prophylactic against escalating bad behavior.  Nobody said parenting was going to be easy, but why make it harder than it need be? One spank on the bum for   pulling the heads off his  sister's Barbie dolls is better than a 2 our lecture about the rights of women in our society today.
ericnorstog, IF, and I say IF, I was God, and when you come before me for final judgement, I would cut off your male sex organ, and if you are a woman, I would stitch up your pusey.
Your not afraid for young women.  You are worried about yourself.  Don't worry, i am pretty sure the transgender is not a communicable disease.  Bruce Jenner?  What disgrace?  Celebrate the sick?   Why do you care so much?  By your comments, any mentally ill people should not be allowed to use public restrooms.  Remember, you do not want to "celebrate" the sick.  Please adjust tinfoil.
I admit that I did not hear the actual interview, so may well be lacking some context. BUT, someone as used to the spotlight as McEnroe should be able to deal with this subject without coming off as insulting a fellow athlete's accomplishments. He is correct, everyone should know that.. But going on about how men can beat women is unnecessary, irrelevant, and not just a bit boorish. But then, of course we are talking about Mr. 'ARE YOU F'ING KIDDING MEEEE!!!!!????' here.
San Francisco?  Eugene?  Would not be surprised to discover these women engaging in hate speech were lesbians.  Sidebar - Used to drag race with Veldon Kropf back in the day out at Balboa Dragstrip.  Good people.
But I guess it was ok For Obama to pardon a military male who transformed to a female who basically committed treason.  That's ok, but not this, talk about hypocrites
He has an insane amount of accounts and is anti-woman, anti-canadian and anti-logic. He's really insane.
You always hear that Trump is a misogynist, but I've never seen proof of his hatred of women.  You can call him sexist and a pig, but I really don't think he hates women.
Women can defend themselves, they don't need you, a man (presumably), defending them.  Thanks for being a blatant hypocrite.
How this idiot of a woman can still have 16% approval boggles my mind.  She should be in jail.
Right?!?! I grew up in a pretty red necked area of northern Michigan but we were taught to respect others and bullies were shunned. Now this "reality" tv star is bringing out the worst impulses of his followers. The lowest, meanest most bigoted and racist actions are justified for trump in spite of what I just know they were taught to not do in their formative years. Political blindness is like being okay with the quarterback of your chosen team even though he does drugs and abuses men and women off the field. Strange behavior. Sad.
In Europe, nobody would care. We are too law-crazy making too many things we like illegal. This schmuck really has a tool we all envy. He want to share his happiness through a photo selfie. No meeting took place. Fahgeddabouddit! He was just joking around. I remember a story about Sukarno who visited Russia. they knew he loved beautiful women so they procured a statuesque young blonde who fit the national pride of women. They banged into happiness and his dream of loving such a white beauty kept them awake all night. The next day the dirty Russkies tried to blackmail the President with colorful photos of his sexual escapade. He laughed and asked for a hundred copies of each photo. In Asian as well as Europe it is a man's right to pork any woman who so desires him. As long as he returns home to his wife, everything will be fine. Who or what brainwashed us into believing such a wonderful sport is so evil? Fork the government and its childish laws.
Using the word "populism" is another revision of former progressive words to further the aims and goals of fascism.  The ultimate effect of massive control of media at all levels through monopoly consolidations by giant economic monopolies - The Limbaugh Dictionary.  Populism's previous U.S. definitions were from the early 20th Century when farmers and workers rose up against the Robber Baron Monopolists, i.e., Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, Carnegie, Hearst, et. al.  Women protested for the right to vote. Now, it is used to describe a movement born by modern billionaires, Koch family, ALEC, Tea Party and ultimately the worst billionaire of all, Il Duce Trump.  The populists voted in the majority for Clinton as reflected in the "majority" voting.  The system was rigged by the same Corporate billionaire traitors to all human and civil rights.  A nation built on hate comes full circle to reap the whirlwind of final solution to finish what Hitler and Mussolini started.  Seig Heil!
I've just been made aware that the suspects, caught with a vehicle full of $3200 (per owner) worth of goods stolen in a local break-in, just got off with just about no penalties at all. This is part of a family with multiple convictions over the generations. However, the impounded vehicle (with the stolen goods inside) was released from impound to someone using a false address. The owner will never see his stuff again. The break-in artists are free to steal again. Now we neighbors are concerned that the brave person who followed and reported these professional thieves will be subject to retaliation. This is just a microcosm of the Mat-Su and Alaska justice system...mirrors the murder situation in this article. The reasons for not fully prosecuting miscreants is: Lenient ("too compassionate") District Attorneys; easy judges; and, the kicker: not enough room in our prisons. Violent offenders like Mr. Almeda are barely punished, allowing them to seduce and kill vulnerable young women.
Women make all the choices but sadly some of the choices aren't that great.  And sadly these women who make stupid choices expect us to pay.  Wake me up when it's 2019 or before if Junior "quits" or he's "fired".
Your site shows the Hispanic women more poorly compensated than the blacks, the whites or the Asians.    So they should be having the most abortions according to your 'suggestion'.
Do you know that some religious faith call for death of homosexuals, and treats women as third class citizens?
Gee thanks, Dan, for explaining it to us from a man's point of view.  Now, I'll go back and listen to women, who are the only people qualified to determine whether or not they have been discriminated against simply because they are women.  When you refer to dignity and symmetry of roles, I hear sexism and misogyny.  Keep up the good work of  justifying  that women are unequal to men by your continued use of euphemisms.  It astounds me that you and men who believe as you think that women are that stupid.
There's no question that Planned Parenthood serves a purpose for women and families in need of support.  I've never bought the political campaign that the far right-wing has lobbied for decades that they care about the fetus.  Hypocrites will turn on their mother and grandmother if it suits their purpose.  Children  born into poverty will die an early death while anti-Planned Parenthood marchers campaign against public assistance and Medicaid that throws these families a life line.  The far right is likely to throw them a shovel and tell 'em to dig six feet under.
Anytime you use a handgun and brandish it to rob unsuspecting people,(especially women) you simply are proving what a worthless scum you are. People that rob others with guns are far too dangerous to allow them to walk the streets. I have no pity or mercy for the diluge these three individuals are. When they get caught, and they will, throw the book at them. Anchorage has become a cesspool of violence from free loaders that move up to Alaska to it into the PFD. It sickens me to my core.
The author wrote a terrible and shameful piece. And feminism has its issues. But you've gone too far Nathan.
Legalize ALL drugs and in a year to eighteen months we'll have so many overdoses that we'll then be rid of these weak sisters.
And Women are still being oppressed, repressed, and distressed...even by an American president. Disgusting.
What is the basis for FGM? Extreme misogyny, jealousy of women's ability to grow life, hatred of women's sexuality. I cannot fathom the reasons for this kind of torture and mutilation! Perhaps if the head of a man's penis also had to be removed at the same time a woman's clitoris was removed this butchery would come to a quick end!
Why is the RCC unique?  No other religious group worldwide has incessant, incestuous infighting. All about celibate males jousting for power, control, not service. What a nightmare Jesus has conceived! Every group has infighting but the RCC has perfected it. As long as there is no accountability except to one man, there will be no balance of power and "power corrupts and absolutely power corrupts absolutely." The pope is a dictator; more subtly, an absolute monarch.  Despite VII's anemic attempt for collegiality, it has been effectively squashed, by the likes of subsequent dictator popes.  And worse, patriarchy restored with a vengeance.  Women need not apply. In the current power scandal, the only voice speaking truth to power is Marie Collins. See what happens when a woman has a voice?  Great evangelization, gang!  Keep it up! The RCC is not reformable.
It has been done for workers, that is if a corporation abuses their rights they have already signed a work agreement with that company that states any grievance has to go before an arbitrator and not a court of law. This has left many women raped or sexually assaulted while working for American corporations overseas no protection from such criminal acts while on the job and instead going to a company assigned arbitrator so they can "file" a complaint.
Better to vote for him than someone who has no respect for our country's secret and confidential documents.  I have several neighbors who tell me that they would be in jail had they followed Hilary's example.  Another American is hiding out in Moscow because he did.  Nice to have your husband, the ex-Pres, "accidentally" show up on the tarmac when the AG shows up in her jet and has a 30 minute chat about "golf scores".  If you believe that, you also believed the crooked finger emphasizing "I never had sex with that woman."
The import of it, so to speak, is to remind "the world" that there are idiots who think they are shaping the world through a lot of public relations activity. Making a movie and writing "music". Remember, broadcast TV needed a female body that could dance and, so to speak, sing because they were launching this new thing called MTV. Adolescent boys ate it up as it addressed their sexual fantasies. MSM loved it too, as they could sell more soap too. Once you are in the MSM, you are then a kind of immortal, insofar as media is involved, which is a separate "world" that "conquers" the actual world.
It was GOD who commanded that His priests be male back in the time of Aaron. To demand that females be ordained is an affront to God. That is not sexist or misogyniust unless God Himself is sexist and misogynist.
As a muslim women she is comfortable with her association to a religion that has a bloody history (as they all do, religions) and a system where human rights violations continue to modern day (stoning of women comes to mind). We can't associate any of that with her because #notallmuslims. Let's talk about literal race  (whiteness) instead?? And let's lump all the white people into a single group, which is okay because they happen to be a majority in Canada so you can't be racist against the whites because there are a lot of them (logic).  As a Canadian women, there is nowhere else in the world that I would feel more secure and free. Is she completely unaware of the apparent dissonance in her beliefs. Celebrating Canada day is about celebrating 150 years of progress- for me is about celebrating the fact that women have equal rights, which sadly is not the scenario for many women around the world sadly.
Speak up, what is your problem with old white men with young Oriental women? The two murderers are men who sleep with other men.
Is this tem necessary for your discussion?  "Schmuck", or "shmuck", in American English is a pejorative term meaning one who is stupid or foolish, or an obnoxious, contemptible or detestable person."  "In The Joys of Yiddish, Leo Rosten wrote: "Never use schmuck lightly, or in the presence of women and children", which was a common view among Jewish people who felt a connection to the language, and who still viewed it as an obscene reference to a penis.
GET OVER IT!!!!!! IT WAS AN EFFING JOKE!!!! Quit being so damn hyper sensitive.   YES, it was funny... It was funny because MOST nurses are indeed FEMALE! FACT. When I hear the word "NURSE" I, and statistically 100% of other human beings picture the woman with the white dress and hat. THATS HOW IT IS. DEAL WITH IT!  2) Statistically 100% of straight men WOULD NOT want gay men OOGLING their genitals and "admiring" them. FACT. That is NOT "Anti-Gay"... Its just FACT. I certainly would not want some gay guy checking out my private parts...   And you Leftists wonder why we cant stand you guys... You are NITPICKERS!!! You take apart EVERY DAMN sentence and analyze EVERY word... You take the fun out of EVERYTHING.   MAGA 2020.
Obama who?? Another week and Uncle Tom will be old news. Only legacy will be assuring no senile bag ladies and colored talking selfies, like we have here, will ever 'grace' the Oval office again! As for all the Marxist-feminist, gender bender, hipster latte sippers in California....too bad.....so sad.....you lost... park your brooms and change your pantsuit shorts. It's going to be a long EIGHT years for the west coast toker crowd!
Can you imagine having to work on a daily basis with this sour woman?
Yet this "racist congresswoman" is speaking the TRUTH. I know you hate to hear that, because it's doesn't fit the narrative that you would like (which is that this black woman is racist, and the honorable POTUS is honest Abe).  But you are wrong. It's not an opinion piece, this news is the damn truth. Wake up.
Okay, my second major problem with this article. I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the "sex for resources" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the "keepers" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of "good old days" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.
This is abuse, and it's disgusting to see you bragging about it. If you do this to your son now he will rebel when he's older, AND resent you for the rest of his life. I'll tell you what you can do -- about the most of what you can do. He's already into dance -- consider signing him up for more "masculine" dance classes, like swing or hip hop dancing. That way he keeps a connection to more "feminine" pursuits without harming his pride. More to the point, fucking ASK HIM FIRST. And respect his wishes. Your son is not your plaything, to mold as you see fit.
Lying about Russia. Obfuscating the truth. Embarrassing America overseas... But it's still better than child rape, groping, and seducing a woman on her honeymoon while his wife was pregnant... A pretty low bar...
The unmitigated arrogance and hubris of these 'no-kill' imbeciles never ceases to amuse me.  So convinced are they of their own "righteousness" they can't imagine that more than one person would EVER disagree with them.  No, I'm not Rain25.  She's female and I'm male.  We don't even live in the same country.  One thing we have in common is that neither of us are idiots.  Don't you wish you could say the same.
To be fair he/she would be welcome in team sports. The girls with the he/she will have an advantage. But in individual sports it is unfair. Notice there are no females dressing as males competing as males. They would also not be welcome on a guys team. So since this transgender issue will likely favor only guys being girls it will come out unequal. And until you menstruate and have cramps you are not a real woman. I would like to hear from girls dressing as boys and see if they feel equal amongst the boys.  I personally feel robbed as a female letting males impersonate females.
"Last week, the Proud Boys – a male-only group devoted to promoting the superiority of Western culture – disrupted a Mi’kmaq protest in Halifax, while wearing adorably matching polo-neck shirts. The founder of the Proud Boys is Gavin McInnes, who is a bit like the Don Rickles of anti-feminism, complete with jokes retrieved from a time capsule packed in 1962. Feminists are ugly, did you know? Their ovaries are all dry and shrivelled up! Behold the beer glass filled with male tears." ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ The question here remains... Is This Paragraph Classified As Civil..??  /..
NATO is now questioning USA ...Obama is trying to thwart the duo force - Trump/Putin.  Trump is taking us right into WWIII ... hate to pop your little bubble.  No worries, Trumps Russian womanizing & American Woman degradation will take him down faster than anything else.  We're right back to Woman-power.  He's toast.
Cultural competence says Jesus would have told them to 'go and sin no more'. Homosexuality was never accepted in Jewish or Christian teaching.  It still isn't. Neither was men or women wearing the other sexes' clothing. The Church is warned about 'wolves that come dressed as sheep', a falling away in the Last Day, and people with 'itching ears'. I am sure that once again I will be 'stoned' for my thoughts. But the liberals love to kill the messenger, because they hate the Message.
Yeah, I sure see a very familiar pattern: bitter divorced guys who seem to think all women are liars.  Take no notice of them. No one else does.
"to combat forces that are corroding our social fabric."? i.e. Sharia Law Anyone that has had to deal with zealous muslims will have experienced the intense dislike they have for 'infidels' (non muslims) especially if you are a women.
School of hard knocks...Syrian muslim female, remove your head scarves and your big enveloping baggy voluminous clothes. Look how Canadian women dress. Copy.  How you dress is what people see first. The head scarves are a red flag to most Canadians. You will close doors.  This is one of the school of hard knocks. You are not in a muslim country.
From the political perspective I find this situation hilarious. The democrats have spent years very successfully painting republicans as "anti-women". Now one of their very own, a large contributor and vocal supporter with a bully pulpit, is being accused by numerous women of sexual misconduct. It seems his personal friends and recipients, like Hillary, came down with cases of lock-jaw. What about that "nasty woman" Ashley Judd who waited 20 years, and only after achieving success, to now come out and accuse Weinstein. Hypocrites?
Then, there was Axa Parvaz who was killed by her father for refusing to wear a hijab.  Honour killings in Canada are actually a leading cause of death for females now.  It is disguised as " domestic violence" by our supplicating news media   to protect Islam from shame.  BTW, Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal was an act of Islamic terror because the killer, whose real name was Gamal  a Muslim, believed women should not be out getting higher education.
"So if a man leaves he's a loser and if she leaves him...he's a loser."  Well, sure, it's in keeping with the baseline supposition:   If a man despises women, he's an a-hole; if a woman despises men, it's because men are a-holes.  Feminists do have a kind of consistency going there, it's just not what you'd call rational.
CATER to the loggers? as in like tricking? FOOL!  i did the logging. Can you handle a 36" bar chainsaw?  Can you figure how a tree's gonna fall? can you tell which one comes down first in a stand of a dozen trees?  Can you pop a round open with a maul?   come on out into the woods with me and i'll "cater" to you...... wear your tin pants - you're gonna need'em what a sick fantasy life you lead - everything leads to ugly for you.....your brain works on flipped circuits.....    DG:  "i don't read CU posts 99% of time. they more often than not, seem to be a random "statement" from a sci fi book , dropped into the middle of whatever. and his view of women is disturbing and creepy."
Wonder if he's recovered from mommy's special pictures and daddy bragging about sexually assaulting women? Not enough therapy can help that little sperm.
How dare you. How dare you, a white girl who didn't vote for the most asinine inhuman being who ever became president, give me a ration 'o shit without using your real name.
I'm tired of the feminist rant.  As a middle aged white male, everyone is looking to blame their problems on me - problems from the past that I didn't have a hand in.  Suck it up princess - you've got far more choices than I do.
I hope this passes! After all my years going to Boulder, having an office there, I've found the people there, though progressive and ultra liberal, ONLY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR WAY OF LIFE! Everything in Boulder is so lily white though the liberals there all yell and scream for diversity... and also... NIMBY... not in their pristine world. Just got finished dating a Boulder woman there and I could not be more disappointed in her as a person! She harped about equality and racial values yet not once did I ever see a black or Latino among her or any of her friends. What a bunch of hypocrites there! Plus, nobody except for trust funders or very wealthy folks can afford to live in Boulder anymore. She poo-pooed Denver neighborhoods yet I live in a completely paid off beautiful ranch, on 1/4 acre in a quiet neighborhood and she lives in a cramped townhouse that's claustrophobic and she paid $600K for basically a micro townhouse to live in Boulder. Haha!
The woman needs to learn how to come up with more plausible lies.
Omar Khadris a murderer and the left thinking as usual are trying to make him out as a great guy.He bloddy well killed a guy and you let him walk around like some saint.Justin now brings in Syrian murderers like its nothing and they are mainly yong men who wouldnt fight for thier country and get more money than hard working Canadians.What the hell is wrong with Ottawa.I dont care he was 13 years old,He knew beter than to kill just like the inderage woman who killed Rena Virk and she is still in jail.
I agree ...this goes back to my comments about the differences between men and women. A woman neglects to practice safe sex when she decides to engage in reproductively provocative behavior ... squanders her opportunities to choose via the morning after pill ...finds out she is pregnant and she (and the law) decide if she elects to keep the child then the man is on the hook for the next 18 years and if she elects to kill her baby the man has absolutely zero say in the matter at all. Is there anyone who really thinks that we don't run things?
Sounds like producer intended a form of Semitic hyperbole to make a point? Didn't see it.  Wonder if his point was the institutional church was anti-sex? A trove of works underscore how bad sex was.  No "Joy of Sex" manuals in RCC circles! Pleasure and sex were not condoned until Aquinas thought a little pleasure was acceptable, only in context of conception.  Hence the RCC joke, "Not a sin if you didn't take pleasure in it".  And masturbation remains a mortal sin! Taking pleasure when not conceiving. The stranglehold on sexuality in the hands of men supposedly celibate!? Like 9 Republican senators deciding on health care for women. Not that films may be bizarre but the theater of the absurd we're forced to play roles in is.
Outsider:  I truly feel a woman would have to be drugged unconscious, tied down with barbed-wire and forcibly raped by three different men in front of at least ten wittnesses and videotaped before you would consider it to be inappropriate sexual behavior or sexual harassment. Gary Crum
There is not now, nor has there ever been any excuse for sexual assault. I understand and empathize with females in this regard: some guys are just jerks. This (human relations), is something that must be constantly be taught, apparently, as a new crop of young people come up ever year. I've been involved with this university for 60 years, first ass a youngster and then as a student. I wish the school the best in this effort to combat sexual violence. I"m happy they are finally taking this matter seriously.
The woman is a traitor.
Another completely off course tirade against the male gender Weinstein is one person who allegedly sexually harassed and allegedly raped a group of people. His behaviour does not represent the male gender, male Hollywood producers, male CEOs, or any group of males.    Stop slandering an entire gender to suit your daily quota of man bashing.   This is just disgusting. Try REPORTING the news once in a while instead of making every story into a 1970’s era feminist college case study.  It’s pathetic.   The real victims in this study are the ugly women and men of Hollywood who never get the opportunity to be sexually harassed in exchange for highly sought after roles.  They are the ones we should be reallly sympathizing with, not the hotties with huge paychecks, awards and armies of fans.
This needed to happen, IMO.  Assad is a thug who murders innocent women and children.  I am under no illusion that Syria is going to become a liberal democracy, but can they please get a dictator who doesn't horrifically gas babies.  (Oh and this is after Aleppo which was basically genocide.)   Wasn't Tillerson appointed because he was buddies with Putin?  Perhaps Tillerson should lobby Putin to drop Assad.  I am sure that there is an Alawite mullah or tribal leader who isn't involved with this thuggery who can be in charge.  Putin should find a different client, can Assad, and have him tried for war crimes in the Hague.
Now that Trump is our President, it means we can slam liberals up side the head with baseball bats and grab women anytime we want, because that's how he rolls and we get to do the same thing now as his supporters and loyal followers of Donald J. Trump, our new Fuhrer!
Amazing the double standard of our media.   It is open season for journalists to constantly demean and insult the new President of the USA.   If Clinton got in would the same ignorant comments be flying about a female?....or is just because yet again we have another raving Liberal getting space to vent?   I think media, like the G & M had better learn soon that there are many people who support Trump, and just because it is 'cool' to constantly slam him for fellow media and Hollywood Liberal high fives.....it is getting very old.
Don't invite Trump period.  Let him flail around for a few months until he's impeached.  Then I suppose we'll have to invite the creationist, anti-gay, misogynist Pence, but at least he won't be grabbing women's genitals when he gets off the plane.
Conservatives hate anyone smarter than themselves, that's why they hate women.
I am secure with the way I was born, I do not feel like a woman nor want to be one but if you Johan feel like a woman you can be one. To each his own I guess....Maybe some day with the liberal way of thinking,if you feel like a dog , even though you were not born a dog, you can be a dog. You could howl at the moon and drag your butt across the floor all you want Johann.
Some men are taught to view some women as worthless.  Sexual harassment is caused by women too not just men.  Some men are just opportunists.  Women at work compete usually so it is hard to get other women at work to defend each other. I tell young females that if you think females are horrible while your young then just wait until you get older.  They only get worse.   Women compete for status and attention, not necessarily for money.. I have hardly ever seen women support each other at work and school unless they are friends.
Above Center is making a typical racist and xenophobic comment. Political Correctness has been the bugbear of the Right ever since they were forced to accept Women, Gays, and People of Colour into the political forum.  Notice we are "a Nation" according to Above Center.  No longer One Country/Two Nations. Or even a Mosaic of Nations. And what are these code words "ideas & innovation"? How are we being held back by "political correctness"? Oh, right, because Liberals won't approve those pipelines. Hahaha.
Yet, she had no problem staying with serial sex offender Bill for all these years.  Hillary gives me the creeps.  What kind of manipulative, ambitious woman does that?  One that cannot be trusted.
American women are traitors in Trump's America
So therefore Germany shouldn't apologize either, given the firebombing of their cities, the mass rape of German women instigated by the Soviet Jew Molotov, and the 4.5 million German civilians who died/were murdered after the war (1945-7) during the ethnic cleansing of the Eastern third of Germany that the Russians, Poles and Czechs ripped off? Hmmm... maybe you are right.
Trump made fun of women's appearances. He made fun of women's periods.  His infamous line: "grab 'em by the p****"   And despite all of this:  He won 53% of the white female vote  45% of college educated female voters  42% of women's votes overall  And 9 million more women than men vote in the US election.  Women had the opportunity to break the biggest glass ceiling in the world and vote for a female candidate that was also the globe and fail's preferred candidate as they have constantly reminded us after the election, but chose not to. The biggest whiners, Ms. Renzetti, are reserved for those who participated in the women's march the day after he was elected and could not accept the result of a democratic election.
Sing it, Mr. Krustofski.  The only thing close to a violent incident I have experienced in Anchorage is when a white male threatened his girlfriend at my gym, my husband approached and told him to knock it off, the perp was about to hit my husband, and a recent arrival from Sudan backed up my husband, yelling loudly, so the white male creep backed off. Yes women have to be careful - that's what we've been told all our lives, it's nothing new.  The only male who was violent with ME (when I was a girl) was white, too.  I have learned to not pre-judge all white males as ignorant creepy perverts - it's ignorant to judge people by the color of their skin. So knock it off! Oh wait, I forgot the alcoholic who pointed his shotgun at me, way out on a trial north of Talkeetna - yeah, you guessed it, white male too.
Well, in one instance mentioned, MEN as well as women, presumably, have every right to be "aggrieved."  I'm referring to the four-day Swedish music festival now cancelled next year because of "reported" rapes and sexual assaults. Talk about over-reaction. And I mean it.  All these incidents are alleged and unproven, at this writing. If charges are laid, some will likely be tossed because of lack of evidence; others may never go to court because some of the complainants (perhaps as addled by alcohol or drugs as their "attackers") will recant.   CBC says the festival "draws about 40,000..."    Ok, lets say of the 27 nasty sexual incidents reported, 20 turn out legitimate: that's .05% of the total who attended the festival.  Heck, next year, just ban liquor and drugs stronger than pot!    See? Cancellation is over-reaction.  See that knee-jerk all the time, much like this column about a small group of stupids and misfits in polo shirts who represent nobody but their pitiful selves.
The problem with the Catholic faith, other religions, government, the military, law enforcement, and criminal justice is this; they are all dominated by men, and mostly by white authoritarian men! Sorry guys, but most men aren't known for their empathy for others or planning for the long term versus short term pleasure. In Trump we see these negative qualities magnified a thousand times. Frankly, I'm sick of it! All the institutions that make countries a good place where their citizens can thrive would be much improved if at least half the people wielding power and making decisions were women! More than half would be even BETTER! Now we see what the world is coming to. Short term greed takes precedence over the environment. Short term greed is more important than people and communities. Make no mistake, we are killing ourselves. But the authoritarian white men causing this genocide will be long dead before their grandchildren start paying the price.
Really?  Must have missed it.  This woman is a hack.
No need attack the president's character, which has been on public display for decades. Trump is a rich "playboy" who cheats his business partners and contractors, gropes women, fires people for entertainment, employs illegals for dirt wages,  trades wives in like last year's Buick, and has never read a book. The last thing Trump is, is "innocent", unless you mean "innocent of  wisdom". Trump says he "loves the working people" but if you believe that, you are truly incapable of rational thought. What is astonishing is that 42 million Americans voted for him, in spite of the fact that Trump would take away their jobs, support and health care.  The drama has only begun to unfold. Comey was very careful not to leak or perjure himself. His classified information will go to the Senate committee in closed session. Trump is the big leaker, along with his truly unhappy subalterns. Anyone who still thinks  Trump is anything but a swindler is truly, pathetically stupid.
Lousy headline as usual. Lashes out doesn't need to be in the conversation.  Kelly did a compassionate speech to the press. The women Congresswoman is a loon. She called for Trump to be impeached 20 minutes into his Presidency. Trump was trying to something positive. It got turned into shi.....
what complete rubbish, here in canada woman have all the same equal rights if not MORE rights than men period
All that may be true, Andrew, including "associated being gay with being a sexual predator."  Quite likely--because we're dealing with human beings here--some gays ARE sexual predators. No groups--and very few individuals--are left untainted.  What's missing here--because (1) it's subtle, attitudinal and often more private (2) It has been condoned by society and (3) makes men look weak and foolish, is sexual harassment and even assault perpetrated by women.   Many women--past, present and, possibly, in the future--will continue to offer sexual favours (to husbands, mainly) as a bargaining chip, "gimme what I want, then maybe I'll give you what you want..." often it's implicit in years-long relationships. The ultimate "gimme" would be the engagement/wedding ring trade off.  Without it...no sex at all.  This behaviour can be seen to be encouraged--or aided and abetted--by a society that traditionally gave women no other real power except what they took for themselves in bedrooms.
I waited for said feminist to open a door at the Mall. She just stood there waiting for me to.  I opened it, squeezed through and shut it behind to the squeals of hate coming from behind the glass. OMG did we laugh.  BTW women are not second class citizens. They are mostly spoilt brats who are simply conflicted between wanting total freedom until they realize they have to get their hands dirty.
The cheek of the woman, well your Canadians MP's have let the woman push thru her first step. There will be more to come, it won't stop now, Muslims are on their way to running Canada. Its amazing that Canadian MP's can be so so stupid, passing special laws for a Religion that states people "not of that Religion" should be put to death. You need to read the Koran. The Quran contains at least 109 verses that call Muslims to war with nonbelievers for the sake of Islamic rule. Some are quite graphic, with commands to chop off heads and fingers and kill infidels wherever they may be hiding. Muslims who do not join the fight are called 'hypocrites' and warned that Allah will send them to Hell if they do not join the slaughter.
Are you saying this woman is "street trash"? Did you watch the video or read her story? Your comment is about as dumb as it gets.
Legal authorities need to use tRump's words that were captured on audio/video to the fullest extent of the law.  There's probably a lot more than a dozen women that have already come forward to publicly admit what tRump did to them.  The sting of tRump saying, "When I see a beautiful woman I can't wait.  I have to kiss 'em...I'm a star and they like being grabbed by the p___y."
What absolute rubbish to make a statement like "Good riddance" especially to these men and women who our trying to uphold our constitution and keep this President and his criminals from continuing to steal from our tax coffers and the people of South Africa .....just stupid!
" .. Does this woman really believe we are so dumb not to see .." She merely believes what is actually self evident - Ontario voter ARE that dumb !  Think about it - she has bought the teaching establishment votes - the same establisment who teach the finer points of Discovery Math that prepares future Ontario citizens to vote for Liberals contrary to any evidence of malfeasance ......  .-)
As usual the article had no real information. No facts or evidence mentioned just the women's claim and nothing else. What a worthless use of space.
Honestly, Sher, you are so intelligent, and your comments are mostly well thought out and logical, to me anyway, but sometimes...  Segregation in some sports is necessary.  Few women possess the physical strength men have, hence women's tennis, golf, football, etc.  This is done to level the playing field, forgive the pun.  Sex segregated schools have little, if anything to do with marginalization of women.  There are many reasons why sex segregated schools are actually better, but we can argue that another time.   We can argue who did what hundreds of years ago, but apart from being a history lesson, who wins the "we were more advanced first" war does little to help in this case, although you don't mention the Incan civilization, or Mayan...  Westerners are complacent, some arrogant, but I'd say more ignorant in our belief that " It can't happen here",however I see that changing.  Western civilization is under threat, we would be wise to become a bit more vigilant.
More complete and utter nonsense from Balki. There is no problem with masculinity, males, powerful males, straight males, etc. NONE WHATSOEVER. There are a few PEOPLE committing illegal, unlawful, immoral and unauthorized acts against other people. End of story. Stop labeling all men, or all powerful men, or Geeks? Really Geeks?? "Deep down the Geek knows?" Are you f&cking kidding me Balki? Now you are labeling, berating, mocking, discrediting, vilifying, STIGMATIZING an entire class of people, young men who work in technology, because a handful of people acted inappropriately? Out of millions? Do you read your own crap? "Empowered after centuries of having sand kicked in their faces, too many tech geeks are asserting their newfound dominance over women repeatedly and repulsively" ???? You are a sick person. Your stories are garbage. This entire discussion is sad, pathetic and symptomatic of the spiraling demise of the mainstream media as it will soon be formerly known.
a real test for our feminist leader - he capitulated on arms sales to misogynist saudi arabia   if he does the same here - whatever credibility he has will be shot  might as well change his name to Ben Dover
Way off. 13% refers to men, women, and kids. White men 31% of the population.  Black men 3.5%. Black men are FORTY times more likely to commit a violent crime. I love it you think wikipedia is reliable. Go to the Us Census and the DOJ. That's where I get my "lies" OK Ericsnot?
To make such a blanket statement that men would take advantage of a drunk woman who passes out, is rather sexist of you.      That said, there are indeed some who will.   And that is why young women should not facilitate such crimes, by making it much, much easier for the perpetrator.
Wouldn't that defeat the whole purpose of the term "alt-right"?  The term began as a catch-all for a mainly Internet-based melange of traditional liberals, libertarians, and conservatives who oppose the accelerating influence of the authoritarian left (itself a melange of radical leftists, radical feminists, Communists, pro-Islamist, pro-censorship, college activist types). It's purpose has been to delegitimize non-authoritarian forms of liberalism and their concerns (e.g.: civil liberties and human rights, anti-authoritarianism, anti-globalization, pro-labour, legal due process, media skepticism, free exchange in the marketplace of ideas) by associating them with authoritarian right-wing ideologies like white supremacy, Neo-Nazism, Islamophobia, etc.    I get why you would think that you're "calling a spade a spade" by refusing to use the term "alt-right", but the whole point of it is to slyly associate liberalism with Neo-Nazism without courting libel.
" ....after an apology for past instances of racism (dressing up as a geisha, fetishizing black women’s hair). Her penitence seemed empty...." Taken straight from 17th century puritanical philosophy. Why not just sit Katy Perry at the front of the church and humiliate her like a 17th century pregnant teenager, or make her wear a hair shirt, like the monks of old, or set up stocks in the town centre where she can be really ridiculed and physically abused. In fact why stop there? Run her out of town. Prohibit her from selling records. Ruin her career.  This is how you victimize someone who is a major supporter of LGBTQ. This sanctimonious column is a disgrace to the Globe and Mail.
For those who think they are white as snow and without blemish I must repeat this truth: From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.  People, this is not gossip and hearsay.
Alceste, you are a woman's sexual organ
Exactly.  Trump always does the right thing when it comes to women.  Slick Willy uses women like a condom and then flushes them down the crapper.     And Hillary empowers him.  It goes to moral bankruptcy which is not a positive presidential value.  LOCK HER UP!  LOCK HER UP!  LOCK HER UP!  LOCK HER UP!
You have no idea what the pregnant woman has been thru. Your ignorance shows again.  Do yourself a favor and educate yourself on the difference between a refugee (one who is fleeing perhaps even for ones life), Google photos of Syria today,... for starters.  And grow some compassion.
Don't underestimate these mysoginist Albertans. They are neither insane or stupid. They are no different than their likes in USA. They are likely well educated, middle class men and women who prefer to be racist, segregationist and sexist. You may not like the tone of this message but you can't deny the inherent reality within.
The American 'sisterhood' had its chance to save NAFTA and many other beneficial institutions such as the EPA and the State Department but instead voted against one of it's own to install in the White House a mentally ill, illiterate fascist. There is no case here to imply the girls are any smarter than the boys.
So many lies, where to start: 1. Cite your sources that prove the Dems know about the most famous tape when flip-flopper political opportunist Trump  - whom you so admire -  when he was a Democrat. 2. Provide proof that the Democratic Party ever considered Trump their “darling” 3. I guess you don’t know about the suits Trump has settled over sexual harassment; 4. I guess you don’t know about the women - and men - who have come forward to discuss the sexual assaults he has committed and his disgusting bragging about his exploits. 5. And this a big one: please provide cites to your literally unbelievable statement that “ all the women he has met with in person agree that he’s been a perfect gentleman....” I mean, I’ve seen women talk about Trump shoving them up against walls and feeling them up.
You know the old saying: garbage in, garbage out. "Calgary’s unfounded rate was 10 per cent. “Our rate was lower than the average,” [Staff Sergeant] said, “so our members do do good work – but we can always do better.”  An insult to police: "do better" based on what standard?  An insult to the public: the "unfounded rate", unfortunately, is meaningless.  Because we don't know what "unfounded" means.  Police departments have different interpretations.  To feminists, "unfounded" means police don't believe complainants (often called "victims", even before sexual assault is proven.) Not necessarily true.  Therefore, the "unfounded rate" is...garbage.  Garbage in...so garbage out. What police/public/complainants need is consistent file assessment; clear definitions.   Got questions on the "gold standard model" (Philadelphia's oversight) and don't give me lowered "unfounded rate"--that's garbage. What's unfounded mean in Philly? Any unintended consequences? Conviction rate up? Stats pls!
Ugly feminism. Saying that girls are in conflict with the male rulers, the patriarchy. It is brainwashing children with alt-right propaganda.
Say what you will about Clinton, but my God man, an old adulterous bankrupt casino magnet with multiple marriages who lives in a gilded sex palace and who has a long history of openly disgusting and abusive comments about minorities.    Why would any woman be creeped out by that?
I truly believe most people find grabbing women by the crotch to be reprehensible.
You're far too kind by delicately phasing "the Democrats are cooked". LOL  In reality, they would all be given a fair trial and then swiftly executed via a traditional Islamic beheading for supporting abortion, gays, adultery, pre- and extra-marital sex! For those that are not aware, public be-headings for just those highly anti-Islamic religious beliefs are as common as fiestas in Mexico! LOL   I say let the (D)onkey voters seal their own fate by allowing our new Muslim overlords rewrite our laws! LOL  WARNING: Graphic and Disturbing Woman Beheaded In Broad Daylight in ‘Moderate’ Muslim Nation While Police Watch... http://www.israelvideonetwork.com/woman-beheaded-in-broad-daylight-in-moderate-muslim-nation-while-police-watch/
Fuck this ain't no female this is a crazy ass tranny that threatens and harasses the homeless threatens people on a regular picks fights with men all the time I think it's bs that she he is playing the poor women card when she has no problem picking fights with men and has harassed Jeeves the one who pushed her many times don't talk shit don't get thrown through a window pretty simple
cholo isn't pro-lgbt or anti-lgbt. cholo just believes in a little common sense. you should go to the bathroom depending on what you currently got. have a penis? go to the mens. a vagina? then go to the womens. simple. transgender? well if you cut off your wang and now have a hole then go to the womens. and if you had a hole and plugged it up with a pole then go to the mens. feeling mahu? sorry, if you still have a penis you go to the mens. likewise, if you feeling butch but still have a vagina the womens restroom is where you go.
T. Swift alleges that M. Mueller touched her bare bottom.  No panties?  I'd have gone for a sphincter massage.  Some girls like dat.
exactly hence cholo's common sense solution. have a penis? you go to the restroom for penises and likewise for vaginas. no debate and no need to identify being a man or woman. simply go to the restroom with what you've got. got it? what's to argue about? well cholo is pretty sure someone will come up with something but only to stir up more trouble.
If they knew what a creep he is - gropes women, can "shoot a person on 5th Ave in NYC and wouldn't lose a vote", in addition to behaving like a boorish king. He's known for colorful speeches that promise much but deliver nothing. Nothing like having an admitted sex offender for POTUS. Perhaps he just announced he's leaving and the boys went wild.
Thanks for that link to CNN.  It is nausea inducing how he mentions that he is a feminist, no matter what the question.
He knew the hearts of men/women.  MSW and WALFORD don't.  It's these "don't judge judgers" that drive the rest of the world nuts.  They don't see their own hypocrisy!!!!
VERY well said.  I would add: the push for universal human rights is not an issue any group owns. No one gets to police my legal, empathetic, and productive push for rights by acting as ideological hall monitors. Sorry, you can try, but no. Too many SJW persons (a noble calling) don't understand that rage and verbal attack are, well, Trumpian methods. It's a mode that fails to accord with what it calls for in others: empathy, tolerance, dialogue. It's the overheated strands of SJW rhetoric that actually helped Trump, dividing the left and creating a back lash. Consider Rorty's GENIUS prediction of the Trump movement: "One thing that is very likely to happen is that the gains made in the past 40 years by black and brown Americans, and by homosexuals, will be wiped out. Jocular contempt for women will come back into fashion. … All the resentment which badly educated Americans feel about having their manners dictated to them by college graduates will find an outlet."
This woman is just as arrogant as Justin. No wonder he made her a minister.
Trudeau praised and complimented the women. But attendee Lianna Rice attacked Trudeau by saying with contempt that "white men" represented Canada. What a racist and misandrist.
Your first sentence shows how clueless a person can be. If you are a result of the Canadian education system, I weep for it.  Before it is too late, go to a vet hospital and talk to the few remaining Pacific war vets and tell them the atomic bombs were an experiment on woman and children.  See what there reaction is to your moronic opinion.
Being gay is no defence if a woman is motivated to make an accusation of sexual misconduct.    In the gay world  that's how we say "Hello, nice day".
ISIS like to rape women, send him to ISIS.
I won't base my life on a book written 2000 years ago. The Bible is full of stories and written by people who participated in heinous crimes ranging from murder, genocide, mass murder, horrific child abuse, rape, incest, stonings, crucifixation, plagues etc. People bitch and moan about sex education in school but find it perfectly acceptable to teach their children about an innocent man crucified on a cross. The Children's edition has color pictures many churches especially Catholic Churches have life size replicas of naked bloody Jesus hammered to a cross.  God did not forgive or forget. He killed men, woman & children. He killed anyone who crossed him. He killed to make a point. I was raised in a Christain home, grew up in church. Now I refuse to go to church. I despise organized religion. God is a God of love, forgiveness and compassion yet the biggest hateful hypocritical bigots I have ever met claim they are Christian & people of God. Hate preached from a pulpit is still hate.
Schandelmeier has some good points and some nice lines but he can never get through an article without a paternalistic, stupid sentence like this one: "The hunters that hauled those rutty animals back to town are going to find their wives more finicky than my dog." First off, can't he find a better comparison than wives to dogs? Second, it's hardly "finicky" to not want to eat something that he describe two sentences earlier as inedible. Third, there are plenty of women who hunt, caribou or otherwise. Not every woman is sitting at home waiting for her tough guy husband to come home with a dragged carcass and a load of patronizing BS.
No matter how you slice it, 80% of the gain in obesity is women, according to CDC. Women have become such disgusting fat-bodies Oprah, Rosy and the rest demand that men learn to love the fatties. Young men of today have few options without going overseas for a wife. Before the 90s, women were slim, well dressed and mostly pretty. Nowadays, most are obese, tatted up, blue and orange hair, pierced, the gamut. Aside from simple obesity, it's all the other stuff. Disgusting.
As happy as you may have been to leave I assure you that many of us were positively delighted. From the insane and embarrassing effort to portray Moochelle as the most beautiful and glamorous woman in the history of the world to the hero-worship of her dim-witted husband, we were trapped in an 8 year nightmare. I hope I never have to see your angry, bitter face again. Get over yourself.
Well just how bloody crazy can things get?   So, if you're equipped to make a stand-up job of urination - you get to use the men's toilet, otherwise, go sit in the ladies room.  It's really simple, but the liberals want to befog even this!
I don't get parts of this "Pride Week". As a heterosexual male I don't get a parade and I surely don't get a week where people celebrate based solely upon my sexuality. No one outside of my family celebrates the fact that I have been with the same woman since we were both teenagers (12-13) and now we are both in our 50's!   Why is being gay all of a sudden so special that they get an entire week of festivities? I get Fathers day and my wife gets Mothers day! Why isn't the fact that we are a family celebrated for a week? I just don't understand why we need a gay pride week instead of Lesbian/Bi-sexual/Gay/Transgender/Queer day.   Why do we celebrate people based solely on their sexuality?
I posted my comment with trepidation because I knew I would get the "Oh you foolish girl" type of response and your arrogant, dismissive response doesn't disappoint.
The DC Republicans are pathetic. For 8 years all we heard was "We have better solutions for health insurance. Vote us into power and we'll fix everything". Now they're on their second try and can't even get an agreement from their own party. Obamacare took 1 year to draft, so I'm not sure why they feel the need to rush a bad bill through in the first 6 months. If they're so confident Obamacare will fail, let it and then come to the table with a "savior" bill that will pass due to public pressure that will be on Congressmen/women.
What the mental midgets fail to grasp is this is every bit a part of the human experience, and without it, the human experience cannot exist. Now, to further expose just how profoundly stupid these people are, if a woman has the right over her body then why is she prosecuted for drinking heavily while pregnant and birthing a deformed baby? It's not a human being in the womb, remember. It's just a blob of cells (sic) the woman has the right (sic) to do whatever she wants to.
"Sexual Predator"... You mean "Women giving themselves over to a billionaire" as women do. You lost me after that, T...
Definition of mob rule: control of a political situation by those outside the conventional or lawful realm, typically involving violence and intimidation.  Taken in context with the rest of your post referencing the "hazards of tyranny," I would say I understand the intent of the phrase, "mob rule."   Are you comparing the peaceful march in Seattle to people hanging blacks from streetlights?  I'm not sure how you can draw any comparison between the two.  Women began fighting for the right to vote in 1848 when they started to organize nationally and convene women's conferences all over the US.  They organized parades, pickets and marches.  They were beaten, jailed and went on hunger strikes.  To suggest that after 72 years of fighting, women were given the right to vote because of the intellect of the Republican party is an ignorant conclusion that ignores the years of struggle and pressure women put on both the president and the congress.
Too late. Its already happening. CBC and Trudeau liberals call it  just a crime of some sort without any particular explanation. except for social alienation. Even when  a Muslim  shrieks Allah Akbar while shooting a guard at  the Cenotaph and invades Parliament, out political better just shrug and say we need more research.   IF Woodies in Toronto gets blown up Islamist Canadians don't expect any truth  in  the  Globe, Star or CBC about what really happened.   Ecole Polytechnique was in reality an Islamic raid to keep women out of school.
I think she inhaled a big dose of stupid. Smartest woman in American can't remember a darn thing when questioned by congress.
Women must wear strict hijab even covering their faces entirely.  And they should also wear opaque sunglasses. We don't want to see these monstrosities. Right, guys!
"One in three women has been a victim of sexual assault in her lifetime. One in five adult women has been raped; so, too, have one in 20 girls. One-third of adolescent girls report their first sexual experience as being forced, or coerced. "   These statistics are shocking because of the unnecessary pain and suffering caused to victims, but also because they imply similarly high proportions of men are either rapists, have forcefully coerced women into sex or are otherwise sexually violent. Do we have any statistics on the percentage of men who are rapists in our society? This seems to an important bit of information in looking for solutions. Thanks.
At this point it's quite a few "she saids" though, and some really prominent names.   Plus there was the recording of him groveling with some woman to come into his room to watch him masturbate.
What? "Sex has not been a difficult issue for the Church... or for people"   ??  What planet are you on?    Temptation is more than "somewhat challenging." In the early days of the church, so many men were castrating themselves (to be holy "eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven" that  Emperor Hadrian instituted the death penalty for anyone who castrated without official permission, as well as for any doctor who performed the deed.    In Islam, sex was such a strong temptation that men forced its women to wear burkas.  Even today Mike  Pence won't allow himself to have dinner with any women other than his wife.  LOL !  Seems to me this has always been a BIG issue.
No, because it discriminates against men when women are always complains that men discriminate women. We don't need this junk meaning the feminist attack on men.  What does that accomplish particularly when there has been so much progress!
It goes to show how far down society has sunk that we need to have a vote on this issue . The second one is born , the doctor makes no judgement of the babies future personality and the type people that person will want to hang with. You are declared a boy are girl .Right then it's decided what bathroom you use. They don't leave the birth certificate blank on sex , waiting for a person to decide what fits their fancy down the road . It doesn't get any simpler than that. If your born a boy or girl , use that bathroom. Anyone who feels they were really born in the wrong body has issues .People with issues do odd things--like wanting to use the wrong bathroom. Letting people decide on a whim , what sex they are on that day--to use whatever bathroom they want is insane .We can't have men going in women's bathrooms with young girls and children in there. Just saying to trust people , who by they're very action have issues , is insane and dangerous . It's pathetic that some defend insanity .
And I'm sure Obama's chain of succession was filled with only people of love, and never did anything wrong. I'm sure I could make a list just like yours showing your hypocrisy, but it's lunchtime.  It's also creepy to read about a woman getting dressed. So what has she done prior and since? Walked around outside in the cold? I did that while shoveling all the global warming from my driveway. I think I accomplished more. And to all the men I saw wearing those stupid hats..pathetic beta-types.
Not that long ago that Catholics had to cover their heads at mass (remember the ridiculous hanky thing?)! Peggy -------------------- not "had to" it was optional no women got scorned, beaten, harassed, shunned for not wearing it  that ridiculous hanky thing - you show that "Anti Catholic hatred has a place in YOUR Canada you have little credibility fighting for tolerance  oh yes the hanky thing is a veil
On the IRAN, NAFTA, OBAMACARE, DYNK, Puerto Rico, NFL, Las Vegas killings and every other Policy Portfolio that dTrump has a finger in it proves to anyone with an IQ over 20 that  without doubt that he is a MORONIC , DEMENTED and DEPRAVED IMBECILE who needs to be removed from the WH by any means possible ASAP before his hourly brain farts further effect climate change and/or kill every single Americans' brain cells and cause more than the incredulous damage he has already generated!   Pity poor 'Mellania and Ivaanka'....likely sex slaves or even worse . dTrump0 could not be trusted to run a children's lemonade stand in the middle of Yellowstone Park's Volcano if there were  any females within afew  hundred miles of it.  WAKE UP AMERICA...you have a sheer, total and utter BULLY-BABY IDIOT for a 'prez'. You elected what amounts to BOZO the Clown......and once upon a time the World thought that the USA had at least  modicum of intelligence? Those days are long gone since Nov 2017.
That is tragic and attributable to  immoral priests who used their positions to take sexual advantage of underage males and occasionally females too. Such people should not be admitted to seminaries, let alone ordained. As long as they are, innocent Catholics get stuck with the bills, be it through their donations or in this case out of just compensation to employees carrying out the work of the Church. Many of the affected employees probably took on their work as a religious calling.  What a rotten way to treat them. Shame on all who bear responsibility.
Shocker. And somehow the GOP keeps pretending they are the party of the little guy and that they really do care about flyover country and getting so many to vote against their own economic interests.    Guess they couldn't stomach seeing a competent woman run things. And had so much unexplained rage about the black guy.
Time for Chenault to go,  he employed this idiot, do the math 10 yrs x 12 mo x 9K,  Million Dollars to drink, drug & batter women.  Loozer ! Un effen believable.
Why shouldn't men expect something in return from women for providing sex to them? I find this article completely ridiculous.
Republicans generally believe that it is ok if you are republican.  So if you are republican, its ok if you grab a women or have sex with a member of the same sex.  (Remember all those cases of males being busted for having sex with other males?)  Just love Republican consistency.  They are so consistent in doing the opposite of what they preach.
Really? You trust a woman who has been caught multiple times lying over Trump?  I'd love to hear what you think about her connection to the Satanic Rituals "Spirit Cooking" that her campaign manager John Podesta is involved in.  Don't take my word for it.  Look up "Spirit Cooking" and "Marina Abramovic".  Pretty sick stuff.   Also I think it is very RACIST of you to hate-monger against immigrants.  Melania is a LEGAL immigrant and citizen of this country.  You should keep your bigotry to yourself fascist!!
Oh yeah, if I don't poop before a run I nearly crap my shorts at about the half mile mark, like clockwork. LOL...   Running will definitely bang it right out of you, but this woman is nuts. She ignored porta potties and other nearby options.
Says the person who believes in an invisible super being (fantasy) and voted for a widely-acknowledged, mentally ill pathological liar (reality).  I see that you conflate fantasy with reality, a common problem with religious people and Trumpnuts.  Both have a tenuous grip on reality and so have difficulty distinguishing between fact and fiction, or "alternative facts" as Kellyanne Conway recently stated to worldwide ridicule.  You have a choice. You can either hide in your fantasy world or put on your big boy- or big girl - panties and deal with reality.
From the column ...   "The government said they also want to add a “gender” chapter to NAFTA that recognizes the importance of women’s participation in the work force and economic growth as well as another chapter to support Indigenous people."  Ha. Ha. Ha.  Ha!  As if them hard-assed (smarter) Yankee traders really give a shit about supporting Canada's poor-hard-done-by indigenous nations. Are there *any* adults running the shop in Ottawa?
"Aspiring starlets and established actresses alike reportedly had run-ins with Weinstein." The didn't have "...RUN-INS..." with Harvey. They were sexually abused and some were raped. Call it what it is! As far as HilLIARy being a supporter and protector of women, just ask those women who were violated by HilLIARy's husband how supportive and protective she was of them. And you need to look into the roaming hands of Joe Biden before you go all moist-eyed about what a wonderful protector of women he claims to be.
Impeached for what? Have you even researched their laws? Clinton wasn't impeached for jizzing on Monica's dress, or grabbing her by the pussy, and then dipping his cigar's in her vagina, before smoking them, no, he was impeached for LYING TO CONGRESS. He told congress that he "did not have sexual relations with that woman", and then it was proven to be a lie, and he was charged, convicted, and impeached. Where was his DECENCY and COMMON SENSE?
Actually, that wasn't the issue. There was a difference between partnering with organizations and welcoming individuals--a pretty continual issue in advocacy activities. It's the "politics makes strange bedfellows" issue, sometimes in reverse. The biggest problem lies in the polarization that has occurred surrounding women and women's issues. Some of that has always been the case--women are more interesting to everyone, let's face it, even when it's not a control/freedom issue--and some of it is the result of the politics of the past near fifty years--The Culture Wars. The issue of bodily integrity is really personal to women(!), and having opposing organizations on that issue would likely have made the event contentious in ways that were not originally intended and did not occur. In other words, it was probably the right call to make at this time, although it may not be in the future.    Complexity is involved, which makes statements like yours unhelpful to finding common ground.
My my some thin skinned Amy-ites deleting post.  I dislike all liars and hypocrites. She is really a foolish woman with no interest except promoting herself like many others in politics who will sell their districts, mothers, children and spouses to get elected.
And this is a problem for those of us who are monogamous heterosexual males or females because???  I am reminded of a couple of the early Christian sects who believed that Jesus would return in their lifetimes--you know by 70-100 A.D. at the latest.  Accordingly, they declined to participate in sex because everyone would be in the Kingdom of Heaven so kids were just a distraction.    That Christian sect disappeared.     And here we are a couple thousand years later still waiting for the return.    If the homosexuals are killing themselves with their lifestyle, they won't reproduce and so 'the problem' will just go away!
hipsters, white people with dreadlocks, credit card hippies, and self-entitled self-righteous over privileged idealistic white millenials.   if i were a minority, a woman or gay, these would be the absolute last people i would want taking up my cause, or attempting to represent my interests and/or frustrations.  but alas, i am in fact the problem- a thirty-something white male- the sole cause of every injustice ever perpetrated on anyone or anything since the damn of humankind.  and i've never been so ashamed.
If this woman was black or brown and a Muslim the jury and the courts would impose an immediate, maximum sentence.
There we go...it's about "choice" right?  So, HOW does the woman get intoxicated?  I'm assuming by "choice".  And please, give in to a "demanding" partner?  You know what? Live alone!  And if you're relying on Contraceptives,good luck (I had a sister-in-law who had 5 kids...every ONE of them while on or using a BC!)   You would think that if your main concern is carrying a child to term, which seems to be your only response to getting pregnant, perhaps you should remain celibate.  As far as I know, that's the ONLY way to remain not having to worry about pregnancy.   MY point is, women make an entire STRING of choices before getting pregnant.  And killing another human being because you don't want to go through the bother of dealing with your actions is outrageous.  It is scary that there are so many to whom an innocent human life is absolutely meaningless.   It's not MY job to stop men from having intercourse, don't want to pay, don't play!
Sad to say Ron, but the Donald should be attacked.  Come on Donald show us your tax returns.  You promised.  Ron, why do you still defend a liar?  Hell, he makes GW look honest.    Who cares about Hollywood celebrities?  Hasn't it always been a place of loose sex?  But the Donald is president and should not be grabbing women's privates.
a lady who claims to have balls? is that not the bathroom fuss? no wonder she seems dazed and confused. I gave up correcting her, good luck.
But my grandson would never do such a thing, I was a good grandmother, I didn't know why he was out that late or where he got that gun, he went to school, he must have been framed. Why is it that the boys are more stupid than the girls? Maybe the girls know who and what is going on but again are afraid enough not to say anything. Where do the guys that have nice clothes and even a car and no job get guns and cell phones, they get it the old fashioned way, they earn them, right?
"You all" know that for years, women in villages have been getting pregnant on purpose on the off chance that their pregnancy will have specific issues such that a licensed physician will sign off on the verification that there is a medical necessity for abortion, which is required for medicaid to cover the travel---so that they can go on a brief trip to the exciting metropolis of Anchorage for an unpleasant medical procedure.  Illogical, not a shred of actual evidence (only required by the intelligent, though), ridiculous premise.  Gee, I think I found the missing half of Eastman's brain!
This  dirtbag  looks  like  Obama, not  Trump:  30-year sentence in 'heinous' murder of Union Township woman | NJ ... www.nj.com/.../30-year_sentence_in_heinous_murder_of_union_township_woman.h... Apr 11, 2014 - File photo of Arnell Yearwood, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for 2010 murder of Diane Zaleski in her Union Township home.   Stabbed 44  times  with a  pair  of  scissors.   In  addition  she  was  raped  and  her  face  beaten  to a  pulp.
I was recently watching the other day when he did his letter segment. Low and behold there's one from Richard Rhyner, Anchorage Alaska telling him what a great show he had put on in Tacoma Washington. When I saw this story line I just knew you would be all over it defending the guy. Nothing wrong with that, everyone has their, shall I say hero's. But I have to say O'Reilly is an arrogant, pompous ass but that's just my opinion. Only reason I tune in is to see who he can bastardize next. Then there's the sexual harassment charges currently going on against him. Let's see what's the count now.....4 women and counting but let's bad mouth his ex wife. The only thing Bill O'Reilly is looking out for is his pocketbook but hey defend the guy all you want after all he's not a perfect human being as you say.
Someone wrote that the same people arguing that these girls should have to more effectively cover their midsections are the same people arguing that it is ok for young girls to have to put on a hijab.  I dunno.   In the first place, the hijab argument does not fit with the ten year old girl. Pre-pubescent girls are not required to cover their hair in most Muslim traditions.  But in the second place, is there really no difference between, on the one hand, seeing a seventeen year old with hair reaching from her forehead to her shoulders, and, on the other hand, seeing a seventeen year old's backside who is wearing thong undies under thin sheer leggings?  I have a sneaking suspicion that, if you did a poll of all Canadian mothers, more would be comfortable with seated middle-aged men admiring their teen daughter's hair than with seated middle-aged men admiring their teen daughter's thong-and-legging veneered backsides.  Does that mean all those moms are just sexist and narrow-minded?
The Taliban thinks women are sex objects, waiting to be grabbed. So does Trump
At what point did the say I was talking about Alberta schools? I'm speaking about the experience in the US where some states banned sex ed and the teenage pregnancy rate soared. This proves that sex ed works even if it's not the 100% success that you were complaining about.   Your second statement is ridiculous. The presence of sex ed is unconnected to the need some women may have for the abortion pill. An unwanted pregnancy can occur for myriad reasons. It seems that you're more interested in slut shaming and have some hang up about sex ed.
Wouldn't it  just be too funny if Oprah Winfrey ran for the Democrats in their next election and became POTUS. Those Trumpsters would sure have their knickers in a twist. A woman and a black woman at that. Lordy, Lordy.
He's a real rapist (Ivana in 1989) and an abuser of women (too many examples to post.)  He is NOT presidential material.  More like Ryker's Island material.
This ugly "woman" ,should go back to selling toilet cleaner, and building stadiums, and stay out of the Co-Eds" bedroom.
Of course these anti trump types never have proof of him calling women pigs. ( besides rosie o, who is one). These drama filled letters are amusing in their desperation. Anybody but billary.
Nonsense.  Your remarks here are both offensive and untrue.    Where have I ever supported the "subordination" of women?  That is truly ludicrous.  And all I have ever said concerning Cardinal Burke?  I have given you exact quotes from him - which YOU proceed to spin and interpret according to your agenda.  That you cannot deal with his exact quotes, but tend to want to summarize them in accord with your agenda is no fault of mine or his.  That's on you.
ISIS drinks, does drugs, rapes many women & hate everyone other than themselves.    Too bad that all they had to do was watch American TV to find out when U.S. was going to pull out of Iraq & leave the vacuum to reach the power they have obtained.
Stuff that women's rights V: children's lives crap
True.  Anyone  that thinks that a boy is simply going to claim that he’s a girl to make the team hasn't thought this thru. This is school where everyone knows everyone. That means that the kid is going to have to live as a girl 24/7. Makeup. Hair. Clothing. No hanging with his male friends. No male sports. Not to mention that he’s just removed himself from the hetero dating pool, pretty much permanently. And that’s not even considering what his former male buds will call him. Gay and fag are among the kinder words. And then we get to the physical bullying - 10% of trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted.
Annie Zak go find the cave you crawled out of and crawl back in it. You are brain dead how immigrants bring 1.9 Billion to our town, wrong jive woman. We pay 1.9 Billion to these jerks that come Alaska look at the crime they bring in, I can not believe what has happened to our State in the past 5 years.
We have a daughter that age.  Of course we don't know any details yet and very possibly alcohol involved, but it grips my heart as I can imagine this girl panicking and choosing the stupid choice.  Never, ever leave the scene of an accident, even if you are impaired, as it will bode worse, and it is beyond horrible for the family of the deceased or injured.  Our prayers go out to all affected and involved. So tragic.
White privilege is absolute nonsense.  I was raised in a lower middle class family with four brothers.  I worked from the age of 9 as a paperboy up until I could get working papers at 14 and continued working through College.  I paid my own way thru College because my parents did not have any money. I was hired as a Police Officer in 1987 and have worked there since.   I was not given any special treatment, in fact the opposite at the time due to minority hiring practices that required women and minorities to be hired in front of white males, even though the entrance scores on the civil service test could be 30 points less.  I did not have an issue with this, but to claim I had white privilege because I am a white male is ridiculous.   white lash is another made up term by the progressive left.    Can you show me some of the "advantages" that I received as a white male?
Do you think the woman (who may have been driving her kids to grandma's house) coming around that corner he was passing in may have been someone's child, too?  I have no sympathy for the sociopathic cretin.
Get a load of this: "A rant from a misogynistic, homophobic racist is allowed on 'Civil' comments." That's just stunning! Fedup808 has labelled Frank_96740 a woman-hater, a gay-hater, and a black-hater, but HER OWN comment has apparently passed muster as a "civil comment". What a hypocrite! Where are the controls?
Isn't that a convenient excuse?  Imply that those who didn't vote for you were too stupid to know better? Then, fall back on a tired liberal lie that it must have been due to underlying misogyny and sexism? I'm sorry, Ms. Clinton. That just isn't true. And, it's horribly sexist and misogynistic to suggest that it is, implying that we white women are so stupid, we need the men in our lives to tell us what to do. As one white woman who has been following you and your husband since the 1992 election, I can say that it's the lies, corruption, class warfare arguments, and lack of a message (or a soul) that soured me on both of you long ago. There's no way I'd vote for you. But, if there was ever a female candidate that I agreed with and I thought could do a great job, with real accomplishments behind her, you better believe I'd vote for her in a heartbeat. But, like millions of others, my vote is not a lock based on gender affiliation. There are other things that matter more.
"Children need a female mother figure 24 hours a day for their entire childhood" oh nonsense.
Twitter gives you potentially bigger networks, but only for the famous few. The rest of us will use Facebook and comment on popular blogs.  We have plenty of Purgatory Mates in the comment section of most NCR stories. We know the concept well.  Trump voters believe what he says, that in states where the popular vote for Clinton was high, fraudulent votes occurred. The reality is that any fraud came from voter intimidation in the five rust belt states Trump surprisingly won.  Church Militant was been reading Fr. Rick Heilman on manliness, as well as using a version of the Trump anti-PC line where not discriminating against women and others is somehow abrogating your rights to free speech. Not sure passing this idiocy on is worth our time. As to Irish Spring, do the manly men at Church Militant even bathe?
White evangelical Christians worship the Pussy Grabber In Chief. Gee, I wonder why so many people are checking the None box these days? We just had eight years of a President who was a loyal husband and wonderful father to two daughters. And he never called either one of his daughters and I quote, "A piece of a**" while talking live on the air with Howard Stern. Unlike Trump who has consistently lied, cheated, and disrespected his daughters and three wives FOREVER! Guess Barack Obama's skin was the wrong color to get any respect from evangelicals. If the lying, adulterous, vulgar, tax cheating, racist, misogynist, bigoted, narcissistic, ignorant, draft dodging, boy-man Trump is the new Christian hero, just what kind of Christianity is being practiced in the US nowadays?
AT:  The "sticks and stones" argument is a weak attempt to excuse verbal attacks on others.  It's much like GBA's favorite "grow some skin".  It's saying it's OK to insult others, to make ad hominem attacks, to make crass, crude remarks.....the recipient should just "tolerate" it. After all,  "sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me".    So, African Americans should tolerate being called N#@%^, women should tolerate being called "C$%%^s", Latinos should tolerate being called "S@#^" or "B$%#", and calling liberals "libtards" is just fine.  Yes, indeed folks, we should all just "man up" and let others insult us all they want.  You don't really mean that, do you?  I'd be interested in your view. thanks, Gary
No, but that's not what we're talking about here is it?  Why?  Because someone can't decide to identify as a different race (yet).  Rachel Dolezal gave that a good try though.    Think about this, colleges granting full ride scholarships to the best "female" athletes.  You would have "transgender boys/men" taking sport scholarships from real girls/women because they're better at them is certain sports.    That'd be no different then a Elizabeth Warren being granted teaching jobs at Ivy League schools by falsely claiming she's Native American when she's not.  You liberals better think these ridiculous new "rules and laws" through before blindly going along with them like the sheep you are.
"I'm automatically attracted to beautiful [women]—I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything."
Cute slogan.  After you try hugging the hate out them, maybe the muslim terrorists will let you choose from nail bomb or van assault for your demise.  They have used both means very recently to kill innocent men, women, and children.
im sure glad you were allowed to waste the assembly members time, standing there looking glaring menacingly at Amy and snarling to the assembly how she should resign for insulting a fellow muslim, lucky for us we don't have sharia law here. im sure you can't wait to stone to death any women who speak up. didn't you have some feral cats to kill?
The Muslim girl you speak of was beaten to death by an illegal immigrant from a Latin American country. He was not "white", and therefore probably doesn't actually fit your narrative.
Dear Saint Miguel, what if the women were, um, lesbians?
Would never vote for ANYONE who supports Trump.  He and Weinstein are two of a kind predators....... Straight out of Trump's Mouth, QUOTING the man who is NOW YOUR PRESIDENT! remember? “I DID try and fuck her.  She was married.  I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there.  And she was married.  Then all of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything.  She’s totally changed her look.  I’ve gotta use some TicTacs, just in case I start kissing her.  You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful—  I just start kissing them.  It’s like a magnet.  Just kiss.  I don’t even wait.  And when you’re a star they let you do it.  You can do anything…  Grab them by the pussy.  You can do anything.”  — The President of the United States of America
I am surprised that only 54% of women reported receiving unwanted sexual advances.  Why?  Because flirtation of various sorts back and forth between women and men happens all the time and is entirely normal and key to our society.  On the other hand, sometimes someone flirts with us or gives us attention we do not want.  Presto, an unwanted sexual advance.  A statistic like this is really nonsense.  If the survey were specific like how many have had their butt grabbed, breasts grabbed, etc., etc., as separate questions then we might learn something meaningful.  If the unwanted sexual advance is simply being asked out on a date, then the situation is utterly hopeless because women and men will always be asking others for dates and sometimes the askee will not be happy about it.  What is different is that feminism has created a generation identity confused.  Sexuality is normal (to a point).  Feminism has taught some women that all male attention to sex is bad.  A losing proposition.
Oh My God! Isn't that "taking the name of God in vain"? Bimbo? "an attractive but empty-headed young woman, especially one perceived as a willing sex object.", a Trumpanzee favorite. Calling a lady a bimbo is the gender equivalent of calling a gentleman a "himbo", a good looking, lame brained, sex object. Comes in orange too.
The entire nation is watching as a complete and utter sociopath/malignant narcissist is disintegrated in a very public manner. Her own family won't stop her, and her own Party is too terrified to cross her. Any real enemies or threats to her ambitions have been quickly and permanently 'dispatched'. If not Satan incarnate, the woman is certainly  evil, even demonic
Funny.  I have heard it said that Salome may have been Mary's sister...which makes more sense than your scenario if Salome was the mother of James and John...considering James and John were close to Jesus in age.  I've not seen any credible or respected source that claims she was his sister.  And I guess the ever-desperate effort to argue Mary was not perpetually virgin goes along with the need to justify the sexual mores of today.   Talk about vincible ignorance!!  *lol*
Wow.   This is probably one of the most (if not the most) asinine,  lefty fascist propaganda pieces I have read in a while.  Göebels would be proud of Seattle Weekly.     There are no white supremacist bands here. I love how it says "it is more common for white supremacist bands to promote their ideas subtly".  Yeah,  that way the leftist fascists can call any band or person a racist or a Nazi, and distort their words into bullshit.   Also,  Death in June is not a Nazi band.  A Jewish,  gay,  immigrant who loves black dick (Milo, of course) is not a fascist.   The adjectives listed above of what he is, is every one of the things that Nazis hate.  And Anti-Sharia March was exactly that --  an anti-Sharia march against honour killings, FGM, and killing of gays.
Reasonable response.. both choices sucked! I didn't sign on for the friggin Obommy care either, screw it! I had friends who saw a jump in insurance costs and they were strapped as it was. If we do end up in a war, which is of course worse case senerio, I can see only one potential for hope no matter who starts it. We might see a revitalized people which ha! nobody wants to see Americans really pissed off, United, under the same purpose. We are the most industrious, hard working and most violent people on the planet. Trust me, my mother is a democrat liberal and you don't want to see that woman pissed off with purpose, No! She doesn't own a gun for a reason lol!!! United we must stand. You write measured comments, makes for a good read, self-control is a virtue weather I agree with you or not.
Aren't you the one who also doesn't believe in jail sentences for anything but murder?    Especially not for sexual offenses against women?
Simple and easy plan... it's worked since the dawn of time. Born a women ... use a woman's bathroom. Born a man... use s men's bathroom.   If you can't figure that out... you're about as dumb as they come.  Peace out!!!
Nobody gives a carp if you find the first ladies attractive. They are not there for your viewing pleasure.  At least not until misogynist MAD MAN tRump came along.
obstructionist?..irrelevant? Is that what a voter becomes? when he criticizes someone who has, at the least, admitted assaulting women? Maybe in your bizzarro world..
You can agree with the initial visions and doubt the garbage and exaggerations Lucia added after the fact - like Mary suggesting women were damned to the hellfire for wearing pants or the awful story of a little 4-year-old girl who was damned to Hell because she didn't share a toy.  It seems like someone was exaggerating and fame-whoring to the far right.
And who really cares? Why is the GM becoming islamized, do they think we would have to wear these ridiculous garments  any time soon???? If its ethnic clothing, I'd rather see saris, kimonos and other garments that are not demeaning to women.
That you found the Access Hollywood funny speaks volumes about YOU.  Sexual assault is a serious, violent and criminal offense that is not to be taken lightly. If "liberals are responsible for promoting promiscuity and the objectification of women in this country" why did they vote for a foul-mouthed, thrice-married sexual predator ? Your hypocrisy is astonishing.
Is this tem necessary for your discussion?  "Schmuck", or "shmuck", in American English is a pejorative term meaning one who is stupid or foolish, or an obnoxious, contemptible or detestable person."  "In The Joys of Yiddish, Leo Rosten wrote: "Never use schmuck lightly, or in the presence of women and children", which was a common view among Jewish people who felt a connection to the language, and who still viewed it as an obscene reference to a penis.
No, absolutely not.  The difference is the reason behind the speech.  We can't yell "Fire!" in a crowded room, unless of course there is a fire.  Part of the problem is that too many people can't express an opinion without going a bit too far.  Don't like a movie, okay, but some have to prove he movie is unlikable and make insulting comments about the actors.  I loved the original Ghostbusters and wonder about the remake.  However, when I see it I may like it.  If I don't, I won't take it personally or feel it necessary to make hate-filled comments.    One of the reasons I think Donald Trump is dangerous is that too many of his supporters feel empowered to apply hate labels to group historically discriminated against: women, blacks, Latinos, Asians, etc., etc., etc.
BUT...in the interest of equal rights and equal responsibility, a Woman serial pedophile rapist should have her clitoris removed. Sorry...but fair is fair.
Up until now, to get a woman who'd provide sex, men had to prove they could be what she wanted: a good provider of income.  Margaret, it's time to tell women:  To get a man who'll be a good provider of income (so you can stay at home when YOU want to and raise children when YOU decide), you'll have to offer men what they want: better sex than women did in the past.  It's a new world, Margaret. You have to get over your hang-ups about sex and "proper" social roles.   Let me show you how traditional "proper" roles can ruin things:  "How We Waded Into The Sexual Harassment Quagmire  -- And How to Dig Out" http://malemattersusa.wordpress.com/2011/12/11/the-sexual-harassment-quagmire/  This may be the most thorough analysis you can find of what I think has for many decades been the sexes' most alienating and destructive behavioral difference.   P.S.:  Many women enjoy porn and enrich their relationships.  They don't have hang-ups.
Sooner or later Feminist writers will need to admit that the men's movement MGTOW is growing every day in every country in the west and women have only themselves to blame. Men are not only turning off marriage but relationships as a whole. 60-70% of men aged between 20-40 in japan do not want a relationship and is cited as the reason why the population will halve by 2050. Unless columns like this mention MGTOW you will have no hope of realising that dream of a white wedding as there are consistent reasons why men list for going MGTOW. Financial rape from family court and DV and child abuse through parent alienation that is endorsed by the community. Hope you idiots have kids to pay for my retirement. Enjoy your cats company ladies, i gone my own way and could not be happier.
Justin Trudeau WILL be defeated in the next Federal election due to his and the Federal Liberal Party's incredible and unbelieveable naivety and incompetence. How did we ever get this incompetent leader? ! Besides Canada's failed electoral system?   Was the major issue giving women the vote? who vote for style over substance? Either way it doesn't matter, He is a self absorbed,  narcissisitic, psychopath who needs to be removed from office immediately! He is completely detached from reality and needs to go! Canada WILL suffer under this creeps leadership!!
I am often astounded by the number of posters who appear to credulously believe this kind of media swill.   But then I remember that most of you are Soros or benighted labour union shills, or in a Womens' Studies faculty somewhere,
The right-wing misogynists on here have proven the writer correct.  There are still many cowardly men in Canada who fear strong women.  Pathetic.
you know chrsty1. You must be really stupid. You begin by saying you know "for a fact the old woman could work circles around" me. Then you continue by telling me that I should NOT "regurgitate" vomit against people I have no knowledge of or about!!!! You stupid moron you wrote exactly the kind of comment you suggested that I not write. You don't know me!!! But you "know for a fact"""""yada yada yada. Moron!!!
Trulander is a hopeless moron, w/ no chance. He was thrown into pwr like a hurricane, by politically uneduc voters & media party, despite having resume of McDonalds employee. He avoids answering any real ?'s, & when he does, he speaks in platitudes & dances around issue, w/out answering the question.   Wut is he supposed 2 stand up 4? I'm not only 1 asking this either. Trump hasn't done damn thing 2 CDA/CDNs or said anything. Trulander has NO PLACE 2 TELL leader of ANOTHER country wut 2 do, if that's wut this is getting at. And nearly 80% of wmn said this BS? LOL! This "poll" of ONLY 1000 ppl out of 36 MILLION is NOT accurate in ANY stretch of the imagination & prob conducted in GTA (50% immig).   But keep propagating #fakenews & skewed/biased results just like US MSM. All it did was DISCREDIT media. I hav over 3000 followers on twitter, a good 2000 r CDN, ALL supp Trump, & a lot r WOMEN. My numbers climb daily. It just tks quick look at soc media 2 c where ppl's ACTUAL views are.
Perhaps you could substitute the word male (or men) in the article for women or blacks, or Muslim.
Just more proof she is a flake and unfit to hold ANY position. She gives women a bad name just like Pelosi. They are setting women back 100 years. It is time for these women to strp down and just go away as neither is relevant and both are making fools of themselves hanging on when no one wants them , and they are incompetent.
Killing babies makes women and families healthy, eh? smh
If one were to take the opinion of the Globe at face value, we should just listen to the feminists and keep all men locked up in cages from birth and exterminate the ones with poor genes that express masculinity.  Because, hey.  Men only invented: Space travel, computers, smart phones, facebook, the internet, the car, electricity, light bulbs, concrete condo towers, electrical transformers, and defended the freedom of the world.  What good are we, we're just a bunch of peices of crap.   Ugh.  I'm tired of reading this feminist crap.
And the ugly reality of CIA black ops being financed with drug money, the equally ugly "coincidence" of a new heroin epidemic and our ongoing involvement in Afghanistan---All hiding with the chickenhawks like the cowards they are; behind young men and women, many of whom actually want to serve our country...It's a shame in which both parties share the blame.  It's time for change.
(cont)  Goldberg is so excited over an opportunity to attack Ms Clinton and, by extension, all liberals, that he ignores the glaring differences between role expectations and life experiences which result in those statistics showing men are more violent than women in our country.  Consequently, he ends up looking foolish and incompetent.   Gary Crum
Sure, in the uncivilized world, AIDS is widespread among men and women.  So how do you account for the disparity between men who have sex with men and heterosexuals in the civilized western world?
I don't think the democrats want to win.  They just want to complain.  If they can't beat the "orange buffoon" then what does that say about the democrats?  I think it says they are double buffoons.  I mean, come on, there is so much to galvanize against Trump, isn't there.  Or maybe not.  Maybe the general public really doesn't like ...   1. illegal immigration 2. social justice warriors 3. offence at anything and everything 4. coddling N. Korea dictators 5. being put down because they go to church 6. being mocked because they lost a blue collar job and want to work and not sit at home waiting for the government to help me. 7. being called sexist because they didn't vote for a woman, when it wasn't the fact that she was a woman, but rather it was because she was a CLINTON!  Yeah, maybe the democrats are just out touch.  But, what do I know.  These are just my opinions.  I guess I could be a G&M columnist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bathrooms with stalls, coed, fine, whatever. Locker rooms, sorry I don't think people with penises should be on the benches around or in shower area with my wife and daughter. And the last poll I saw said something like 65 percent of the population agrees with me. Sorry if that offends the 1 woman in 200,000 with a penis who's affected or whatever the stat is. And I don't care how their groupies feel about it.
Obese is fixable As much as I hate Obama especially the woman one, I liked her way of eating.  The only problem was that she did it so badly.  Even Hitler didn't force a diet on people.  ,  Criminal Record?  Hell you are being sent out to kill.,   Drugs reduce readiness and are difficult to fix.
Without realizing that his audio mic was on, and bragging how he likes to pop tic-tacs in anticipation of charging at a beautiful woman and kissing her because he can't control what's between his legs, Trump is stupid to think that his sexual predator behavior wouldn't produce lawsuits from unsuspecting women.  Guilty by circumstantial evidence (his audio taping) and the fact that there's now at least four women and a 13-year-old girl turned a woman that has a lawsuit against Trump.  Boo hoo, hoo.  Get him Michelle and Hillary.
Again with the hateful, dishonest and cowardly comment, from a real hater!!  You're either a complete moron, Islamist in disguise, as many of these terrorist cowards are-hiding in populated areas, hiding behind women/children, hiding in Mosques, hiding in burkas, etc.  It's radical Muslims gunning down everyone, not Christians, Jews, Hindus, etc, FACT!  And too many, possibly ones like you, are quick to challenge others for being at fault; knowing all to well for you to stand as an honorable man and openly denounce these radical atrocities would "surely"  get your little liberal snowflake butt in a whole world of trouble!!  Stand up and be counted and see who really shoots you in the back!!!   And all you do is rattle off your in-tolerant and dishonest opinion; you have to because, while you may shout down my comments you're not able to refute my statements. Because all you have, is how you lived there, so what!!
The author writes (with the editor's consent):  "It’s mostly speculation at this point as to what Trump will do."  So why not also publish an article entitled "Will Trump be putting black people in chains and repealing women's suffrage"??  This kind of writing is ridiculous.
Yes, but if we say what you say (just talking about a report) we get censored, because it doesn't fit with the multicultural society that PM junior wants us to believe is what we need.  Why can't we say Islam is a misogynistic, gay-hating religion.  Not all Muslims agree with this, but those who do then kill, beat, and rape women and gays.
Yeah, you hypocrite, if the shoes were on the other feet you'd be blabbing the same or worse.  You should be embarrassed for yourself for supporting a presidential candidate that was caught on audio informing Billy Bush how he prefers to sexually assault unsuspecting women, denigrating military veterans like McCain and Corp. Khan who gave his life for this nation, mocking a disabled journalist, and calling various women ugly names, has numerous lawsuits pending, didn't pay income taxes for twenty years or more  but stick it to bump and grind working class.  Did classy President Obama enter the White House will this much baggage?  Noooooo.
I got banned for a couple of days for posting: "Show me an Imam who says homosexuals, women and Atheists are equal to a Muslim man, and I will show you an Imam with a Fatwa on him". Seemed rather apparent and civil to me...
Wow where did GM get this ignoramus of a hack calling athletes louts and saying Rousey is a feminist agent of change to MMA savagery -- she's the most unsportsman-like figure in all of MMA everybody is glad she's gone, she wouln't even shake girls' hand before fights and when women' MMA caught up with the men she got ploughed by everybody.       So you got an ignoramus to write his personal prejudices about a sport a few old people who read GM and have never been interested in anyway.    Look at the sportmanship between MMA fighters you imbecil, hate is rare in MMA unlike boxing, they fight like athletes and then they hug it out and shake hands...but there's no convincing you is there?   YOUR MIND IS ALREADY MADE UP SO YOUR EYES SEE NOTHING.   IDIOT.   unlike many other sports where a couple of wimps play and then act all sore and filled with injured ego when they lose.  Pfff.    Wow.
This is what happens when you treat women as less than human and don't ordain them the same as men.    Nothing says, I hate you, in Christianity, more than watching a parish needlessly close because the women God called to be ordained and lead those parishes are deemed obviously too unworthy and unsacred to be allowed to keep them alive, or even cause them to grow and gain more Christian souls to the fold and to God.    Married priests are not a bad idea, as long as they only come, after women being ordained priests, without any restriction to becoming Bishops, Cardinals and Popes.    Ordaining only married men to priesthood would be an extreme sin against Justice who is God and the Human Dignity of all women, as it would represent outright Gender Segregation in our church, giving all authority and sacred powers to all men over all women.  These suggestions are the problem with our church not the answer.   Sexism is hate in all of its forms and Jesus condemns it in all Gospels.
No,you're totally wrong.Stats prove 20% smoked pot in the last year, that is just smoked-not regular users. About 5-10% of the population are regular smoker,and you wrongfully assume they are all men. Some guys play video games,but its a small percentage compared to the percentages of women that watch TV, spend hours on Facebook/Instagram/etc. So Facebook is better than games? There are more unemployed women than men,and are more unfit and overweight women than men. More women are educated,but they are usually educated in liberal arts crap,or other useless things and are working in stores...whereas guys take practical education.
Let me guess: Your'e an angry feminist with a bone to pick with white men.
Hopefully drivers in all cities soon do the same. At some point Uber will either relent of lose copious amounts of business by pulling out of cities. At some point people have to revolt and ask for decent living wages. It's very clear that Trump isn't interested in the common folk as he tried to advertise. He just signed off more legislation revoking protection for workers, especially women. He's just phony and a hustler who conned millions.
This entire assault ordeal reeks of a spoiled, privileged celebrity accusing a man who did not do this at all of misconduct. The photo shown on the internet of Muellers hand behind Swift proves nothing. She is smiling in the photo. I have no respect for Swift embarking on a mission to ruin this man's job and life. I have a relative who is wrongfully being accused of similar and is in the middle of a court case for something of which he is totally innocent.In the meantime due to media he has lost his job just like this poor man.Innocent until proven guilty? Bull.the USA has become a joke in some aspects of law. It is too damned easy nowadays to have someone convicted of a sexual act of which one is innocent. I think Swift is full of it and I believe the DJ and his girlfriend. Swift needs to back the heck off.If she doesn't want this guy around her anymore fine but she needs to stop ruining him. she needs to work meager jobs like most people of the world and come back to earth.
The woman is completely demonic. The democrat party is too terrified to cross her, because she has ordered the assassinations of dozens who have threatened her ambitions through the years. The woman is not only insane, she is pure evil.
American Nazis kill an innocent woman in Charlottesville, and we're worried about a ball-player sitting during a song?
There's no grouping, clueless!!!  Check out the FACTS, which apparently don't fit your liberal views.  70% out of wedlock birth rate among young black females and to many of the males leaving them alone.  Black on black crime rate up double digits in Chicago in 2017 alone!!  And the lists go on and on.  I'm no where near as ignorant and arrogant as you sound!!!  Just so you know I was born into a military family and was going to the same schools, riding the same buses, walking the same streets, scout troops, sports and eating in the same lunch rooms as blacks, Hispanics and Asians.  And this was in the 50's & 60's, long before you ever saw the first minority.  And guess what clueless??  We  got along, because we "all" were held to the same standards expected of military personal/dependents living on base or in the surrounding areas.  Just a little personal knowledge and experience!!
Jesse Jackson is a politician. Al Sharpton is a minister. Neither one is anywhere near as bigoted as you. And in the Jim Crow South, lynching of black men, often following their genital mutilation, was done thousands of times, with many photographs of whole white families, men women and children, pointing and laughing at the hanging corpse. Real family entertainment, post-Reconstruction and continuing into the 1960's.   (  Allen, James. "Musarium: Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America")   Benjamin Tillman, governor of South Carolina and later a United States Senator:  "We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men, and we never will. We have never believed him to be the equal of the white man, and we will not submit to his gratifying his lust on our wives and daughters without lynching him."    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching
Yeah, Terhune, a deranged psychopath with a gun.  A gun that killed and innocent woman.  If the psychopath had tried killing the woman with his bare hands, the woman's brother would've kicked his butt to the curb, but the loaded gun did the job.
So, when will we see a female Pope? Oh yeah, maybe a million years after there's a female priest, right?  We have enough white-boy misogynists right here and right now.
The tea party doesn't compare to what happend all across the globe  yesterday with the Women's Marches. The tea party was full of white racists.
Yes we have laws in this country that protects women from dirty old men who can't stop themselves from putting their hands on women's privates without consent. We have laws that protect the privacy of medical records and other personal data. Anti-abortion laws are unconstitutional and are a wet dream of far right extremist pervs.
Boy these women are all now piling on.  Where were they before this all became public.  They all knew what a scumbag Weinstein was but elected to say nothing. Now it is easy to speak out when they have nothing to lose. Typical Hollywood hypocrites.
Yes the language is unclear, but the message is very clear - the Vatican hierarchs do not want gay men in the priesthood period.   This is the proverbial nail in the coffin on vocations for an organization that does not ordain women or generally allow married men.    When I walked out the door of the Roman Catholic Church, I have never looked back.    I love many Catholics, but the Roman Catholic Church is a misogynist and homophobic institution that has oppressed different groups for centuries.   It is dying out in the west, and will eventually only exist in developing countries.   Gay Christians  will find a home in the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and the United Church of Christ where they are generally welcomed in the ministry.
I'm afraid I'd rather take someone I don't care for over a complete, blabbering, racist moron. I know white men don't have very much to lose, but if you have any women or people of color in your small worlds- please reconsider burning ours down, will you? Make America Great Again? You mean back when your granddaddies got to go a-lynchin? Or maybe before your mothers got the vote? Yeah, real great.
Why did these women go willing into a room alone with Cosby? Did they not know black men have big schlongs and practice rough sex with drugs? Were they looking for pay-4-play money action? Quaaludes were very popular during those days and were used as payment for sax just like cocaine, pot, heroin, etc. Why didn't they report their rapes at the time it happened instead of now when everybody is claiming it. Opportunistic lottery ticket? That 15 year old. What was she doing in a Playboy mansion. Wanted to be sexy woman and was willing to take drugs and be a playmate like all the beautiful pin up stars? Is there a thrill about being stoned out paralyzed and being raped by a black man with a humongous flagpole? Something like a sexual fantasy like bondage, whipping, and wearing shiny black vinyl bikinis like in Bangkok? I think Cosby's going to be acquitted.
The bishops have no credibility where family life let alone family planning are concerned. They resent he pew people flagrantly acting according to their consciences rather than kowtowing to the clerics. No businessman is going to increase his insurance costs by eliminating a benefit which actually reduces insurance payouts. Eliminating contraception increases health insurance risk and that increases premiums. Trump is either too stupid or too cynical to admit to this but his benefactors (financial as well as philosophical) like the idea that men can once again control women's options.
Feminists often say the word bigot but when it comes to debate they don't want to hear it? Hypocrites.
No, because Muslims don't let their women out of the home.  They also don't have gender fluidity.  Therefore, the only option is a manhunt.
The Pope is called far worse by regular Catholic bloggers on here for his teachings on women, gender theory, homosexuality and abortion.
It looks more like the lunatic white supremacist billionaires have begun to take the US people on a joy ride to oblivion. Sheep, how in the world can you support Trump? He and his thugs have absolutely no interest in the average American. His choices for cabinet are indicative of that. DeVos will, for example, destroy public education nation wide as she did in Michigan. There are already signs of how poorly educated the average American is and she will nail the coffin shut. Pence will throwback LGBT  and women's rights to the dark ages. I could go on but I think you get my drift.
your book is open to evisceration, just like the bible. both books are the codified legal/moral control of the masses. both are offensive and chalk full of patriarchal dogma. yours instructs open subjugation of women and children.   There is no "learning" in either of those books, only ignorance and domination.
While I condemn violence against women in all its forms, no matter who the perpetrators are, there is a major difference between men who commit violence against women in the west, as compared to violence committed against women in Islam. For one, men who abuse women in the west, do it alone, there is not generally family members involved.  In fact, the evidence shows that a man who is abusive tries to isolate the woman from family & friends in order to hide the abuse & emotional manipulation.  In Islam, as your article has pointed out, family members are complicit in the abuse & murder & have no issues with carrying out the acts, even mothers of the girls.  Women in Islam who report abuse are shunned by their families & communities, are the ones blamed for causing the aggression in the first place. In the west, the taking of a life is murder no matter what the reason & punished accordingly. Islam does not recognize murder of women because it is their fault for "shaming" the family.
Suggest you check with a Muslim scholar.  You're wrong. It's a fashion imposed by insecure, small-minded, misogynic imbeciles, precisely the type males the progressive world, including our Feminist PM, will shun in a heartbeat. They treat women as chattels, ignore their basic human rights, subjugate them and their daughters from morning to night.  They are barbaric in outlook with scant respect for human life.  Their views toward women are abhorrent.
Crap, I'm tired of all these females who come out from under the rock to make allegations that can't actually be supported.  NOW, you speak up.  I hate women like this, just users.
You mean like how they are taught by black thugs, since those black fathers are missing, or how far too many young men and women are indoctrinated in the strict version of Islam and Sharia Law. Any thoughts about those people, or are they off limits because of color or religion.  They are according to dishonest, PC & cowardly liberals!!
So if a man leaves he's a loser and if she leaves him...he's a loser. I wonder how eager all those women would be to leave their men if their husbands got custody 12 times to 1 in a skewed family court system. I wonder how eager they would be to end those relationships if they were saddled with the mortgage on the home they could never set foot in again or were stuck paying support to their "independent" ex. Can't help notice that modern women enjoy pretending to be tall while standing on the state's shoulders.
Does this woman really believe we are so dumb not to see she is trying to put in our pocket money she took from our other pocket? While making some (money) disappear in the process?  I hope voters see this for what it is: a desperate, neck-deep-in polls, act to recover before elections.  She does not care about you.
I love all these men in the comments that are telling women how they should feel about working with someone that has bragged about getting away with sexual assault. Trump stated he could grab them by the p***y.   Would you let your daughter go to work for someone that said that? Would you force your wife/mother to do so?   This comment section for the most part is just a bunch of Mansplaining.
Call me and many that thinks how I tink, Islamophobists. But the radical Islamist/Muslims are Real, deny it if you must but it's Real in my mind, they are spreading Terror and now Islamophobists are fighting back. Allahu Akbar! Yikes!  Americans are sleeping while Islam/Muslim brings with them Sharia. Those that create Religious Wars in the MidEast are planting Sharia's seeds with the flow of migrant Refugees into America. You know the Hate these people have and hold within that's taught to their offsprings. The Mosque's don't fool me, they have a hidden Agenda, the Spread of Sharia. Women's Rights Groups and the Snow Flakes jaws will Drop!  Jesus, couldn't teach them 2000+ years ago, What makes Americans or for that matter any Christian denomination tink they can change Islam/Muslim's Religion followers to assimilate into the Western World? A Religion that needs to be updated, times changed the World never ceases to Spin the game
This is the stupidest policy I have heard about in the last year - and there have been some real winners!  I wonder what it will be like for tranny women wrestling in men;s wrestling.  Upon a loss will she/he/it cry rape or sexual assault?  This reminds me of the old USSR "women" in the olympics with beards longer than their testicles.  How is it fair for a girls basketball team to play 5 boys who say they are women?
Richard, your silly story word salad of male bathroom users in this nation now all of a sudden invading female bathrooms dressed as females is ridiculous. Transgender people have been around since the dawn of man. In many old cultures they are revered and share the family duties when I comes to child care, housekeeping and cooking. So transgender people have decided that they, according to the God Squad, are a new breed of humans who just recently are invading the restrooms of America seeking sexual pleasure. Who gets attacked more for sex, women by men or women getting attacked by men dressed as women? . A recent study in America that I read this week states that women are more at high risk of getting sexually assaulted, physically assaulted or murdered by their male spouses or boyfriends.  The article came with a photo of a dead woman lying under a white sheet in a parking having been recently shot and killed by her husband. No doubt similar to the ones we see daily.
Stupid is as stupid does. This women has all the stupid that a person needs for a lifetime.
Unsurprising how DFL is adverse to science and progressive principles. Unsurprising how they are hypocritically willing to subvert justice and fairness in order to achieve their goals. Unsurprising, because Christians have, throughout history, always been antiscience, always anti-progression, always been hypocritical, and always been willing to do despicable things to protect the status quo. They have always been on the wring side of history.  As an atheist, I'm tired of this. I'm supposed to leave them to their superstitions, but they think its fine to dictate to everyone about who we date,  whether we can have premarital sex, what a woman must do with her body, what substances we can ingest, what day of the week we can buy alcohol, etc, etc, etc (etc for days...I could go for days). If Christians think I'm being unfair, then they need to take an active stand against the interference of their faith in the lives of those who don't subscribe to their belief system. Enough!
Yep and I have a bond on Nkandla and I have no knowledge of alterations to the homestead or have sexual relations with that woman!!!
since his self confirmed avocation of "grabbing women's vaginas"  clearly reflects a very, very sick individual unfit for any public office ~
Excuse me, Extremely Stupid and Uneducated Person, not of Ametican Origin, but frm a foreign country who knows nothing of the US Constitution:  US LAW states: a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.  So , all Americans are of the militia.
So, we will have overt, systemic discrimination introduced by the federal government against white males, favouritism for females of any colour, and no new money.    All the researchers who blindly welcomed this government in are waking up to the ugly hangover that they were duped.  Mr. Trudeau pledged an innovation budget but provided zero new dollars for the universities that produce innovation.  Now Duncan cherrypicks the most questionable aspects of the Naylor report as her targets.    Canada will far farther and father behind its global competitors.  Mr. Trudeau's election will become a day all scientists will rue.
So, the Donald saw a twofer - a business opportunity with pretty young women attached, and a pair of suckers to take to the cleaners.  Trump pulled it off - taking candy from a baby.  So, let's blame the feckless, ill-starred entrepreneurs, right?  The clay pots drifting downstream alongside the cast-iron Dutch oven, who is looking for a little additional flotation, right? Get close, and the clay pots are broken.  That is what happened.  This was minor entertainment for The Donald, New York City's biggest trash-sifter.  Who cares about the Little People, right?  If you vote for Trump, you're either a loser, or a Big Shot Player.  Which are you, folks?
I can see it now, she will be bashing UH football and all the while talking about the women's volleyball team. What a baboose!!!
True, they are not interested in women having orgasms. One of the flaws of celibacy and clerical continence. They assume what real do to women is selfish. It is surely not. Luckily for the Church, not all priests are emotionally and sexually stunted, so there is hope.
Bill Clinton warned Hillary not to write the book as is and not to go on a book tour. She has revealed herself to be a bitter, old woman who cannot and does not take responsibility for her election loss. People who did not vote for her did so because she is a corrupt, dishonest liar.
Your sources are garbage. A years-long investigation by the Jusice Department under GW Bush found nearly zero voter fraud.  If you stick your head in trash too much, the trash sticks to your head. Your sources are trash. How about the space alien who married an Iowa woman and they had a flying baby? That's your sources.
They attack trump's wife, and this okay. Just ask Parker. But when Cruz wife is attacked, golly Trump is out of control and hates women. Kathleen Parker is habitually a shameless hypocrite. And for the record; Billary is known internationally as a shameless POS, who has defended her husbands preying on women all the way back to the governors office, and has far more "bimbo eruptions" than Bill Cosby. She is also known as a shameless politician who has gotten rich through influence peddling, and flaunting the law.
- A volatile ignoramus with little impulse-control....OR a fundamentalist theocrat with a belief in TrickleDown economics + an OldTestament view of women.  Either way, yikes....  - However, Roy A. (and Lynn W.), VP Pence sure seems more dangerous re progressive concerns, b/c HE has executive/legislative experience and, more importantly, reliable self-restraint. IMHO, the serious theocrat will do far more for his fellow rightwingers' agenda than the embarrassing + unstable Mr.T will.  -. As for trusting temperamental Mr.T with nukes or any major weapons, for the first time in my over-30 years of voting, I hope some conscientious national-security officials (not his political appointees) AND the few officers authorized to carry the launch codes are secular patriots who have already devised a few Plan-C options, just in case they need to deal with any unlawful orders from, say, a 'Commander' appearing delusional (or oddly obsessed with seeking praise from a shrewd former KGB leader).   -
Trump: I kiss and grab women by the pussy and I can get away with it because I'm a star. Women: That's exactly what he did to me. Eagleclaw: I say Hillary said the N word and that's EXACTLY the same as accusing Trump of kissing and grabbing women by the pussy!  OK dude. Take some meds. Go lie down.
Methinks your "lying cheating thief" is the mythical person the Republicans have been carefully constructing for years, if not decades. I cannot imagine a candidate for elected office who has been more examined than Hillary Clinton, and yet no charges have been laid.  It may be more honest were you to say, "... a loudmouthed obnoxious buffoon or a woman." That, I believe, is the real issue. The U.S. is less ready than they think they are to elect a woman.
Some women are the worst!
Well the bar is set pretty low for Mr. Game Show Host president, isn't it. As long as he doesn't call a whole nation of people "rapists," or brag about grabbing women by the "p******y," or make fun of a handicapped person, or criticize a fellow GOP candidate for her looks,  most people would think he did a good job.  On the other hand, he should be able to deliver a good speech, as Hair Fuhrer has told us in the past: "I know words. I have the best words."
You highlight that this is one of the most egregious things ever done in Canada and when we found out yesterday they took in ZERO Yazidi's, the women whose bothers, husbands sons and fathers were murdered and them they themselves turned into sex slaves IT IS AN ABOMINATION what Trudeau is doing. He is a villain, a straight up villain now.
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL  Found the pro-birther! Pro-guns, pro-death penalty, but make the old geezers suffer at the ends of their lives and make sure women are punished for having sex!
The hypocrisy of the Christian 'right' is front and center in this election. They support a serial adulterer, misogynist, racist, xenophobe, and nativist who will divide our country more than at any time since the Civil War all in the name of 'pro-life'. Yet he stated he wants Roe vs Wade overturned to hand the issue back to the states. That will not end abortion since at least 26 states will permit abortion in any and most circumstances. We need to come together as a people and address the causes for abortion since this is a symptom not the disease. Only through a paradigm shift in our culture which recognizes that women have full agency as citizens can we address their needs so they can choose life.
By the statistics the author provides, women are drastically OVER represented at the Oscars relative to their actual contributions to this year's films.  The overall point being made is (kind of) valid, though, as everyone should be given an equal chance based purely on their merit.  But that fault isn't the Oscars; and the hashtag, as stupid as hashtags in general are, is completely off the mark.
A shameful disgrace. Walker, who campaigned on a promise not to touch the dividend, unilaterally taxes every man, woman, and child in the state $1000. And what does the Alaska Senate do? Not a damn thing. THESE PEOPLE NEED TO GO. Vote them out when re-election time comes.
It seems like some people want to abolish all the well established procedural safe guatds built into the criminal justice system designed to protect the accused from wrongful conviction soley for the crime of sexual assault. The way the law is headed an angry woman can ruin an innocent man's reputation, destroy him financially, and take away his freedom for a very long time simply by making a a baseless sexual assault allegation. I question if in this day age it is worth the risk for a man to have intimate relations with the opposite sex. If i had a son I would advise him to avoid relationships and  to focus on improving himself intellectually, spiritually, financially and physically. If he had sexual  urges I would advise him to look at porn and get it out of his system and then get back to self improvement.
How dare you, Sarah. To try to equate feeling underpaid or under appreciated to sexual assault is unconscionable. As a working woman and a sexual assault survivor, do not dare to speak for me. What in the name of God made you think that comparison would be acceptable? I am deeply offended.
Total baloney. She just wants to jump on the political(feminist) bandwagon to show a bit of solidarity with other women. If she was any kind of stand-up woman she would have brought the matter up when she was sitting, not from the safety of the general public.
I'm such a nasty woman!
Wow really? Just having a Native Child doesn't give a woman access to health care. The children do because it is based off blood, people stay broke to get on health care that is a lot worse. A lot of the royalties are only for shareholders and many corporations haven't been allowing shareholders for many years. Your statement is truly bigoted and ignorant. This type of behavior is what adds to racism in our state.
Define hypocrisy....women who make a living by showing their legs while simultaneously claiming to be feminists.
Yet in court, justice was served so what is your problem other than displaying your women hating bigotry.
Afghans may not have attacked Canada but they sure attacked women  and girls burning down schools and denying them an education and basic human rights.  .  You are right,  Muslims are the victims , the ones that are female.  Is that the"entirely different light" you support?
Eric Holder the blatant hypocrite.  You displayed your racial bias when your DoJ failed to indict New Black Panther leader King Samir Shabazz for appearing at a polling booth in Philadelphia, dressed in military garb, with his 'associates'.  This is the same individual that has advocated the killing of white people, including women and babies.   You allowed him to patrol a voting booth. ' Now, you are concerned about racial insensitivity.   Pathetic political hypocrite.   And of course this is just one example of many many more.
Why is the maximum 12 yrs? I often wonder why a drunk driver gets a lesser sentence than say someone with a knife or gun. The thing that impaired her wasn't forced into her system. As a person who is against the death penalty, this woman should be locked up for the rest of her natural born life. No mercy, no forgiveness, just the sound of the cell door clanking closed.
So thats all that matters? That she is a woman? You are a sexual racist.
It's misogynistic because they don't see men and women as equal. Obviously feminists can't be good mothers or wives.
No listen, he said it to a woman. If he had said it to a man I might (likely not unless they were personal friends) agree with editorial, but he went after a 'weaker-than'. He is a blight on all of us. A coward who would not say it to a man but figured he had an opportunity to let fly with a weaker female. He is pathetic and absolutely should not be in authority anywhere. As a man I say this.
And mean while, back at the ranch, this "president" stinks that violence against women is funny. One would like to believe that after he got caught on tape Billy Bush style, bragging about his sexual assaults, that he may have decided to believe it would be smart to not look like a total loser anymore. So what's it gonna take folks? What is going to be his next misogynist move? Does he have to personally insult each and every one of his mother's supporters?
Not a peep! Those Antifa were throwing feces and urine at people, Liberal Journalists were attacked.  That is a Bio-Terrorists attack.  Remember when Antifa blocked an ambulance that needed to be re-routed and this delay caused a death.  No word from G&M.  Or the brutal death of a white couple, in Kentucky, raped, hacked, burnt, bleached or the white man who was pulled out of his car and beat by BLM.  These Leftists are the same group who will gladly destroy private property, kill Police officers in a cowardly fashion and pepper spray girls point black.  They are the true bigots and by far the most dangerous.  Lawlessness, Godless and full of hate.  Odd that Obama didn't get this kind of treatment when Lakeisha Holloway drove over people in Las Vegas because she was "frustrated" and killed a young woman in 2015; or when Abdul Razak Ali Artan drove over people and then got out to stab some at Ohio State last November but then again Barry couldn't be bothered to attend NO after the flood
Monte,  These verses precede the Lev 24 text quoted above:  "And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp; And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the LORD, and cursed."  The LORD told Moses to have those that heard him curse lay their hands upon him and then the accusers were to stone him.     Was this influencing your thinking when you opined?  '...aliens should have the same legal rights as citizens.'
Masculinity is now toxic ? Wtf did I just read ? This piece is absolute garbage! So is the message we should all be feminine because somehow feminine qualities are superior? It’s now ok to bash all men in general because of the actions of a few powerful ones ? Sexism as plain as day ! I haven’t read such an arrogant , condescending steaming pile like this fake journalism in a long time . If this were about women and feminine qualities being negative , this waste of space article would never have seen the light of day . So ignorant .
Regarding :" gay culture" - This old phrase, 'particular friendships', might best explain what the old men in the Holy See want to address. - That is, secular clerics, as well as consecrated men and women, must avoid an, albeit natural, human tendency to have friends that are just like themselves.  That is, they do not have an 'open' approach to relationships and thus act in an exclusionary manner. - In houses of consecrated religious, 'particular friendships', raise suspicions, isolated one religious from another and thus are divisive. - More diffused, but just as apparent, secular clerics who have 'particular friends' limit their own ability to be a brother to the brothers and sisters of Christ. - So, this document is best read if 'gay' or 'homosexual' is replaced with human.
Trudeau could start by promising not to elbow women in the boob
This woman is a killer, which goes furthest in explaining her crime.  She became a killer the minute she climbed into the car drunk (yet again) and killed an innocent person.  She deserves more time than she got.    And yes, it is a "deadly piece of metal."  When operated by a purposely impaired person.  I don't need to hire a lawyer.  I work with 700 of them, and have for 25 years.
Speaking of sexy locker room comments, has this author ever been to a La Leche League get together and hear other young females talking about their new nursing sized boobs? It's a new world moment for these female mommas.  HA-HA. VANITY SECRET.  It ain't hard to get favors or "honey-dos" from "daddy" when he sees "mommy" in her new bra size!  All "mommy" has to do is hang her bra on the shower curtain ... or casually take a slightly longer walk wearing no blouse in the master bedroom.  Ya gotta love women.  They're worth the trouble men have to listen to when women "bitch about men's sexual locker room talk".  ALL should please notice ... that the word "bitch" refers BOTH to (1) an unhappy woman and (2) complaining in a nagging manner!  Men, on the "utter-hand" are boars ... and BORES (or not listened to) when they express themselves!  YA GOTTA LOVE WOMEN BITCHING ABOUT MEN!!!  WOW.  Is real life as human animals ... really so one-sided ... about clumsy sexual locker room talk?  REALLY
DV is the most dangerous calls cops can respond too. DV is a vicious cycle, often begins with the abuser breaking the victim down verbally until the victim believes they are nothing. When it gets physical typically the first few times, the abuser is so sorry, so apologetic and promises it will never happen again. But that is only the beginning. I used to think women were stupid for allowing some guy to hit them, and that it would never happen to me. I was humbled. I learned the hard way that it can happen to anyone, and that often but the time the pyhsical abuse happens you feel like you made them get that mad, that you're to blame, you feel ashamed and even though the abuser hurt you, often you don't want the abuser to get in trouble. You stay silent. Recant. Blame your self. Go back. Scared to leave, scared of making it worse. The most dangerous time for women is when they try to leave end a relationship. They often end up dead. Paper doesn't protect people from their abusers.
How would that look, a black woman on the brown bill...
Women do not do anything better than men except get pregnant and give birth.  They don't raise children better or nurture better, we are not better parents.  This is more nonsense designed to justify sexism in our church.  Men don't represent Jesus Christ better, therefore there is no reason to keep women from ordination as priests, bishops, cardinals or popes period.  To insist upon highlighting every flesh difference one group has verses another in hopes of making others see that group as more different and therefore in need of restrictions is  a form of hatred.  Whites have done this to blacks and so has our church done this to blacks.   People do this to justify ethnic disparity of treatment as well.  Any discrimination done against a group of people based on flesh is an attack against that group's human dignity and all Christians must stand against the individual who purports this hatred no matter who they are and critique that person's behavior for the sake of that person's soul.
“I am not responsible for the death of that woman.”  Sounds like rantings of a greedy sociopath.
Regarding Donald Trump's grabbing shenanigans with women, Barack Hussein Obama had this to say.... “The unbelievable rhetoric” from Trump was “disturbing”, Obama said, adding, to laughter: “I don’t need to repeat it: there are children in the room.”  Barack Hussein Obama on Harvey Weinstein's pussy grabbing:  [nothing] .  And Michelle Obama said this... “And I have to tell you that I can’t stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn’t have predicted.”  Michelle Obama on Harvey Weinstein's pussy grabbing:  [nothing]  .  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuUTVtVEnYY
I believe Trudeau has been quite circumspect with respect to any references he has made regarding Trump.   Moreover, your implied critiques of Trudeau for fostering bilateral relationships, working with the UN and making a point of standing up for the LGBTQ community say more about your appetite for intolerance than anything else.   Your partisan bile can't hide the fact that whatever disputes you might have with the Liberal government's policy orientation, or your personal animus towards its leader, the fact is that decent Canadians would be loathe to leave their women folk alone in Trump's company; and, decent Canadian trades and service people would think twice before working for Trump for fear of either being stiffed or subject to discriminatory treatment.  Trump is a vulgarian and an ignoramus. I doubt very much that he is any good at poker.
money money money  the cost of looking after old is to much for the bottom line Were will it stop  our society #$%@ we cant decide if we are a man or women Social marxism and  crony capitalism has merge to give us atheistic dehumanize approach to health care LONG LIVE  COMRADE  DARWIN  get rid of useless eaters ( LOGAN RUN NEXT ?)
What a disgusting horrible woman. To murder your own children in cold blood is beyond comprehension.
You think this is the smartest woman in the world?!? Thats your statement!?! Let me respond by say that Buds medical center is having a two for one special on head injuries through the weekend. You outta take advantage of that deal, cause damn, if its not a head injury you've suffered, then its brain damage.
And made fools of themselves and the Church:  Q. Why censure Hans Kung? A. Because the ordinary catholic is a simple person and it is the role of bishops to protect these simple people (simpletons?) fromthe power of the intellectuals Q. Why did God create women? A. Because Adam (the universal man) experienced a loneliness which the presence of the animals could not satisfy,  so that Adam (the universal man) would not descend into a baneful (?) and sterile "encounter with himself"(?!) Q. Did God really, really speak to Eve?  A. Yes,  Q. Surely, that is metaphor? A. His words were "definitive": (and I quote) "...he shall rule over you") Q. Surely you just mean for catholic women? A. No, arn't you listening to me. The church is "expert in humanity" not just in churchiness,.I applies for all women forever "..in the church and in the world".  Didn't you read the title of my "epistle"? Q. I don't think that a reasonable person can buy all that... A. Then you are a "radical feminist", begone.
...so,  by the way Donna, pussygrabber is the WORST PERSON IN HISTORY TO HOLD THAT POSITION, if you really give a damn about this country, WORK AGAINST HIM, not the DNC...work for the Dems, not against us...if you continue with this crap...do you think any Democrat in this Country is going to support you, your candidates or any other think you want....  ...HELL NO!, WE ARE SICK OF THE INFIGHTING, AND ANY MAN OR WOMAN WHO CONTINUES TO PUSH THIS CRAP IS GOING DOWN....you can meet them all at the bottom!
this story is only a propaganda piece, of utility for the dimocrats disinformation campaign against President Trump. no matter what this woman says, it will be skewed and manipulated by the press to achieve the goal of the dimocrats, anti Trumpers, and establishment fossils. it also gives cover to useless congressmen, when they have to explain to their constituents what they have been doing since the election.
So in the end  because no native man will ever be interviewed or asked what happened,  we are left to believe the native  women were beaten to a bloody pulp  by nobody, raped by nobody,  and murdered by nobody  unless it was by white men or  RCMP officers.
Burn baby burn. SeaTac is Ground Zero for the Democratic Resistance Movement against President Trump. We want anarchy and violence because we lost the election and we cannot come to grips with reality. We are mindless fat white women that wear pink pussy hats. We will burn the whole I-5 corridor until we get free healthcare and free McDonalds. Black Lives Matter. Fat White Women's Live Matter. We are Fat and Proud. Long live Patty Murray, Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters. Gotta go...I just farted and wet my diaper.
The Left hate on Left White Women in race for the Georgian Governor's Race: "One of the main mantras of the chant was #trustblackwomen" http://www.opslens.com/2017/08/14/when-the-left-eats-its-own-white-female-gov-candidate-shouted-down-in-georgia/  I expect no less from your Racist Party! lol  BLM, Barry, Jesse, Al, Fredericka and Holy women Ms. Nadal and Ms. Brazille should be Proud of themselves. The New m.o. of the Democratic Party, anti-Whites! You got duped crafted by the Democratic Racist Tools
i can't even begin to discern whether or not the people posting their ridiculous, justice-hating trash in the comments section are serious or not. given how racist white canada is, ive no doubt its sexism is thriving as well.  regardless, you cannot take seriously anyone who refuses to see the clear patterns of history in which toxic masculinity (whatever you call it, there is in fact a clear historical record of male oppression against women [and non-conforming men] in western societies) is responsible for the ongoing degradation of basic human dignity and rights in the name of dominance and power.   i mean capitalism? really? thats the best that the "most awesome civilization" can come up with? lol  youd have to be blind, insane, in active denial, or a deeply criminal individual to not be able to admit what is a basic empirical fact: men, racist and colonialist white men in particular, are toxic to life on this planet, period.
The woman, or so I'm told she is a female, gets more hideous with each lie.
As sad as it sounds, yes. If a gay/lesbian is "forced" to change/shower in the locker room of their genitals, then people who are uncomfortable showering with the opposite sex will feel comfortable. As long as the trans guy that's gay can control his attraction at least. If he doesn't, it could get ugly!  And Lord help a women that feels like she's a guy showering with a bunch of men.  Rape happens all the time and makes the news frequently.  Are you willing to put people at risk for the feeling of one person in ten?  A little ironic isn't it?  People would feel more comfortable showering with someone attracted to their sex than someone of the opposite sex that isn't interested in them.  But guess what, people feel the way they feel. Respect that as much as you respect those that feel different than you!
Hahahahaha!  Yes, that is so much worse than grabbing pu##%, walking unannounced into teenage girls dressing rooms while they're naked, groping women, defrauding college students out of their hard earned money and so, so much more.  Thanks for the huge belly laugh.
The Globe continues to lose credibility on a daily basis. Southey washes over Berkeley "protesters" violently assaulting students peacefully gathering for a speaker who's opinions they disagree with (including pepper spraying a women being interviewed by media - the videos speak for themselves it was a pathetic display of violent cowardly lawlessness). Lighting buildings on fire and looting businesses is a legitimate because Southey disagrees with Milos views?  At least Southey is consistent in representing the ignorant bias of the hypocrite social justice warrior fringe. Right, there are no issues with political correctness in public discourse, just look at Rotherham or even the recent "event" in Sweden this past Monday.
That's right Jon, lets just further the myth that unhinged liberal feminists like Syringa just want an Alpha male like Hodad to come and rescue them from their dull gender studies programs.  Its so obvious that she is just trying to better his life by helping him with his grammar so that he doesn't commit the heinous act of unintentionally triggering someone with misspelled words.
RR, you keep calling a perfectly decent woman corrupt while ignoring the actual corruption of Trump. What is wrong with you?
Yes, but the right is wrong to do so. the right, and that means mostly the religious right is right that the fetus is human and we are killing it. They are wrong because it is the woman's human still part of her, depending on drawing it's resources from her and needing her for survival. It may even kill the host and it has had no independent experience. It isn't even able to realize the Trump is evil- that is it has no sense of right and wrong, rational and insane or anything else that we expect a human will need to begin that journey leading to being  even a ignorant stupid misinformed member of society. It is the members of society that government is supposed to be for.  It is not the business of government but rather that of medicine to address the woman until those cells in her become a member that can  join upon being born.
This would only apply if they said they were not going to do it for anyone with say a combover or an orange tinted spray tan. That is discrimination, like not baking a cake for any gay person.  What they did is said that they do not wish to dance for that ONE person that has openly stated he likes to grab women by the p***y. This is more akin to a bakery refusing service to a bad customer and not discrimination.  Keep on reaching though.
Woman was merely man's helpmate, a function which pertains to her alone. She is not the image of God but as far as man is concerned, he is by himself the image of God.   --St. Augustine  As regards the individual nature, woman is defective and misbegotten, for the active force in the male seed tends to the production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex; while the production of woman comes from a defect in the active force or from some material indisposition, or even from some external influence.  --St. Aquinas  Another kind [of prophesying] is specific to priests, and is not suitable for women, for it is the role of women to be subservient, not to be dominant. And it is this reason that blessed Paul adduces (in 1 Corinth.14): “Let women be silent in the Church, for they are not permitted to speak, but they must be subject...” .’  --Robert Bellarmine  Go team!
"By investing in women around the world, we've investing in families, we're investing in prosperity, and we're investing in peace," Trump said"   Huh?  And I keep reading in the media that he's a chauvinist, deeply sexist, a misogynist, and an enemy of women everywhere...
"I did not have sex with that woman, Ms Lewinsky". "If you like your health insurance, you can keep your health insurance" "A YouTube video created the Benghazi attack" "The IRS did not suppress political activities in 2012" "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor" "The DNC did not rig their primary election in Hillary's favor" Talk about lies...
The khan family should also be upset with Clinton for supporting the Iraq war. Not hearing much on that front. We continue to maintain air strikes in that region for the Iraqi government we support to even have a chance in battle. If my son died in Iraq I would probably hate any politician that supports invading any country that isn't an immediate threat to ours. Trumps question did have some legitimacy. Some Muslim countries are beginning to treat their women better but we still know the majority of Muslim countries don't give their women the respect they deserve. The delivery of his statement wasn't the best, but the political uproar following turning an extremely sad situation of a young man losing his life into a battle to help get Clinton elected might be worse.
Turns out 45 is rubbing off on Kelly who it now appears lied about the congresswoman- how she got money for some building by just calling up BO; turns out she wasn't even  member of congress when the money for provided for the building.  And this time there's proof in the form of a video.  This is also a man who started off talking about how women, soldiers, etc. are sacred and then turns around and not just attacks a woman but then tells lies about her.  45 must have some sort of lying fairy dust he sprinkles on the people around him.  If Kelly wants to maintain his supposed stellar reputation, I'd suggest he run not walk out of the adult daycare centre.
“So, do you think it would be acceptable for a woman to proposition someone for sex, strip down and lather themselves in soap?”  That sounds disgusting! You're sick!
How can anyone in 2017 support this misogynistic practice, when women are beaten or killed for refusing to wear this  That's real religious Freedom! wear it or they will beat you until you voluntarily wear it!  Some much for being voluntary!
rangerMC, here is just one paragraph from one article in the american thinker.   'Therefore, at the risk of sounding brutal and cruel, here is my message to transgender people, as if I were speaking to my son. I’m sorry to have to be the one to tell you this, but you are not a girl. It pains me to say so, but you are a boy who thinks you are a girl. It’s not your fault, no more so than it is the fault of sufferers of BIID or other uncured disorders. But you have never been /a girl, and will never become one, no matter how extreme is the pretense. Not even surgery will change that fact.' this is one of the 10 main articles. even the blogs are stupid; read blog on 'no such thing as a free lunch'. the writer compares a free lunch program to the mess in venezuela.   articles i read in american thinker seem to be written by evangelical christians,  liberal haters or they are just plain nuts.   http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2017/07
That Republic party horse hockey has as much credibility as "I never had sexual relations with that woman." The Republic party impeached Slick Willy over that. They don't hold their narcissistic bloviator to the same standard.  Sad? Nope - totally hypocritical.
Rose McGowan's Twitter won't stop sexual predators but... If every attractive young woman would wear a Rose McGowan mask it would stop sexual predators dead in their tracks! That butch haircut and worn out face will make any man young or old go limp in a flash!
Mike Johnson 994:  As per Merriam Webster:  strum·pet: (  a female prostitute or a promiscuous woman).
Racism makes equal protection under the law impossible. Most white people have no clue about how much rape, robbery, and murder they benefit from and they really don't want to know. We have never had justice for all in this country. What exactly has this women taught her students. What ever it was, it didn't produce equal rights for all. Of course, white people are the primary beneficiaries white racism. Racial profiling makes equal rights impossible. Most white people like it that way. This even while most cops are killed by white men. Heck, most white people deny they invented the race card founding this nation in the 1st place. They can't handle the truth. It makes them look bad.
There are many women in the courts sucking all the money from their ex-husbands in the same way...
Have you taken a look at the so called incriminating photo? Not one damned piece of evidence is in that photo as Taylor claims, Taylors skirt is not up as she says it was in the photo, Muellers hand  is not on her rear. In fact Swift, Mueller and the third girl are all smiling. If Swift was in an upsetting assault situation why the hell is she smiling in the photo that is supposed to be damning. this case reeks of a spoiled damned celebrity whose Mom snottily  insisted this DJ be fired. 'HE GRABBED NY BARE ASS." Do these words sound like they are coming from a classy woman? It is too easy nowadays to be accused and convicted of a sex crime one did not commit. I  have a relative in similar situation as Mueller and my relative is damned innocent. This jury that heard Swift's case did a poor job and ruled in favor of a celebrity because they were a celebrity without heeding proper evidence.. Sound familiar? How about OJ Simpsons original trial?
Your head must really be in the sand to claim that all religions are the same. It saves you the trouble of actually having to study the religions themselves. You can flatter yourself with your benevolent tolerance (and, of course, look down on all small-minded intolerant haters). To say that the actual teachings of Islam have zero part to play in these terrorist acts is unbelievable. The still stone women to death in Muslim countries. Does the religion itself not inform this and countless other acts of violence and intolerance in any way?
Just another insecure weak white guy, threatened by women and minorities. Yawn. You're a dinosaur, buddy.
If some chap wearing a black and red bandana around his face blocks off my street, I might be tempted to spit in his face and call him a word you've never heard someone call anyone. That's the kind of thing that generates sudden hostility that Seela Sankey seems to be surprised by. Actually, on Monday I did have a woman driving her Lexus SUV with a dog in her lap pull halfway into a street and then suddenly stop when she realized I was driving in the other half. OK, I didn't spit on her, but it wasn't because she was white. It was more an issue of my closed car window. If she could have heard the obscenity I screamed, she might have wanted to go share her victimhood at this rally, but being white she would not have been allowed to speak.
This is about racism..  This woman did not even see her deceased husband in the coffin.  Was not allowed to.  How does she know who if anything was in there.  What's Orange got to hide.   Talk about Weinstein,  this guy is no angel either.   Total loser.  His supporters also,  total losers.
Andrea Stairs is the female Donald Trump. Unqualified, arrogant, horrible hair, and extremely creepy.
Trump may suck but Hillary would have been far worse. The woman made a career out of lying. Saying we would be better off with Hillary because Trump has lied during his campaign is laughable. He was the lesser evil by far.
They're bars. We're not talking blocking the doors of universities to prevent blacks from getting in. Or preventing women from getting a law degree. They can have ladies' nights, men's nights, men with ladies nights, hardhat nights, whatever. I've heard some people complain that the other six nights are already men's nights. Well, waaah. I think men tend to go to bars more than women, so if it's true, there may be a reason for that. It reminds me of when someone filed a discrimination complaint against Hooters because Hooters didn't hire as many male servers as female servers. Um, that's kind of the point of Hooters. Besides, most men in low-cut t-shirts look silly.
The far left and Islam share a lot in common.  Both seek to destroy Western Civilization, both treat women as second class citizen or chattel and both are not fit for modern society.
And where were these Women of Principle the last eight years, as Obama and Clinton bombed women and girls of color into paste all over the Mideast and Africa? Can you point out any anti-war marches of significance in the past eight years during Obama's warmongering, reactionary administration? The answer is a resounding no... you can't. The ignorance, hypocrisy and arrogance of it all is staggering, but it comes down to this: Go, Team.
What about the guy that RAPED a woman downtown on that crud?????? Or people that kill themselves? As far as I am concerned they could shoot the dealers
I cannot agree with you more.  Caitriona is a lovely, enormously knowledgable woman and I miss her lyrical voice when listening to KWAX.  The rude and unkind comments regarding her personal manner of speaking reflect on the ignorance and pettiness of the person who posted them.
The left calls for Trump to be assassinated, to blow up the White House, say that Trump is Hitlerian, a racist, sexist, homophobic, idiotic con man.  Trump says Crazy Bernie, Crooked Hillary, Low IQ Mika, Psycho Joe, Low energy Jeb, Elizabeth Pocohantas, Lyin Ted. He insults and they insult. There is no indication in the above insults that he treats women any differently.
Trudeau speaks out of both sides of his face. In one breath he's telling Trump he's ready to get down to business and that he'll work with him. And the next he's tweeting how proud he is of Canadian women opposing President Trump. He's nothing but a  liar​ and a hypocrite.
I never said that women priests meant there should be no married priests.  The order in which this takes place represents a concern for the human dignity of all women.  If our church ordains married men then WE THE People are claiming that we believe women are less sacred, less important & less human than men & not deserving of equal spiritual rites & sacraments or any voice at all.    Right now we have a small portion of celibate men ruling over all other men and women.  Deacons are a joke who have no authority.  Men were served no injustice - it is not injustice to demand celibacy.    We must ordain women first or at the same time as married people or we create an abuse against the dignity of all women that is so severe as we have never committed its like in our entire church history.    This is a test of what we-laity will allow, as far as, the abuse of women in our church, if Francis puts it thru.  We must demand these men stand up against sexism 1st to show worth for priesthood.
LW3: I'll be you get yourself in a lather women someone calls you "ma'am", believing (incorrectly) that it it refers to a "madam" who ran/runs a house of ill repute. Educate yourself, your silly feminist harpy.
well, its big oil and the dirty bastards club buying the ladies and booze now...
The rise in anti-islamic sentiment is a reflection of the rise of radical islam within the Islamic community.   People see that dozens of young Canadian muslims are going to Syria to join ISIS.   They see massive "no go zones" in European countries and a rise of home grown attacks there.   Then you have the audacity to call the resulting backlash again Islam immigration a phobia?          The best way for Canadian Muslims to combat Islamophobia is to moderate Islam in Canada and drive out hate filled Imans, and change some of the  anti-Woman/ sit at the back mosques that Premier Wynne likes to go to.  To paraphrase the Liberal Dutch PM Rutte, "Act normal".    Most muslims are moderate and fantastic Canadians.  It is time for them to take out the trash and fix up their own communities.
Men shouldn't be allowed to write about women's sexual assault. They almost never have the first idea what they're talking about. As here.
This is a sad legacy of the feminism of the '70s. American white women have made themselves so unpleasant that  men look elsewhere. Mail order brides, for example. I've got a catalogue of Russian beauties right here. They're beautiful and they're not cranky.
Get prepared Canada, we have had enough of your sanctuary attitude toward immigrants and illegals. You print any BS about Trump, but nary a word about an immigrant who stabs two women and sexually assaults a two year old child. Tells us globe you and staff are perverts and would like this crap. we will clean up here and come to clean up Canadian perverts. You have no one to stop us. Your own great military man russel Williams is a pervert. That means it's easy to clean you out and take over.
Really? Having a penis automatically makes you a man? Nope. Just as planting a seed in a woman's womb and producing a baby doesn't automatically you a father, simply having a penis doesn't automatically make you a man: Both designations have to be earned, something you'd know if you were a real man.
The fat lady whose name I can't remember.
"Although it is not true that all conservatives are stupid people, it is true that most stupid people are conservative."    John Stuart Mill  You should also read Mill's "Harm Theory" in conjunction with your Liberty reference.   He also was one of the first to advocate the advancement of women as equals that found no ground among conservatives.
Eighty-year-old women spontaneously die every day. Therefore, if you strangle your grandmother, the use of the term "murder" for your act is "precluded."
Pathetic.  If this is true, Putin only exposed how much a lying sleeze  that the Clintons actually are.  If you wouldn't have written those emails, there wouldn't have been anything to find.  If you don't sleep with your neighbors wife, there is nothing for the PI to find.  Face it Dems, you lost, you had an inferior pathetic woman running.
Personally I think the late Mr. Cohen will appreciate the sardonic irony of staring down on the crowds of over entitled brats mindlessly hollering woo hoo as they pile out of rented limos etc.  Oh the women tear their blouses off and the men they dance on the polka-dots It's CLOSING TIME And it's partner found, it's partner lost and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops It's CLOSING TIME I swear it happened just like this: a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss It's CLOSING TIME The Gates of Love they budged an inch I can't say much has happened since But CLOSING TIME I loved you when our love was blessed I love you now there's nothing left But CLOSING TIME I miss you since the place got wrecked By the winds of change and the weeds of sex.
Well, this white woman did not want a rude, alcoholic, violent, thief in charge of the nation I love.  I am also someone who has followed her career closely for thirty years and I was not interested in supporting a corrupt lying dirtbag who is likely into witchcraft, pedophilia, and child trafficking.  The idea of this disgusting immoral pathetic excuse for a human being standing up as a role model for girls just twists my guts into a knot.  Would someone please lock her away for one of the many crimes she is known to have committed?  Jenny Hatch www.JennyHatch.com
"Parental Rights" is just extremist Christian code for their version of Sharia Law.   In Jim Minnery's perfect world, all women and girls would essentially be slaves of their fanatical fathers, just like in all extremist patriarchal religions.
Join with us the week of June 17th to celebrate these hard-working women and men for Global Garbage Man Day! www.garbagemanday.org #GarbageManDay
Incorrect generalizations don't mean you have a point. Just say you don't like her, or because she's a woman or a liberal. When I say " Donald Trump is a liar, racist, bigot, cheater in so many ways, misogynist, thin skinned, draft dodger who is embarrassing to himself and America, and doesn't have a real policies in regards to anything other than making ignorant and grandiose statements about building a wall on the U.S./Mexico border and he has little hands." I can back up each of those statements. You can't and Fox News and Breitbart don't count as credible sources.
Sometimes it amazes me to see so many commenters who appear to believe the most ridiculous things about Trump (as here).  But then I remember that many of you are shills for Soros or the sadly confused labour movement, or are in Women's Studies faculties somewhere.
It is one thing to be critical of one's policies and wholly another to be critical of their gender, sexual orientation, race, etc.  Nothing in Paul's comment spoke to the Mayor's policies.  Personally denigrating someone's gender is uncalled for and fucking rude as hell.  If he wouldn't talk to his wife or daughter that way, why the hell would he talk to any other woman that way?
Now, here's a few problems with what you wrote. You assume men have higher sex drives. They don't nor ever had, otherwise the pill wouldn't have made a difference, if men wanted it more and that's what gave women power over men then they'd still have that power. Somehow they don't. And yet it seems sex wasn't the power they held, weirdly enough we hear a lot about past "shotgun weddings", let me tell you something poor women worked, dad was liable to fund them until they married and yet there was were shotgun weddings concentrated. And yet a lot of wedlock kids happened with kids who still saw their daddies and were directly supported by them but mom wanted nothing with dad. So it seems women were still fucking for the reason they always fucked, fucking itself. Women lined up the docks for the same reasons girls line up the sports block, to see hot men who are there to work not please them sexually.
You think grabbing women by the genitals isn't a moral issue, loser?
This Women's March, AND the crazies who are going to be disruptive at tomorrow's Inauguration of Donald J. Trump reminds me of Gov. Reagan. He was confronted by some hippie who said "We are the future", to which Reagan responded - "I better sell my bonds."
The discussion appeared to be about how he is perceived, not how he sees himself.  African-Americans perceived him as one of their own, and voted accordingly.  When they were faced with the same programs from an older white woman, they bailed.  There was a letter from prominent religious leaders in the African-American religious community pointing out to her that much of the program of her party was diametrically opposed to the core religious beliefs of their churches.  She did not even bother to acknowledge it.  The inability of the losing side to face squarely the reasons for their loss, not just at the national level but across the country, and insistence as this article demonstrates on attributing it to the stupidity and dark desires of "deplorables" seems to indicate that its run has ended unless the Republicans - as has been their custom - completely blow it.
Canadians are about to lose their Right to Free Speech as parliament gets set to vote for,  Liberal MP Iqra Khalid’s M-103 bill!  This bill will criminalize all criticism of islam and sharia law and force Canadians to accept sharia law limits on everything!  Criticize islam for killing homosexuals?                  Sorry that is now hate speech! Criticize islam for female genital mutilation?        Sorry that is now hate speech! Criticize islam for allowing men to beat women? Sorry that is now hate speech! Criticize islam for honor killings?                             Sorry that is now hate speech!  Want to maintain your Freedom of Speech Rights, then contact your local MP and tell them they are totally wrong forcing sharia law on Canadians!
I come from a family in which every woman was an RN, and my Grandfather was the Chief of Surgery at the Royal Victoria Hospital, in Montreal, and a Holmes Gold Medallist, and I will tell you this much. I despise what the Canadian Medical System has become. We pay GP's over 160,000.00 CAD a year, and in many instances a lot more, to write prescriptions and order tests that have no value. They have no ability beyond their capacity to memorize. They have no diagnostic capacity, no intuition; they are arrogant and often so wrong that they harm their patients, sometimes seriously. My friends daughter was blinded by a hospital GP who refused to heed the warnings about a dangerous drug that he was treating with. I am going to vote Conservative for the first time in my life, in the next Ontario election, and I am going to make it my mission in life, to utterly destroy the comfortable little setup they have made for themselves. I would rather die than be treated by a Canadian doctor.
Yes, but even on a less traumatic level than Stockholm Syndrome, women typically do not identify with gender as a class, they identify or assimilate with the immediate men in their life.  Behind every angry white man who voted for Trump  there was an angry white woman who also voted for him. They found it easy to dismiss his bragging about sexual predatory behavior as mere "locker room banter" - just like Trump's own wife stated on TV, because it's important for their psychological survival to keep their solidarity with  these key partners in their life. It's interesting to note that when women have lived among other groups of women, and shared their common experiences, and identity (such as our LCWR nuns) they began to identify by gender as women, and this led them to see the root of their oppression more clearly and to question the truth and their loyalties.
Women can drink as much as they want to. Hell, honey, go for it. Maybe she shouldn't drive, maybe she should have a designated care-taker? Alcohol to excess and sex just causes trouble. I wouldn't want to get raped, I wouldn't want to come to not knowing how I got where I was, but he's NOT my boyfriend and I... I... don't want to be here....holy hell!!!! Nooooo!!!
I'm curious as to why Melania launched her legal action so much quicker than her husband, who threatened (promised) to sue the women who accused him of sexual assault...  As for the justice's characterization of there being no more worse slander than calling a woman a prostitute, I would suggest that wrongfully calling a woman a vile  racist would be considerably worse. Murderer. Child rapist... all things that are much worse than an activity which, while often illegal, has been around for as long as men having been trading rocks. Or real estate.
This week, our Pope, in a homily stated that gay men are not fit to be priests basically because they are feminine, he made jokes about how an old cleric was making fun of a new priest because he was examining his look in his fancy clerical garb just like a woman would.    Gender segregation is a split by gender.  Most men are married in our church, so they too have no authority.  Optional celibacy will open a flood gate to married men-which is why this priest, in the article, described that thousands of married men will jump right in, the moment the pope gives the ok -thousands in Brazil alone.  So all those women who have been leading parishes as lay ministers are gone & replaced, even if they are made deacons they have no authority.  Celibacy causes no one harm so it is not wrong & no one has to be a priest.  I have no problem with optional celibacy if we are ordaining married women too but it should not be at the cost of women.  Black men have a voice in our church.  Women do not.
Q: Do facts matter?  A: Let’s find out  Fact: Obumpkin spent time, effort and taxpayer money trying to interfere/block Bibi Netenyahu’s re-election and no big deal was made of that.  Fact: Considering she has been described as the ‘smartest woman in the world’, Felony-Shrillary made another of her characteristically bad judgment calls when she brought the arrogant, stupid, know it all, John Podesta on to her team and trusted him with all sorts of access.  Fact: The DNC was arrogant and stupid not to buy the best cyber protection it could for its very sensitive files.  Fact: Both DNC and Podesta were reckless in making their materials available to any hostile foreign intelligence service that made the effort.  Fact: Whether it was Guccifer 2.0 or Russia’s GRU that passed the hacked emails to Julian Assange, no one has disputed what Podesta did in fact write.  //  more to follow //
Oh look, It's "look-at-me" Dave, trying to gain favor by self deprecating...  But he doesn't want the resulting reaction just for his own deprecation, no, no Dave wants the recognition that he can deprecate a whole gender, nothing less than half the population...Dave knows about better than we'all.  Dave, you sound like such a loser..!  Only a loser has to do what you do for attention.  Please, show all women how "lovely" you are, marry one of them and go off to family court in your virtuous delusions of yourself and your divine deprecation.  What a loser.
What is up with SEXIST comment!? How dare you say something against a female Secretary of the Interior.  Obviously you are misogynist who hates women and wants to see them raped and beaten in the streets.  I am going to report you for HATE SPEECH!
A Commander in Chief who openly admits to grabbing women by the genitals still a-okay, though, amirite??
That guy did something criminal. Congratulations--you have found a refugee who did something criminal towards women.  Never happens in Canada, ever, right?    I trust you are are very, very active, StillGotIt, in raising money for women's shelters, outreach programs to get abused sex workers off the street, programs to rehabilitate domestic abusers, and pushing for changes to the criminal justice system to see sexual assault charges stick against men more often. Such is your concern for women, right? If you want to save them from the dangers of Syrian refugees? I'll assume you're active on all those fronts.   What did you expect people to do here, read your remark then extrapolate from that criminal incident involving Soleiman and support denying all immigrants and refugees entry? Some of us took Fearmongering 101 and won't fall for it. You'll get far with Leitch supporters though.
Why was it the right thing to do?  Can you be specific?  I doubt it.  This is just more republican bull.  Republicans do not offfer anything but be afraid, be very afraiid as those nasty Muslims are coming to rape your women.  Pretty pathetic.
"Hatred is at the root of much of the world’s horrors"  Muslims and liberals love to excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of Christianity, Europe and America, destructive iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other.  Entrenched civil  wars between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects, ISIS , Taliban and Al Quada are the root causes of most of the wars and social chaos happening around the world today. It is a purely thankless job to try to stop Muslims from killing other Muslims, or non Muslims, or gays, or women,  or Jews, or Christians, or Buddhists or Hindus..  It is worse than anything expressed in the west, even by trolls.
It will be interesting to see if the latest revelations will come to light. This would be revelations of thousands of children "fathered" by priest. These women and chidren were exploited by priest and can be be another integral component of SNAP. I simply can not imagine what will be the next revelation about priest.
How badly will Trump have to fail until some people stop apologizing for him? They blame his bad reputation on the Media. Are you serious? Trump has proudly stood in front of the cameras and microphones and made an ass out of himself daily! Every day, he presents the world with another poorly planned executive action or he alienates and insults another ally or issues a threat against another country. How many lives of American soldiers are you willing to see sacrificed? How many thousands of people will have to die before Trump worshippers will wake up to truth? Will he have to drop a nuclear bomb on another country before you realize your deal with the devil on abortion has just killed more people than abortions have or ever will? How many times will you ignore the words of good men and women when they fairly and accurately criticize Trump's words and actions? Every day I gain more understanding of how Hitler took power in Germany by observing the behavior of Trump apologists!
Oh made-up poster, what an asinine comment: which of his days on earth was Devin P. Kelley ever considered "a good guy?"  Perhaps you can ask his ex-wife.
Complaining about the man doing up his suit jacket is akin to picking pepper out of the fly poop and I can't imagine how women feel about being criticized for how they dress because quite frankly I don't care how they dress. I prefer some not to dress at all.
This really is getting to be a tiresome non-story.  Harvey Weinstein might be a creep, he probably is, although no court has convicted him.  But the creepiness is Weinstein's to own, not mine.  That is the only story here.  To tar and feather all men simply because they have the same kinds of chromosomes as Weinstein is disingenuous at best, malicious at worst.  It is cowardly to hide behind the facade of the word "systemic," to insulate the women's mob from accurate accusations that they are including men who have spent their lives being respectful to all others, (not just women,) in their charge that all men are women-abusing scum.  It simply is not true, and I for one have had enough of this guilt by association.
The man's history has nothing to do with what happened. You are no better than the guy who blames the woman after raping her.
Ordination of women is bad enough  but women as bishops is and will always be a deal breaker in the eyes of the RC church.  (Bishops can ordain priests you see - a double whammy).  My husband is Anglican and I am RC.  His bishop is a delightful woman, full of wit and humour, who has shaken up her diocese from top to bottom, reassigned old hangers-on and put the lait in charge of the direction they wanted to go, re: the church.  My bishop, on the other hand, hardly ever goes out of the city limits, refuses to follow the more liberal of the pope's commands, in almost 10 years has yet to visit his more rural parishes, is only concerned about having photo ops in the diocesan newspaper,  requires the common folk to come to him, etc., etc.  If everything else were agreed to except ordination of women, there would be no agreement - ever!  It is the dealbreaker, ergo of primo importance.
Ronna are you delirious?  By making a statement like that you set the advances women have made in leadership positions such as yours back to the dark ages.  With this buffoon in Office we are an embarrassment to America, the GOP, and any other party not to mention what the rest of the world leaders are thinking about how far America has fallen.  “The best place we have ever been?”  You need some serious counseling.
I am sure they are going to come out in droves.  You can't be gay and be conservative.  You can't be gay and be weary of so-called multiculturalism.  You can't be gay and have any opinion that doesn't parrot what some liberal mouthpiece is blabbering.  It is time for gays (and women) to say, Islam is a religion that hates us.
An fb friend puts it well "I just hope the Trump, Bernie, third-party and non-voters are happy now. People you know — maybe even you — will die because of this. That is not an exaggeration. After moving to Texas, I couldn't get insurance as a self-employed freelancer with a depression diagnosis. Not before Obamacare. It didn't matter that I'd never been hospitalized. One wellbutrin prescription is enough to screw you when it comes to conditions they don't like. With a mother who died of ovarian cancer and a father who died of heart disease, I'm the trifecta of screwed. We all are — except for those ***hole white men and delusional women enablers sitting in Congress who don't deserve to be called human." Pre-ACA I too expected to die early because of no insurance. I've had some thru the ACA, but now perhaps I'll lose it. And yes, I again expect to die early because of no insurance.
Zuma should never have gone past GO when he confessed to having sex with an HIV positive woman(never mind the rape accusations) without a condom knowing her status, and then having a shower to ward off the virus. His intellect and mentality at that point was obviously well below any acceptable standard. Anywhere else on the planet, he would have been banished to the compound of Nkandla, without firepool, chicken run etc but no, the ANC showed what they are all about and subjected us to years of humiliation and duncehood. It all points to the entire mob burying their noses in the trough like the pigs they are.
Christy1, a poster on this thread is a real little hellcat. Her favorite word seems to  be "regurgitate". she used that word in two recent posts. Must be trying to impress us. I'd like to vomit down her fat ugly neck. I'll be she is a fat girl, ugly and smells really bad on hot days.
Very true! And yet so many also around us! Just have to go to Whole foods to see those poor old white men fools being led by the nose by younger oriental women! Another type of perverion! Geez! Just because those are hetero relationships we can't let them pass unremarked!
What wasn't factual or logical about the argument I made? Are you denying that transgendered people have some form of mental illness? If so, then how do you explain what causes a biological male or female to sincerely believe they are a member of the opposite sex? Demonic possession?
3.  Tudor Development. As long as the development is for healthcare, education, and housing, GREAT!  But grocery stores? Shopping? We've got TOO MANY of BOTH in the Bowl. And, we've got people without any money to buy the junk they sell. NO. Either use that Tudor Road AS PLANNED ORIGINALLY or no to the outside interests who want to build megastores and 'boutique' shops.   4.  PROSTITUTES SNITCHING? When pigs fly. How DARE any of you try to make any citizen a spy on their neighbors. Dropping charges but ONLY if someone ELSE is thrown in jail?  If 100 women are arrested, ask how many men are!  NONE. So if this works, a prostitute could simply name her cohort in the crime of selling sex -- the man who paid her for it!  Tadah!  PUT HIM IN JAIL, THEN SHE GOES FREE! How easy to make this backfire, fools!  Nasty men came up with this stupid idea. For shame. Gestapo tactics. Vichy French!  Hypocrites!
Is that really your standard for leadership?  How many skyscrapers?  Really?  How many bankruptcies?  How many marriages?  How many torn and tattered relationships?  How many obscene and vile comments about women?  How many stupid ego driven remarks?  C'mon Sylvia.  you can do better than that.
"Many young people are not allergic to the truths of the faith or to the church, but they simply don't know anything or know very little about the faith"   The good old "what we need to do is catechize them properly". Perhaps they do know what the teachings are -- things like "women are inferior to men" or "gays are 'intrinsically disordered" or "contraceptives are evil" and reject them. And, of course, there is the whole clerical sexual abuse mess, especially the cover-up by the bishops.
The floodgates are open now, aren't they? Here's what confuses me;  why would these people have to sexually harass anyone? I know that pop musicians have women lining up to go to bed with them, be they ever so smelly and pimply, and sometimes downright ugly. These Hollywood guys are famous, good-looking men.  In any case this trial-by-press and accusation is repugnant.
I wouldn't expect anything less from pages of the Breitbart tabloid that's on record publishing nutcase pieces saying that birth control makes women fat...don't look right...talk right...choose the wrong mate...makes women sluts and looking unsexy all the time and makes men unmanly.
You have no proof that this woman even exists. So who is this "she" to whom you keep referring? Cretin.
And when was America great the first time? Was it during the Vietnam War 1960's, or the racist and sexist 1950's? America wasn't great for blacks or women or the poor.  The Soviet Union was great, really great. Then the oligarchs grabbed the reins of power from the faltering empire, and now Russia is gaining power again, on the backs of its poor and powerless.  It is obvious that Trump and his Wall Street 1%er buddies are going to carve up this country, starting with destroying health care for the poor. Then after two Clarence Thomas type Supreme Court nominations, Roe v. Wade may disappear.  Goodness knows black voter suppression will be in play, as it was in the 1950's. I mourn the deaths of American troops who will die in the next needless war, all to make the war machine rich and the Republicans stay in power.   It is as was in "Harry Potter'..."The Ministry (of magic) has fallen, the minister of magic is dead". We are in those times. Think Cheney.  Hugh Massengill, Eugene
Why don't you do like most people do Dick, Just mind your own business! Of course I can tell by the tone of your words you will probably be the rat fink that does tell the feds about this! Don't you have more important  problems to solve? Like how your president Tweeter De sexually assualted  all them women. Now that is against the law Dick......... go get him!
Just trying to keep with the meme from the left led by Hillary Clinton. Here are some of her quotes when referring to Bill's dalliances.  "I know who that whore is. I know what she's here for. Get her out of here."  "Bimbos, Sluts, Trailer Trash"  "narcissistic loony toon"  "These women are all trash. Nobody's going to believe them"  But the real question is; what did Harvey really do? It can't be about the sex, that's been going on and known for over 20 years. The New York AG refused to indict him 10 years ago even though it appears there was enough evidence to do so.  No, This type of behavior usually gets a pass in liberal America. Something else is going on here.
Girl is lucky she made her way up the hill, these idiots should be charged with attempted murder as well. The intent was there
Bill Clinton raped women ...lots of them ...that's what the facts are
Hire a lawyer to explain the law to you. She's only going to prison because she killed someone, not for the DUI alone, which is not a felony. "Deadly piece of metal"? You must wonder why cars are legal and why they are not considered by law a deadly weapon, per se. What's the fatality rate of DUI drivers at the minimum BAL? It's virtually zero. This woman is a careless, self-absorbed idiot, which goes furthest in explaining her crime.
Looks like Pierre Elliott Idiot Junior should mandate brain washing of management types so they are as woman friendly as he is.
Yes, these white people, for instance Alaska serial killers Israel Keyes, Robert Hansen, Joshua Wade, all reveal they are inhumane, arrogant and indifferent to the suffering of women, young people, Alaska Natives, blacks, etc.   What do you think should be done about them?
"In recent years, Cosby, 79, had admitted to decades of philandering, and to giving qualudes to women to induce them to have sex..."  I never liked the guy. There was just something about him.
I'd hire this guy by lunchtime The globalist left wants to destroy capitalism at all costs. It deploys agents everywhere. Then deploys this evil quota crap on corporations. Deadbeats must make up 75% of your corporation.....  How the hell this kid got fired for speaking his mind and his ideals is an absolute travesty  Business and greatness is about fire - not corn flakes You want debate You want discussion you want yelling That is how great ideas are born They are not born with cuddles, cookies and hot milk......  This is exactly why women don't succeed in business  Consensus is for communists and evil feminist white male haters Success is bred by killing your enemy - not cuddling him. Women cannot kill it is not in their nature There I said it  You all OK now or do you need a snowflake cuddle room
Maybe she's finally right on something. She brought sex into the campaign. She focused her support on feminists and and sought support from the Katy Perry's of the world and with Madeline Albright who famously lectured all women when she said  there's a special place in Hell for women that don't support women. She went on and on ad nauseam about shattering glass ceilings and her stupid quips about her server and breaching the rules for securing data. Most of her platform was gender based social engineering and slammed men when the polls showed her without sufficient male support by calling them a basket of deplorables. So with a platform that did not reach out to males, she focused on identity politics. Problem was she miscalculated. There were not enough women in her identity politics groups willing to support her in every state. Many women chose to ignore her siren calls. Both candidates were deeply flawed so it boiled down to a choice of the evil of two lessers. That's not misogyny.
Because Christians don't strap bombs to kids and women and blow themselves up.  Look at all the mass killings and the one thing in common...Muslims.
To say that masculinity is toxic is stupidity manifested in a malicious way. Masculinity encompasses strength, resolve, good manners and compassion and does not (as Ms Balkissoon supposes) denigrate feminism in any way or suggest that women are objects to be exploited. In fact, I suggest that if a man has or cultivates these qualities as well as that rare and almost wholly male quality called objectivity, he may rightfully be regarded as a gentleman. Ms Balkissoon included a better term in her opinion piece from Dr. William Ming Liu -- "dominant masculinity." She should restrict herself to its use and not resort to unjust and bitter diatribe.
Her Nazi grandfather would be proud of her. I voted for Liberal and now regret that. Nasty woman.
.  My prognostication skills sometimes leave much to be desired, but I was dead right on predicting this one.  The Trump brand is now anathema to women.   Ivanka's clothes will soon be available in remainder bins.  And the Trump-branded hotels will have lots of empty rooms.  The "elites" who stayed in those hotels past will be avoiding them as "distasteful", now.  And the boys in camo hats who put Trump in the WH can't afford the Days Inn, let alone Trump Towers.  The suckers that have been paying him royalties to put his name on their buildings will soon be trying to get out of their licenses and get a new monicker.  .
Please explain to the rest of us dumb smucks, how a woman wearing veil (religious freedom) trumps all other rights and rules. Thank you. Looking forward to your reply.
Kaepernick said, "he can't stand for a flag or an Anthem when some are lying in the streets." This whole protest has been about the flag and Anthem, and those kneeling wouldn't admit it, because of  any reaction. Trump forced the issue. And those who were offended by Trump's words, are you also also offended by the words many of these black players listen to daily. Words like women are b i iches, kill cops, f this and f that and f f f f f. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that more blacks idolize these rap entertainers and they have a bigger influence then Donald Trump will ever have, regardless of any words.
California still has the death penalty.  That is what he deserves.  I would perform the task myself, personally.     He killed an innocent woman and yet you want to treat him as someone 'special' instead of the low-life scum he has proven himself to be.   Why?  Are brown people supposed to be held to a lesser standard of conduct just because they are brown?  How is that not racism?
Trump doesn't seem to realize that the more he attacks his detractors - especially women - the more repugnant he appears to be.
So dumb. Q: What percent of white men hold executive jobs at their companies? A: A tiny fraction of one percent. Q: What percentage of white men are congressmen? A: A tiny, tiny fraction of a percent.   The white man has become the boogey man, when the job situation for 99.9999% of white men, and their chance of being promoted, is no different than that of women and minorities. Oh, and, given the reverse discrimination, in academics minorities and women are being hired and promoted at a much higher rate than white men, but based on their sex and skin color, and NOT on performance.
Waterboard the girls til they give up the names.
The only people dumber than this bitch, are the ones who vote for her.
Look another republican living in the past.  The present must be really rough.  To be clear the report says that Trump paid prostitutes to pee on the bed Obama slept it to ruin it, not that he was peed on.  He's much more of a garden variety peeping tom, opening doors he shouldn't and trying to catch women and teenagers unsuspectingly and undressed, if that doesn't work he can always grab em by the pussy.
so in reality this alt left person wants a fascist government to control what we can and cant say, how pathetic and typical of someone who is brain washed living by a religion that treats woman as cattle
For decades, Australia has been struggling with a violet and very unfriendly Muslim immigration population. The “Lebos", Lebanese immigrants, have made themselves very unwelcome by treating Australian women as sex toys they can fondle at will on the beach, in bars, in stores ...anywhere. Ozzie men trying to defend women from sexual assault by the Lebos are instantly labelled racists by the one sided media. The same happened in Cologne if you remember.
So you are saying that if a woman can't have unprotected sex without any risk of consequences, then there is a war being waged against her.
Feminist Journo's can't tell the difference and assume anything male and masculine must be toxic.   It is literally sexism given a hall pass to write whatever.   Helps explain why feminism is dying.
All this from the party that turned a blind eye to all the bimbo eruptions and but helped tirelessly in the bimbo destructions, and that defended the cigar insertions in the oval office, and the interns' kneed pleasuring of him while he is on the phone with a congressman talking about troops in Bosnia, and the consequent killing of innocent people - warmongering -  to force the nation to focus away from his abuse of power and sexual molestation (assault or rape if he had been a republican) of his female staffer.  Malignant.  Right  Bernstein's mouth is open grave..
Your ignorant, this woman paid many many years of income tax before shortsightedness took it away and here we are. How do you know she does not work? She does receive an income, a pension thus she will pay taxes. You have not facts no basis for you Union Corruption" statement which makes you zero credible, have a nice day.
Dear author, please stop being a bigot. It is every bit as offensive for your to condemn all "White Males" as it is for a neo-fascist to spew his (or her) judgments. The proud boys don't care if there are all women showings of movies. Please end your prejudice.
She's a very brave girl with her rifle.  Killing is fun.
So if a raped girl is reluctant to tell her parents, and instead resorts to a coat hanger, you're okay with that?
She would probably like the "pro-life Republican" more if he hadn't bragged about how he grabs and sexually assaults women, and if he hadn't described his aggressive womanizing as his "personal Vietnam" in his battle to NOT contract a venereal disease.  It might also help his  "likability"  to refrain from rating women by their looks and calling them pigs, dogs, fat slobs,  etc.
Did he then stuff the transgender's penis after castration in the transgender woman's mouth with the head sticking out?
"People don't burn other people alive" You need to acquaint yourself with autos da fe in Middle Ages Europe. Christians did precisely that to women accused of witchcraft, Jews who refused to convert, Christians who were accused of heresy (that is, they held beliefs the authorities didn't approve of), and others. After some Jews rejected Martin Luther's protestant Christianity as not being their cup of tea, Martin Luther suggested locking Jews in synagogues and setting the synagogues on fire. If that's too ancient for you, only 30 years ago, Christians were raping and slaughtering Muslims in the former country of Yugoslavia. Last year, Jews living in the West Bank burned down Arabs' houses and mosques, and in at least one house, the occupants were in it. Terrorists are brutal. A lot of terrorists are Muslim. That does NOT make all Muslims dogs. If a man from Arvada gets angry at his ex-wife and burns down her home with her in it, are all Arvadans to be considered dogs?
Fear looms large over everything the right wing does. Fear of other people, fear of minorities, fear of women, fear of the world, fear of travel, fear of animals. It's just ridiculous.
What do you think leftists Oregonians are going to say? This  foolish comment is not surprising.  This woman knows absolutely knows Trump is a racist.  Without even knowing him, she just knows Trump is a racist.
So having borrowed one of Michelle Obama's speeches, Melania is now following her mode of dress - imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  Good for Melania for sticking up for women's rights, even if it means shaming The Donald.
gary - Islam considers women to be on the same level as dogs and condemns homosexuals to death.  Can you speak to that?
"Responsible dissent" to some like Ms Tesa Ann means "being like the Tea Party, not like BLM, OWS, or other 'socialist' groups." Funny how the same people who think that the Tea Partiers (who didn't start protesting till after the black guy got elected) were patriots, but the current crop of anti-Trump protesters are un-American, isn't it?  As for Trump and abortion... well, he was pro-choice until he saw that his political fortunes lay with the other side. If I were a betting woman, I'll bet that very few of his campaign promises will be fulfilled. He's already backing off on gutting the ACA, building "the wall," getting out of NATO, jailing Clinton, ending SSM, etc. Tis what happens when you believe a con man.
If the shoe was on Canada's foot, if we had been attacked and thousands slaughtered on our soil and many more around the world for decades, I expect you and all the other knee jerk Trump haters would be demanding our government limit the risk of further attacks here by heavily scrutinizing anyone coming from countries where the majority of terrorists hail from.  Security 101.  I think the Left have lost all sensibility following the loss of their Queen Hillary.  A woman with a 40 year track record of lies, subterfuge and deceit, and the # 1 cheerleader for a serial adulterer, rapist, money grubbing, butt grabbing husband, King Bill.
Kudos to the farmers and women entrepreneurs for getting the pullback. For the white, middle aged, balding, overweight guys running small businesses, you'll need to better market yourself next time to avoid being the cash pinata to be whacked at Mr Morneau's convenience.
When this woman talks about people who can't afford to leave, she really means losers.  Florida is chock full of stupid people. Those "snowbirds" who move there just because it is warm are even dumber.
I'm not going to say anything for or against the president but I would just like to remind you that if Americans had not elected Trump then we would have hillary for 4 years or more. She is easily the most corrupt woman in the U S. It's more than apparent that people do not use their computers/phones to do simple research. Google hillary or bill and you will find a completely different world from the one you watch on CNN, MSNBC, CBS etc. I used to vote blindly BEFORE the internet. Now, I research who the people are that want me to vote them into office. You've heard, "where there's smoke, there's fire? http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/THE%20CLINTON%20BODY%20COUNT.pdf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkMfpge3gE
This crazy woman has no place in civil society, much less public office. She is a malignant person who doesn't understand how to be respectful to an 11-year old Cub Scout. She used low-common-denominator political rhetoric, of the kind heard on cable news, first to disparage the "the media" to a child, then insults his intelligence and the motivation of his parents. Shame one this woman and her constituents for electing her.
One candidate for president is a sexual predator and one is married to one, along with her own issues with ethics. Talking is not as bad as doing. Bill Clinton was accused of rape and apparently still continues to see young women in his penthouse at the Clinton Library. Our country is in huge trouble and of course this revelation was timed and the responses were planned. How can Hillary Clinton support women while be married to Bill Clinton? How could the Republicans who knew what Trump was support him? He was OK with them until the public found out the truth. The Clintons are friends with Donald Trump, imagine the conversation between Bill and Donald on the golf course. None of these people should be or have ever been anywhere  near the White House. I'm voting for Jill Stein.
Thank for whitesplaining and fat shaming. God knows  we wouldn't want to elect a man who gropes ugly women.
Do realize how ridiculous your logic is? You want fewer abortions, and want to make sure every lady uses birth control. But you want to defund Planned Parenthood which makes contraception available to women. Defunding PP will result in MORE abortions, not fewer.
I'm a CONSERVATIVE woman and let me clue you into one fact, most men ARE jerks. Alt left women are equally loathesome.
Being right about what?   Bill is in trouble for sexually harassing women. He just settled a lawsuit about other sexual harassment.   His political slant is not he issue here. You are conflating two very different issues.   Bill is right wing and has a right to promote and push his agenda. That is fine.  Bill and other fox execs thought they could groom up and coming talent to be their personal prostitutes and use them for sex. This is not fine.  Why does the right have to try to deflect using such bad technique?
duds:  Great questions you have asked, (Why was this young woman the only one who got a motel room, and why did he ask her how old she was.  Its like the bumper stickers around that ask, "ARE YOU 18 YET"?   The reason this is asked is because  of the legal age laws  to consent to intercourse.), I pray that the jury realizes this and sees right thru it.  I believe this guy is hiding behind the SACRED CLOTH, and I pray that he is CONVICTED.  HOWEVER, I am a REALIST, we live here in LAME LIBERAL Land County, and it would not surprise me if the jury lets this sexual predator off the hook...........Only in LAME COUNTY.  The Liberals need to be THINNED OUT.  I have to prepare for JURY DUTY.............
From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
Absolutely we should "weed out" the brutal murderers and killers of women and children. That, presumably, would also include Mr Trump's Military Industrial Complex, which has brutally maimed and killed MILLIONS of innocent Muslim women and children over the last thirty years.  If only you (and those agreeing with you)  held your ideas with real conviction and rigour - the world would be a much better place.
Would that make you sleep well at night knowing this lady is caged like an animal for moving a plant from one place to another via airplane? I think you need to be freed from the ignorant prison you live in. Someone get this guy an edible, stat.
Damn your evidence.  Screw due process, She says he did it so she is right  The accusation of rape is too important for any woman to take so lightly  just to get revenge on a guy who jilted her.  But having said that, thank god I am gay so none of it applies to me.
These women should spend a year in Iran, Iraq, Syria or any other Muslim country then tell me how oppressed they are in the US.
I never said anything about groping, the stalking was true.   Like a puppy dog.  Fortunately she disappeared at the end of the school year.    You are giving me  a taste of the disbelief that MEN face if they claim rape or sexual assault.  Your post is exactly what men face in this situation.  Men are supposed to consider themselves lucky if a woman wants to sexually assault them.  If you think women have a problem with disbelief, for men it is a hundred times worse. http://www.vocativ.com/underworld/crime/hard-truth-girl-guy-rape/
I just feel pity for Americans.  They have a serial liar and con man as president.  He is attacking women and the poor, just as expected, but hey "poor people don't want healthcare".  What a sad, sad joke.  The US may never recover.
Terrible article. The columnist and the quoted author could have done with more research examine different angles and viewpoints. The reality is it takes two to tango, have casual sex, and get nowhere close to long term relationships and marriage. There is no purpose to marriage and it introduces massive risk and cost to a wealthy individual. Also what an idiotic stat to use on university graduates. Whose going to make more, the gender studies moron whining about patriarchy or the electrician? What's the entrepreneurial breakdown between men and women? STEM, etc?
And yet gays who want to be women earn better wages than the average Joe. it takes a man to show women how to be a lady. <smirks>
Jackie:  Your post here is based on INCORRECT information.  "These are black kids who's "crime" was they touched a white chick" is NOT true.  the young woman involved was AfricanAmerican.  If you read the Police Report you will see that the "race" box for the victim is marked AfricanAmerican (Black).  Spinning this incident to be a racial incident is really a shame.  I, for one, would appreciate it if you would either delete your post references to this as a "black on white" incident or make some correction.  If you doubt my information, do a little research and see it for yourself.  Thanks,  Gary Crum
This editorial is fine with me. I don't agree with Antifa's methods although I support most of the same causes.  I say the ends don't justify the means. But apposing Antifa's methods doesn't make be swallow the false equivalency of "on both sides" because I saw the video of the nazis marching and chanting with clubs and torches, the terrorism that killed a woman and injured 19 others, and the savage beating of the black guy in the parking lot. There were no good people marching and chanting as nazis. Trump's stand on Charlottesville encouraged nazi groups and KKK. And "on both sides" is code for white supremacy and racism. It's a damn shame that antifa, a small fringe group, feeds the whole false equivalency baloney. This fringe group on the left is wrong; but doesn't counterbalance the bulk of racism and white supremacy and KKK, and Trump's in-code approval of them.
Actually you wrote that no one was curious as to why Trump "l-o-s-t". Read your own stuff? Okay, would "abet" be more precise? I really thought "complicit" was more respectful of those who voted for him believing that sexually assaulting women, general misogyny, vulgarity, vitriol, vengeful, rapaciously greedy, not paying taxes, stiffing workers and suppliers and investors were all matters of repentance and behavioral reform.
"HTG, with so many more important matters at hand, do we now have to pay attention to whether we wear 'racially appropriate' jewelry?" I guess many white folks can't handle diversity, even when it does not effect them directly, like how black women wear their hair and jewelry.
Simple- men be castrated who are in positions of authority that will make feminists happy. Women who use sex to advance their careers can be tarred and feathered. Fair ?
I'll also throw in there any person who believes in the annihilation of a particular nation or nations, or who espouses honour killings or female genital mutilation.
almost  no  females  I  know  are  feminists, but then  they  shave  their  body  hair  and  don't  have  sex  with  other  females.
"Unpopular" is a gross understatement when it comes to attitudes towards Trump. Among women who find him repulsive in the extreme (100% of the women I know) there is a sincere hope that Trump succumbs to a fatal disease as soon as possible and this regardless of the fact that Pence, whose acute idiocy by all accounts, is overshadowed only by Trump's excessive perversion, would succeed him.
Thank you for trying as hard as you could to deal with the recalcitrant GOP super majority Senator Gardner. Must be so frustrating to be dealing with such cowardly, ideologically blinded men and women who put the welfare of the oil industry above that of the state of Alaska. Don't let the bas#$ds get ya down Senator.
While leaving the march, I ended up behind a teenage female walking with what appeared to be her mother. The mother held a sign that read, "Keep your hands off my pussy". This is the level to which the mostly uneducated mostly white GOP has brought us. I really never imagined I would live long enough to see mothers walking in protests with such signs. To have to admit that the sign is necessary truly saddens me.   Trump represents an historical coarsening of America and, from other reports and what I see on social media, he has emboldened the worst among us to act out their Un-American ideals. I hope we can eventually recover from a President who openly advocates sexual violence and other abhorrent actions.
Sad to see no mention of the move by biological males to take over female spaces that Fed law allows sex-segregated.  Men have now pushed ladies out of the ladies' room at Target and Starbucks, off the gold medal podium at the last Olympics, and out of the  running for sportswoman of the year.  Worse, people with penises are now demanding to be referred to as women without ever once having monthly cycles, bloated bellies, or swollen breasts.  As we watch women being regulated  to second-class status in order to make men feel better about themselves, it is shoes that have caught the public' eyes.  Shoes, not women.
You seriously believe that? We don't stone women for being raped, we don't throw gays off buildings for being gay, women do not need permission from their male relatives to go out, and we don't cut off women's clits so they can't experience sexual pleasure. Tis comment is laughable and ridiculous, and WRONG.
So now all they have to do while holding a gun to your head is ask for your keys, your phone and your gun. So if you get off a shot and they return fire and you end up in the hospital with an organ shot up or brain damage and problems for life or worse dead and you knew you were within your rights does that help. Or maybe you should start shooting at every couple of black guys that come toward you and find out they're from the church after you killed one and you go to jail for years does that help. But if they are caught and eliminated that might help but the do gooders will cry foul and the Civil Liberty pukes will cry foul and the laws will soon require that other race couples are being discriminated and should be holding women up as well and the liberal legislators will have to write new laws and so on. Dumb isn't it?
How old are you? I have owned three Corvettes, two C3's and I currently drive a C4. I have come to the sad conclusion that anyone between 30 and 60 years old looks like a pathetic loser in a Corvette. If your goal is to attract female companionship you should also drop the Corvette from the list. Women over 30 and under 60 attracted to Corvettes are also pathetic losers. Now if you are 60 or over, have at it. At this point, nobody cares what you look like.
Trudeau won't look after us, he's to busy being a feminist.
What is disrespectful about consensual sex?  Why should a person in show business be expected to be crude?  Why would any decent, self-respecting conservative vote for a man who claimed that he could - well, I don't think I need to post that here.  He is the same person, you know.  Frankly, I think he's still in show biz.  Do you think he made a claim about an action that he didn't actually perform?    See the problem?  If he did what he said he could do "any time he wanted" he is a man who treats women like property.  If he didn't, he's a liar who said he did something that he didn't do.  Bill Clinton, at worst, cheated on his wife, something that we're all pretty sure Hillary had at least a smidgen of awareness about. He said that he didn't do something that he did do.   They are still married. Their first for each.  I have my doubts about the chances of the Trump marriage remaining solvent post-term.  Anyone know what Vegas has on this?
It was a human male not a female fat sac.
To summarize: Women are like cars. When they have sex, they are actually lending their bodies to men. If men wreck women's bodies, women must pay the costs of repair. Unintended pregnancy is like a car wreck.
This daughters of the vote idea is an excellent program, and especially fitting for international women's day.  I know at least one attendee, and we are very proud of her and thrilled that she was chosen and got to travel with the other young women to Ottawa.  And for the life of me I just don't understand the origin and nature of the comments here that are so persistently derisive and dismissive of the voices of Canadian women. I wish we could have discussion boards that were free of such offensive and hurtful comments. There is no need for them, and the continuing presence of trolls and antagonistic comments will undo so much of the good that open and intelligent discussion and debate on the internet could offer us.
This woman is a waste of newsprint and bits.  Recycled "progressive" kool aid nonsense is all she ever spouts. Her supposed hero Obama combined with Bush before him to bring tragedy to millions in the Middle East with their ideologically influenced incompetence and she compares Trump and Trudeau's hair. She, not Mr Trump, is everything wrong about America including her display of profound ignorance about the rest of the world.
And a society that expected chastity from women, and praised male virility.
Odd that the country that elected someone who brags about being able to grab a woman's pussy would exalt someone who objects to having that happen.
Uhhh.... Trump raped women and children No that didn't work Uhhh... Trump is a biggot filled with hate and will destroy America No that didn't work Uhhh.... We will recount the votes to show that Hillary won or at least try and tie up the election No that didn't work Uhhh.... It was the Russians! That's it the Russians! They swayed the election in favor of Trump.
White folks...How about serial killers? Albert DeSalvo, the Boston Strangler, David Berkowitz, New York City’s “son of Sam.” Ted Bundy, who called himself “the most coldhearted son of a bitch you’ll ever meet,” confessed to thirty murders in the 1970s. Chicago serial killer John Wayne Gacy, murdered thirty-three teenaged boys and young men in the 1970s, burying twenty-seven in the crawl space under his house.  Gary Ridgeway, Washington State’s Green River Killer, was convicted of killing forty-eight girls and young women but admitted to ninety murders during the 1980s and 1990s. Jeffrey Dahmer, the Milwaukee Cannibal, raped, murdered, and dismembered seventeen men and boys over thirteen years, Dennis Rader, known as BTK killed ten in Wichita, Kansas and was on the loose for decades.  Though each of these men was white, no fear of white men emerged. Their murders were considered individual acts for which they alone were responsible.
You aren't that dumb are you,  really.  Gender police?  I'm pretty sure that if you line up 100 people, I can tell if they are male or female.  Go back to smoking your hooch and watching CNN.
The Rebel has no respect whatsoever for women.  All they do is promote hatred and division in Canada with their half-truths, racism and sometimes outright lies.  Levant should be in prison.
It is unlikely that there will be any change in the culture of the Church until women and men are treated as equals before God and are allowed to study together for the priesthood, whether they are gay or straight, married or single. The hierarchical structure needs to change to a horizontal structure that honors the majority viewpoints. The early Church relied very much on the "sense of the faithful". This means that the lay people were the voice of the Church and it was their common sense that determined the horizontal structures of the Church. The head of the Church was Jesus, not the pope, and that made all the difference. What are we doing honoring a human being as the head of the Church, especially when popes are ignoring the commands of Jesus and worshiping an institution instead? It has been many years since I have heard a bishop talk about living the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. All we hear are bishops interfering in the sexual lives of the lay people. Very sad.
It's imperative that all Canadians both Muslim and non-Muslim read this book concerning Islamic reform: "Heretic Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now by Ayaan Hirsi Ali" Go to your local library and get it. It's not a book about bigotry, its a book that dissects Islam explaining why its the way it is and how it must go through a reformation. Ayaan Hirsi Ali makes a powerful case that a religious Reformation is the only way to end the terrorism, sectarian warfare, and repression of women and minorities that each year claim thousands of lives throughout the Muslim world. With bracing candor, the brilliant, charismatic, and uncompromising author of the bestselling Infidel and Nomad argues that it is foolish to insist, as our leaders habitually do, that the violent acts of Islamic extremists can be divorced from the religious doctrine that inspires them. Instead we must confront the fact that they are driven by a political ideology embedded in Islam itself. Fed. MP's must read it.
The march on the 21st had zero arrests, so just to clarify, that is NOT mob rule.  The protest in Seattle was very peaceful, I was there.   You are correct, being willfully ignorant of the history of American citizens demanding change to "make change" are ignoring the beauty of living in a democracy where our constitution protects our right to peaceful protest.  If women hadn't protested in the early 1900's, they still wouldn't have the right to vote.  You sound ignorant of the impact those protests had on reality.
Islam is a hierarchy of submission; The world must submit  to Allah (Islam) All Muslims must submit to  Allah and the Prophet Mohammad  (shahada)  Men must submit to their Imam A wife must submit to her husband Children must submit to their parents.  A female must submit to all males. ( a mother must obey her own son)  Human laws are not to be obeyed unless there is a benefit for Islam to do so.   If a father tells his 16 year old daughter to marry a 55 year old taxi driver with another wife, she is in no position say refuse . That would violate the honour of her family.
Calling a large percentage of US tax payers that you may one day preside over "deplorable".  Shows her true colors.  Sick woman.
What about the NDP female with the bottle stuck up her vagina, was that not a vulgar thing of the left?
What she is saying "Women and minorities are too incompetent to compete with white men, so the bar needs to be lowered." The irony of the SJW brain is they don't realize how stupid they sound or the fact that just because you believe in something so much, doesn't make it real.
as parents we laid down the law to our kids.  explained carefully and clearly what cause and effect and consequences meant and how they would be dealt with in our home.  every new child heard it, understood it and shook hands.  of course, as smaller kids it made no sense.  i have used my hand to spank the bottom of my kids when they truly, truly needed a heads up correction.  spilling a drink.. throwing a hissy, cussing, name calling, lying, swatting someone else...99% stuff kids do?  no -not spankable.  my 3 yr old not leaving the heat stove alone?  or deliberately not listening when headed for a road?  yeah.  my only daughter - the family"baby", a mini me, ie. trouble..  i have never given more than 4 maybe 5 spankings altogether with my 6 kids.  really how hard did this woman have to strike this child to leave bruises?  hope it did hurt her waay worse than the child
Maybe these women made it to where they are at, cause they got a abortion vacation? I can't wait to ask Millett about that. "Hey Millett did you get a abortion vacation to get to Anchorage and do you plan on voting against female mutilation in Alaska?".. Good grief.   Guys like Eastman have some serious issues.  He'd last 10 minutes in a village and because of his own self imposed fears/judgments, he'll run off into the wilderness. Then the local search n rescue will have to go out and get him. Drag him back. Feed him. Give him a cot. And hope the weather is good the next day for his plane charter.  This dude has issues, best he stay within the boundaries of his own district and stop women from that area from getting abortion vacations and protect them from female mutilations.
As a physicist I can say things like:"Let us assume that the universe is one-dimensional" or "Let us assume that a solid has periodic boundary conditions" and then derive in peace the consequences of my wild impossible assumptions.  But now a professor in the social sciences will have to be careful when he/she assumes that the humans or for that matter the chimps, are made of males and females.  A tiny fraction of the 1% of trans/etc... will go nuts and claim discrimination.  Gays won rights by claiming that nature made them the way they are but apparently we choose our gender.....  amazing how completely degenerate our Western societies have become.
Her "taxed" feminism still does not brush away the fact that her and others knew of this behavior by both Weinstein AND President Bill Clinton, but due to either friendships, careers or political convenience (or all of the aforementioned) not only looked the other way but demanded that their audience also pay no attention to their man behind the green curtain who is masturbating away.
“You can’t feel like a boy for wrestling and a girl for basketball.”??  Ah, if I am not mistaken girls wrestle boys now.  Not a very impressive statement from the 'director'.  Any opinion from the DOJ is just that, opinion.  The DOJ is not the Court and personally I believe it is currently run by unconstitutional criminals.  Team participation is a deflection of the real issue here.  The real issue is does a penis = male and a vagina = female or is a mental dysphoria  of sexuality brought on by societal pressures the determining factor.  The second part being,  whose 'feelings' or rights are more important, the less than 3% or the 97%?  Personally I like to drive fast, over the speed limit and have never hurt anyone or crashed.  My guess, way more than 3% of drivers agree.  Therefore I should be 'allowed' to because I 'feel' like it. Does that offend you?  Is it potentially uncomfortable or unsafe to the vast majority?  Can I legally do it?  No!  What is the difference?  Morals!
How insane have we become that there is a need to address this issue ?   The second you are born the doc says right then and there you are a boy or girl.  He doesn't say the sex isn't known until the person reaches 16 to decide what they are. The doc doesn't wait for gay supporters to convert people into something they aren't . If your born a boy , use the boy's bathroom . Born a girl , use the girls.  Nothing in life can be more simple . A person shouldn't decide how they feel each week  to decide what bathroom they should use.   It's stunning that those who support the pick what ever bathroom fits your fancy can claim with certainty that an open door policy wouldn't be abused by people with sexual perversion . Anyone who can't stand the sex they were born with has issues from the get go. Unstable people shouldn't have ANY choice in which bathroom to use.  That we have to talk about this issue shows how far down society has slid.  Shame on us for encouraging twisted behavior.
He is the lowest DNA example, of an intoxicated primate, who only eats, sleeps, reproduces, and is physically violent.  He should be placed in a zoo cage, with another female primate, and a rubber tire.
Not to mention indiscriminate barrel bombing women and children. Assad is a butcher with no morals.
Excellent question !  I extend the same to all the women (and men) who hero wordhip Bill Clinton and who "made it ok" for him to be revered worldwide. The "feminists" and pink hats who marched against Trump, but honor Bill as a "senior statesman" and would put him back in the WH? Hillary and her people who blamed the women (victims) who tried to speak out but who were called "trailer park trash" and "looney tunes", how about them ?   Some of you older folks may remember back in the 50's and 60's how females were talked about and treated during high school. If you happened to be from the wrong side of the tracks or wrong color you were a "bad girl, a slut", fair game for jocks in locker rooms. Sluts/tramps  had it "coming to them". Get them drunk and they "pull a train" for the team.  While Trump said or bragged about doing some really nasty things, he was able to be elected because Bill got away with it. We gave Bill Clinton a pass, just as Hollywood has given Roman Polanski awards.
This type of nonsense shows just how far the arrogant religious PC movement has gone.  The Northwest Christian University officials are no better than the Muslim extremist and how they treat women.
And yet in the study I cited the accusers, the women, themselves admitted their accusations were false. Sorry, no amount of feminist scaremongering can get around that.
There is not a lick of science in this entire article.  But there is a ton of misinformation and fear mongering...  and THAT is the problem.  This woman is suffering from cognitive dissonance.
Well she was being a "nasty woman" and the President did say it was OK for police to rough up suspects so...
What a piece of GARBAGE! Obviously written by a left wing nut that resents the knowledge, experience and power that comes with getting older. It seems that she (and many other clueless people) think that 'aging', working your way up and being a useful part of society in your 'golden years' is something to be ashamed of.  Being 'old' and part of society is not a dirty word, it's something to be proud of. Remember lady one day you will be an 'old white woman' how you going to feel then?
The unarmed black men and women in the news who have been killed by police were not committing violent crimes.  I think one was for a broken tail light, another for selling cigarettes on the street.....  I mean, pul-lease stop being an apologist for a horrible reality that black people are almost twice as likely to be killed by the police and it is wrong.
OMG, you equate your privileged white male status with the hatred and oppression of others especially people of colour, women, Muslims, Jews, etc.  That someone would dare question or criticize that unearned status or demand equality for people other than white males does not make you a victim in any way.  The fact is your whining only shows ignorance and lack of regard for others.  Pathetic.
God bless the Supreme Court of protecting the sacred abortion rights of all women!!!  May God damn and destroy the pro-lie, anti-choice, forced-birth movement.
Iran's morality police, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan's "blasphemy" laws... the left believes it's "Islamaphobic" to bring up issues staring everyone else in the face like a fat man in a diaper. When Iranian women were beaten by regime thugs and thrown in jail for dancing to Pharrell's "Happy", crickets from the perpetually offended activists. When Iranian men led a peaceful protest against forcing women to wear head coverings by donning their own, crickets from the perpetually offended activists... the same goes for the Christian woman facing the death penalty in Pakistan for "blaspheming" at work, of course her word is irrelevant... As for the Saudis, Saudi Arabia certainly has it's issues but without the ruling Monarchy, it would likely descend into chaos, anarchy, and perpetual war. Robert Lacey's "Inside the Kingdom" is an interesting read...
"Why would a woman who accused Trump of attempted rape ever go out with him?"  Simply put, Harth is a feckless idiot. If Trump truly did these things to her or forced his hand to her crotch in the restaurant she should have lifted the salad fork from table and nestled it somewhere between Trump's chin and cartilage covering the larynx. In addition, what kind of coward was this boyfriend Houraney, the true testament to this couple of carpetbaggers is how money was more important than attempted rape, cheating and all the other things Mr.Trump did to make Harth feel 'traumatized'.  If Trump did half the things this article says he did then I blame morons like Harth and Houraney for allowing a person, a mere mortal to manipulate and control their lives to the extent they claim, poor, poor little lambs.
Why do you make negative assumptions instead of simply going to the Run for Women web site and LOOKING for where the money has gone??  You say they don't name the organizations, which is simply WRONG -- every single dollar is accounted for.  The Run funds not only mammograms, but also research, education, outreach, and treatment. Also on the Run for Women web site, under "About Us" and "Our Story" is the whole, longer story of exactly how the Run for Women started.  You should read it, because you'll learn something!  Shame on YOU for being a lazy armchair critic who's not helping anyone.
Im a woman and I am voting for Hillary because she has a vagina.  She'll finally make rape illegal. I don't really care that she lies and steals as long as she can limp  her ancient lady parts into the oval office.
The author didn't say men are X.  In fact, she pointed out that it's not just men who blame the victim:  "That slut-shaming pablum didn't work out too well for Karan: an international boycott of her brand is underway. Apparently women can be dinosaurs too."  "Fragile flower" is a common term for somebody who is being oversensitive and taking offense where none is intended.  If the shoe fits....
The following shocking..  THIS WOMAN IS A MONSTER ..!!   TRUTH HURTS..!!! https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=212688522461817&id=212639889133347
The trouble is, most high earning women are chain smoking, manly buffalos.  The goodlooking young ones tend to be airheads.
wrong.  Viewing a body is NOT a sexual desire. Seeing that somebody has a natural huge set of breasts, OR a huge penis, OR a double Vagina or even double Penis (and yes, BOTH EXISTS), is no different than finding that a massive tumor was in say the small intestine, blocking nearly everything, and yet, the patent did not realize it. Or when a women comes in heavy but feeling funny and it turns out that she is having a baby (and yes, AGAIN, this happens).   Now, if they were mishandling the body, OR were taking pix for personal use, then yeah, I have a REAL issue with it. BUT, docs, nurses, etc work on our bodies day in and day out and need to know when things are not right. They also need to know what CAN be different (which is why I like older docs for PSP and young for specialists ).
Good.  They shouldn't capitulate to that requirement if they don't want to.  It's a stupid, oppressive and mysoginistic requirment in the first place.   But, that's only my opinion.  Culturally, the question should be whether a Saudi, Sharia adhering female would forego head covering in order to not offend a Western culture while visiting.  If not, there can be no expectation of reciprocity.  Alternatively, if a woman in the American contingent CHOSE to wear a head covering, I don't think I'd have any sort of huge problem with that either.  The choice to show respect should likewise be respected.  What would be very, very impressive to me, is if the American men donned traditionally female Saudi head dresses and walked the mile in others' shoes.   That would take guts, and that would make an important point.  But I don't "expect" that.  Otherwise, let people wear what they want.
If you think tRump is a better choice than Hillary, there is more wrong with your values than you think. There is nothing good about tRump and nothing bad enough about Hillary to justify this unhinged madman in the WH. I did not find the Bill Clinton accusers credible. I don't find credibility in the Cosby or Weinstein or even the tRump accusers, either,  as much as I would like to see him get accused of anything that could get him out of office. I am consistent. I don't agree with women waiting decades to come forward in some frenzied mob to make accusations they have little credible evidence to support. tRump stands out because of his own words and bragging the way he did himself for more than 30 years. Blame him if you don't like his special brand of accuser. But you are the hypocrite if you can accept the Clinton accusers and not even care about tRump's. How are you any different than the people you criticize? You aren't. You are exactly like those you claim to condemn.
be truthful, you don't love ben, you love what he stands for - anti rail.  about muslims, whose religion hates women, hates all other religions, will kill anyone who so much denigrate their religion, hates gays, etc.  do you love them?  do you love whites that hate blacks and all minorities?  or hate them?  do you hate native Hawaiians who hate haoles?  you are a hypocrite.
The guy in the first photo looks like a crack head Vigo mortsen, the second dude looks like he has a pointed head and 2 sets of eye brows, the female in the 3rd pic looks like a Chinese lady boy, the guy in the 4th pic looks like the world's coolest wigger, and the girl in the last pic, it looks like she has a  mouth under her chin....and it's smiling for the camera. If you guys didn't know, this group is call the cluster fuck crip gang.....
Are our women ashamed to have hair, therefore have to cover it? Deranged Muslims say so.
Excuse me? Some of the the richest states in the world live in the region and REFUSE to take in the migrants. THEY ARE THE PROBLEM. Pretty damn obvious. Or if America, Britain and France are causing these issues, they take them all. Not Canada, we will take some sure but WE CANNOT BE THE ESCAPE HATCH FOR DICTATORS around the world. The men must fight and die for their land as my ancestors did with Stalin rose and the women and children went to Canada while male ancestors were obliterated fighting and dying for their land.
If my wife tells me there's a man in the female bathroom I will go in and beat him down.  Anyone who knows me knows this to be true... think about it before you enter the ladies restrooms in Anchorage.  Test me! I could care less what the current law says.
Women earned the vote by offending people, blacks earned a better place in the world by offending people, we earned basic human rights and shed the grip of the church and monarchs by offending people.
Nice story, but you are of course the lyingest of liars. Tell us the one again, about how Obama is Wise and Wonderful, and Hillary is an honest woman. Tee hee, it's always good for a laugh. You tool of the Enemy of the People.
I'm betting if the husband of LW1 works out at a gym, he's one of those fools who actually talks on the phone while lifting weights. From time to time I see this. If only these clowns knew how idiotic they looked. I'm not kidding: Men and women lifting up weight as they are talking on the phone! Who is SO important that they can't wait till before or after the workout to speak to? And no, these hardly sound like emergencies (a la "Hey Tom, your dog just got run over by a car," or "Hey Emmie, your house is on fire."). Really, an hour's workout, and they MUST take the call inside that hour WHILE they're literally in the middle of a set? And need I say they always talk loud enough for those around them to hear? Talk about self absorption.
Milo was right:  feminism is a form of cancer.
Hope this woman never has kids. And why does she have a drivers license?
So she should be quiet and play nice.  No. Women don't play by those rules anymore, dicky.
Because they don't. Not only do they not "emphasize misogyny and homophobia", but this is a silly stretch and groundless claim.  It also assumes that folks who see marriage as it has been for 99% of history are somehow scared of gays? And all the women at this church are delusional? Should they be rescued from their fate?
Roman Leverenz, “This is the price we pay for our freedom”, which liberal talking point did you get that one from in regard to the Second Amendment?  Don't insult the brave men and women who sacrificed their lives for out freedom and paid the ultimate price with you idiot talking points.  You should be aware they did just that so you could spout such trash without fear of retribution from the government you want to run all our lives.
Can't this woman just go away?  Vamos already.  I'm tired of the placating gestures from those alligator arms, the weak if not worn out woman of the peeps routine and yoga
Ladies and gents, I present the Russian Troll.
I won't use the word "white" if there were other non-Indians out there. But nearly all the non-Indians happened to be white people. If there were nothing but black people out there, I would write "black sycophants".  If a black man beat up a little old lady, I would called him a "black thug". If that person happens to be white, then its "white thug".  I don't see how a descriptive word could be considered as a racist. If a male attacked a female...would that be a sexist term?  Indian Lovers is a universal term is it not? Why would it be racist? If I am a Motown lover, would that make me a racist?? If you love haiku, would that make you a racist. I think we are throwing that word "racist" too much in this world.
When will people stop blaming the victim? Why don't you ask the question...when will abusive men stop beating women? Disgusting
The feminists in the so-called feminist movement are the epitome of penis envy.  They do not like who they are.  The result being they actually denigrate the truly feminine.
I tried to tell anyone in Eugene that would listen  she is the real deal. Considering her age she is just coming into her own as quite possibly the best female long distance runner ever. I only hope so. Good luck in the finals Allie kick some ass!
Another day, and even more hatred and division from the "tolerant" left wing.  It looks like this third-wave feminist zealot missed MLK's dream about a nation where people would be judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin.  I'm anxious to see more left-wing trolls explain how this type of racial discrimination and stereotyping is justified because it fits into their hypocritical agenda.
I find it hypocritical to hear "blessed are those who see God in every person" from someone who cannot see God in women, and just said women cannot be priests because they cannot image God.
In the recent past, it would have been unthinkable for a sitting president to allude to assaulting a political rival, much less a woman. Now it's not even a headline.  -----  A very misogynist, sexist and anti-feminist line.  I am outraged!  Does this author believe women are less then capable of defending themselves or that it's somehow worse to assault a woman or that women are victims that we need to protect?
Wrong... what is malignant is the media.  What the media is doing is taking sides against half the country who believe what Trump is doing is the right thing and it is bias schmucks like you in the media that are part of the problem not part of the cure.    In fact for decades now you have declared war against the average working man/woman because you think YOU are enlightened and that the citizenry are too stupid to manage their our own lives... that YOU and big brother govt knows best.     So thanks but no thanks asking for our help in destroying Trump... we plan on destroying the scum in the media instead.
Philippines is one sick country. They don't treat their sewage so pollute their seas. Birth control pills were invented 50 years ago. By now their drugged urine has tricked down to their underground drinking water. Filipino women have the highest rate of mammary cancer in Asian women. There are too many people and not enough infrastructure to support their waste treatments. Don't buy their food products. Let them sell to other countries. Maybe dump them in Mindanao. Best way to kill them is to feed them their own food.
I have been looking at topless magazines and pornography since I was a young boy. Boobs are sexual and provacitive. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills reading this shit. These women and supporters are looking for every angle to protest equality. Men and women are created different. Equal and different. I'm a 30 year old male. The way women dress in our society already has me breaking my neck and "objectifying women". Put a nice set of boobs in front of me and I know I'm going look and think sexual thoughts. Without that intention even. The woman in the article stated women should be able to be topless because men can do it. What is being eluded to in the comments about the nature of men and the way we are wired. Is that we see boobs, or tight cloths, and our minds shift to wanting said "object". The sexual urge takes over. My point is this is not about inequality. This is about our physical anatomy being different. Have some morals. Making men wear shirts is more logical than this B.S.
Possibly for female children because they will grow up and be forced to breed and bear children of their uncles and rapists.
Men whose Number One criteria for a woman is 'she's gotta be hot' usually attract gold diggers who view men as ATMs.
We have to pay for the French, the Catholic, the Jews, the Muslims, the Feminists, the Natives, the Welfare Class, the millions of government workers, the baby boomers pensions, the new immigrants and refugees....   what more could go wrong ???
If our economy continues to improve and the stock market keeps everyone's 401k's from disappearing, and employment number go up, people may hate him but they will vote for him. The disgrace to the office of president was Bill Clinton. He is who trailblazed for Trump. Everyone gave Clinton honors and awards, so why wouldn't they vote for a Trump ?  Clinton was and is a vile perpetrator of sexual harassment and sexual assault on numerous women. Hillary made sure that the victim's of Bill were drug through the mud and called them trailer park trash and looney toons.  So, in the long run, the Democrats are going to have a tough time coming up with anyone except Bernie !  Run Joe Biden and see not only the way he vilified Anita Hill but the way he treated a black man. Not so good.  Maybe the Democrats will run Governor Moonbeam ! How about Vicente Fox ? Better be Bernie !
Sorry, Trump has brought racism and bigotry to the forefront by railing against Muslims, including insulting a Gold Star family; his claiming the judge's bias because he's a Mexican in the Trump U fraud case. He has a pattern of incidents of discriminating against African Americans since the 70s on, and his birther claim against Obama.   In his campaign, Trump  after African Americans, immigrants, Latinos, Asians, women, Muslims and even mocked a disabled reporter. And it's interesting how the KKK and other white supremacist groups have been emboldened under the Trump administration.
I'm thoroughly opposed to the Trumps, but I'll be damned if I get on board with your slut-shaming. She can do anything she wants with her body. The idea of you trying to exercise control over a woman's behavior is more disgusting than any photograph.
Ok, a lady who lost to pretty much a neophyte in Obama, was one of the worst SOS's ever who managed to have all of the money in the world on her side and a sitting President who was pretty popular just handing her the Baton...and she lost to TRUMP, all while blaming white women, Russians, Comey, the DNC, Bernie, WikiLeaks and sexism etc. You don't find that inept? She lost to a person no one else would have. So, yeah, that's pretty damn inept in my opinion.  This story is a lot more than what Trump is tweeting about, that's for sure.  I hope both parties go down in flames, I'm tired of them and their stupid games and their lies, and they can take their mouth breathing supporters with them.
She is a calloused, deceiving and cunning  She was an accomplice to her husband's sexual abuse of women and her treatment of his victims is despicable.
That was a joke, and a jab at your comment. You made reference to Christian women being fridgid. Your insane if you even think I'd meet with you.
Zweli, too little too late from you.  You may be a gentleman and scholar, but you're too weak or too self-preserving to take on the ANC you indirectly support.  Stand up, speak out, push for a secret ballot - you could still be a hero, but you're too chicken to take the risk and speak out.  And even if you do, look what your, yes, YOUR party is doing to the poor lady MP speaking out.  It's disgusting.  And you will forever be tarred with the rest of the scum like Zuma, Mbete and Duarte in the top six.
"What a silly and short sighted post. God is genderless. It's our own inability to understand His Fatherhood that makes us think in the little categories you think the Church teaches in."  What a silly and short sighted post. God is female. It's our own inability to understand Her Motherhood that makes us think in the little categories  you think the Church teaches in.
Nothing quite like men making decisions about women's bodies and women's health care. And every last one of these GOP hypocrites would claim to be opposed to big, intrusive government.
The men in prison will give this low life an anal awakening  Maybe after they make him their bitch, they'll beat up on him for sexual gratification  Cut him up a little too. while their at it, give him some of his own medicine. NOT A MAN IF HE HITS A WOMEN-
Many of the "foreign" cars are built in Canada and the USAby men and women who live next door to the CAW/UAW workers and have the same education level.  Of course, "any idiot knows" this.
Could it be that the Muslim, Obama per the Koran, thinks that men are far superior to women and that women are sex objects for men?...Every Muslim follows the commands in the Koran...for good and for evil.   Then, we also know what the Koran says about Homosexuals...and that may be the real reason that Obama is silent.  Weinstein must know too much.
No. They would think that it was Hillarious. And the notion that Trump's retweet is promoting violence against women, when everyone with a functioning brain knows that it was aimed at one specific person, is the typical ridiculous overblown claim only a few buys into. Note that when Kathy Griffin held Trump's decapitated head, no one claimed that it promoted violence against men.
Hillary is pathetic and an embarrassment to all women of honor and integrity.
Thing is... Muslims think their religious beliefs should be the law of the land. They're offended by anything non-Muslim. They think all women should dress modestly in public. They don't want you walking your dog past their house. They think fling a Canadian flag on your house is an affront to their home country. They really want sharia law in place. It's no wonder there is a little push-back. starting to surface.... It's going to get worse.... look at the problems in England and France.
Donald Trump is a nasty man, and Hillary Clinton is a nasty woman. No matter whom you vote for, we'll end up with a nasty president.
This guy's been watching too much Western reality TV "documentaries" or else he's just regurgitating the current "white guys are unprecedented evil" theme.  I'd say Islamic headcutters in the Middle East and Islamic child and woman kidnappers in Africa (to name just the first two that come readily to mind) make these guys look like college kids.
Hey Fareed, while I am somewhat heartened by you FINALLY admitting that you so called "educated" elites missed the obvious, I am irritated that in YOUR explanation you assume all Trump voters are/were UN-educated white-trash Idiots. I am a college  educated white woman who has worked and travelled. I have friends of all colors and backgrounds, and I am NOT an ideologue.  The reason I voted for Mr. Trump is because I am tired of you and your elite buddies lying to get elected,  and then REFUSING to listen to our concerns while you vote yourselves into prosperity!
My condolences to the family. Muslims may be skeptical about "road rage" but nobody is skeptical that an illegal alien from south of the border killed this poor girl. Because Mexico and Central America sure seem to produce more than their share of violent criminals.
indeed, gary, and there are some who are such emotional cripples they need a safe space because they think some one looked at them funny. This is purely political BS gary, BS that belittles true sexual harassment. This is such BULL*&^% I liken it to claiming I was sexually harassed at an AA meeting because they hugged me. and notice your shameless intellectually bankrupt drivel comes into view yet again when you claim he "targeted" these women when in truth these women and the democrats targeted Kruse, an easy target because he smokes in his office. This BS is nothing less than political shamelessness to deflect from the story breaking, the democrats took money from a sexual predator.
Well I have "deigned" to answer.  Just in case you missed it: The answer is that the ends do not justify the means. Rape does not justify murder. Go after the rapist and give him the death penalty if you wish--but the child conceived did not rape the women. Therefore the child does not deserve to die for something he/she had nothing to do with.  Incest does not justify murder.  The health of the mother does not justify murder.  Doctors should do all they can to save both.  Now, sir, do you care to answer my question? My question is this:  If you would not support anti-abortion legislation if exceptions were made for rape, incest, or direct health of the mother, what does rape, incest or direct health of the mother have to do with anything?
This is a madman who has gone public and said that he'd date is daughter, Ivanka.  How fricking sick is that for a presidential candidate; and we thought Bill Clinton had a problem with women.
The 15 year old girl already did get the last laugh. Gorsuch couldn't compel any laughter if he tried. He's a poser and a vacuous buffoon like Trump.
You say NYT accuses Trump of 1) racism, 2) sexism, 3) authoritarianism 4) homophobia. Maybe they do that because: 1)Trump spent three years fomenting the ugly lie of the "birther" movement, and called Mexicans "rapists and criminals." 2) The the "grab 'em by the p****y"president has been clear about his approach to women.   3) Trump told a rally: “Nobody knows the system better than me,  which is why I alone can fix it” 4) Trump recently attended the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s “Road to Majority” conference, where he said he would “promote and protect family values” and “ protect religious liberty in America.” The Faith and Freedom Coalition is an anti-LGBTQ group that vocally opposes same-sex marriage, and has even joined a campaign against gay Boy Scouts of America leaders, in the name of their interpretation of the Bible. Quit blaming the media for presenting this President as a disgrace. Trump's record speaks for itself.
Not that long ago that Catholics had to cover their heads at mass (remember the ridiculous hanky thing?)! Most of the Muslim women I know do not cover their hair- let us not get crazy about this.
This article is McGinn's very shallow attempt at sucking up to Mrs. McGinn and evry women within his reach. He probably chants that foolish maxim "Happy wife, Happy life". Grow a pair for heaven's sake!
Sadly, your perfect God aborts thousands daily. Sadly, just tell a rape victim "to keep her legs closed". Since many in your con-camp don't agree with telling a woman she can't have an abortion if she was raped, that exception takes away any and all other arguments against a woman's right to choose.
What a !$@#% kind of man are you? The woman died and you're attempting a crude joke.
This is such BS. I fell for my woman specifically because she didn't use sex as a tool to manipulate me into a relationship, as a "gatekeeper". I don't respect that and wouldn't be with someone that behaved that way. This kind of thinking makes women feel like sluts (in a negative sense) for enjoying sex and sexual freedom, which they should not.  The driver here isn't access to sex, Margaret. You eluded to it in your article; men don't want to settle down until they feel they're financially stable, and the work environment has changed drastically, for better or worse. I wouldn't have been interested in marriage or kids until my career was established, and that now takes a long time. It's not because sex was cheap. This article is so damaging.
So you "believe" in trapping and forcibly sterilizing human beings?  That's called eugenics.  Hitler was fond of that.  But before you consider acting according to your "beliefs", try to get a hold of a 1994 movie called "Blood of the Condor"--it tells the true story of what happened to a bunch of Peace Corps idiots who sterilized Quechuan Indian women without their consent in Bolivia.  The women's husbands and fathers caught those Peace Corps idiots and TNR'd them with machetes.
No - but raping an unconscious woman behind a dumpster is rape and in this case there was no doubt - the rapist was caught in the act.
Nothing wrong with being a conservative woman, but I cannot agree with that 'most' men are jerks.  Those who have committed physical or mental abuse, and refuse to get help, and disregard anyone's needs except their own, definitely are.  Many will if not stopped, become murderers.  Now how can you prove your statement that alt-left women are loathsome? Has one been abusing you?
How many chiefs or band council members will have to step down or face any repercussions for protecting men they knew raped, murdered and beat women on reserves ? None. The IMMIW protects them too.
There still are a considerable number of conservatives who believe that a woman's place is barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen. This, therefore, is no surprise. They are backwards-looking losers. And that's exactly why Canadians chose a Liberal government.
This woman is an idiot looking for publicity.  Send miss Khan to the middle East where her husband can keep her in the house and unable to speak out loud
I thought that the orthodox position was that "the Sacrament of Matrimony is an exclusive life commitment between a man and woman". Now you tell me that is heresy.   Climate change deniers are not heretics. Idiocy is not the same as heresy.
The Clinton foundation gave out 10% globally! What about the other 90%? Oh yea they need really cool jets to go see their old friendly donor's in the middle east. Yeppers that would be the donor's who kill gays and commit atrocities against women that most people have no clue what is going on every minute of every day. If Americans were told by the media what was really going on with the Clinton Foundation Hillary would never be able to lie her way out.
"Eight years ago, when Barack Obama was elected, a lot of people weren’t happy but for the most part they moved forward to give the man a chance."  Donna, is this with the fact that hate groups in the U.S grew at an alarming rate after that election, in mind or without? And, is this with the meeting of top GOP'rs at the Caucus House Restaurant in D.C. to plot to obstruct the new (black) President at every turn, on Inauguration Day 2009, in mind or without?   I'm sorry that guy was a jerk to you, but do you not see a disconnect as a Christian in supporting someone who brags about grabbing women by their privates? This is not to mention every other demagogic, xenophobic, and otherwise horrible un-Christian things Trump said during the campaign, and continues to this day. Or are you one who just blames media i.e. kill the messenger and doesn't believe a word of it?    https://www.splcenter.org/   http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/03/The-Conspiracy-to-Commit-Legislative-Constipation
This is such a piece of sexist garbage.  So, the only thing that motivates men to do anything is sex?  That's the only reason that they educate themselves, learn manners, get a good job?  On top of that, women have to stop "giving away the milk" in order to make sure men civilize themselves.  Good god, what millennium are you living in, Ms. Wente?  Believe it or not, there are many, many other things that motivate men, including self-respect and a desire to do good in the world.
Truth! Millions of women didn't WANT more of Obamanism - which would have been all but guaranteed with Hillary as President. Eight years of divisiveness was enough... Trump is a breath of 'fresh air' even if he is Tweet happy! Obama was a rotten choice for President, elected ONLY for his color, Hillary was even a worse choice (if anything could be) who showed us how corrupt the DNC and Democrats ARE! Instead of PROTESTING, women and everyone else with a lick of common sense should be giving support - of course, Dems have a REAL problem NOT being their usual complaining selves...
I can assure you that millions of us did laugh, because we found the joke quite funny! It's not funny at all that our President talked about grabbing women's pussies, but the kitty-cat ears are the purrrrrrfect response.
Pride began fragmenting when the Dyke March allowed the females to have an event that specifically discriminated against  gay men.  It was further weakened by the removal of "Gay" from the name,  to be a generic  "Pride"   which simple worked to eliminate gay men from the identity of it.  TI was further damaged when the gay men of Toronto,were accused of being nothing better than racist KKK  hate monger  by BLM and NOBODY... NOT TORY>NOT THE MEDIA>  NOT KATHLEEN WYNNE > NOT KIRSTEN WONG TAM > NOT JUSTIN TRUDEAU came to our defense.  They all tacitly agreed that the white gay boys of Church St , who  started Gay Pride in 1981,  really  are a despicable bunch of curs because nobody dared refuted   BLM's accusations. .    Again and always the gays get thrown under the bus,  This is a boot stomp to the face of Toronto's gay population.
You sure you want to talk about "adults marching around"?  Women with stupid hats, 'protestors' blocking highways and damaging property, etc might come up.  And 'bullying"-LOL. Ask Betsy DeVos about the current bullying and lack of courtesy. Kathy Griffin might have something to say, too, about setting examples for our children.  The inappropriate behavior we are currently seeing has no political boundaries.
Yes, how dare folks hold women accountable for stupid actions and bigoted opinions!!
To Fred Jones ... What an absolutely ignorant statement. What do YOU know regarding the status of why and how she is raising her children? Probably NOTHING ... (that is the definition of "ignorance" ... not knowing). There can be many explanations why a single parent is a single parent. Yet you chose to write/hint in a way that suggests something is wrong. Your question/statement is a corollary of the question, "Fred, have you stopped beating your mother yet?"
Well, there still pussy grabbing, going after  married women, while married, groping women and walking unannounced unto teenage girls dressing rooms while they're naked. I could go on if you want me to.
Okay,  Help me understand.  A woman who has big bucks in a bank account and has a lucrative job is stuck in a abusive relationship for what reason?  Oh, it's not the money, it's fear, right?  From now on, I will discount all the media stories on financial dependence.  Regarding fear, how rich does one have to be to buy a semi-automatic 9 mm hand gun and get a CC permit?  Oh, I see, some are philosophically opposed to self protection.    I don't think for a second that you really care about women.  The actions and decisions required to actually improve relationships which include accountability are not PC and you would not even discuss much less consider or recommend them.  It feels better to bemoan the situation and evil men.  You yourself are pretty big.  Big men see the world much differently than small men.  Perhaps you are comfortable with the notion of big evil men because you are one.
No doubt. You must hate women as much as Hillary detested Bill's victims.
Why don't you just go to hel...  Venezuela.   You can't fix stupid and eating the rich has failed in every country it has been tried.  In a free society individual citizens can rise to the level of wealth you detest.  Your solution is to confiscate their wealth for the ruling party members.  Why is the daughter of Hugo Chavez the richest woman in Venezuela?  Is it because she created Microsoft, Google or Facebook?  No.  It is because her father lied to the poor and they gave him an army.  You should worry about your own mirror.
Christopher Columbus was a murderous monster. We still have slavery in the US, the FBI investigates it. Maybe you are unaware of it. Also, the sex trade in the US runs on enslavement of mostly young women, runaways. Many of those young women are dead, disposed of where no one is likely to find them. As far as I know, Aztecs and Maya no longer sacrifice humans. What we all long for is an environment in which people are secure from violence in their lives. Don't you agree?
No comments. Wow!! All those slimey producers, NBC, Bravo and the rest of the entertainment corporations are like turtles with their heads in a shell. The most important thing to them is bottom line. Well enjoy ''tis the season".  Watch your profits go red. My utmost respect to these women who were exploited, groped and raped by Weinstein at such a young age who finally came out as a group.
Speaking of 'IDIOTS' - how do you feel when you look in the mirror every morning. Obama was a moron, a total race baiting dimwit and likely you voted for him. Hillary was and still is a lying career criminal - you voted for her. REMEMBER - neither the DNC, Hillary or ANY other democrats disputed the information put forth by the hacker(s) whomever they are.. YOU still voted for her as did millions of other idiots. Women voted for Trump, lots of them, women with actual brains and the ability to realize there is something more than the corruption coveted by Democrats. These women and millions of other people believe there is more to life than handouts and welfare. If Trump provides even a little hope for the salvation of our country it's better than what we suffered through for 8 years and would have been continued with the likes of Killary... From what you told us - you are old enough to actually KNOW something, sad you didn't pay attention...
Hugh: Ali would have looked down on you, and not respected you, unless you yourself are black, heterosexual, married to a black woman, and a Muslim.   If you don't fall into that category, then you would have been a devil in his eyes.  When asked by a BBC reporter about his beliefs that black people should not associate with whites, he said this:  "There are white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?"  That is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.  The fact that his analogy for white people was that they are rattlesnakes says a lot.  What if a white person said that of blacks??
Seriously do you even know one person that eats sheep?  They are predated upon by trophy hunters, stupid men and women with something to prove by hanging somethings head with horns on their wall.  I have a dream that I can hang a few stupid people heads on my wall one day...there is a place where you can go that actually lets you hunt humans, and damn, that must be so, so satisfying if you can pony up the quarter million bucks ;-)
I don't care if he's young and stupid, being stupid when it comes to sex with minors is a felony. I know all you guys maybe understand and have some sympathy for this hopped up male but some things can't be excused. New world fellows, where any woman to your liking is not subject to your desires. Deal with it and keep it in your pants, please!
I am struck by the irony of illegals showing the same contempt for the rule of law that is the cause of their homelands being such a mess. I am amused by the presumption by their advocates that all the "Dreamers" plan to go to college and become scientists, doctors and lawyers. The truth is that the overwhelming majority will end up as unskilled labor. For every young woman who gets a four year degree there are ten who will be on their third pregnancy by the time they are 19. For every young man who earns an engineering degree there are a dozen who join gangs. What we can expect from these youth (ages up to 30) is shown in their demonstrations where they do not plead for a chance at a better life, but DEMAND some imagined right to invade this nation and live off the taxpayers generosity. They and their advocates militant approach is not winning a lot of support. I agree with those who say that letting this generation stay ensures another wave of invaders.
so men are all the same - is that your point?  I knew this woman who was really b*thchy every month ... should I judge all women in the same way?
Another fine Democrat in the anti-Trump movie industry making headlines of raping women. I guess the latest craze is for Democrats to rape, molest, abuse shame, etc as many women as possible. Must be a new Democrat trend that started with Bill Clinton. hahaha
Yet to see the headline, "Kangaroo rapes woman!"
It may have been a factor but I would say a miniscule one.    The woman did little to enhance her own credibility, and I still maintain that the ascendance of Trump was more due to disgust with the status quo than support for his inane rhetoric and ill thought policy statements.  Clinton was the embodiment of the status quo and therefore rendered herself all but unelectable.  Had she chosen to clearly demonstrate a commitment to real change, things might have been different.  And if the Dems had supported Sanders instead of throwing him under a bus, they almost certainly would have been.  To blame the election loss on her combination of chromosomes is to be a sore loser.
Stupid owner. Poor dog that belongs to her... "Atta girl!!" to the woman who broke the window.
I attended every Pride from 1981 on the lawn at Hart House to last year's fiasco. .  I have had great times and seen it grow from a little gathering on a lawn to the extravaganza it now is. But i always feared the destruction of Pride was inevitable when a bunch  of angry dykes threatened to kick my teeth in for  showing little pencil sketch of a female nude at  a display of art at Hart House. The creation of the Dyke March, that segregated gay men out to benefit the lesbians was a slice of the pie  too big.  Even the change of the name from GAY Pride to merely Pride was to dilute the contribution of  the men.  What started as a celebration of gay or LGBT unity has become a power struggle where the gay men of Toronto are now classified as racist hate filled bastards who must be cast out.   Yet, we are still expected to pay for it.
Now that's funny!    Recall Charasma?  Not removed merely because he is homosexual, but because he made a PUBLIC spectacle of his well-coordinated, well-supported announcement with his boyfriend by his side with the claim he is to be married.  If a straight priest did that with a female, he, too, would have been removed.  Apologize for his dismissal?  He broke his vows - apparently after being warned - and announced his intent to marry.  Of course he had to be dismissed.   Why do you attempt to equate his actions with Fr. Martin?
You're saying your god doesn't believe in abortion? Really? Read the old testament. He orders his minions to kill every man, woman (including pregnant ones) and child (except for the virgin girls!) so many times. He's a psycho. He made homosexuality because to christians he made us all.  In the new testament Jesus does not follow the old rules. Remember an eye for an eye? He changed it to turn the other cheek. Jews stoned people but Jesus didn't. He actually stopped a stoning. Telling them those without sin can continue to stone her.  I'd suggest you read how the bible was put together and when. I did that after Prevo start thumping his bible to keep gay discrimination going. I keep meaning to thank him for helping me become an athiest.
Is it me or are female politicians just the worst!?
What an absolute hypocrite you are being here Ousider77.  You are always passing judgement on the criminal justice system here on the RG website:  criticizing the police, prosecutors, and the courts regarding many local criminal cases.    You also frequently defend people accused of sex crimes, even in some cases where they have confessed, and now you are defending a filthy, dirty, cold blooded murderer??   That is simply outrageous behavior by you.  Your values sure to seem to be backasswards to me.  Raping women and children is EVIL.   Murdering people is EVIL.   Those who commit such vile sins will be damned by God himself, and will suffer for all eternity, consumed in the fires of hell.     I say this:  May God damn the person that killed this woman to scream in agony till the end of time.  That person deserves a punishment far worse than anything that JadedJade can possibly imagine doing to him here on earth.
I'd make this fantastic woman president tomorrow. Or Lindiwe Sisulu for that matter.  And when she says "They said they are going ahead with charging me, irrespective of the fact that they are illegitimate" all I would add is that yes, that's true they are a total bunch of useless b*stards.....
Right...keep telling yourself that while barbarians kill kids and women. You're the problem
You must feel empowered to be a female lapdog.
Turn into sexual harassment?  What a daft allegation, and a complete evasion of the point under discussion.  I will continue to wallow in beauty, and leave the defense of people like Berkeley rioters to you.  BTW:  Most of the people I represent are poor women.  I am immune to your tactic of falsely accusing me of sexual harassment.
That's laughable. It's always anything but her horrible persona. Just a reminder: "We came, we saw, he died.." (accompanied by a giggle) on the eve of angry mob lynching Qaddafi. That's who this woman is. If hating her guts is misogyny, then it's perfectly justified (in this particular case).
BS! Still beating up on Hillary while the goon in the WH sucks democracy down to the lowest rung? Abuses women? Lies constantly? He's a grifter, rips off contractors, and embarrasses the US with grunting ignorance. And you adore him...geeze.
so funny...yea, I'm a male nurse, took all the jokes about if I were gay, was the last time those individuals joked me about anything. I tell ya, I know a few RN's who are ex SEALS who would love to hear you joke them if they are gay.  People need to grow up.  Nurse are both male and female and both have some gays just like in any other profession.  But hey...just keep right on joking us male nurse...till you meet one of us who will very kindly show you the path to....
The "insane" Electoral College kept a mad woman out of the Oval Office.
He thinks we should spend STATE MONEY investigating his bizarre little fantasies, to DECIDE if women in villages are worthy of healthcare of not? I guess he didn't want to be in office after all! Way to double-down on being an illogical bigot.  We don't have cash to 'investigate' whether or not human women should have access to healthcare. What a load of trash.
This woman just keeps embarrassing herself with her ignorant rants...
Simple. Because good women are hard to find and bellow average women not only have a bad habit of seeing themselves as above average, they have a bad habit of seeing themselves as above top 10%, and women in general have a bad habit of seeing any male bellow top 20% as bellow average.  One good way to point out the idea. No one would call an out a charismatic of shape rich ugly man with a bullshit job and a few bullshit degrees top notch in the dating market, regardless of how many languages he speaks fluently. But you folks have been calling a, anti-social snob upper middle class woman in her 30s who looks well past middle-age, which a bunch of social studies degree's and sorta speaks three language the cream of the crop even if she can't even lift half her weight and thinks that a baby/child is heavy. Women which just flipping the description ends up with a guy that has to resort to prostitutes which hate him for being so pathetic.
Raised, Val and Shosno,  Post your photos and let's see what you look like. Insulting someone's looks makes you a jerk, and yes, it is being mean to say that. What an asshat comment to make (and like). You got the stones to talk crap about someone's looks but you clearly DON'T have the stones to post your pictures, much less pictures of you doing anything.   Chris, you have a daughter, how would you feel about something derogatory things about how she looks? Because people can dish that same medicine to you. Karma is a b#^%*. When someone talks like that to your daughter and she is upset and her feelings are hurt remember this moment. As a man, you should lead by example how men treat should treat women. Post a picture of your kids and let's see what other bullies have to say about them. But you won't so I'm over this conversation, Karma comes around ...  Keep being jerks. Congratulate yourself on being bullies.
Now that Trump is our President, it means we can slam liberals up side the head with baseball bats and grab women anytime we want, because that's how he rolls and we get to do the same thing now as his supporters and loyal followers of Donald J. Trump, our new Fuhrer!
"I am sooooooo tired of the feminization of men in this society "  Your masculine anxiety is showing - just so you know.
And also woman, if you think porn is better than sex you like porn more than most guys. Porn isn't a substitute for sex, men and women have masturbated since ever using their imagination just fine. Women have dildos since before history and puritan women bemoaned it because it "gave the appearance that women want sex just as much as men want" just like nowdays feminists and past day as well bemoan them because it gives the appearance that women like dick just as much as men like pussy. Here's a secret, both are true. Isolated women will turn prison gay way quickier than men. And if you put a man and a woman that hate despise and are disgusted with each other to their guts she'll try to fuck him way before he even considers it. If you put two straight women in that situation they will turn prison gay way quicker than the guy in that scenario to consider fucking the woman he despises. (I'm saying this first hand)  Solution? Accept the current state and revel in it.
whiny parents make me vomit in my mouth . Get a life , and let your kids grow up with out you in their hair . Sports is bad enough , with all the , johnny my special child should be pitching , or at least play first base . though I must say the woman running P.P.S. is way overpaid and hasn't done  s&*t
He has an insane amount of accounts and is anti-woman, anti-canadian and anti-logic. He's really insane.
"Few care about others gender issues"  Outsider:  You know better than that.  Why do you think getting equal rights for women is such an issue?  Why do you think the ERA hasn't passed?  Why do you think it has been so difficult to fight discrimination against homosexuals? Who do you think several states would still outlaw same-sex marriage if they could "get by" with it? ........ "That's not what this is about. "  Don't be silly, that's exactly what this is about.  Transgendered individuals are the new "target of opportunity" and will be subjected to every possible indignity some folks can provide.  You can support such treatment.  I will oppose it................  "Special demands"......yes, like the special demand to not be ridiculed and marginalized... Is that asking for too much?   Gary Crum
Unless we are talking rape or incest or some other illegal act against her, all a woman has to do is hold that birth control pill between both knees.
Tolerate a little pat?   Women want to be. ... ?  Not have every right to be treated equally.   I hope that is a joke, but I fear it is not.   I hope you aren't poisoning young minds with this garbage.     Time to start walking upright!
No doubt a women who has an abortion chooses it! Obviously!  The women is not the point.  The child she murders is the point.
Why not simply refuse a permit to this ridiculous group? What other group has parades to celebrate their sexual preferences? A bunch of low intellect guys and women in g strings is a waste of road space. I have little if any concern about what people do in their bedrooms (or their local parks) but until they have a heterosexual parade or a celibacy parade or a freaky fetish parade this one will be ignored. Wait until these BLM fools who are  now controlling the parade actually need a cop......let them do without.
Women used to be treated like muslims covered in hijabs for the longest time. If you wore something that showed some knee then youd be considered a whore. I guess people dont readily remember womens suffrage.
I'm with the Nasty Woman and the Bad Hombres.
Women who voted for Trump are misogynists too!
You can't be a TV news lady unless you look like a porn star. I'm not saying a beautiful woman can't be a great reporter, I'm just pointing that the average looking women don't get a chance. Americans need to quit watching TV news. It's making us stupid.
Beyond shameful! The only true democracy in the region that respects the rights of women while we flood our country with racist Muslim trash! Obummer shows his true lame duck colours, and meaningless weak kneed double term, outside blind siding Canada on keystone and blabbering his carbon bs with our own local 'little potato'. Sad day for democracies everywhere when the likes of any of the mid- east trash Arab states and their medieval human rights record is worth anything on the world stage!
And everyone else we catch sexting, even womem in positions of power in academic institutions, women who use sexts to catch men who they think will advance their careers!
That's unfortunate, Mr. McCrea, because God blessed you with the gift of being able to unite with the female of our species and create new life, and you're wasting it on recreational use of your sex organs with some guy.
Then why aren’t Muslim men wearing this religious symbol instead of only submissive Muslim women ?
"We think of all women as compassionate , when in reality—they are the mass killers we should fear the most"  So you worry most about the attack of the killer vagina?
Most likely they were land whale, cat lady feminist nurses who's only options for getting laid are with desperate beta cucks who don't have any standards.
This is COLLEGE age women?  Look at that blackboard. It looks more like something in Middle School! Ohhh...the poor lil snowflakes! Their professors and advisors have convinced the college age women and the Minorities that "If you are on a college campus...You are in danger!" This is happening all over the country. How many sexual assaults have been committed on the UO campus lately? Are these serious attacks? or a slap on the butt? Unacceptable, to be sure. but a serious crime? "Whatever we wear, wherever we go, yes means yes, and no means no.” Wow. Is this advice for 13 year old girls?  Translation: "I have the right to dress revealingly and be out @ 2:15 AM and if YOU , "Mr. Man" interpret my actions as a sexual come on...THAT is your problem.  BUT, I reserve the Right to have consensual sex with you ...BUT, if I later regret my choice, I can report it as a rape or sexual assault."  NO wonder more and more young men are going "MGTOW" !
I guess the centuries of female transgressions do not exist... for Denise, its ... what are you talking about?   straight white men are the evil ones....  women are without fault in this. When progressives operate, its whatever convenient lies will work. Take the Muslim student council female who made hateful remarks about white people. Now the progressive professors and students are claiming that when Dalhousie intends to hold her accountable that free speech is threatened. What a laugh... if a white person had said those same things about blacks, asians, muslims, native indians, GLBTQ people.... there would be a human rights trial and firing, dismissal, shaming and new stricter rules and laws. LYING HYPOCRITES... all of the progressives. Hateful and racist themselves.
motley:  Yes, she was thinking about John and what a incredible ORGASM  she had last night.    motley:   I  have a neighbor who is a young typically aggressive  female in her late 20's.  She has told me numerous times that on her way to work in the mornings,  while driving,    she uses her Vibrator.  She also said many of her female friends do the same thing.  Uhhhhhhhhh, I told her I did not think that was a wise choice, and she just laughs at me.  Gives a whole  new meaning to Ring Tones??????
A conventional choice? Sure, if you, like Mitt Romney, walk around saying ridiculous, not-intuitive things like "corporations are people, my friend!" Or, if you are hostile to the rights of women, he's a conventional choice. If you are someone who would almost always side not with a worker, but with the employer, then yes, as conventional as the day is long. Mr. Hobby Lobby supports alternative laws for Christians, and that won't fly.  Neil Gorsuch is no friend to the average person, women, or workers in America, and he makes lots of noise about how judges should interpret the law and not inject their own beliefs into established law. This stupid notion among some Democrats that they should save their ammo and political capitol for a REALLY BAD SCOTUS nominee is just that-stupid!   President Obama took great care to nominate a Justice in Merrick Garland who wasn't a bomb thrower, one who could be acceptable to a wide swath of citizens, and look what he got for it.   RESIST TRUMP.
Are you Catholic?  It seems to me a bit ridiculous to assume that most people's problems with Hillary have to do with her being a "woman".  It is far more likely that others have the same problems I do:  Lying, deceit, criminal activity, indifference, self-serving behaviors.  She supports KILLING BABIES.  That is a major disqualifier for Catholics, of much greater importance than her position on the environment or immigration.  She lied to congress.   She tampered with evidence.  She made back room deals, not to pass a political agenda but to commit crimes.  She left Americans to die in foreign countries.  She stole money with her so-called "charitable foundation".  She is everything bad and evil -- unethical politicians all wrapped up into one.  She is blatantly anti-catholic.  Anyone who supports her necessarily supports her behaviors and activities.  I would much rather support someone with a history of stupid locker room talk than someone with evil criminal/murderous intent.
Isabella Fajardo - I don't care who you have sex with - not my business.  But if you have something hanging between your legs, you are a MAN and do not go in the Ladies room.  No ifs, ands, or buts.  Get over it.
White working-class Sanders voters became white working-class Trump voters. They preferred a fascist over a woman--they are reactionaries (and likely racists) and belong with Trump and the Republican party. Friends of fascists are fascists. If you vote for a racist, whether or not you espouse racism personally--you're still a racist. You cannot vote for Trump and not qualify as a racist.  Sanders cross-over voters are deplorables just like the rest.  They voted for the Rapopotus and endorsed his virulent racism by voting for him.
Another hit piece from the resident Jew defending a self-proclaimed "victim" of revelations of abberrant human behavior of a religious fanatic feeding at the government trough while dedicated to the destruction of the same.  Dredging up the Clinton's as the latest sinners unworthy of association with the pure, white, holy, christian Trumps, Pences, and all the rest of the immoral, evil Republicans refusing to eat with women, but more than willing to assault their crotches.  Goldberg is pure evil in concert with the current nazi, Bannon, infesting the governing system and despoiling the national discourse with vile invective from a modern Judas wallowing in wealth within a traitorous, misnamed "think tank" devoted to the overthrow of all freedom and democracy wherever it may be found.
NOBODY was the right to tell you what to do with your body! | That is the FUN-damental  right and freedom of all humans. | Not the government, society, your friends, your family, your wife or husband. | Women won the right to abortion years ago, they won the right not a be a mother; A sex object. Men are still fighting for the right not be objects of production. Mostly it is men who use drugs, men who are expected to work. That is the sin. That is why men in Canada live 10 years less then women, they are expected to be human machines and not complain. |
Carmen Gutierrez is a gold digger and nothing more.  Don't be fooled like my father was, Rod Bradley.  Carmen was having an affair with a married man while my father was dying.  She then proceeded to attempt to cheat my sister and I out of our inheritance.  This woman is trash and I will never forgive Rod for his poor judgement in character time and again.
Where was the compassion part? Where was the liberal part? None of your responses so far are laughy-faces, do you suppose they are ashamed to laugh? Do you think that Harvey Weinstein's forced sex is in any way funny, compassionate, or liberal? If you do (which I sincerely hope you don't) then you are one sick, twisted, pathetic loser. Did you vote for Trump because he violates women? Is that Trump's secret recipe for his popularity among the poorly educated?
You left out the part where he said. If abortion is illegal then the woman should be punished.
Yes, it's perfectly normal talking about how you activley tried to get with a married woman like its no big deal and that you can just "grab [women] in their pussy" if you feel like it. Is that truly how you feel? I guess that's why people like you have been labeled deplorable. Go back to your trumpsterfire.
Trump was ATTACKed by the father at the convention.  His son was killed in a war Hillary supported.  Good for Trump for not backing down - Muslum women aren't allowed to speak.  Where is the press's curiosity over Benghazi and the 4 dead Americans Hillary is DIRECTLY responsible for!  Go Trump, take out the PC press
"Since the incident, Daulatzai has received hate mail and violent threats"  Well, even if she wasn't treated poorly by the airline for being a woman, Muslim and having brown skin, she's sure been treated poorly for them now.  Way to go America!  You cringe at nothing.
How does thew Globe let this lady write for them. She should be on CNN. Listen up Reznetti it was either a mad man or a felon. The USA went with the mad man.
this woman is the queen of lies. fact
This woman is sick and needs to get some serious help.  I doubt that jail will provide any of that help and may worsen the problem.
Roughing up or women beating is not a criminal offense as far as the police in this country are concerned.
tRumpity Dumpity turned his bigot/racists rants against women and anyone with brown skin into a bed of hot politically incorrect comments.  That's why tRumpity Dumpity is hiding behind Twitter.  He's scared of the mainstream media.  I can hear is knobby knees clicking.
"Trump’s opponents can emasculate him by bringing him down to size, and picturing him as gay, tiny, feminine and childlike."  So according to her analysis, those who use this technique (and we have our share of those on CC) are in fact encouraging homophobia.    I'm not sure I see the homophobic connection, just the intent to denigrate through any means available by the true Trump-haters.
Are you calling me a Nasty Woman? Ha!
Did you read the article where the Kremlin confirms Trump and his campaign were in contact with the Russians before and during the election process. Of course, Trump and his lying bunch of sycophants  have denied that what they were doing.  That's in addition to talking about grabbing women by their pussies, walking in on 15 year-old girls while they're naked, bragging about "working like a bitch" to try and get a married woman in the sack while he was npnarried and so, so much more.  Yes, he's a great role model.
Peter, yes I am saying they bred their slaves like cattle. It was cheaper and more fun than buying adult slaves with skills. If you read the memoirs of Mary Chestnut, you will read her comments about how she and her girl friends resented the fact that so many of their slaves looked like their husbands. She was cited in Ken Burns documentary, The Civil War. Most white folks don't want to know this. Most blacks with English surnames are descendants of slave owners. That is how they got those names. Slave owners didn't consider themselves to be racists or rapists. They considered themselves just capitalists. So much for Christian morality. Raping black women was also common practice throughout the Jim Crow days. Black families sent their daughters to school more than their sons because their daughters would be less likely to be raped as a condition of employment if they were teachers, or nurses. Remember Strom Thruman's black love child?
Don't worry, not one cent of your tax dollars will end up in the hands of women or gay men.... unless they are called "President", "Minister" or "General"
Another sicko. When a man chooses to hit a woman he is no longer a man.
Nothing new here.  Sex has always been a form of currency.  Margaret wants a return to the days of hours of begging.  It's not going to happen.  It's a little more complicated than the few variables she presented in the column.  For instance, young men have watched their hard working, faithful fathers get trampled by the patriarchal legal system when their mothers are "not happy" and go off to find themselves.  Women are now the initiators of divorce.  Young men will have none of this destruction.  Porn ?  Absolutely, just wait for the life-like sex dolls.  The Pandora's box is wide open.
People aren't mad because he had a "potty mouth."  They're mad because he said he could grab women without permissions because he's rich.
Ignorance rears its' flat head.  The home-schooled or anti-science loons are given the same respect and deference as is given an expert on the subject.  It is a republican thing - Sarah Palin being the pin up girl for the "my ignorant opinion is as valid as an expert's opinion" philosophy of the world today.
A real p.o.s,if there ever was. Did 100,000 American foreclosures, uglier than sin and gets a hot looking Material Girl. I wonder how he did it, knowing the suicides upon losing one"s home. Shameless.
my young child pointed to a woman and teased, “You’re fat!” ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Fat woman: "I can lose weight. You, on the other hand, will always be ugly."
I thought the march was in support of women's rights?  Suggest you don't disrespect their goals through mission creep.  Typical white male, trying to take over to suit his own agenda.
Glenn you are one nasty, misogynistic individual.  Why does it upset you so that an intelligent young woman has a successful career?
Is that you, Aaron?  Raping women, getting away with it, then laughing at them and in the face of the mysoginisyic "criminal" justice system.  Sounds like the psychopath I encountered.
The author appears to be married to a white guy based on her last name. Maybe she is a self hater like all those other oriental women who lust after white men.
Well he is a bit of a pussy cat, so he may want to use a female facility
As a female, I think you're too dumb to vote.  Get back in the kitchen before you hurt someone.
These protests where not about hate. They were about outrage with a man who brags about sexually abusing women - "grabbing their pussies" without any permission being president. It's disgusting to most of us. Not about hate, about truth of who this animal called president is.
humanrights: his remark is beyond foolish. young girl fighting back may have saved her life this afternoon. thank you for your post.
Regardless, there is not valid reason but sexism as to why that priest need not be female.
It's OK a black man call you a white trash,  but if you say they are black, you get arrested for being a racist.  They pretend to brush it aside when ISIS killed innocent people and they are OK to let Muslim women wear Burqa on our streets but you wear a Great America hat, you are fired. They don't respect democratic vote and pretend to embrace in democracy.  Fck all these liberals idiots, they will turn your kids into Muslims one day.
No wonder he had to move to a third world country.   Those mental gymnastics to justify his corrupt and criminal behavior are just unbelievable.    Somehow a white guy exploiting Thai culture (and their women) is traditional?
Changing the subject from your apparent disapproval of jail, particularly for crimes against women,  will not work.    I view one value of jail for the sexual abuse slime balls is its ability to prevent them from abusing other victims.
The author quotes a professor who states  "police reluctance to work with feminist legal groups mirrors a sentiment common to employees of any company.'   Several years ago, I attended a complaint of sexual assault where a woman called to report she had been sexually assaulted at a party.  When I got to her home, she was accompanied by a local Rape Relief representative.  As I spoke to the woman, I was continually interrupted by the Rape Relief rep, to the extent that I asked her to leave the room.  It turned out that the sex was consensual, and that the woman was actually intent on a guilt/revenge thing.  What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said "look what happened to me," and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!!   I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.  She never did.
You must not have any idea what the ADA is. You really should read up on it. And try to be more respectful to our men and women in uniform you ungrateful leech.
For all of you who haven't been on the Alaskan Highway coming out of Canada and went to Delta, there is already a HUGE HIGHWAY SIGN that honors these men who built the highway. so much for knowledge and picking to piece what he says. David Eastman is the only one in Juneau besides the rest of the minority who works against anything anyone says that is correct honest and truth. Those who can't handle honest are on her complaining. DO YOUR RESEARCH before you run your mouths. Guess none of you are aware of  this procedure preformed on young women. Why wouldn't someone want to stop the practce here in Alaska. Anyone who disagrees with mutitation of women and abortion is wrong. Disfiguring women and killing children is not cool and I stand with Representative Eastman on these things as a women. You men know nothing. And this reporter must be paid by the thieves in the Governors office and the so called lawmakers, and senate. They are all corrupt
He certainly has the look of a SLICK WILLY.     His look is typical of a high percentage of young males  the last 3+ decades that want to  look like a woman,  act feminine, wear makeup, earrings,   etc.  I do NOT understand why these young women are attracted to these types of Wanna be Males?   What ever happened to males being males?     Our daughter was NEVER interested in these types of wanna be males, Thank Goodness.  Males that acted feminine, wore makeup, wore earrings etc.,  would get a response of from her of, EEEEEEWWWWWWWWW.  Had this guy shown up, I would have talked to his parents and him as well.  The message is, STAY AWAY.    Our daughter  preferred smart, down to earth males that behaved and showed male masculinity.  She is engaged to be married to a Oregon State Police Trooper.    Mr. Giughiano definitely has a SKUNK in his WoodPile.....................
oh for crying out loud. all the money spent on sex ed and this is what we get? born with a penis=male, vagina=female. in your dna. and don't run the 'mixed genitalia at birth nonsense'. does not apply.
Hill-larious was Slick Willies Madam!  I guess she had a hand in procuring some the  women for the sad sick slickster. I believe she is gay.
"Pam Knowles, the third woman, on the board had felt similarly too" Pam is so hypocritical. She conventionally forgets how she marginalized Director Buels and anyone else who tried to bring up issues or concerns that were not part of her agenda.
8 years ago the country was ready to consider and elect a black man as President...we just collectively made a bad choice and elected the wrong Black man....The country is again ready for change and consideration of electing a woman as president....like the black man 8 years ago the media is squarely behind the woman now....even though serious wrong doing attends the candidates....They seem willing to do anything to help cover up those crimes...Obama has certainly been the greatest disrespecter of the law in our history until Hillary came along...and took this disrespect to a new low with Obama's help..!!!  for all American voters, and especially Alaskan voters the Obama/Clinton crime families must be sent packing in November 2016...Trump is the only choice for all freedom loving Americans....especially Alaskans...
Yup. Sort of like Razzamatazz referring to that woman-beater as a "dog". Bit rough referencing one of the most loving creatures to define such a low-life!!
You sure don't pay close attention to stories.  This was a big lib who was doing this.  And he's just the top o' the iceberg out there in lib land.  Full of liberal women who talk about being for liberal causes up until the point that it hurts their career and then they clam up.  This is a real tough one for all the little libs out there in the world who are having their hypocrisy brought into full view.  Odumma, Hillbilly, Glen Close, Judi Dench, Ben Afleck, Matt Damon, .... the entire "hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil" bunch.  All exposed by another liberal who had the sack to actually dig into this and print it, Ronan Farrow.  And it's even more laughable that the liberal news channel, NBC, employer of Ronan Farrow, refused to put the story on air.  Seeing Rachel Madcow interview him on MSNBHEEHAW was like seeing a Nazi run newspaper interview a Nazi General who was spewing bad things about Hitler.
It is difficult to believe how many neoliberal journalists on CBC and Globe and Mail are so fully behind the rampant misandry and outrage against all males. Why any males still working in these media any longer is a mystery. Men are so unwelcome and so easily branded as misogynists?  Feminists are becoming toxic, except the mature ones like Margaret Wente. Women are in psychological warfare with men now, and men are the modern doormats (remember that expression from bygone feminist days?). Men are becoming adjuncts to current society, unnecessary in the workforce, and unnecessary at home. More's the pity for our sons. Balkissoon's article is quite silly and insulting.
Fire the woman yourself by cutting the cord.
What a great opportunity for a local girl to be molested by our SprayONBack Gorilla of a president. Perhaps Trump will GRAB HER BY THE PUSSY! J.k. Congradulations Mrs Waldron. Please use this platform to adress real issues :). I wish you luck, and stay away from the oval office!
Those who commit sexual assault (against children or women - or even men) may not receive as much disapproval or punishment in some other nations.  But they are pretty close to pond scum no matter where they commit it.
The problem with your argument, like those of this professor, is that they assume that all whites hold their positions only because of privilege, and that none of them actually earned or deserved anything that they have. Her comments like "by keeping your job and your other unearned privileges..." and "...you are the problem. Your very presence", are inherently racist and sexist, promoting the idea that white men are inherently undeserving simply by dint of their race and gender, and can never possibly deserve their positions, no matter their individual merit. It's clear from her rants that she favors only people exactly like her (she specifies giving up their positions in favor of minority women, not just minorities or women, because if you're a white woman or a black man, you still need to go to the back of the bus to give her your seat). As a non-white in academia, I simply don't see this as true. It's blatantly bigoted. If she's not getting ahead, she likely hasn't earned it.
I guess if your IQ is about 65,you rule the world (see:Trump,Donald),and that includes the music industry.I couldn't care less about Taylor Swift (except that she shares her birthday,Dec.13,with Ferguson Jenkins,who happens to be my cousin),but I believe she's a bigoted,though (sort of)talented airhead who uses token women of colour in her "squad" to advance her brand and deflect likely well-deserved charges of prejudice. (I couldn't image her EVER having a black,Asian or First Nations boyfriend.She's essentially the Tammy Wynette of this generation.)
Believe that most of the over-the-top vitriolic reactions witnessed here can be explained by three main factors.  Bluenoser... Muslim... Female... in that order.  Keep giving em hell, Ms. Kahn !  #Hatersgonnahate
See.....you are not being "rational and compassionate" - or factual.  I am NOT a "holier than thou" one-issue obsessed Catholic,' nor am I the one being a bully.  I have NEVER demonized "pathetic women" in fact, I work with them and listen to them.  Nor am I using "nasty inflammatory language" - nor is it I who now look like a "sadistic sexist, insecure, schoolyard" bully.  Did you read YOUR comment?
So angry that they've chosen a woman as crooked as a moose's hind leg who's married to the biggest womanizer in America since the Kennedy brothers.  The Harvard professor will be voting for her while holding his nose like all other liberals who ignore logic and evidence.
So, Globe and Mail, when Trump crowds were chanting "Lock her up" about Ms. Clinton, it was "misogynistic", was it? It was a hatred of women behind that, by hateful haters who hate women?  What utter nonsense.  Look, I was 100 percent against Trump and 100 percent in support of Clinton in all my posts...  .... but this throwing around of the term "misogynistic" has got to stop. You might as well call the chanters a bunch of puppy torturing mass-murdering sibling rapists. It is that silly, the use of "misogynistic".  There is nothing misogynistic about chanting to lock up, in jail, a person you feel to be guilty of crimes. You might as well claim it is misandrist to chant for the locking of of Bush and Cheney for war crimes.
Billy boy never served, he was to busy harassing women.   Killery never served.  Obummer never served although he is friends with a home grown terrorist named Bill Ayers so maybe that counts enough for him. Oh and his buddy the Reverend Wright.  What a group of hypocrites
Women need to learn the old proverb that "the only good scumbag rapist is a dead scumbag rapist" and carry with a permit.
I would ask these questions of Catholic of fundamentalist Christians.  But there is one big difference between these two religions and Islam.  Islam actively promotes misogyny and homophobia.  Women in Saudi Arabia are treated as second class citizens, having to cover themselves, not being allowed to drive, etc.  And gays are being thrown off buildings because they are homosexual.  I mean, by God, this is 2017.    So there is a difference in having a different view (I cannot condone the homosexual lifestyle so I am not going to bake you a cake) versus violence toward that person (yeah, I will bake you a cake, with something nasty inside it).  Christianity doesn't throw gays off buildings or force women to cover themselves head to toe.  For the record, I am gay, so this issue is important.  And for the record, I am deeply sorry that someone would shout out things to people would appear to be very nice folks!
Then after the woman that Newtie was cheating with tried him out as a husband and is now divorcing him.  Even Newties money can't keep a warm body in his  bed.
Yes she mentioned white people as whites were the people who voted for him.  What other racial group voted for him?  I am not aware of any sizable minority that voted for him.  Maybe Russians?  The fact is the people who voted for him were not intelligent.  They were influenced by imaginary fears created by the Donald such as Mexicans are swarming over the border to take your job. or Muslims are going to rape your women.  Pathetic.
I'm hoping he meant that men wouldn't mind getting grabbed in the crotch. But even that is naive. If the female equivalent of Trump strode into a lacrosse team locker room, as the teen boys playfully snapped towels at each other, and randomly grabbed a crotch, the dream of easy sexual activity would seem more nightmarish.
HE has completely ruined HIS life. happy jail days. what a slob. what a lesson to women to be wary.
Its this type of trash being published by main stream media that creates divisiveness.   "Femininity is too emotional, Women don't have to be"    When did man hating become acceptable?  Is that how women achieve equality?
Totally disgusting, is the example of what happened to the woman in  Texas.  Extremism, spawned from and supported by religious superstition, is alive and well in America. Especially in states like Texas.
"A former first lady and a businessman with no prior public service are far from a normal matchup."  What the heck is that is Supposed to mean?  A women who tag up with a rapist  is more qualified than a citizen candidate.  I always knew Oregon is not part of reality.  But this editorial takes the cake. It's third-grade and  simplistic.
Earlier this year Islamophobia saved Notre Dame in Paris from being blown up by a car bomb driven by 3 Muslim women in burqas.  People thought it very odd that three women in black drapery covering their faces were driving erratically around the cathedral looking for a parking spot. The car was filled with  propane gas canisters and would have collapsed a good portion of the 1000 year old monument.  There have been 3 such attempts by Muslims to destroy the cathedral in 2 years.  To more and more people in Europe and North America now, Islamophobia is just common sense.
This statement wouldn't be out of place here:   "Feminists have always enraged me. They want to keep the advantages of women (e.g. cheaper insurance, extended maternity leave preceded by a preventative leave, etc.) while seizing for themselves those of men.  Thus it is an obvious truth that if the Olympic Games removed the Men-Women distinction, there would be Women only in the graceful events. So the feminists are not fighting to remove that barrier. They are so opportunistic they don't neglect to profit from the knowledge accumulated by men through the ages. They always try to misrepresent them every time they can."  ~ [translated]
Oh my boys and girls she has scolded us. It is called free speech you bitch, if that is the way they feel then too bad. You are as equally offensive to 95% of us as they were to you. Get over it, better yet get off this planet we are done with you.
It's always risky to tie in with "it's happenin', baby."  Not that advertising did a lot of that "back in the day."  No, at the time (anytime after, say, 1920) Mad Ave., was showing women REALLY knew much more than men in domestic areas, like cooking, cleaning, washing laundry and toilets.  Come to think of it, still are!  Who's protesting THAT?  "Pussy hat" feminists don't think this is somewhat "insidious"?   Hmm, men aren't protesting these demeaning, insulting ads that portray them home-front ignoramuses, either.  Good call.  Why protest THAT kind of gender stereotyping?  Women wanna own housekeeping?  A-OK, I saw (to thunderous masculine applause.)    Simplicity is often best.  Saw a great ad last night for a certain arthritis pill.  Senior, guy ravaged by time (just like the market!)  sez two things:  "Remember the name"  (Repeats name, breaks it down into its parts, over big name logo visuals.  "This is the box."  Big close-up of blue box with name.  That was it. Beauty.
Go back to raping young boys McElroy and stay out of American politics you fat pedophile pig  The Catholic Church has become a joke  The socialist communist pope preaching to Trump to take more Muslim murderous refugees and ms 13 drug dealing child rapists DUI sucking American taxpayers dry  While IGNORING THE MASS GENOCIDE OF COPTIC CHRISTIANS AND GAYS AND WOMEN THROUGHOUT ARAB WORLD WHILE SWEEPING THE PEDOPHILE CRIMES OF PRIEST LIKE MCELROY UNDER THE CARPET FU CATHOLIC CHURCH BTW IM CATHOLIC BUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS BECOMING A COMMUNIST VIOLENT ORGANIZATION
What was your response to Trump admitting grabbing and groping women's genitals? Were you outraged also? Not putting Polanski in a good light for his deeds, but listening to Trump and the Bush talking trash talk about women that could easily be a sister or daughter in Anywhere, USA was and is disgusting.
Funny how everyone wants to come to White nations though isn't it! I mean Mexico for Mexicans, India for Indians, China for Chinese, Japan for Japanese, ME for Arabs but White Nations for everyone?? Your anti white hatred shows? Why come here if you don't like music, pork, beer seeing women dressed normal, dogs? There is lots of room in the ME for you.  Oh I know why they come here, it's for the welfare!  I do miss the old days of European migrants who worked their butts off and made this country great! Built this country, defended this country against that dictator you seem to associate us with.  You are anti white, please leave you aren't good enough for Canadian values, why don't we let smart hardworking Latino's or Asians in ?
What a bunch of whiners,  these women do not represent me! They'd be better off to put their big girl panties on instead of a hat!
That poor woman is mentally deranged.....
Sexist trash.  Really?...woman are not tough?  It's for you on the phone.  The 1950s are calling and they want their attitudes back.
I cringe deeply every time I see her face, or hear her voice, or read her name.  The damage and destruction this patronizing, law-breaking, belligerent, tone deaf, activist woman and that grossly incompetent, self-righteous grinning fool, McGuinty, brought to this once strong Province is breathtaking. It's an out and out crime.
The Trump Fan Club has many misogynistic, homophobic racist members on this site.  The fact that Civil Beat allows their disparaging comments of women is appalling.
I prefer a Canadian PM who is progressive, liberal, feminist, compassionate, inclusive, handsome and young.... and with a good head of hair.... just like Justin.... and even a 'tat or two.  O'Leary is regressive, fascist, macho, insensitive, harsh, capitalitst, unattractive and old..... and bald bald bald!!!  I speak on behalf of most Canadian women who went gaga over creamy dreamy Justin and who voted with their feeelings.... soooo obvious ......
If SOB to an NFL player is offensive, then lets talk the words to the music they, black players, listen to before, and after the game. Like kill cops, women, are b i iches, f this f that, f f f f f. In the week since Trump used SOB whats happen with the protests? Oh and by the way Colin Kappernick said " he couldn't stand for a flag or an Anthem, while bodies lie in the streets." The original protest, was about the flag and the Anthem.
True, but North American women in general are completely insufferable anymore.  Real women do exist but they are very rare. After seeing friends and family go through divorce rape these robots have a real future.
if this crazy female take a dump on my driveway not once, but multiple times and she will be prosecuted, after I film her. She will be identified, and she should consider herself lucky I do not take stronger measures to stop her in her tracks.
How is it an "attack on women"?  Do MEN not have faces?  Do MEN not ALSO get "face-lifts" as well?  Call it "Plastic-surgery Shaming" or whatever but PLEASE stop with these ridiculously transparent attempts to pit women against Trump.  It's hypocritical but even worse... It's just pathetic.
Which accusations against Trump[ have been "proven wrong"?  To my knowledge, none.  Trump's denial lacks credibility, after he has repeatedly bragged about his assaultive behavior.  Wht if your beautiful, innocent daughter were grabbed by her breasts and genital organs by someone she trusted as a mentor?  How would you react?  Do you really want this monster, who praises the dictator Putin, insults dead veterans, and calls women "pigs", as president?  And you call Democratic voters "fools"?  Have you looked in the mirror lately?
Only 19 more days. 19 MORE DAYS until Trump loses, refuses to give a concession speech, and sulks off into the shadows to form a network to cannibalize Fox News' slice of the ignoramus pie.   Just 19 more days that I have to listen to "get off my land" rail belt types clamor about "killary" "pillary" or "hILLary"   19 more days I have to endure people voting against their own self interest: women wearing "Trump can grab my p***y" shirts next to their husbands who wear "dump that c**t vote for Trump" shirts.   19 MORE DAMNED DAYS UNTIL THE GOP DOES MORE "SOUL SEARCHING" (as if it had a soul to search) much like the GOP has done after Mittens and McCain.   19 more days that I can keep offering the blowhard loving Trumpeters the chance to put their money where their confident mouths are and get no takers.   19 more days until the GOP gets another beating because they are tethered to a hackneyed vision of America that doesn't exist anymore, and shouldn't.    Have at me trolls!
Most 'news' publications should be embarrassed.  Fake outrage once again over a political comment which is true and can be said about and has been said about many groups.  How many times have you heard that if someone is elected they will take away a woman's right to choose?  Pro choice people need to rise up and protect this right.  Is that in anyway saying to use violence?  Nonsense.  People used to be intellectually honest when having civil discussions about politics.  Nothing intellectual about this news article and anyone who is buying this junk.
HRC caused veterans to die. But you are okay with that. You are on record saying about all the corruption HRC has been involved in as she has not been convicted, yet you and the rest of the fools in the dem. party are okay with convicting DT on a few people all of a sudden coming forward. I can easily link to where some of the allegations have already been debunked, I can easily link to many woman who have come forward and said they were treated with great respect from DT, you could also but your party leaders and the corrupt main stream media has not told you to so of course you won't. Yes Eric, those who allow themselves to be used, to be manipulate are fools.
And the Democrats have Bill Clinton go back into the White House because he is so respectful of women  interns and Democrats are willing and eager to meet his special needs to advance their agenda.  Anyone who sends their daughter to work under Bill Clinton deserves nothing but contempt.
I know it is quite sickening.    We really need to stop asking for same treatment & ordination, and start demanding it instead.    I am so tired of seeing these dialogues back & forth stating the likes of "Maybe if we women beg & crawl before the hierarchy of the church, they will allow us to join a ministry that gains us no more authority than the laity - maybe they will honor us with the permanent deaconate"!  Yeah!!  It never even occurs to some of these folks that they are actually insulting the humanity of women, in suggesting that this ministry, because it is in no way equal to priesthood or above, is somehow an acceptable goal for women to seek.    We need justice - not another sexist cage for a ministry.  We need to get active.  I have met quite a few men and women who are so angry at this Trump win, and relating it, in part, to our church's influence on our country's politics, they seem to finally want to fight now. Email me: restornow @ mail.com (one word) if your interested.
I see the wrong-wingers out in force carrying the fraud elects fake news message. The electoral college voters need to shut this election down until President Obama, FBI, and CIA can disseminate one final report that proves or disproves that the  Russians meddled in our presidential election.  The public also needs to be informed about what was up with the $12 million that was discovered in tRump's RUSSIAN campaign manager's account before he fake fired the guy.  I'd say tRump and Putin both planned the fraud elect tRump.  He's a boldface liar and p___y grabber that needs to be prosecuted for inappropriately groping unsuspecting women.
It is pretty clear there are a lot immigration fraud consultants cheering for wife beaters because they advocate that so they can get money for immigration services that they clearly ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO DO. Very sick people. They probably would cheer for Sharia Law if it allowed them to enslave women and profit it from it, too.
or the fat lady to sing.
Is that list in reference to the actions of president-elect Trump...or the Catholic  church?    Isn't the fact that your own religion has acted worse than Trump a matter to ponder?  Sexually assaulting.....not women, but children.  Misogyny galore.  History of vitriol to Jews and other religions.  Rapaciously greedy?  Yes -- so much so, a protestant rev started by indignation over corrupt indulgences, that's still in full force.  NOT PAYING  TAXES!    Oh my gosh...  Priests and workers and teachers make a pittance, while Bishops live like princes in mansions.  Funny that you object so to Trump (and all Catholics who voted for him), but here you are in the RCC.    Paging Dr. Freud...
The entire first paragraph consists of one word:  "Evil"  You may disagree with that, but I suspect you mean the 2nd paragraph which is also completely accurate.  There are no good racists.  End of story.  They are all hateful scum and there are no words that can defend them.  THAT cannot be denied.   trump ignored the murder of an innocent women while saying some of those white supremacists were nice people and attacking those who came to protest peacefully.
Christy is just wasting taxpayer funds. The LNG bandwagon has left - Australia and the US have sewn up the market. The important thing about this trip is that it demonstrates just how dishonest this wretched woman is.
Nope. White men are pretty scary. Especially Christian ones. They reeeeally hate women as well as POC.
It sounds like this woman may be a white lady. These were black men killed and a black woman that he had to pretend he gave a fuck about so I would like to know the race of this woman. He still gets no brownie points with me....
Well it is quite obvious... Most female pregnancies ARE  aborted  ... actually it is quite stupid... in the long run there is an shortage of woman in that, there are not enough females and then they wonder why the RAPE culture is so rampant in that place...Their old believes that males will support their elders later is also no longer the case as far as I know ... so there again... it is S T U P I D to abort the girls in the first place .... they are only hurting themselves ...
By good man, I was using a rather low bar,  for instance "doesn't shag interns in his office".   Thank you Bill Clinton. By good man, I was using a rather low bar, for  instance, doesn't do phone sex with a woman while his child is climbing in his bed (Thank you Anthony Weiner).
This is absolutely delusional. Sounds like you think you are a victim, eh? Poor white males and their suffering at the hands of those aggressive women!
Axa Parvaz , and the 4 women of the Shafia family were all killed by their traditionalist Muslim families because they didn't want to wear hijabs and burqas as commanded by the males who dominated them.  This is less about fashion, but how to make  a slavery look nice.
The democratic party removed the filibuster to steamroll its agenda.  Suck it up boys and girls.
The U.S. Catholic bishops have, and deserve, little influence in the public square. It’s hard to get too concerned by the recklessness of +Naumann and other members of the Republican Bishops Conference. On the other hand, in Donald Trump we have a candidate who is a notorious racist, fascist and adulterer; an accused rapist, child molester and serial sex offender; a demonstrably unstable personality who should never have access to any of the levers of government, let alone to the nuclear codes; a demagogue who lacks even a minimal understanding of the issues of the day, who is contemptuous of American values and of democratic institutions and processes; a bigot who attacks racial, ethnic and religious minorities, ridicules women, and mocks the handicapped. By endorsing this despicable man, Naumann does more than embarrass himself; he disgraces the church and trivializes and diminishes the pro-life and pro-family causes he purports to support. Let's pray that his priests will oppose him
Imagine a headline "Femininity is toxic" (re/gold diggers).     There would be calls for the author to be fired immediately.   Why this won't happen?  Because misandry (read/"masculinity is toxic") has been so ingrained into our unconscious that we now accept it as normal.    This is the paradox of toxic modern feminism: Men even when they behave badly don't hate women, in fact they love women too much so they use and exploit them...feminists on the other hand truly hate men  -- as exemplified here.
He was forced out of his own country .  As opposed to the tens of thousands who want to flee to other countries because they are too coward to stay and fight for they're own homelands. I'm not talking about the women and children---but those over 18 years old who are cowards . Thank goodness American's aren't cowards or the German flag could be standing tall on our homeland.
Mr. Trump also said he grabs women by the genitals.  Then he said that wasn’t true.  He also said the Mexicans would pay for the border wall.  But he is currently seeking appropriations from the American Congress for the wall.  Do we really have any excuse to take him seriously?  SAD!
Hard to miss the rhetorical delirium enjoyed by so many writers@theGlobe (abetted by a cadre of “progressive” academics at masculinity-is-toxic.edu) in fanning the flames of male dread. The n-word is used mainly as metonymy in Fuck Finn (= black slave) but the book has become “toxic” in the minds of some because of its one famous use as metaphor (= inferior human). The same in reverse is the case with the insidious ways the m-word is deployed by angry feminists: powerful men are “garbage”; all men are powerful, by definition. Ergo…  It's imperative to take down "predators," not so to suggest, even semi-equivocally, that “rejecting masculinity” is key to being "fully human." You rarely read anything in the Globe that takes women to task for their part in the "semiotics" at play in the ways men negotiate "the spaces between archaic ideals and modern reality." It's true that the Globe employs Maggie Wente, who pleads for balance, but she's the lost-leader equivalent of NYT David Brooks.
You mean like Hillary's husband that she's covered for and ruined the lives of the women he sexually assaulted? Can't attack one without the other. They're both crap.
When will this woman ever accept responsibility for her Party's defeat.  Email scandal, lying to congress under oath, her and CNN trying to fix the debates, ignoring middle America and taking other democratic states as a given, just to name a few.  Then a Clinton trying to preach morality to Donald Trump, that's like a pedophile saying he's just kind to children. Get over it you lost now move on!
she didn't mean it amela that's a poor comment yet you were happy that that other lady had to resigned when she called Micelle Obama and ape in high heels you all wanted her gone and you say this is ok what a bunch of hypocrites who say nothing should happen to her. liberals with mental disorders.
At what point will the public understand that this woman is a crook?
So now after nearly a year, five Congressional committees, the FBI, CIA, and NSA, darn the luck.  Dems and the media just can't find anything on Trump, so what to do?? Go after Jared Kushner.  Got to be something over there, right?  If the Dems and the media haven't embarrassed themselves enough, how about Nancy Pelosi complaining about President Trumps visit to Saudi Arabia.  Her complaint was that he didn't travel to countries in alphabetical order.  Are you frickin' kidding me? This was the woman who told us all: "we'll have to pass the bill, so you can see what's in the bill."  Obviously she didn't have a clue, and still doesn't.  Does the media mock her incredibly moronic statement yesterday, or any of the numerous ones before?  Of course not. Why not?  Because they're off after Jared Kushner.  Divided we fall America.  How much more of this nonsense will you tolerate?
Now the Palm Beach Post is reporting a third woman who says Trump groped her when she was 23 and working at a concert at his estate. Looks like another "liar" for all you loyal scumbag enablers to trash.
This woman is mentally unbalanced.  She far outdoes Trump for attention sealing behavior.  As to her statements about Sgt Johnson’s body not being located for 48 hours she seems to turn it into some type of racist thing.  She is totally racist.  Things are crazy in combat...doesn’t she realize this?  She is the hate monger. I hope that her insanity becomes evident to her constituency.
Trump has zero experience in politics. He is an expert in Real Estate, bankruptcy, draft dodging, tax evasion, lying, abusing women, bulling, making fun of disabled people, accused rapist, and F moron, - you would think he would at least surround himself with experts in politics, instead, he settles with criminals, racist, mentally, deranged people. But then, can you blame him, the people he can relate to and comfortable with, he surround himself with them. His base are mostly KKK, neo-nazi, white supremacy, demented, low life racist people.
Another citizen of convenience. She's a business woman in Beijing, when problems start, then she complains to the Canadian government and tax payer to bail her out. Ridiculous.
This article is a perfect example of female...  1) Solipsim 2) Entitlement 3) Lack of agency 4) Hypergamy 5) AWALT  Only the craziest of men would marry Western women nowadays.
You feminists should have your male and female children taken away from you.
Why does the media continue to talk to this woman?  She is a fraud, liar, cheat, thief, and circumstantial evidence strongly suggests a murderer.  Shut the Hillary Up.  Why doesn't she just go and enjoy the millions she and Bill have stolen from the U.S. and other nations, and leave it alone?  Guess it's because she still wields a lot of power in the Shadow government and her ego won't allow it.
Apparently your experience is with girls wearing old lady underwear that covers the entire bottom. You like dat?
Sex work is a much better option than the burden of having them on welfare, as is the case in places such as the UK.   It is also time to drop the stigma on sex work: it has a long tradition in being a way for low-skill women to lift themselves out of poverty and there are worse ways to make money for migrants.
South Africa: Zuma rapes Kwezi...ANC -  response? USA: Trumps grabbing of the p****y.... Republican - response? UK: Fallon touches journalists knee.... Tory response?  Truth is, females do make things ambiguous, it is part of the mystery and males do misinterpret messages with testosterone in full swing and emancipated females are going full kink in the Grey areas of weak society.  The weaving blurred lines (intended) of acceptability are going to get more confusing for both males and females, set by "leaders" of society, pornography and the church leaders, not only Catholics where Parental leadership is being stripped by political correctness.   Feminism  is good, but when.
Trump and Weinstein are in the same position. Both have been accused by a large number of women of patterns of sexual harassment and abuse going back decades. Weinstein rightfully has lost his career, his reputation, his power and after the lawsuits are done presumably most of his money. No one in Hollywood will work with him again. Democratic politicians are rushing to return his donations. He is a pariah. Trump, on the other hand, somehow remains more powerful, wealthy and popular than before. He is a serial adulterer, alleged sexual abuser and thrice married former casino operator, yet to conservative evangelical voters he is a hero and a rightous man of god. His election proves once and for all that American conservative Christianity is a hypocritical farce and a sham. Weinstein's supporters rightfully condemned him when they found out what kind of monster he was, Trump's just shrug their shoulders and say "who cares as long as he puts our guy on the court."
Bubba's lucky year, C'Mon woman, the Sexual Predators have been at it a Long time.  With the millions of Sexual Predators out there, the Bubba's will be serviced FOREVER...............  Read the Sign:  Lock them up FOREVER............
Oh my God!!! Being an innocent person and getting gunned down in the street is not even close to going to a party, getting s**t faced, and then screwing some guy in the back room.  If the guy is as drunk as the woman and they have consensual sex at the party, you can't later blame him. He was drunk too and not responsible for his behavior, like her. Right?
America dodged a bullet with Hillary! What a shrieking clown this woman is.  The Dems really don’t get it, do they?  Listen, we hated paying through the nose for Obamacare. We hate when our tax dollars pay for refugees and illegals.  The government destroys EVERYTHING it touches.  Just butt out of our lives, please.  My cell phone is just $25/month from Tmobile. My auto insurance is also just $25/month from Panda. Why? Cause the free market works!    Take your socialist agendas and shove them where the sun don’t shine.    Hillary supporters are mad and saying it's Russia's fault for exposing the corruption on Hillary.. lol Anyone else think this is funny?
Instead of trying to unite the country our prime minister is trying to divide the country by having different taxes for men and women in hope of gaining a political advantage.  No prime minister in Canada's history has stooped so low.  Justin Trudeau has no shame.
@ALbertD3 >>So, in saying that, am I an online troll? You didn't define it very clearly, just as M103 fails to clearly define Islamophobia. This is a dangerous game. . Spot on. We have articles conveying 'Muslim victimhood' and 'Canadian -phobias' - most of the time authored by a Muslim woman in a head-scarf. Hold the outrage, before marking the post, and ask yourselves why is that a pattern? . Where are the Muslim male authors? Or non-covered Muslim female authors? Or opinions different than those having been relentlessly published in G&M?
This is what happens when a woman wants to be a man you get a foul mouthed she man want to be.
The extremists are the right wing who actively work to remove the rights of women.  Those re the people who need their "Canadian Values" vetted.  Time to drop the "Muslim Extremist" stupidity and realize that the safety of Canadians is endangered by white supremacist right wing nut jobs far more than Islamists.
I think it's interesting that one of these two mainstream women is a transvestite (Michael Obama) and the other is a confirmed lesbian (HilLIARy).
It's a lesson for women to not be stupid.  Dunno if that can be taught.
What is with you hawaiikone? Can't figure you out. You just admitted that you are ok with a stupid president. You must really have some serious psychological issues because nobody wants a stupid leader except you. OMG incredible and you are telling everyone to relax? If you are a male I don't blame your wife for leaving you. If you are a female likewise. Geez!
How sad.  There is a big difference between having propaganda centers that claim to be helpful but whose only purpose is to stop women from having abortions.    So you are going to vote republican from now on?  As if you didn't already.  Face it you republicans are the biggest hypocrites around.  When you balance a budget, give me a call.  lol   Love your source, a moonie paper?  or was it sold?
"Long standing rules of decency" huh? I guess that leaves out all the Trump voters who support the sexual predator they put in the White House, a man who violates every sense of decency, not to mention the law, regularly.  Where was Minnery's concern when Trump was barging into naked teen girls' dressing rooms unannounced?  When he was bragging about "grabbing" women "by the pussy," not to mention assaulting them by groping and kissing them?  Such hypocrisy. SMH.
This woman is completely insane.
It is a crazy world where it is supposed to be huge offense and  "sexual misconduct" to "leer" at and call a female "hot chocolate". Bloodless wimps do not understand a real man's  hormones. But painted women looking like harlots are OK to dangle their half naked bodies with surgically enhanced breasts like a bait in front of men?
Except when the Minister responsible for Social grants is an alcoholic and does not give a damn about them. Then there is Faith Muthambi (SABC fiasco) who spends her time trying to extract every last cent of money for her and her family and she failed spectacularly at ICT Ministry. The less said about Dudu Menyeni the better as SAA will never come out of the mess  they are. Then there are the fickle and wicked ANCWL who have selective amnesia when it suits them. So unfortunately there are a rather large number of women in Govt that are downright nasty and useless at their jobs.  However I do agree that there are many more that offer a shining light such as Dr Khoza and Madonsela et al.
I want every self righteous person,  especially men, on this planet to take a lie detector test and prove they never talked like this before. We all have done it and do it.  Man and woman have and always will talk sex.  You notice  Clinton talks sex it's hip and giddy , but when Donald Trump talks sex, it's  dirty and vile.  We are a nation of hypocrites.
Add to the story the fact that it was deemed newsworthy that the Saudi King, ACTUALLY  SHOOK MELANIA TRUMP'S HAND, while she visited his country, and it is not hard to see why the Mainstream Muslim World is just not compatible with Modern Western Society. NOT EVEN CLOSE. Women there, are treated like garbage.  It is not hard to see how that degree of male domination can sow the seed of hatred and radicalization towards anything or anybody who is different.
John Paul II was a jerk.  Plain and simple.  He had no interest in trying to follow the example Jesus gave as we read the gospels. And he tried to set the Church back 100 years.  He was only accurate setting it back 25 years.   I guess the "Vatican boys" finally got to Pope Francis.  Such a legacy John Paul left--mostly all negative.  I can speak with a priest for five minutes and tell whether he is a "John Paul" priest.  Hopefully, Francis is leaving a legacy to be proud of.  Perhaps, ordained women Deacons.
A day without women? Yes, please! I will surely enjoy that day to myself.
This is ridiculous! I feel sorry for the men who feel they have to rise to these heights and spend that kind of money to propose.  I feel sorry for (and a little angry at) the women who are expecting these kinds of proposals as a sign of love. Good for the business people who can earn a living fulfilling the fantasies though! Maybe I'm just a curmudgeon.
Your examples of moral equivalency fail to hit the mark by a long shot.  First of all, the United States is not a Christian nation. European countries -- forget about it!  Secondly, no one commits atrocities in the Name of our Savior.  Islamic terrorists regularly kill and enslave in the name of Islam and even cry out "Allah Akbar" when committing their crimes against humanity.  A genocide against Christians is taking place right now in Islamic countries.  The atrocities against women and gays are unspeakable.   Christians and Muslims have a different understanding of the God of Abraham. For Muslims, this God is pure will.  For Christians, God is love.
Way to go Dean Lapierre....another blatant and unnecessary testimony to IGNORANCE!  In case it went right over your head, that inspired, creative, defiant outpouring by women around the world the day after the inauguration was of historic significance. Women lit the fuse of change that will confound and leave in the dust the dinosaur opinions you espoused. Note "espoused", in the past tense. You may still turn the corner and make a real difference as yo move forward. We are pulling for you to do so, especially the women! And by the way, as someone raised by a single mother in the 1950's, I know what real courage is all about. I can smell disrespect a mile away and no one should have time for it.
Unfortunately, proving sexual assault which occurred many years ago is almost impossible. The only chance a woman has is when MANY other women come forward with similar claims or there was a witness. Keep in mind that Trump actually boasted about grabbing women by the pussy...or perhaps the fact that Donald actually admitted doing this kind of thing doesn't count.
If that should happen and none of us will still be here but I feel very sorry for our descendants, especially our female descendants. Islam is not exactly known for equality among the sexes. Gays will have to back into the closet. And all meat animals with the exception of pigs will suffer even more at the time of slaughter.
I think your analogy falls far short of the truth. The nazi aholes and white supremiscists are vile and digusting. However, antifa went there looking for a fight. The brain dead white supremacists were happy to oblige but make no mistake, antifa is no innocent girl who wore the wrong party dress.  The woman who was killed in no way deserved that fate and had this white supremacist group been in Denver, I might have been in the crowd peacefully protesting against them.    I can fully say that the white supremacists do not in any way represent me or my family. They don't speak for my political or social values and I wish they would wither and die. I hope you can say the same about the antifa.   That is an honest assessment, as devoid of partisan hackery as possible.
They're fascists so the way they behave is predictable. It's the same with the pro-life filth. They're drooling at the prospect of whipping women into submission. It gets them off psychologically and otherwise.
"... and both major candidates behaved like civil adults."   What? Where have you been Phyllis Zagano?   Did you not hear Donald trump say the system was rigged and that he might NOT accept the outcome of the election IF he did not win? Did you not hear him incite angry mobs at his rallies  to "lock up" his opponent? Did you not hear him call his opponent "a nasty woman" during a presidential debate? Did you not hear him brag on video that he enjoys sexually predator behavior toward woman, married woman...while he was a married man? Did you hear where he likes to grab them --and all because he could because he was a big shot??  Donald trump has lowered our civil discourse into the gutter- into his swamp --and now that he succeeded in dubbing angry white uneducated men with his racist, sexist and xenophobic fears, we are supposed to sit back and behave nicely -- because you wouldn't want to be inconvenienced by a traffic jam?
“A feminist federal budget would prioritize progressive taxation, increase the proportion of total government spending on public services and social protection to lift people out of poverty, encourage living wages, close the gender pay gap, and increase the international aid budget to make our global commitments to women’s rights a reality.”  WTF!   My family works our collective @sses off and pay huge huge taxes and you want to give our cash to women, immigrants, and deadbeats????  WTF, WTF, WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How about work for Canadians who pay the goddamned bill!!!!!  Progressive actually is the new word for Communism. They had a plenary a decade ago to change the name so people wouldn't be fooled. The Communist left is pure evil. You hate success and hard work Layoff 50% of the public deadbeats and give us a tax break not a tax increase!! I'm gonna go f"in postal. That little weasel is sneaking around Canada. Drain the swamp of this vermin Where's our Trump
I'd be curious to know which aspect(s) of the game lead to concussions.  If I'm not mistaken, revised college/professional rules prohibit the knocking of heads together, which, of course, would have been a big source of concussions on players prior to the rules being changed.  I used to play a lot of tackle football, in the olden days when organized sports weren't the primary venue for playing the game, in the parks and backyards where I lived.  No helmets, no pads.  Where I live, the parents are onto the dangers, and our high school team has dwindling numbers of players (but a lot of our guys are feminized too, because I live in Liberal Hippie Land, nut I digress).      Ban the game?  Ridiculous, feminine, snowflake thinking there.  How about changing the rules?  No one is talking about banning rugby (concussions, soccer (concussions), lacrosse (concussions), hockey (concussions).
Mr. Neil you seem to have missed the campaign of lies, lies and more damned lies spewed by right wing media and the Sanders primary campaign that resulted in millions of Americans thinking that Hillary Clinton was as corrupt as trump so why vote at all or why not vote to blow the whole system up. Before she announced her candidacy she was recognized as the most influential and admired woman in the world. Afterwords she was vilified i.e. Swiftboated, by the same shameless billionaires and media cretins that destroyed the very honorable military record of Senator Kerry. At the DNC and after Hillary Clinton's approval skyrocketed as people  actually saw who the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton represented. And again during and after the debates when it was revealed just what a boorish dolt trump was and what a savvy person Clinton was with real policies that would benefit the lower and middle class while trump had insulting soundbites Then Comey took it all away by inserting himself.
As a black woman, she gets 12 strikes.
You are correct. If abortions were only being done by black women, there wouldn't be so many single black mothers with children who  have so many different fathers!
For starters, "loathsome" is any inflammatory/gruesome rhetoric about abortion. Some trolls here are obsessed with this one subject and it is offensive. When we  get serious about solving the abortion problem we will start with the premise that no one likes the idea of abortions, but demonizing women -- the only ones left with unwanted pregnancies --is cruel and sadistic and downright "loathsome."
Nah...you're the victim for having to endure a world in which women exist.  Poor guy.
Sounds like he is high and flying at this moment. Looks like he would answer a call by the comments he is posting on Facebook.  This guy really needs the suicide hotline number. To many young men and women are trapped in this deadly cycle of heroine addiction. How you like obamas doctors now.
then women should be prepared to returning to outhouse when white men stop being plumbers.
I would like him neutered no matter what race he is and who the woman is. (snark)
my sister used to be sane then 15 years ago moved to Oklahoma, now she sleeps with a gun, says she needs it in case of a robbery, Nuts. Yesterday an American police woman sang the anthem at a game and  she had a gun on her hip, Why. Worst I have ever heard is some NRA clown saying Sandy Hook never happened and Obama made it up. These guys picked trump so, they are crazy.
see how bs likes it when they drag his boyfriend out in the street and beat him. Lol. Kill non believers, women, children. Proliferate the population and elect a Muslim President. Elect Muslim congressmen.
Hypothetical question:  A great many commenters here have convinced themselves that whether one has a penis or a vagina is an insignificant detail relating to one's gender identity.  Ok, fair enough. So consider a business with two multi-user restrooms. It removes the signs that say "men" and "women" with signs that read "penises" and "vaginas," with no gender judgement implied.  What would be the objection to that? And on what grounds?
Honestly, I hope she wins. I know first hand the attitude many police officers have in regards to sexual assault, and its disgusting. Women find it hard enough to come forward, but when they muster the courage, they get treated like shit and victimized all over again.
My grandfather made his fortune selling women for sex and my father was a prominent member of the KKK.    This makes me highly qualified to be President of the United States of Christians.  Hatred is my name.  Fear is my game.  DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT!!!
Id like an explanation of why they aren't seeking anyone else but they know 5 people were involved.  That's bs right there!    It's bad enough that when this poor woman was shot they kept it silent for over a week.  But to add insult to injury they know more than 4ppl were involved but aren't seeking any more arrest warrants?  Uh how about the illegal sale that involved these douchebags to this woman's home?  Because as far as I'm concerned if her son wasn't trying to be a damn drug dealer outta his moms house she might still be alive.
Just when I thought I had heard everything, "Throwing semen at women". EXTREMELY ODD....Gotta be a  Mental Health Illness candidate.   ORS 163.415,  A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the third degree if:  (a) The person subjects another person to sexual contact and:  (A) The victim does not consent to the sexual contact; or  (B) The victim is incapable of consent by reason of being under 18 years of age; or  (b) For the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of the person or another person, the person intentionally propels any dangerous substance at a victim without the consent of the victim.  (3) As used in this section, "dangerous substance" means blood, urine, semen or feces.   10 years ago I knew a Lane County Deputy that went to work one day and when he went into his office he passed by his secretary, said Good Morning, and put his hand on HER shoulder as a friendly, warm gesture. She filed sexual abuse, she won, he was fired.  What about a hand shake?
Nothing about Democrats ever changes.  This is exactly the type of hatred they directed towards Abraham Lincoln - Democrats said "he was so stupid he did not even know his own first name."  Then a Democrat murdered him.  Sound Familiar?  Nothing ever changes; every Democrat is just another potential John Wilkes Booth (to adapt a phrase from the women's libbers).
the idealistic ulta progressive mentality this woman lives in is clearly what is wrong with the democrats and left in general, she is completely blind to the faulty Hillary with all her lies and arrogance
Bill Cosby is innocent. The women are liars. Men need more rights. Women will say anything to get their way.
So we should hate the other gender because women are evil? The robots being the replacement to a nuclear family is nothing more than just promoting single parenthood with a retarded version of nuclear families. These should improve human relations, not be a catalyst to ending human interactions forever. This is why Gen Z has so much potential then Gen X and Millennials.
A Muslim follower of Islam just recently attacked, shot, maimed and killed many foreign national people, including a Canadian woman, at a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey. Muslim terrorists also recently killed a Canadian woman in Jordan.  Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslims  have claimed influence and responsibility for the attacks.  That's interesting. The Trudeau Canadian government has allowed at least 60 Muslims to return to Canada who have been helping Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslim terrorists in the Middle East.  And Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslim terrorists have called on followers of Islam to use any means to attack innocent people in western societies including Canada and al Shabaab Muslim terrorists in Somalia have called on followers of Islam in the U.S.A. and Canada to attack people in soft targets like shopping malls.  We've had Islamic jihadist attacks and killings in Canada already.. I guess Canada and Canadians should get ready for more.
"Let him who is without sin throw the first stone." "Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye." "Suffer the children to come to Me." The words of the Christ.  Paul wrote to the citizens of Corinth that they were to marry, but Paul didn't tell Corinthians to drive out-of-wedlock mothers and their children from "the temple".  As for Corinthians 7:1 "“It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.” 4) "The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband." 10) "To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. 11) But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife."  Just a sample; but no requirement to shun or drive out a woman and her children born out of wedlock.
OJ made history by being the 1st black man that was involved in the death of a white woman, that bought his way out of a death sentence by hiring a dream team of lawyers. That ability had only been a white privilege before him.
I've tried responding to Kathleen's "states rights" argument twice now, and been zapped into the dreaded 'UNCIVIL ZONE' both times.  Since I'm marking everyone else's posts as 'good'/'civil' no matter who they are or what they say (even Kathleen's!) because I refuse to be ADN's unpaid censor, I think that's a little unfair.  There may be no 'civil' way to present certain ugly truths, but I'll nonetheless keep trying.  Invoking “states’ rights” was the Ku Klux Klan's tactic for perpetuating Jim Crow laws.  And the only HONEST ‘anti-abortionist’ I ever heard speak was former Grand Dragon and current Aryan Resistance leader--and TRUMP SUPPORTER--Tom Metzger of Falbrook, CA. When once asked his position on abortion, he said: “We oppose abortion for white women. We are in favor of abortion for non-white women.”  That's the TRUE position of these overwhelmingly white "anti-abortionists." But unlike Metzger they don’t have the guts to admit it.  That includes 'Trumpy the Clown'.
"Since 2007, when EpiPen was acquired and she was the company's chief operating officer, she earned about $2.5 million in total compensation. In 2015, her compensation was nearly $19 million."  Are you kidding me?! Disgusting... This woman is a greedy lunatic. Mylan raked in $1 billion for EpiPens in 2014 and '15. I'd say that's a pretty fair profit. These people don't care about how many lives this saves, just how much money they can make off of it. It's a monopoly, this kind of price increase should be illegal.... Let's see what her income looks like next year... Sickening.
Jules Bailey would have us overlook his church's discriminatory policies simply because he says he disagrees with them.  And anyway, "we're family", as if it's just his crazy Uncle Imago Dei in the attic.  Mr. Baily's religion is his private business.  Nonetheless, as a candidate "running to be a mayor for everybody", the organizations he chooses to join are a very valid indicator of his beliefs and values.  (Jules, there are hundreds of churches which do not deny civil rights to the LBGT community.  Did you even look?)  Portlanders care deeply when a mayoral candidate chooses to join an organization which denies civil rights to any group.  What if Mr. Bailey chose to join an organization which denied civil rights to blacks?  Women? Moslems?   As they say, Mr. Bailey, "you can choose your friends but you can't choose your family." In this case, you have chosen to affiliate yourself with "family" which denies the LBGT community full civil rights. Portland voters will not overlook this.
I don't think that this is going to go away.  The woman who procured her for Trump and Epstein and who witnessed the sexual abuse is testifying.  Billionaire Epstein is a registered sex offender is NY.
You just nailed it! They're mad because it wasn't a good enough win. Stupid popular vote. Stupid looser performers who won't perform. We didn't want a big splashy inauguration anyway! Stupid looser women in their pink looser hats!
When has Melania come forward to say anything? What did she have to say about her husband's defense against the women who accused him of assault last year when he said they were too ugly for him to rape? Why do the wives have to say or do anything anyway just to make you happy?
Vote for the racist who hates women he can't bed. Because Hilary.
What a smug jerk. As if her degree in library science qualifies her to advise ANYONE on what books they should read on any subject. I suppose if the first lady had sent science books, this pretentious idiot would be recommending books on string theory and quantum physics. What she really wanted was to show her peers just how clever and sensitive she is, and try and embarrass someone who was trying to do a decent thing. I'd like one person on here to tell me with a straight face that if Michelle Obama had sent the same books, this woman's response would have been the same.
Billy, are you a complete idiot, being thick headed or just not reading what people have been trying to tell you in response to your soapbox blathering.  A) Poor people without insurance need health care too. B) Planned Parenthood provides women's health care for free to anyone.  PP does these thru donations and grants from the States and Fed and Charity Foundations.  No Federal money is allow to be spent on abortions.  The people protesting Planned Parenthood know this, but have decided that a zygote is a person.  These same people believe that Corporations are persons too.  Once again, POOR women get help with birth control via Planned Parenthood.  POOR people mostly do not have insurance, and less will have insurance as soon as the GOP gets done gutting ACA.  POOR women cannot afford to go to Dr for prescription birth control, therefore Planned Parenthood is necessary.
Masturbating in the presence of a job applicant is not 'sexual'?  Bill Clinton "did not have ''sex' with that woman", either!  I am hesitant to ask what Rose thinks 'sex' is!
To all of you blaming UH for this departure, go get a brain. Track & field is only there to satisfy the requirement to have enough women participation without breaking the bank. It is a money drainer and UH would do well to get the least expensive coach, preferably a local woman. To blame the infrastructure or the pay is just crazy talk. Do any of you crying babies even have a clue as to where UH stands compared to other mainland schools? Who puts money into track & field except the most richest of power conference teams or rich private schools?  Thank you for your service but don't let the door hit your fanny on the way out. You won't be missed.
Maybe they're discussing the best time for a quickie with your dirty wife?
Notice you didn't try to answer my questions.  I understand.  While it could be argued that both parties are in need of improvement, the democratic party is the  more responsible party.   The republican party has not balanced the federal budget for over 50 years and has been responsible for the vast majority of our public debt.    Republicans hardly stand for less government intervention.  Afterall they tend to feel that women need to be regulated as they are too stupid to run their own lives.  And it were republicans who led the march against same sex marriage.  Why the hell do republicans need the government telling them who they can and cannot marry?  Now they want to spend tons of money to build a stupid wall and hire many people to kick people out.  What a wonderful use of our tax dollars,  (NOT!)
"They talk about solidarity and the inclusion of people who are brown and black, Muslim, native, LGBTQIA (the I and A “visibilizes” intersex and asexual individuals), disabled and those of diverse faiths"  The above smacks of the exclusion of white women. Those are not 'cool'. What a horrible article!
Gary voted for Bill Clinton who had been raping women going back to when he was expelled from the Rhode's Scholarship program at Oxford after hist first semester and then voted to put him back into the white house as the first rapist and husband of the most corrupt politician in our country's history.
Donnie Boy hates women, anyway.  Sees them only as objects.  This is no surprise.  Loser Donnie makes yet ANOTHER error.  Will it ever stop?  No.
The story IS her side of the story, Stephen Hawking.  Has anybody else noticed that a certain commenter—let's call him Dick—never ever ever misses a chance to comment on the articles about gays? Dude's gaydar is like the Hubble Telescope. And he sees gays everywhere—like the nice woman who wrote the column about tolerance this morning; she talked about going to gay bars with her husband. Or a public bathroom. Or a locker room. Whenever the gay is threatening to get good, Dick is johnny on the spot.  And you guys flew all the way to Alaska from Texas to get all up in our Pride thing? Seriously? Sort of like one of those theme cruises, I guess. I'm sure there must be places in Amarillo you could run into some nice fellas.   Just something to think about Dick and Dave: if both you boys are THAT anti-gay, you're probably gay. Hope that helps you sort out some feelings.
80% of Muslims believe a man has the right to beat his wife if she disobeys him.  54% of Muslims believe homosexuals can be punished with death.  90% of all Muslims believe a woman is worth 1/2 the value of a man. 60% of all Muslims believe killing Jews is not a crime. 80% of Muslims want Sharia law in America. . Yea we want that in Canada and Justin is making sure we get it.
Trump is everything the left hates, a wealthy heterosexual white male, whose wealth was partly acquired through inheritance. To them he is the big bellied southern sheriff and they are the brave freedom riders. This is the romantic philosophy they have been taught and cling to and protest is part of this romance. If this writer wanted to protest something, maybe she could start a campaign to find out why there are so few writers of colour (I hope that is the right word) on the Globe staff. Maybe she could mentor a disabled African Canadian woman, help raise her up from nothing and as a culminating act of sanctimonious goodness offer her your job.
White males laugh at these narco fems.   Your narrative shows everyone who the bullies and predators are.   It ain't us man It's you.   It is truly sad how you can watch  muslim women treated like dogs and not mention anything.  Why not focus on the true enemy of women.  You would get our support by speaking clearly and honestly about midieval muslim laws....  c'mon suck it up
Bro Country is filled with attractive women so apparently you are not into that.  And that gun violence isn't limited to just bad areas wasn't your point, if it were you would have stated it differently.  No, you were making a comparison about relative safety of the two areas.  And in epoch fashion, you failed.  I note that you didn't bring up a gay nightclub in Orlando, which also, according to you, isn't as safe as Little Mexico.  Are gay nightclubs awful?
Tell that to little boys and girls who were raped and sexually abused in residential schools who have suffered all their lives from toxic stress and lateral violence. Go ahead tell them.
If he did  he should. But if  he didn't he shouldnt.  Just because he said what he said doesn't mean these woman were his victims.   There are numerous accounts refuting these stories, but you won't read them in a paper in the tank for DNC.  And he ain't my man. I.wish he'd step down. But as long as the crook Harry is running Trump will have my vote.  It's sad beyond belief that these are our two choices.  I understand why we got trump. Why the left Choice this crook over bernie or didn't allow any other candidates run is a clear sign of DNC corruption.
A few strips of bacon are far less harmful than the  things said in the mosques by impassioned Imams to the attentive Muslims who believe every word about exterminating Jews,  subjugating women,  gays and infidels
But does it excuse all the millions women who know they can get ahead by sleeping with the right people. It is a two way street: Men want sex, Women use sex.
Im not sure if people are being willfully ignorant or if their experiences differ vastly from my own and my spouses. I am a Black Woman and I have started a Family with a White Man and we are madly in Love and have always been. Yes we enrich each others lives in so many ways but there are challenges and they have the potential to negatively affect our union. As a White Man it can be extremely maddening that there are parts of my existence and Identity I simply can not discuss with him as he CAN NOT identify with, understand or feel my plight as a WOC. It is extremely frustrating that there are parts of who I am that simply don't resonate with him in any way at all. If you all want to trivialize that challenge that many IR couples face, as someone on this post commented on as well, then you are all clearly in denial. Talking about race relations, differences and challenges should not be taboo in any relationship as they are an intimate part of our identities in many capacities. Wake up
I completely agree. This was a creative sentence, but it's the wrong one for Boyle and the patients and caregivers subjected to her evil personality. If she turns out to be a jerk they can't have around, what then? The judge should require satisfactory behavior reports and change the sentence to prison time if the reports are negative. This  woman should have gone to prison. Period.
For the most part I agree with you. These scumbags are in both parties. I'm not sure if there are more in either party but one party, the democrats, made it part of their campaign to identify the other party as anti-women. From what I've read, Weinstein's activities were well known in the industry, which probably means it was well known, by a lot of people and yet people who were receiving money and favors from him seem to not care.
One attack, by a British born citizen no less, and Doug call this "New wave". Let me quote another:   “Terrorism will not defeat democracy,” Lindsay Hoyle MP, who is deputy speaker of the House of Commons, told the BBC.  Everything the politicians don't like is an attack on democracy. Every war they wage is to protect democracy. You know, the people is tired of this old standard chest-thumping political excuse.   A few days before this attack, U.S. led coalition, meaning U.S.-UK, conducted a massive air strike on Syria "Islamists" stronghold. But it turned out to be just a residence, killing 30 women and children. You don't see one word of this in the 'coalition' controlled media.   Exact same thing happened in Canada Parliament a few days after when Harper ordered CF-18s to join in Iraq-Syria war.  You keep bombing them, they keep hitting you back. It's the POLITICIANS in charge who conduct this war policy in the Middle East. It's the people who get the retaliation. Stupid.
Are they in denial of what trump has done and said. Incites hate, racism, bigotry, adultery,sexual predator, dishonesty in his businesses, 3x married,manipulator,. Do they listen to what he says in his speeches. I am sorry but, Jesus is about loving, kindness and forgiving, which I do not see that in the words that come out of his mouth. To me he is evil.No way is he believer of Jesus Christ.In Genesis 1 :27 God created man in His own image, in the image of God he created Him ;male and female;He created them. Another thing is churches are not suppose to endorse or not endorse any candidate on pulpit, newsletter or church bulletin. there are very strict IRS laws for 501c3 non profit.
LRAPA is doing their job, and writing tickets for violations.  Now, because the POTHEADS are Ignorant and Stupid and they want to waste their money paying  fines,  I guess you can say the program is not working, at least on them.     You just can not fix "STUPID", but in this case I believe they need Professional Mental Illness intervention.   I know that the woman who lives there has been in the Salem Mental Health facility 3 times in the last 10 years.
I find it embarrassing not because she's a women but the fact she has no political experience and it's nothing but a patronage appointment based upon money that she coughed up. Is that better for your precious mind?  We'd be better off with the present "Vacancy"
I didn't say what she did was ok. Just made a fair comparison. I find it odd that a lot of women stay silent on the Chumps admitted sexual assaults. If someone did that to my wife he wouldn't be walking around today.
False.  He freely admits to relationships with both men and women and he has chosen men.  Gay people choose to be attracted to their own sex.  I wish we would have more stray cats choose to be gay, then we would have fewer stray cats.
There'll probably be twice as many pervs than women, but definitely twice as many boobs, maybe both.
i don't see a woman--I see a traitor.
MEN OF CALGARY: GO GAY! It is the only thing that will save your skin. But in today's heated feminist empire, being gay may not be a defence from an accusation of sexual impropriety.
Apparently the truth is hurtful to some but it doesn't change the fact that it's true. Apparently this isn't civil enough for the leftists at the DP but I'm reposting this because it is indeed fact.   Dolores Huerta Is an open, blatant racist. She is no different than any member of the KKK, her views are the same, just towards different groups. Trying to hold her up as some pillar of the community is laughable at best, quite frankly it's embarrassing that anyone in our community would look up to this woman.
As with most things this government does hypocrisy rules supreme - with sexism being at the top of the list. Way to go feminist potato.
[the veracity of Rep. Eastman's comments.] Did I miss the memo which states that Rep. Eastman is an authority on abortion and native women's reproductive culture?  Only fools and the naive credits a layman's statements as having any veracity.  I strongly suggest you go read about Russell's Teapot.  I'll even make it easy for you and give you a quick a dirty link to start with. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot
"...feminists have said that they were racist in supporting white men over sisters "of color;" or opportunists in clinging to men who held power; or secret misogynists, haters of women, who had come to despise their own kind."  I hope the Democratic party clings to this message of identity politics.  The empty calories of: "it is not because I am unqualified or incompetent rather it is because they are racist, mysoginist, xenophobic, homophobes who hate transgenders, that you should NOT vote for them.  Look at me I am your only real alternative so hold you nose and vote for me because I belong to one of our glorious special interest groups." Even people that pass the Special Interest groups litmus test want leadership and a vision.  Nobody likes a negative messsssssage.
"I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then. I have since learned it’s not an excuse, in the office — or out of it. To anyone. I am going to need a place to channel that anger, so I’ve decided that I’m going to give the NRA my full attention. I hope Wayne LaPierre will enjoy his retirement party. I’m going to do it at the same place I had my Bar Mitzvah. I’m making a movie about our President, perhaps we can make it a joint retirement party. One year ago, I began organizing a $5 million foundation to give scholarships to women directors at USC. While this might seem coincidental, it has been in the works for a year. It will be named after my mom, and I won’t disappoint her."  He's from the same era as the serial misogynists Trump, except Trump is still a jerk and chauvinist. Sounds like Weinstein is going to channel his anger elsewhere. Trump & the NRA watch out!!!
Still won't vote for Lisa - who had the unprecedented and historic chance, with other strong like-minded women in the senate, to change the way things are done in Washington DC.  Instead, she latched on to the same testosterone-driven, archaic, old-bull partisanship power plays that's made the Senate ineffective.   Lisa can't even call Trump out for the putz he is, for heaven's sake.
So what will Dunleavey and Keller say about all those "pesky" gender issues? This is ripe for a Constitutional challenge and especially fit for a VETO before it is blown out further out of proportion by these Legislative SEX police. No biology no secular integrity just their Godly notion about your freedoms.  Dresses only and to the ankles Girls! No lgbt Ladies and Gents it's wrong, and the big one --well you know it it all -- Come on what a waste of time and effort!!!
All I am saying is that your 'target acquisition system' malfunctioned.  You want to kill the people  who weren't involved and are trying to atone for the mess of others instead of the low-life scum-sucking dogs (to give them the benefit of the doubt) who actually made the mess.    You 'knee jerked' because they were frat rats.  It's sort of like saying 'all blacks',  'all women'.  You are saying 'all Frats' are evil just because they are frats even when they weren't involved.
No offense to women. Just an opinion.  As a single, fit, successful, 38 year old man, my life is pretty awesome.  I have great relationships with my single male friends.  They add to my life, unconditionally love me, and support me.  I have never had this from a woman.  In my opinion women don't add to my life.  Typically they have unfounded expectations that make my life harder.  These expectations stem from a life of constant male attention willing to trade time, money, or entertainment for access to her vagina.  Women leverage that attention, especially to men they are dating..."Make me feel special or I'll choose someone else."  It's a losing proposition as the relationship goes on.    Now that sex is easily attained, men are realizing that women are a pain to deal with.  We are opting for more short term low expectation relationships.  I suggest women ask themselves "How can keep a man happy if I didn't have a vagina?" Most women have no idea what a man wants.
So, Hillary Clinton, the self proclaimed "champion of women's rights" has surrounded herself with a bunch of sexual perverts and deviants, like her hubby Slick Willy, the perv Anthony Weiner, and this other perv Harvey Weinstein. Oh, and not to mention, Hillary also took millions from some of the most repressive countries in the Middle East that treated women worse than cattle. With "champions" like this, who needs enemies?
Easy. We voted against abortion & murder. We voted against the lying, illegal, immoral activities of probably the worst person to ever step into American politics. We voted against evil. I ask, how could any decent human being ever vote for Hillary? How low do you have to sink in moral character to think that woman should be our President? I can't understand what I don't respect. Until you & others who voted for her hold to a higher standard there will be no meeting of the minds. What happened in this election was an anti-establishment thing. Congress barely changed. Governorships barely changed.  What did change was the election of a non-politican who defied both parties. If you want to know why, you are going to have to recognize us... the silent majority, who are sick of Obama's devisive politics, Hillary's corruption, BLM, riots, political correctness,  and all of the other babble of the recent past. Grow up and learn your faith before you dare lecture us on being Catholic.
Why HOPE?  She seems on a suicide mission to destroy European culture with a deluge of islamists.  Ask the 12 dead at the Berlin Xmas market or the women raped in Cologne last NY eve.
Which group killed an innocent woman? A violent nazi was the only person to kill an innocent woman by using a vehicle in the same way daesh terrorists do. Stop with the putin what about ism and false equivalence. It's false, misleading and ignorant.
In spite of the continuous and shameless lies spewed  by trump in the primaries and in the general campaign it is still shocking to see that anyone in the public eye would be so unaware as to repeat lies without realizing they will be seen as crude, boorish liars. As you say the truth obviously does not matter to trumps supporters because he is their liars. Sort of like still supporting your quarterback no matter the foul deeds he is seen doing off the field because he is the leader of your tribe. I for one will never get used to it nor allow it to be normalized anymore than I will allow the sexist, racist, bigotry of trump to be forgotten or normalized. Disgusting breeches of social norms, disgusting disrespect for women, ethnic and religious minorities, calls for his political opponent to be jailed like a tin pot dictator are unacceptable and unforgivable. That his supporters could vote for him because he said and did such nasty things  put us into a whole new and unamerican world.
agree but the sexism out here will not allow it.  Hawaii is decades behind the mainland and remains a hideous embarrassment to the nation for its antiquated ideas, domestic abuse, violence against women and stupidity.
This wretched LOSER of a 'woman' - Hillary Clinton - is a self-absorbed, psycho NUT JOB who should be locked up in prison for all of the innocent lives lost and the corruption that she is PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE and LIABLE for!
You forgot gettingvthe sisters back into habits, getting sent to hell for a hot dog on Friday and all Catholics wearing at least one scapular 24/7.  Oh, and getting rid of girl altar boys.
Maybe...just MAYBE...it's personal choice? Ever hear of lipstick lesbians? Ever notice that in many couples, there is a feminine woman and a "butch" woman?  That's why.
When we are going to talk about Islam making women second class citizens and throwing gays off buildings.
It's just a marketing gimmick that shouldn't be taken too seriously.  Having said that, anyone who believes gender discrimination is bad should at least be rolling their eyes at this.  A movie comes along that presents a woman as a superhero and the response is to invite moms to watch it with their daughters but lock out dads and sons?  It's not particularly sinister but it is dumb.
Trump in his own words: if the pedophile is a woman and a teacher, it's actually kind of cool in his opinion.    http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/12/politics/trump-on-statutory-rape/index.html
What the heck is Q ( LBGTQ). Hip hip hooray  for Trump.1) male 2) female 3) Handicapped ( all though all those signs were changed..eg politically incorrect.  eg 3a) physically challenged.  All I have to say is a repeat of what I watched on TV.   Seven new planets where there might be life. Bathroom 4) alien.
Another example of a white male who cannot recognize his own entitlements but feels threatened when challenged. A person so deluded that he thinks men do all the dirty jobs, that women do not fight crime, and seems to be unaware of all the brave women in the military. Delusional and sad.
Stupid solution.More undesirable kids from broken families,single mothers,teenage girls add more criminals
To all veterans that have served our country.   On behalf of our pathetic government please except my humble apologies of the disgrace that this Liberal government has shown towards our brave men and women.
Funny how rape and sexual assault are the only things in the world in which it is always assumed the victim is lying.  I doubt you and your friends go around posting on stories - about a man getting robbed for example that "we have so little information." Or in the case of your little friend there, making a passive aggressive statement as to his disdain for women by putting "perp" and "vic" in quotation marks.  Of course in society we also don't go out of our way to blame the male robbery victim in my hypothetical either...we dont say he was asking for it, he was giving off signals etc etc.    But then of course, those who don't point the finger at every woman in the world and scream liar!!! is close minded.  Yep.
100 years from now they'll view the way we handled this form of mental illness and laugh.  Water is wet, snow is cold, and you are the sex you were born with.  If a man identifies with a chicken and is clucking in his front yard we'll put him in the crazy house, but if he thinks he is a women then he should get a trophy for being brave.
As a woman (The Honest Courtesan) once remarked: "All women are whores." Get over yourself Wente.
The reality is, who ran the black slave trade? The whites? Hardly.  Who owned all the boats? Who introduced abortion, crime, aids , drugs into black communities? Whites? Think again  Why did Israel deport 70K black Hebrews? Some say the real Hebrews are the black Americans.  Blacks aren't thugs, gangsters, criminals, and whites aren't against them.  In fact I would say we embrace black culture.  Blessed to have known great blacks, funny, great musicians and there is something magical about a Black Christian women, child, God's children.    But then who are the Devil's children?  Black brothers, the worst thing possible is a divide and conquer strategy.  I don't like Islam per se, but a know a lot of Muslims who are great as well and they have had their countries destroyed for the Greater Project for Zion.    9/11, the catalyst, whatever happened to the 5 dancing Israelis?  Who really hates America? USS Liberty? Who owns the Federal Reserve? The corrupt biased Media? The Devil is here
If I don't know better, I would think that Cathy Munoz is a sexual predator herself. She is actively advocating for laws, bills and now writing letters that enable sexual predators to keep being sexual predators. This is one woman that I think could learn a lesson by walking a mile in her victims shoes. Karma sometimes is the best teacher.
From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author. Bloom, a white woman, is a civil rights attorney and writer. You're citing hearsay, gossip, and malicious misinformation. Below are real indisputable facts.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
Thank you Tempmanoa.  That creepy man pretending to be female on here (Allie) disagreed LOL.
you need to check your facts.  the reason they were arrested because he insisted on intimidating them for no good reason and they resisted arrest.  they were charged with resisting arrest and one lady did strike the cop while resisting.  but the cop had no right to impose his moral values on these two women, there is no law that couple cannot show affection in public.  the ladies sued the cop, hpd and the city for the cop's stupid behavior and won.  as employer of the cop, hpd and the city are liable for the aberrant behavior of its employees.
The dabbling  heir's handling of the indigenous file is pathetic.  His handling of the missing and murdered women file is it seems a disaster. Incompetent! What do you expect from a two year substitute drama teacher with bouncing and,ski instructing  who lived off daddy's trust fund for twenty years?
Femininity is toxic.  Women don't have to be.
Trump's supporters are now faced with the reality that they have been conned, duped and defrauded. One woman told the press, "I wouldn't have voted for him if he was an idiot." She assumes that Trump is therefore not an idiot because she voted for him. In other words, rejecting Trump means she has to reject herself and her own judgement. This is how tyrants rise to power. They promise the needy and the overburdened the world, things they cannot deliver. They fall for the con and turn a blind eye to the transgressions. Then it's too late.
Way to root for an abuser!  Check out that video of him berating his crew. Check out the reasons why the network and insurers have paid out millions- 13 million thus far - in sexual harassment lawsuit settlements to multiple women. Yes, O'Reilly is clearly an angel, just like the Pussy Grabber in Chief.
He has a lot of accounts on here and is anti-woman, anti-canadian and anti-logic. He's severely insane.
I see this assertion a lot, but have never read why some people believe it to be indisputable truth.  It is not.  "As humans, we also need rituals"  SOME people may DESIRE to particiopate in rituals, but to say that ALL people "need" rituals is not true.    In the context of religion, some desire some rituals in certain contexts (they don't "need" ritual), others pretty much forgo ritual (for example, Quakers).    In the early church, the eucharist was a meal, presided over by someone chosen from the congregation, or by the head of household, who might have been either a man or a woman. No priests.  The rituals that have developed during the history of the RCC and christianity in general,  were developed by men, and sometimes have become a bit ludicrous. When any small change from the GIRM becomes a matter for civil war in the RCC, the notion of  the importance of 'ritual" has gone too far, becoming an end in itself that is often even at odds with true prayer and true spirituality.
Oh you mean directly opposed to the teachings of the sexist male hierarchy of the church who blatantly and sinfully discriminate against women? Catholics most certainly do support a women's right to bodily autonomy and reproductive choice. I am a proud member of Catholics for Choice. All of you self-righteous busybodies should mind your own business!
You are insane, no white woman would go near him.
A women could always have abortion ! ,loser  Do we want to legalize the pagan laws  A sin is sin no matter how you twist the truth
Sorry Jim for not getting back to you soon.    I learned a technique many years ago called dialectic bubbles (we called it that).  You put in a 'bubble' the end results and in this example let's use the text that got her arrested.  You put a whole bunch of circles to form a huge circle to connect it all.  You'd be surprised at what you find underlying end results and how I/you got there.    I'd say this young woman needs mental health treatment and I hope she has insurance because if she goes to Lane County Mental Health?  Worthless and wasted time.  Those people are self serving, subservient slugs.  So, I agree w/you.  So in my opinion: bad equals liars, egotists, manipulators, prideful, deceitful, selfish/self serving human beings.  I've seen very rich ones and of course poor ones...........=bad
interesting.... As a Mandan female, I am always amazed at the number of angry, unstable, abusive men out here.
Eastman is one of those creepy guys who can't stop focusing on female reproductive areas. It is not PC for him to hang w preteens and advise them on no birth control, maintaining virginity, etc. So he grasps at some non factual female reproductive stuff. Think about it, female mutilation and abortion vacations?   Eastman will not go near my girls. I'll scream, spit and kick his creepy body away from them and me.   The dude is sick.
She is female responding to a misogynistic sexual ethic. Don't say you are protecting women when they find your teaching has the opposite effect. Ordain some women (and reject sacred continence) and then let them design your sexual ethic.
Uh, plenty of women have learned how to pee standing up. And after surgery, trans women no longer have a penis.  Why don't you do a little research on the subject.
Kathleen K. Kearon, your prattle about "states' rights" reminds me that the only HONEST ‘anti-abortionist’ I ever heard speak was Tom Metzger, former Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan. When asked his position on abortion, he said: “We oppose abortion for white women. We are in favor of abortion for non-white women.”  And that is the TRUE position of these white so-called ‘conservative Christians.’ But unlike Metzger they don’t have the guts to admit it. And that includes ‘Trumpy the Clown.’
Likely? Have you an actual cite? Regardless, if, as he claims, the sex was consensual, she would have his DNA as well. This isn't television, all most physical evidence can do is place someone at a scene, it doesn't determine guilt nor innocence of a criminal act. DNA is most useful in excluding suspects in a case of alleged rape, or impeaching the testimony of an alleged perpetrator who denies they were there at all.  Also, if both were impaired, then it is paternalistic and destructive to her agency to charge him with rape and not her using the "impairment removes consent" standard. Unless of course you buy into the Victorian notion that only men "want sex" and women are frail, helpless creatures who merely submit to it at best.  This is why rape investigations need to be made by actual police, not incompetent kangaroo courts driven by Title IX "Friend letters" explicitly saying to weight the process in favor of the accuser and remove due process protections from the accused.
"One heavily Muslim school in Toronto faced tough questions a few years back because menstruating girls weren’t allowed to take part in the prayer service.There have been concerns about sexism... what kind of Islam is being preached." ~ ` ~ No Kidding. What pure primitive nonsense.. the female reproductive process is no-one's business, especially that of 'supernatural power-mongers'.  That may have worked in centuries past when missing females during prayer service alerted males to those females who were ready to be impregnated after cultural customary marriage rituals; adding to the male's pack of  multiple wives from same said culture..  . . And for the 'bigoted wunderkinds of the Planet' -- the perspective of this writer has nothing to do with "Islamophobia" & everything to do with being from the enlightened North American "Modern Western Civilization" & believing in 'Personal Freedom of Mind.  . . . Humans playing Stupid Power-Monger Head-Games -- using  'supernatural excuses'.  /.
Typically fool action by these people. "The chain somehow broke" It must have acted up like berserk or was it fools chain? The dog was shot between the eyes probably for good reason maybe because it was straining threateningly towards the officer. The weak woman "girlfiend" claims she held the strong pitbull in one hand and the dog was not snarling towards the officer? And she held her baby in the other hand/. I don't believe her story, the whole story stinks, the part with the car and the boyfriend "helping with the luggage" weird at least. Leave your nuisance dogs at home next time.
Wanting our president to fail to analogous to wanting the pilot of the airplane to fail. Stupid. And the march for equality, mutual respect, inclusiveness and appreciation of diversity doesn't really want pro-life women there. Stupid AND hypocritical.
People with male genitalia shouldn't be in the girls washrooms period. If you want to recognize a very small  group of society in the process of  transformation give them their own space!!!!! Trump isn't responsibly for the amount of media attention  surrounding this group that makes up less than 1 percent of society!!!! Truly, trying to understand the leftist mind set is an exercise  in futility.
Pocho>  Where's all the LEFTies and LIBs today????  I guess they cannot argue the fact that this black-american lady made such a disturbing statement, they have nothing "good" to say in her defense, huh????  Well this is a prime example of "STUPID" as can be.  I hope the Secret Service is knocking on her door at predawn to ask her to come with them downtown for an interrogation on why she made that statement.  Ha, ha, ha!!!!  Stupid is to nice a word to describe her.  They are all  calling for her removal from public office.  My request is she be charged for making a threat against the POTUS and be tried for that in court.
"In the face of hate, all women, regardless of ideology, should support and defend a fellow woman, mother, and activist such as Dana Loesch."  No they shouldn't, she's a hatemonger.
The woman is demented.
Look here:  I used to go workout at the DAC.  I was waiting in line for the am doors to open and two women were in front of me.  They were so happy and animated and so I started listening to their chatter.  One was just GLOATING about how much the subsidies she was getting w/their NEW home they'd bought.  See it was a farm and it came w/the big $$$ from the GOVERNMENT.  They were able to BUY another home because of it.  They also were able to get another Mc D's franchise too!  So when you all complain about children getting 'FREE' meals and YOU'RE paying for it?  You make me sick.  Change what's wrong w/government when you can have a goat and a cow and get huge bucks for it and then I might have some 'empathy' for you and NOT until then.    I think too many folks who have plenty of money  are bigger leeches off the teat of gov than poor folks.    Get real you selfish pigs.  Greed.  It's very ugly.  Puke
History Lesson #2.  Muslims think women are property.  Wide spread rape is up all over Europe from immigrants.  You can legally do what ever you want to your wife in their system.  Don't let your hatred from Trump blind you from these backwards thinkers.
What a cowardly action by the governor. The legislature couldn't get anything done this session except push draconian bills forward that hinder reproductive choices and restrict comprehensive sex ed. This state has the highest statistics in the country for domestic violence, rape, child abuse, gun violence towards women and numerous STI's. So what do our leaders do? Restrict access, of course! Knowledge regarding sex and healthy lifestyle choices is a bad thing for our students and youth, according to those in power. I'm so disappointed in the governor over this action - or rather, inaction. I can only surmise he didn't understand the repercussions this will have on teachers, counselors, students and our state as a whole. Teachers can get fired or lose their license for helping a student in crisis,  doctors or nurses won't be able to lecture because they're not "qualified", students have to opt in rather than opt out. Our legislature keeps taking us backwards. Shame on all of them.
You will notice that the rise in VEGETARIANISM coincides with the rise in FEMINISM and male white knights. ` Men are the bad hunters who kill animals. Well that's evaluation! Humans have been consuming meat for hundreds of thousands of years on earth, so know we should change? Now we should feel bad? ` Notice how feminism has no respect for men? For their fathers, grand-fathers, great-great-great----- grandfathers? If man was part of it it must be bad. ` The men who protected women and provided for them for the last 100,000+ years are now scum! ` Let's listen to the Immutable Laws about men and women by Paul Elam, (this will explain a lot) ` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BJmIXG1jYw
You think it is bad now?! You must listen to mainstream media that tells you nothing. Within the last month in Europe two incidents occurred both involving prepubescent boys and they both occurred in public swimming pools and they were both committed by Muslim immigrants who are doing A LOT more damage to Europe than some homeless pot smokers by the river who for the most part mind their own business.  One of the incidents involved a boy being raped because the migrant had a "sexual emergency". Google it! Oh, and don't forget last New Years Eve in Cologne, Germany when over 1,900 women were sexually assaulted. The list goes on and on and the stories of the war on Western culture by Islam come out in multiples daily. Oh, but I am probably going to be labeled prejudiced or hateful against a group of people who have proven themselves to be a cancer in every society they enter.  When this comes here, you will miss those non-violent drunks. Europe is toast and Islam want to toast us too!!
The brow beating men have taken the last 20 years has been passed down to our sons. You told us we were dicks, now we are.  In private conversations we explain to to our sons that girls and women today are simply spoiled princesses and too expensive to ever marry. Their parents have turned them into brats not worthy of marriage. Look at these girls today, they are narcissistic jerks.  They are spoiled, self centered, flaky twits who leave for the next great Tinder bang....  Then we get into the feminist movements, our Yoga PM and his royal family, etc who tell the world women are useful and men are prIicks.... You keep telling us we are aholes - after awhile you live the part. You reap what you sew ladies. We are pr1cks and better for it
Well I called the office this morning looking to speak with Eric Rennie, and I spoke with a very pleasant (young sounding) woman who said he was in a meeting, and I related the fact that I'm an average Joe who'd just learned from the Globe & CBC that average Joes could supposedly register to make a presentation at one off these hearings, and basically she said (nicely) that citizens like me sort of have to keep checking the government website and find the page specific to the Bill they are interested in. Now had I done that, I would have known about the "deadline" before the morning of. But no, like all the rest of the fools in this country I relied on the MSM to provide me with this important information, so of course, I am paying the Bitter Price now for that reliance. I'd further suggest that the Globe & CBC & whoever else in the MSM might have some kind of Mutant Cybernetic Dog in this fight, and that that is why they decided to NOT tell anyone... until 2 hours before the deadline.
If Meredith has any honour, he should resign. I care not a morsel that his wife and Jesus Christ have forgiven him. A married Preacher scumbag that exploits a 16 year old has no place in the Senate. The emotional scars and impacts on teenagers from much older men luring them into relationships stay with these young women for a lifetime. In their efforts to clean themselves up and regain some credibility, Senators must find a way to get rid of this disgusting man.
This woman is an embarrassment and needs to pack her bags.
Trump wasn't kidding.  In it's declaration of war against the Catholic Church in 2014, ISIS proclaimed, "We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses and enslave your women."
Why would Depp condemn violence - according to article today in Daily Mail Johnny Depp's managers 'knew he abused his ex-wife Amber Heard and claim he once violently kicked the actress' Depp apparently enjoys violence, especially against women.
I agree that women groping men has to stop and all the gossiping women do has to stop also.  NO MORE SEX until then.
This pitiful woman had the nerve bring GOD into her pathetic mix of foolishness, her old man is a hypocrite too. #GR!!
what's this the prophet reminded all worshipers the rights that women have and no other ethnic group or race has superiority over another that's why in Saudi Arabia they do not let women drive cars, women  cannot go out in public unless there covered and they hang Homosexuals, there Prophet is a liar because they still follow his way on doing these things I mentioned here.
"meet some of the most disgusting people on Earth this weekend. On TV. But you should be aware that these disgusting people are among the most powerful in the United States. "  College and university life is another important area where Canadians are superior to their U.S. cousins, from collegiate sports corruption to  "women who have been drugged and raped at fraternity parties not being sensationalist" but rather a "straightforward" occurrence.  Sadly, the University of Central Florida is typical of what a college education has come to in the U.S. Contrast these backward hat wearing idiots to the Canadian character on display in the Broadway play depicting the airline passengers welcomed to Canada during 9/11.
And we must disrupt a church of princes with an ancient irrelevant theology that discriminates against women, gays, and people of other religions and abuses children while protecting abusers.
What's next?  Banning black vets and women vets?  After all, the women just had their parade (march).
the only non shocker here is that... it's a woman. no dude ever thought of being so silly.
Yeah right, read these comments! Really read them.. the traitors are the Trump sticks, powerless little crybabies clinging onto coat tails bashing a group of their own women feeling insecure about performing when they are at risk by a bunch of scumbag bigots. Probably all living in their parents basement crying about never being given a chance and lashing out because they couldn't hold the ball. "Trump save me!!" It's so pathetic.. "save me from my own insecurities Trump!" Even if it means selling out to Russian interests. That is being a traitor Sir!!!!! AND IF we end up at war over this I hope they draft ever single one of them! It's time for these spoiled weasels to figure out what it means to actually fight for what they voted in and for their country of privilege.
The issue here is not celibacy but continence, which is an insult to the married state, particularly women. The belief that one cannot worthily celebrate the Eucharist when one has had marital intercourse is obnoxious and must be condemned.  After that, celibacy (including post-ordination celibacy) easily falls, as does the opposition to female priests and even gay and lesbian married priests.  The cramped sexuality of the past can not and should not survive - and won't give the attitudes of the Millennial Generation.
She was an unfaithful sleeze. She made a vow and did not keep it. She couldn't keep her legs shut. She completely destroyed her hard working man because of her sexual addiction and welcomed a man other than her husband into her bed. Of course he lost it. He goes to work while she shares there marriage bed with a low life scumbag. Those kids belong with his family not hers. Who knows how sleazy that sister is. She is probably after the PFDs and probably is just as sleazy.
See? Right wingnuts HATE women.
islam and muslims have a dimmer view of gays and women, but, unlike milo, they practice what  they preach. as far as i know, milo has not incited violence, promoted hatred, or acted against the groups he rails against. the market cut him down, which is difficult to do with legislation. he did leave us with one good quote that the snowflakes should remember: "f... your feelings."  that said, I am glad he's gone.
The "woman " is seen as the danger to the celibate .  Some bishop even expressed  his relief that one of his priests had sexually assaulted a boy saying that at least it had not been a woman  .  Boys are young , vulnerable and available .
Yawn, another woman under attack by Trump, what else is new?  With him, a woman is either a passive, beauty queen contestant who allows men to grope her and "compliment" her physical appearance or a bitch with intelligence who has the nerve to question bad policy.  Looks like Sen. murkowski is being categorized as the latter, though there were also several Repub men who voted no......
To all of the starving children go on a diet and help decrease the obesity and diabetes problem.  We have food stamps for the starved brains.  These school lunches are for lazy single women with children who refused to get out of bed and make breakfast and pack a lunch. And to perpetuate the hunger industry  and all of their blood suckers
Wasn't aware that there was such an interview but thanks; I found both on yahoo. The 2015 interview was almost unbelievable. When someone mentioned that a poll showed a fifth of the people in Indonesia, rightly considered one of the more moderate Muslim countries, favoured honour killings, she started talking about how Americans are so dumb. Far be it from her to attack people who believe in honour killings. But you can see why she would be sympatico with Justin "Get the f--k out of my way" Trudeau. The first time in the House of Commons he drew attention to himself was when as Liberal citizenship and immigration critic  he strenuously objected to honour killings and female genital mutilation being described in the new citizenship guide as barbaric cultural practices.
OK, ... and not pay your taxes, not yell fire in a crowded theater, not license your vehicle.  Your line of reasoning is that of a sociopath and pathetic to boot.  No man (or woman) is an island, get it, or would you prefer to build your own school, highways, and runways (for example)??
Yes, some women can be more careful.  Men can also do more to make sure that women who drink too much aren't taken advantage of.  If women thought they were going to be raped they wouldn't have walked down that alley or went to that party, or gone to a bar, or a friend's house.  Hindsight is always 20/20.  Since we are using cliche's.     But we've all made mistakes.  Some people have addictions and other problems that make them more prone to being victims.  Others are practiced perpetrators who know exactly how to find their victims.  The problem is why is it OK for men to get shit-faced drunk and women not to?   Men need to step up and take responsibility.  It is rarely women who rape.
This is ALL a sad joke pushed by left wing nuts that are bored with sitting at home.. Trump has no intention of taking away anything from women or anyone else (unless you are a terrorist or criminal) - it is all a farce, a scare tactic started by the left to make up for the fiasco they had with Bernie and Clinton. The left presented a Socialist (some thought communist) and a lying FEMALE career crook that doesn't care about the murder of gays and subjugation of women or Christians. Now all these poor 'ladies' (the ones that didn't actually listen and vote FOR Trump) feel out of touch and need to 'stand up' and show just how clueless they are. So - let them make fools of themselves and fade back into their 'safe place' the left likes to promote..
God must be a freewill man. A female God wouldn't allow this freewill crap.
In other news, a person with a penis  is demanding the right to attend a women's only event where nudity is common. See: http://www.metronews.ca/news/toronto/2017/06/14/women-only-spa-s-no-male-genitals-rule-ignites-transgender-debate.html
It's in the Bible; that's the book from where I faith is derived, right?  So I accept what's written.  So it's up to the naysayers to disprove it.  Impossible to do.  Same with Lot's wife.  Lot offered his daughters to show to the angel visitors that the guys banging on the doors were homosexuals, not interested in women.  He knew that he wasn't putting his daughters at risk.  It's one of the ways we know that this story is, indeed, about the sinfulness of homosexual sodomy.
except Fidel wanted Russia to launch a nuclear attack on Americans--that includes women and children Scheltz.
So Hilary accepting millions from countries that still stone women to death, and kill people who are gay is acceptable? Again who is the whore in the house?
Instead of "pilgrim", how about "selfish and incredibly stupid idiot"? His first duty was to his seven month pregnant wife.   "Venturing into lawless areas like they did is just asking for trouble". And when you ask for trouble, you usually get it. That woman and those poor children have paid a very high price for his decisions.
Yes, and those darn anti-slavery terrorists did too, along with women, children and a whole bunch of other "terrorists" protesting the way they were treated. By the way, slavery was A-OK when the Constitution was written. Do you think laws that make  owning another person are unconstitutional?
This woman is so useless, she should redirect her efforts to the Ontario Liberal party.
And Wynne was there because...????  That women shouldn't be invited to anything.
As I understand the issue, a truly transgender person seeks to change their born with genitalia to their believed sexual orientation. So a transgender male wished to have a vagina instead of a penis and balls because they believe they are truly a female. During this process, transgender individuals can legally change their driver licenses and birth certificates to represent their rightful gender. Like so many other concepts in America and around the world, trans gender means a process of changing. If you haven't changed your genitalia to the correct genitalia then should you really use bathrooms designated for the other gender. And once again why don't we just make all bathrooms unisex. That would solve a lot of problems and wouldn't cost that much.
Like a politician sending nudes of himself to a 15 year old girl. (While he's "off the clock", of course.)
A man who sexually abuses women.  Not my idea of a man at all.
Jimmy Carter admitted he was human and also demonstrated that he was able to resist temptation.  Bill Clinton finally acknowledged that he did "have sex with that woman"..but only after he had no choice in the matter.  He demonstrated he was NOT able to resist temptation and was a philanderer.    Donald Trump didn't "admit"..he bragged about his sexually assaultive behavior.  He documented for all of us to see that not only was he a sexual predator, he was proud of it.....it made him a real "manly" man.  BTW:  There are a host of women who have "documented" his sexually assaultive behavior.    I respect President Carter......a truly decent and honorable man.  I have little respect for Clinton, who showed us he had no decency regarding truth and faithfulness to his wife and family.  My disdain for Trump goes far beyone that.  He's shown throughout his life that he cares nothing about others and acts only for his own self-interest, often to the direct detriment of others.  Gary Crum
most women have to put up with this garbage in one form or another. there's only so many times you can brush this off. after a while, it gets seriously annoying.
To a liberal, anyone who disagrees with her or him is a certified idiot.  What an insult to women everywhere, basically saying they have no brains and no will of their own.
But it's ok for 70-year old Trump to look at 10 year female children with an eye to "dating" them in 10 years, or talk about dating his daughter, or agreeing that she's "a piece of ass"; or raping a 13 year old, barging into the dressing room of a room full of naked and half naked 15 year old girls, unannounced, to "inspect" his "wares, or grabbing, groping and shoving his tongue down the throats of various women without their consent.  Yes, any association with Anthony Weiner is bad; but any association with Trump--much less ascension to the Presidency--would catastrophic.   In addition to his sexual predations, Trump is an out of control, proven liar. He has cheated thousands over his lifetime, in and out of business, and is in bed financially with enemies of the United States. The KKK endorses him. He thinks abortion should be criminalized and women who have them, punished.  Other than Putin, I can't think of one world leader he hasn't offended. He's a narcissistic sociopath.
Hi, I'm a straight white cisgender retired combat veteran who has a Gay Godfather, my son and daughter have "2" Gay Godfathers, my family waves the "FAMILY" flag in a neighborhood who doesn't agree and I have lost friends in the military due to my stance on gays in the military and then your A** goes and does this!! How the hell do you expect us "WHITE STRAIGHT MEN" to stand up with you when you are secretly shooting us down? I love my big gay family and it's "women" (yes I labeled you) that will make it harder for my "FAMILY" to be accepted.  I hope that you get all the non white non cisgender people for your department and get your ass hacked to the stone ages!  I'm sure you will go and find a safe place now and blog/tweet/skype/snap/facebook and your probably so hipster you still use myspace or BBS and say how this warpig hurt your feelings. Rome was not built in a day but you are damn set on seeing it burn in one to get your way! Have a Happy Thanksgiving and a MERRY Christmas!
Interesting how the lunatic fringe Republican evangelists are so worry about a fetus but don't care too much after birth.  I can't remember reading about any evangelists paying for clothing, housing, food, etc. of needy children but they certainly like to force their religious views on women that don't know and will never even meet.
Come in your car, come on the bus, crawl out of your box, every tranny, woman, and cisgendered male has a claim on the impeachment of this fool!  Just bring your own hypodermic needles
This editorial is a ridiculous piece of print, "In other words, Gelser, a 43-year-old woman, is incapable of arousing the physical interest of a male colleague. She’d have to be 20 years younger for her allegations to be taken seriously."  Female beauty ends at 23?  What moron thinks that?  The RG's editorials are becoming harder and harder to take seriously.  Who is writing this stuff, a 22 years old kid?
@ALbertD3 >>So, in saying that, am I an online troll? You didn't define it very clearly, just as M103 fails to clearly define Islamophobia. This is a dangerous game. .   We have articles conveying 'Muslim victimhood' and 'Canadian -phobias' - most of the time authored by a Muslim woman in a head-scarf. . Hold the outrage, before marking the post, and ask yourselves - why is that a pattern? . Where are the Muslim male authors? Or non-covered Muslim female authors? Or opinions different than those having been relentlessly published in G&M?
Only weak minded liberal women.
Because she was a just a woman, and a non-white one at that. Two strikes. Possible drug use was the third.
Have you READ all the available information? The women both had consensual sex; the man is a playboy, and the girls got mad and got even. Billy-boy brought up wmd on the eve of the monica investigation. Poor Bush bought in to the lies. (Though I have always thought Bush, Sr threw the race to Bill.) They are all in bed together! And please, would you people retire McCain! He is a war monger, a dork, a tired old fool.
"Are men who get angry when a woman says or texts #MenAreTrash doing anything but proving the point?"  The point being that people don't like being libelled based on their gender or skin colour? The point that people object to double standards? The point that "rules for thee but not for me" is the archest hipocrisy?  What a ridiculous piece of argument. "By contradicting my point you prove my point!" No, that's not how proof by contradiction works, that's how stories by Kafka work.  The mental gymnastics the author is performing in an attempt to wriggle out from the bigotry of the phrase are doomed to failure: scorning an entire gender is sexism, plain and simple.
"Having few qualms about governance and human rights standards well below the norm, China..."  That is a gross understatement, seeing how there is absolute censorship about all things political, religious, and regarding human rights themselves. It's incomprehensible how Prime Minister Trudeau can ally himself with a totalitarian regime of this nature, even accepting political cash donations in illegal amounts from people who are a part of this regime in events staged in their Canadian homes. It is incomprehensible how Trudeau goes to Washington and lectures Trump and Americans on human rights and feminism, but does not utter a single peep towards the Chinese Communists for their absolute denial of human rights to their people. This is not a difference of degree, of a "standard below a norm," but an essential difference of kind. There is not even a discussion of "equality" of women or gays in China because NOBODY has these rights. Trudeau has proven himself to be a craven hypocrite.
just because cat poo had lipstick on it you would think it looking good? enough to kiss?  to eat?  and   how familiar are you with the wonders of women's makeup?  what's your color palette? you write nonsense. and come across as a foolish sexist bigot. linda hamilton
Ignorant rhetoric coming from a woman who has never taken a course in physics, chemistry, climatology or science of any kind in her life.  Ignorance is bliss until it gets too hot to handle, and then, she'll just blame it on Obama.
Being a small minded and nasty person who is lacking in emotional and spiritual maturiyt and whose ministry is basically scamming gullible people out of money certainly strike me as disqualifications to the priesthood.  And I'd prefer that the right men (and sadly it is still only men) enter the priesthood rather than ordaining anything with a pulse.   We really don't need immature woman hating men who want to play Latin Mass dress up and act like little dictators becoming priests.  They do so much to chase people out of the Church.
Men are afraid women will laugh at them; women are afraid men will kill them."  -Margaret Atwood
You aren't all for protecting women and girls.. a few months ago you were whining about your Alaskan Airlines flight being delayed because a 16-year old girl was assaulted by a drunk man next to her on that same flight. All you cared about was your flight being delayed. You didn't give a damn about her. But here you are pretending to champion women and girls. You're a self-serving bastard protecting bigots in the name of safety. Take a hike!
"Police also had a call from a woman asking if it was legal to trap squirrels in her back yard and take them to a farm’s field."  This doesn't sound especially silly... certainly not worth posting in a national newspaper.
Raping the women and children Americans will not rape
Simply because a black woman led an objectively justifiable counter-chant that contained the words "black lives matter" (in conjunction with several other repeated phrases of defiance) is not evidence that a national advocacy group bearing the same name sent a formal delegation to this white supremacist pig-circus; on the contrary, there was in fact no such formal presence. Conversely, however, the "highest profile" traditional national white supremacy organizations (eg. the American Nazi Party, the Ku Klux Klan) not only did send hate-mongering, cowardly, heavily-armed, addle-minded, yellow-stained representatives in riot gear to this rally, they organized and staged this reprehensible public display of racially-motivated hatred, simple-minded fear and colossal human ignorance!
Saying Drumpf is a creep is also a fact. Drumpf bragged that he can sexually assault women because he's famous. The dude is a creep.  You are on solid ground as far as I can see.
Equal pay. Reproductive rights.  Protection from discrimination, harassment, bulkting and assault. (Like pussy grabbing) Not being charged higher insurance premiums based on gender.  Trump akso said "there has to be some form of punishment " for women who have abortions.  Muslim womens rughts  Dreamers rights.  LGBT rights.  Black rights.   Just because you can't (or won't) recall  that many of our rights are threatened doesnt mean its not happening.   It means you are either out of touch or willfully ignorant. Bith are curable
agree with your co-workers because everyone needs to have the same views on everything....being an individual is now out!  Male and female alike all must shave their heads and faces, no makeup allowed, no eyeglasses, must use contact lenses.  Conform to the liberal crap everyone, so none of them are offended by anyone actually  having a BRAIN!
TomZ,  Really!!! Your bad mouth about women include your mother, your sisters, your grandmother, your wife, your daughters, Holy Mary, Angels, and saints? You deserve a title 'a son of a bitch'!!!  l hope that you are proud of your new title!  I hope you have no daughter(s) to denigrate!  Are you proud of your trash mind and your trash mouth?  Just good look at yourself, can you live with yourself, may be you should run for the next presidency, may be you could trash Americans more then DT!   Well, pope F. And all his clergies holding out to have a right to rape Children! so, you can bit them, No problem there! Good luck!
LOL WTF. Your argument is puerile and ridiculous. What is this, a new talking point from the NRA? It's dumb. No women are backing you up on this because we know what ACTUALLY is sexist. And hey, a man speaking for us is in fact sexist, so you can just stop now. It's not appreciated.
“I'm a CONSERVATIVE woman and let me clue you into one fact, most men ARE jerks.   Let me fix this sentence for you, most men ( whom you know personally  ) ARE (most likely) jerks. In my experience, women in particular tend to attract( and are attracted to ) those persons who are most like them, or who are similar to a person they grew up with whom they fear and/or respect. Then there are the gold-diggers...
I surely think that women SHOULD stop teaching the gospel. I'm good with that. Let men do it all. Or even half of it!
Oh man, such total PC garbage.  In a small number of cases bad men abuse blameless women.  That is bad.  In general and predominantly, couples fight and get angry.  The typical woman will scream, hurl insults, throw things and strike her partner.  She will never be charged unless she actually stabs or seriously, and seriously means hospital treatment serious, injurers her partner.  Evil people, like the writers of this article will tell the women that they are blameless.  They will tell them that they can behave any way they want without consequence.  The writers of this article are incredibly evil in that they fuel conflict and perpetuate bilateral abuse.  But this is sick America.  So it is okay.
taipan, you another wannabe taipan? trump wants to be one. trump will run the united states government just like he did the apprentice. if his guy makes a small mistake like denying women their rights or a big mistake like getting us in a war with china, all he has to do is say, you're fired and hes done with that person. the problem is forever attached to that poor slob, not trump.
Wow- new owners and already fresh, diverse opinions that are NOT from the Washington Post or New York Times!  I applaud Christine Flowers' unmasking of 3rd wave feminism and Leftist identity politics has made for itself-- largely fake campus "rape culture," perpetuated largely by campus feminist groups.  After the 'Rolling Stone' falsifed its campus rape story, coupled with the numerous examples that Flowers brings up, society has slowly started to realize the harm this kind of faux victimhood thinking is doing to the next generation of youth. Yes, there are many examples of sexual assault- both from males and females- but to say "rapists and perpetual rapists are everywhere, out there in the ether!"  Is not helpful to anyone, and this 3rd wave feminist thinking is toxic to everyone, including their own children: . http://www.dailywire.com/news/18590/monster-bigoted-feminist-writer-shames-her-amanda-prestigiacomo
You see nothing but negative information about Trump, because there is nothing but negative information about Trump.   A narcissistic blowhard, a lying fraudster with disdain for women, ethnic groups, veterans, and the truth. An absolute trainwreck nominated by legions of ignoramuses who continually sabotages his own best efforts with knee jerk absurdities.
Where are the "psychotic killers" today who use the "Christian" "faith community" to justify their violence?   Where are Christians who throw gay people off of roofs, turn women into sexual slaves, stone people for adultery, blow up nightclubs, etc?   Where are they?
um...no. the 2-8% false reporting figure is a complete fallacy, and the "research" you mention is by those who want the outcome to be 2-8%. For every "report" you show me that's supports 2-8% as lying....I can show you a report that shows 25% are lying. Lies...damn lies...and statistics.   Ms. Doolittle, like most feminists, has a very, very hard time reconciling the unfounded rate to the fact that many, many women have and continue to lie about being raped...happens every day, countless times, around the world, in every society.  It's a cognitive dissonance, stemming from the "Sugar and Spice" myth.  The answer is really quite simple, just have everybody stop lying. Bu that'll be tough, as many, many studies have shown women casually lie at a far greater rate and frequency than men do. That's why they grow to be much better at it.  Ms. Doolittle's Feminist la-la land is just that....a fantastical echo chamber.
The problem is all feminists want you to think and believe like them. You feminists can't stand it when some of us break ranks-we become labeled self-loathing, hateful, turncoats, and on and on. You can't accept that not all of us drink your tainted Kool-Aid! I want better for my daughters than feminism.  As for my beliefs, I know I'm not in second place. Too bad you are too blinded by your anger and entitlement to see it.
Funny how she says that Clinton's problems were "private" "none of our business". I guess she is referring to Monica but that was never what the charges against Clinton were about they were about harassment of Paula Jones, an employee, and about the rape of a woman named Juanita Brodrick who ran a group of nursing homes and wanted help from the then governor, it was about Kathleen Wiley who was assaulted when she asked for help after her husband died. And let me be clear these were all democrat women you turned your back on. So your little column is more of the same hypocrisy as all the other disgusting garbage that has filled the Hollywood cesspool for all these yrs. Your column is just more of the same self serving pathetic pap that the rest are shoveling.
Every woman who has ever accused Bill Clinton has either changed her story or retracted it. You guys keep conveniently forgetting that, just as you conveniently forget that every other faux scandal the GOP invented about the Clintons ended the same way - nothing found, except Bill lied about a blowjob. @_@  There is a different moral standard for liberals. We don't _knowingly_ nominate and elect sexual predators.
60% of poor people are white, yet you say that Planned Parenthood clinics "are "conveniently" and "coincidentally" located near low income black and latino neighborhoods." I would imagine that 60% of those clinics would be located near low income white neighborhoods. You don't acknowledge any of this. Innuendo seems to be one of your trollish tricks, along with sucker-baiting and switching sides when you feel like it. Your false implication that PP clinics are exclusively black and Hispanic (come on, you only mention black and Hispanic) is innuendo, implying only black and Hispanic women get abortions, get them at PP, or that PP only serves black and Hispanic women. That isn't true, it is false, it is innuendo intended to slur black and Hispanic women, and it is slimy.  You seem to think that repeating your falsehood endlessly will make it true.  It will not.
Typical pro-life baloney. Do everything to keep women ignorant and pregnant. Then abandon both AFTER the baby is delivered.
The inquiry's only mandate is to absolve native men and to blame white people ( white men) for decades of  harm  done to indigenous women. If  the inquiry fails, it will be blamed on white people.  No matter what direction it goes,  natives themselves have already decided they have no responsibility for what they do to each other.
People who have nothing better to do than to whine about a theater having a one night special event just for females... pathetic.
Men do not dress and paint themselves as indecently as many women who are "expressing their sexuality!" for the purpose of titillating the other sex. I dislike painted women, they are frauds wearing a false mask, I consider high heels ridiculous, glued on eyelashes as well as  showing their off their breast cracks a hilarious shame .
George W. Bush and Tony Blair's "War on Terror" is what started this situation in the first place and you advocate  further escalating the conflicts in the middle east?  Bombing hospitals is also a truly heinous and cowardly crime too but I don't hear any outrage over that. The citizens of the middle east get bombed and shot on a daily basis, many of them women and children, and many more die trying to flee war. No one seems to care about their fate. They're just collateral damage I guess so somehow I don't buy your concern for the "misogynistic war on women".
Where did this insulting stereotype come from? The black-as-criminal image has been with us at least since the nineteenth century, when explicit racism portrayed African American slaves’ essential nature as ignorant and savage, in need of the “civilizing” influence of the white man.  At that time little black crime actually occurred, as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled, and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the slave owners, who acted as judge, jury, and executioner.   On average, an African American man, woman, or child was hanged, generally by a white mob, once a week, every week between 1882 and 1930, as police actively participated or stood by and condoned the murders.  Lynchings continued until the 1950s, as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like “disputing with a white man.”
Let me count the ways I am NOT surprised by this: 1. Clinton's accepted $15 million from Saudia Arabia, a country that kills gay people & treats women like property; 2. They've amassed the largest fortune from political careers ever - "You cannot get rich in politics unless you're a crook" - Harry Truman; 3. She is married to a proven sexual predator; 4. "What Happened" book tour again ALL about money, when intelligent people understand she lost (again) simply due to the aforementioned numbered reasons, which had ZERO to do with Russia, Comey, Macedonian's, Fake News, Misogyny, or any of her other excuses.
“The official (Girl Scouts) rule is that girls can not sell in front of establishments where kids do not frequent or are not allowed..."  Then why wasn't Blakely busted back in 2012 for selling at fraternities and sororities?  Hypocrites.  Also, 95 cents for a $5 box of junk-food should teach these girls they're getting ripped off. If you support the local troops, just give them 95 cents directly and skip the cookies.
Nonsense.  He was an armed Polish squatter, land-thief, terrorist, mass-murderer and rapist.  He led Irgun when they slaughtered 120 unarmed men, women and children in Deir Yassin, and when they bombed the King David hotel.  We're talking about EARTH history here, not that of whatever imaginary dimension you would apparently prefer to reside in, OK?
I'm pretty much a redneck, pretty much a "hang 'em high" conservative, but this controversy is stupid. We (white anglo-saxons) took the place from the then locals. You can't, (unless you're nuts), be  true friends to, and respect, people, and steal their country, destroy their culture, and pretty much relegate them to the human scrap heap. ""We'a culpa". But what the hey, We're not going to give it back, and you know it. The woman has the right to her opinion, and, let's face it, she's not wrong. Also, all this politically correct nonsense is really getting tiresome!
Yeah, because the DNC wasn't crapping all over the families of those slain in Benghazi to protect Queen Clinton, right? He said NOTHING that would shame this Soldier's name. He called out the hypocrisy of the convention. They are all for women and Muslims, but Muslims aren't exactly champions of female rights. Quite the pickle. Bravo for Trump pointing out their bull puckey!
What I truly think of this situation would not be suitable to be printed in a public forum, so I'll just say I hope these two women rot.  May they reap 100 fold what they have sown here.  I hope the shame and humiliation of this follows them all the rest of the days of their lives!
instead of labeling restrooms for men or women which some may not "identify with" label them penis and vagina instead. there problem solved. if you have a problem with that you're just trying to stir up trouble.
That leaped off the page at me too. I don't think there is a more disagreeable statement than "obviously we are an inclusive party."   That's the Republican mantra, that you can produce a minority Republican and they can go "SEE! we don't blow racist dog whistles constantly!" It glosses over the severe lacking of diversity that plagues them, and actually is their death-knell. You've got a candidate in Trump that has given up on the Latino vote. He's trashed women with sexist blathering. He's ripped on veterans. It goes on and on.   The Republican party is the exact polar opposite of an "inclusive party."
Trump has paraded around on national TV with is orangoutang peacock feathers out boasting that he's bedded  down thousands of women all over the world.  I'd like to know how many of those women aborted would-be little orangoutangs.
"Just before 4:45 p.m. on July 27, police said the female was retrieving items from the trunk of her vehicle on Aloha Tower Drive. When she walked to the driver’s side, she observed the suspect seated in the driver’s seat.".    I guess he picked the lock and took the vehicle to a Western coast chop shop while she was in the back unloading.  Did you even read the article before making your ridiculous comment?
Not that I disagree with your assessment of this woman, but you did read right in the article that initially she wanted to elope? He wanted "a party".  They're both ridiculous.  Weddings today (& Proms for that matter) have gone nuts.
You recall one incident where a girl falsely cried rape. That does not invalidate or disprove the issues of mysogeny and rape culture in our society. You are able to post these words online, but could you look into the eyes of this terrorized and sexualized girl and accuse her of making this up? Explain the statistics that 321,500 victims over the age of 12 are raped or sexually assaulted each year in the United States. As of 1998, 17.7 million American women have been victims of rape or attempted rape. And those are just the ones that get reported. And you think that the tiny minority of people who fake it should invalidate survivors? 82% of juvenile victims are female. 90% of adult rapes are female. This is a gender issue. Men have been trained by society to act privileged and entitled over women.  She is not lying. And neither are the 17.7 million victims and survivors. She is valid and needs men and women alike to stand with her.
When the 10th round is over and the backers are still standing, they will list them.....  "CNN  - ‎4 hours ago‎  (CNN) Sen. Barbara Boxer, a veteran of Democratic politics, says she never saw anything quite like this before. Loud cursing, shouting, obscene gestures and vile insults, including crude comments about the female anatomy."  Can you believe that! Democrats doing the repub? Tell me it isn't so joe.
Just another insecure weak white guy, threatened by women and minorities. Yawn. You're a dinosaur, buddy.
I am a foreigner to this strange land. Thanks for noticing. I'd rather not be mistaken for an American--no offense, but seriously, their society is kind of a joke. Lol, I'm sure many will feel compelled to repeat the tired ol' refrain of "if you don't like it, leave the country" but the reality is that I am here legally and I enjoy pointing out the inferiority of American society--its stench, its warts, its disease, the rotting heap of racist, woman-hating garbage heap that it is. I get a real kick out of it.
OMG, unbelievable that white males like Scat here could possibly believe criticism against racism, sexism or even discussions about equality are equivalent to the hatreds meted against people of colour, Muslims, women, etc. (mostly by white males).  Pathetic #WhiteMaleTears.
---What about the boy who hugged the wrong girl at school or the Person who peed in a park/alley when they thought no-one was looking. Did you know that a rapist will usually serve a shorter sentence than the guy who peed in the park? Does that person deserve to be ridiculed the rest of his life?---  So, because legislators have yet to distinguish between clearly non-threatening violations such as public urination and friggin pedophiles, you think all of them including the pedos deserve to be free and clear of scrutiny despite that all the research indicates this is hard-wired behavior?  Clearly these differences need to be acknowledged and addressed, and sex offender lists reserved for the most dangerous criminals, but saying they all deserve to lurk undetected wherever they go because of a stupid discrepancy is exponentially increasing the stupidity.
Wow, wow, wow.  The loud-mouth who you hear in this video should have been arrested for inciting the crowd.  The idiot who was arrested broke the law if he was dealing--I'm pretty sure it's illegal to deal pot in the middle of downtown Eugene.  I moved from Eugene in August because I wanted a safer place to live (after my home being broken into as well as a couple of attempts to break in).  On my last day in town, I strolled through the city with sadness--it had been my home for 44 years & I have many fond memories.  On that beautiful sunny day I was accosted by several men, all wanting money.  When I said "sorry, no" I was called names & spit at.  Not very kind actions toward a 65-year-old woman.  Most of these creeps are "homeless" because they want to be.  They didn't lose their jobs--they never had jobs.  Who would want to hire them?  They refuse to be accountable or responsible for anything but their own selfish whims.  City Council, get your act together!
I read an interview with a woman who voted for Trump. Her family is on Obamacare. Her husband is on a transplant waiting list. Now she's scared that she's going to lose her healthcare, because they're saying they're going to do exactly what they said they were going to do. I'm nonviolent, but I want to crawl through the internet and smack her upside the head.
You are a misogynist.  You treat women as little tiny children unable to speak up for themselves and set boundaries as we males do routinely.  It is unfortunate for women that persons such as you who relegate them to the status of weak second-class citizens.   Gelser and Kruse are equals on the power structure.  Thus her response and interaction with him, sans your relegation to second class, would be to define limits via dialog and communication.  In your world, she as a female is a perpetual victim whose very constitution prevents her from being an equal.  You are a misogynist!
Well if John Elway is so miserable in his draft choices, what do you have to say about other teams that failed to draft Russell "The Shrimp" Wilson and Dak Prescott. For God's sake, the Dallas Cowboys selected Dak Prescott. If anything, the Cowboys are nothing but a disaster. Prescott has played well but it looks like Ezekiel Elliott is having his Achilles tendon pinched as the NFL dips Elliott in the waters of punishment. Of course, Jerrah Jones will squawk. After all, it's not okay for your star running back to beat a white woman unless you play for Dallas, "America's Team."
We should be having referendums about a lot of crap, both truedopes and cretin and martin foisted on True Canadians. The Real Men and Women of Canada.  Both this little commie dick-tator wanna be hasn't the stones.
Trump wasn't Even talking about grabbing women by the pussy either.
I am surprise she still in office after her tweet about trump should be assassinated she should have resigned or step down and the press should have gone after her, but they will not do that because she is black, remember the other lady who was in office, the one who said Michelle Obama looks like an ape in high heels they went after her and she resigned because she was white, that's how racist the news media and this black woman are.
Perhaps I'm not fair to women nationwide, because really, Washington women are the chunkiest, leaving aside sheer obesity. War-pigs, ham-planets rule DC when it comes to females of the 20-45 age-range. Slobs. It's so pathetic that chunky 4s think they're 10s and act like it. Ah well, I'm in Boston now, but I have to go down every now and then and the decline is deeper every time. And they're SO nasty on top of it, real Hillary-Feminist Ashley Judd types. Someone should do a documentary, the Uglies of Washington Politics.
Now women are giving up sex as they always had, just not getting a thing in return because they don't need it. Some try to withhold it in order to get more than sex for it, but fails miserably because there are plenty of sex starved women frequently willing to give more for it, specially if they can pretend to themselves and the world that they aren't paying for sex.  Women aren't happy with it, one because they have that itch that say sex isn't as hot if they aren't exploring the man, second because they aren't getting it easily, worst, they are having to work for it, specially because they think they could get more. Back in the day a woman was happy to fuck a guy, and if she got pregnant she was happy to have him to help her support her and his kids and to have someone to fuck for the rest of her life, and she'd be probably happy to cheat a few times too. (so would he)
All of you white folk #trump supporters have the audacity to make comments and judge and you don't have your facts straight. Let's keep it real....you're upset because a black woman #OBAMA is in charge and running things and you don't like it.....wait.....are any of you black.....thought so.....carry on.....    Take off your WHITE hoods, reveal yourselves, know the facts before spewing your ignorance and feces about the internet. Don't you have a rally to attend?  #trump #kkk or something????  Shall we meet for coffee and chit chat?  Let's go.......I'm in!!!!!
Apparently only Zionist Jews have the right to be "reactive" by electing violent radicals?  And "reaction", according to you, justifies raping and shooting helpless women, or somehow makes it less reprehensible?  And you define "comeuppance" as AMNESTY?  You make my points for me.  Please don't waste my time with this "Jews-can-do-no-wrong" gibberish.  You may take it on faith that I vehemently disagree with such bigoted fallacy.  Khalas.
"I know that the woman who lives there has been in the Salem Mental Health facility 3 times in the last 10 years."  Guess you can't fix crazy either ;)
Sent that "Google Engineer" out for a mandatory sex change and then we will see whether women are genetically unsuited for engineering.
What if it's true? Dumb is dumb by any other name too.   But: If one woman called one man a bad name would that then prove there is a world conspiracy in play to humiliate and keep men down?
Trump and his hard-core supporters care because it's not enough to sexually victimize women and children as Trump has allegedly repeatedly done.  No, they must also re-victimize people like Hillary Clinton, who's allegedly womanizing husband was unfaithful, as often as as grotesquely as possible (see 2nd debate).
If we did, we wouldn't accept a single lie, but we let them lie to us, then we feign anger about something that is irrelevant??  This has nothing to do with her sex.  It has to do with he brainless performance.  If she was a man she'd be more like prime minister Zoolander.  We have no problem with her being a female. We have a problem with her being a liar, and incompetent.
You want 'malignant'?  How about holding up a decapitated effigy of the President and Democrats think it's a hoot? How about producing plays where the President is assassinated and the left goes wild? How about a Democrat going to a baseball field to massacre Republicans and the Democrats...especially the scum Obama...show little outrage? And then we have Democrat women dressing up in the "C" caps and vagina suits prancing around and calling out for his assassination. MALIGNANT?  YOU are an IDIOT!
That is a ridiculous statement.  I am a white woman married to a full blooded Tlingit Indian.  How dare you insinuate that I am basically a whore for my children.  My husband and I have been married for over 20 years and have 4 children together.  We have both worked the entire time and support our family.  All of our children have jobs and work hard.  The reason that I married my husband is because I love him and we compliment each other.
What are they protesting?  If Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act and/or decimates Medicaid and millions of people lose health insurance, OK, good, I'll go to the Health Insurance Availability March.  If Trump twiddles his thumbs while Pooty-Poot invades Estonia, I'll go to the Support Our NATO Allies March.  If Trump and Congress spend forty million tax-payer dollars on a stupid, useless wall in the middle of the desert, I'll go to the Don't Build the Stupid Wall March.  If Trump nominates a woman-hating kook for the Supreme Court to replace that woman-hating kook Scalia, I can't be bothered to march. But if he nominates a woman-hating kook to replace RGB and if it looks like the Senate is going to confirm, I'll go the the Already Enough Woman-Hating Kooks on the Court March.  But just a We're Women and We're P*ss*d Off March? Nah, I'll skip that.
.  THIS IS HORRIBLE --- trump RAPED A 13 YR. OLD GIRL  .  "Judge sets date for hearing of lawsuit accusing Donald Trump of underage rape"  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-accused-underage-rape-lawsuit-a7352976.html  .  .  The girl was 13 years old at the time trump raped her.  .  .
Oh Kathleen, as a member of the media, you too want the candidates to play the game your way.  If it comes down to Trump vs Clinton, I'll probably go for Trump.  Clinton is in my book a glad hander who will say what voters want to hear, but will do that which most suits her rich woman needs.  Her real friends are not poor blacks, but the rich and powerful.  Trump at least is willing to take on the media's notions of political correctness.  Underneath all his bravado and slogans, Trump probably has some brains.  I don't sense that he is evil.  Sans evil and having brains, what would he do if elected.  I would like to hear the media ask him about his views on American interventionist wars.  About his views on prison reform and mandatory sentences.  About the drug war.  About funding social security.    Kathleen, you do not address such issues in your negative slam against Trump.  You address the insubstantial, the personal, that which cannot be quantified.  As the media so often does.
Then you, Rich Olson, should be on the No-Comment List.  She's NOT an airhead; she's a 71 year old who kept her head, calmly BUILT A BEAUTIFUL SHELTER BY HERSELF WITH NO FOOD for almost a week while trying to honor her loved one's memory.  If a young man had done half of this (and for no good reason at all), the coverage would be about his bravery and ingenuity and engineering skills, all while he managed to injure himself in the process and come out of it tear-stained and whining about how hungry he is, and with no mention of how a dick tax should be levied for all the times we have to bail out men for CONSTANTLY doing incredibly stupid things, putting themselves & others in grave danger.  This woman is strong, wise and created beautiful, useful things out of a scary situation that would probably leave you crying for your mommy.
this women is going thru hell can't you just all be civil about this
“Frustrated White Man”  There’s an ideology  The press has been using this ideology to justify how an idiot like Trump got voted into office.  At the end of the day, this is all Obama’s fault: after he was elected twice, Frustrated White Men everywhere could no longer count on the racist patriarchy to empower them. So they turned their frustration on other white people.  People please! This white(trash) on white(trash) crime needs to STOP. Or your country will be overtaken by women AND visible minorities, like in Canada.  To the Redoubt!
Probably the same way a lot of people on these boards think the GOP reviles minorities, immigrants, women, poor people, gay people, really anyone who isn't an old white man.  Be pretty helpful if we all stopped asserting the caricatures we've drawn of others as unassailable fact.
Agreed, if the sexually used and abuse of women is and not condemned with the most stringent opposition the bishops have absolutely no right to dictate to them about sex or reproduction.  If the Bishops don't stand with absolute horror at the lascivious "my property" for my self-pleasuring of Donald Trump, then their self-righteous crusade - as if  "vagina" belonged to them - is an equivalent abuse.
Hillary is dumb as a door nail the woman never  knows what's going on!   Hillary your finished - go away now.
OK, so long as you include Clinton on the "Pig" list, No problem. However, I should point out that numerous women work for Donald ( Some in high executive positions ) and none have any complaints about the treatment they get from him. I don't know the facts of any of these suits", but I do know filing bogus claims and lying to destroy someone they don't like is perfectly consistent with everything else the democrat party does.
Why does this story continually make the blatent mistake of referring to Mr. Manning as "she"?  No matter the amount of make-up or even surgery a man may undergo to appear as a female, he will remain a male.  Anyone who is under the mistaken belief that they are of the opposite gender requires psychological help, not a surgeon.
The threat isn't just terrorism.  There's plenty of racism where I work and it's not the white Christians - it's mainly the Muslims that don't respect womans views, or anyone they view as subordinate to them. It's also about what kind of society do you want to live in. Preferring free, open, fair & equal isn't unreasonable.
Articles such as this should point out that these facial covers are political - not religious - instruments, according to many observers, who have pointed out that these full-cover facial instruments have skyrocketed in recent decades and were not widespread in previous decades.  One such published account you can find online is called "How the Veil Conquered Cairo University". There you can see college graduation photos in Egypt of decades ago, where the hair and faces of women are freely and fully visible, their hair flowing freely across their shoulders. In recent years, suddenly their hair is covered and the lower part of a niqab is at the ready to cover their faces.  Canada appears to be a sucker. Canada has swallowed what appears REALLY to be a very recent tool of 21st-century political-power manipulation, as if it is somehow some kind of eternal religious symbol.  I suspect that most Canadians do not like being played as suckers by the industry of political-power manipulation..
Time to boycott all those who contribute to Jew hatred like yourself and the Islamists in our midst who donate to Middle East countries that engage in terrorism, female genital mutilation, honor killings of wives and daughters, gay apartheid, female segregation and rape, extrajudicial hangings, and every other human rights abuse.
I have seen enough to know not to trust any one who professes Allah and adheres to the ideology of hate, pedophilia, degrading and mutilation of woman, beheading of Christians, bombing of innocents, genocide, World conquest which are all tenents of the Islamic faith. Faith in a God who is not filled with mercy and calls for the drinking of camel piss. Allah is not God and Muhammed is just an extremist pedophile baal worshipper of the moon.
Ferguson is a partisan hack.  The Supreme Court threw out his case regarding Trump's temporary terrorist ban.  He is more interested in promoting himself than in Washington State's interests.  He will be running for a higher office.  Perhaps Democrats should concentrate more on cleaning up their own house (ie. Weinstein).   Their hypocrisy regarding Weinstein abusing women is appalling.  They knew for years he was abusing women, but still accepted his money.  Despicable.  And this included the Obamas and the Clintons.  We don't want an income tax.  But the Democrats do.  More opportunities for graft and corruption, because certain people (their donors) will need specific tax breaks.
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. Dolores Huerta is a Judas. She supported Clinton, the fake activist, when she should have backed Bernie Sanders, the true activist and the person who get shit done. In other words, Huerta is a traitor to the Democratic Party and sold out for "the first woman President of the United States" when Clinton was clearly cheating Bernie from his true nomination.
As Keith Olbermann once said, "That woman is an idiot."
The difference is that the progressive left actually has actions that conflict with their public views - Ted Kennedy leaves a young woman to die while he gets to his lawyer to concoct a story to cover his sorry ass and he is hailed as the Lion of the Senate.  Clinton rapes and harasses women and he gets pass from the very progressive feminists (I believe with was Gloria Stienham who said that men should get a one rape pass - or something like that and of course lets remember the famous words of Whoopie Goldberg speaking about the icon of the celebrity left, Roman Polanski of his sodomy of a 14 year old girl who he drugged - it wasn't rape rape!)  The progressive left are hypocrites of the first order - protected by their celebrity and the media.
Only angry fools would tear up Korans or believe that doing something like that is helpful.  And most people know that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and just trying to earn a living like everyone else. Still, our self described "thought leaders" need to dial back the tolerance shaming when perfectly reasonable people ask such questions as: * Why is an inordinate amount of violence in the world associated with Islamic societies? * Why are western progressives silent on the incongruities between women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and religious and cultural relativism? * Why do certain parliamentary motions imply that some religions are more worthy of protection than others? * Why are requests for religious accommodation in schools and other places made by Muslims often treated more solicitously than similar requests made by Christians, Jews, Hindus et al?   The answers are rooted in politics and cowardice.  Muslims are the biggest losers when such questions go unanswered.
You say not even close but you don't give any reason. If he wasn't an unpleasant person he wouldn't've acted as irresponsibly and belligerently as he did. He made himself "right" by his course of action. He manipulated the situation to his own benefit. that's why he's an opportunist and scammer just like the macdonal's woman.
Trump has been recorded bragging about trying to seduce a married woman, and has many women suing him for sexual harassment and assault. Both he and Clinton are pigs.
There's no such thing as "topless equality" since men don't have boobs.   These women are loonies.
As we watch yet again the frothing left slobbering with frothing spittle on all of us, I have a question that never gets asked nor will it ever get answered. You want anti Muslim people ( who have aright to be what they want to be and believe what they want to believe under our constitution - lets not forget this) haters (your word) hunted like criminals. Yet you never bring this up The Muslim culture and their religion Islam are like barbarians. They stone women like the middle ages They mercy kill women for some twisted belief that they have the right to They genital mutilate girls They refuse to admit that Islam is really a totalitarian political system with a small group of dictators running it) Iran, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc. They make women cover themselves and walk 15 feet behind men. Reconcile that Tell us why you condone this? Don't twist it - answer it
Take a pill roi. Klinton lost because she is a major bitch and joe average figured that out quickly.
I'll see if this gets past the Civil Comments and ADN editor. This is a special message for Wasilla State Rep. David Eastman. From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a longtime and regular Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author. She is white.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
Of course Hillary isn't to blame for her husbands infidelity . She is to blame for attacking all those women he messed around with.  She clearly knew what he was doing and enabled his behavior for her own gain . So much for her sticking up for other women. She wasn't alone.  Even women's groups attacked the women who dared to come forward and complain about Bill .  A normal woman would have kicked Bill to the curb after the second or third fool around.  She stuck with him to put herself where she is today.     Doesn't it bother you at all about all the lies Hillary has told ?  If you or I destroyed our records we'd be in jail . Both her and her husband know they are above the law and show zero regret for all their dishonest dealings. She's the most dishonest and untrustworthy person to ever run for president . Your proud to support her ?
Except with Islam where women are treated like property and beat and stoned and whatever.
How about instead of killing her innocent child, giving the woman the option to execute the guy that got her pregnant.  Do we give women these special murder rights because somehow we think they're stupid?  If anybody else kills the child, it's considered a capital crime, but if the woman kills her own offspring, that's ok?  Wicked juvenile men will keep abortion around just as long as they keep pornography around.  This enable these men to abuse women as toys, making them cheap, accessible, and exchangeable.  And the men bear no responsibility, make no commitments, and hardly bother to be considerate.  Stop killing children and start executing rapist.
A total failure as a Texas governor destroying Voting Rights and demanding installing Fundamentalist Christian religion as the law of the land.  By edict dismantling all services for women for reproductive health issues wherever in violation of pseudo-christian dogma.  One more religious fanatic dedicated to the dismantling and eradication of the Constitutional Bill of Rights except the 2nd amendment.  One more ideological Republican fascist nitwit feeding at the government trough which he proclaims to hate so much.  Disgusting.
Jim ... I'm a black woman and the thing I want to say to all white people is to STOP letting that word "racist" have so much power over you. And stop apologizing. Refuse to let those thugs and bullies diminish you and who you are as a person. You know who you are and need not constantly state that you are not a racist or a white supremacist. What everyone fails to realize is that true racism is as ancient as the days. As long as there is evil in this world such things will thrive with evil people to foment it. So is calling someone a racist going to suddenly make them not a racist? Of course not! My advise is to stand your ground.
If you think sending dick pics makes a person's mental state "questionable" (which I don't think I'd argue), then the vast majority of men have a questionable mental state and shouldn't be allowed an once of credibility.   It's just tiring how Hillary is being somehow blamed yet again for the bad behavior of yet another man; this time one she has had absolutely nothing to do with.   Meanwhile the people who hate her (and women in general) are turning a blind eye to their own candidate's violent words and actions; he's said and done horrible things and has admitted to doing them, but they'd rather vote for the person who has committed assault on multiple women than for the woman whose aide was cheated on by the husband she is divorcing for that very reason.   This is how toxic masculinity, patriarchy, and misogyny works, everyone.
Oh, yes, I'm sure you will say that because a super-minority did not have so called civil rights that we were just a dung-heap of a civilization.  Funny, those who lived in the south said that the black family was more happy and healthy than now! Many Women were on pedestals, not the unhappy lot your kind always project.  Your problem is that you watched too many Twilight zone re-runs and bought into clew-less high school drop-outs singing protest songs on the radio.
Feminist surreal nonsense.
yada, yada, yada, its like men deciding womens issues, straight people deciding lgbtq issues, christians deciding religious issues and healthy people deciding ill peoples issues. if it doesn't directly affect you, its none of your business, no matter what that invisible guy in the sky or the horned devil tells you.
Hypocrite-in-chief. Being sexist and bragging about sexual assault as Trump did in the Access Hollywood tape is despicable and an affront to this nation’s women. Does this sound familiar? "Malignant Narcissists will go to great lengths to achieve their aim.  They can be intelligent, high functioning (hold an important job for example) soft-spoken, charming, tearful/seemingly emotional, gracious, well mannered, kind and have the ability to form relationships. They may lie, falsely accuse, dramatize, smear, cheat, steal, manipulate, accuse, blame or twist to get what they want and feel justified in doing so. Because they are entitled, egocentric and desperate, they do not experience it as wrong. They are determined to gratify their wishes and furious if thwarted. Their desire can be so consuming that there is little comprehension of, respect for or ability to empathize with the other.  They lack guilt or remorse and tend to feel or pronounce that it is they who have been mistreated."
I am so tired of articles which praise Francis, while ignoring his inaction on the scandal, his positions regarding women, and his refusal to recognize that the position of the Church regarding gays is so terribly wrong.
First: Chunky Punk could never out run anyone - saggy britches were the least of his worries.  Second: APD knew he had an outstanding warrant for charges of "reckless endangerment and discharge of a firearm" - did they think they could take him easily? Should have tased his ass, read his rights and shoved his ass in the back of the patrol car. For those that scream "racism" - I think they should do that to everyone who is wanted for outstanding warrants for charges of "reckless endangerment and discharge of a firearm". It is safer for the public, and the asshat criminal. We pay cops to protect the public, not give criminals with a known history the benefit of the doubt and hope they will do the polite thing and go easily without a fight. For the love of God, TASE their asses!!  Third: I don't buy the woman's sob story of how she was "scared". She took off her shoes and ran! Not to the cops but AWAY from them. She was scared alright. Scared of getting caught!!
lol nothing surprising here.  don't care what MO wears she is still one ugly woman ... nothing wrong with that either.  you can call her educated or whatever, calling her beautiful is simply a lie. but who cares.  i never have to see her face again! as for sexualiznd BO? well, i knew all along.  90% of the lonely cannot-get-laid women in this country fantasize about having sex with him.  why do you think they are so obsessed with him?!
The majestic walls of Ontario’s legislature are hung with portraits of the province’s political grandees, and it’s hard not to notice a certain similarity among them, chiefly in skin tone (pinkish), hair colour (grey to white) and chromosomal composition (that would be XY). This similarity does not escape the attention of a group of young women passing through the halls.  ---  Don’t let the trolls win.  So the feminist troll author, is extolling the virtues of ignoring other trolls.  The irony is thick and rich and oh so hypocritical.
And Dlamini is supposedly Chairwoman of the ANC women's league.  Just shows how morally rotten and corrupt she is.
That Two Toned Trump had draft deferments as a young man are irrelevant.  Was is important that a President aka Commander in Chief has the authority to put US citizens in harms way.  What person in their right mind would entrust this narcissistic sociopath with that kind of responsibility and authority?  This man should be measured on his own merits and lack of good judgement.  Addressing his viewpoint of the military: Who in their right mind calls POWS losers and disses the bereaved parents of a fallen US soldier.  Trump's own stated Viet Nam Era 'war sacrifices' were going to bed with women and dumping them because they bored him.  Had he got a STD, he probably would have put in for a Purple Heart.
Pelosi?  Waters?  This 'woman congressperson?'   batshit crazies?  You got 'em all.
Silly boy....it's only sexism if the comments are directed at a woman.....similarly, it's only racism if the comments are directed at a non-white person.
You right wingers are full of horse hockey. NONE of you rebuked Ailes, O’Reilly or any of the Fox Fake News crowd when those perverts were chasing skirts and harassing women from 1997 through 2017. Your criticisms of the sexual predator Weinstein are nothing but partisan whining and you hypocrites never had any family values.
I guess getting $10m makes you a little cocky.  Why else would Mr Khadr think that he has the right to rewrite the conditions of his parole?  So he can associate with his terrorist sister?    This woman is still a radical.  Read the quotes from her recent social media posts.  And she pleas for her brothers release from Gitmo, but not for her ex-husband who has been held for 5 years by the Taliban in Afghanistan.  The fact that Omar wants to see her in an unsupervised setting makes me nervous.    JUST SAY NO !!!
hahahahaha, no one else defends the goon politicians and illegals like you. You're some of the best entertainment in the SA comments Caitlyn Klastri Jenner!  Ever think about running for public office? HitLIARy lost and threw in the towel and since you're now a "female", ever think about asking the plastic surgeon to make you look like HitLIARy and then you could run against Trump in the next election? LOL
We don't need M-103. We have a Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  BTW is it white males who are requiring some Muslim women to cover their face and relegate them to the back door and women seating area of mosques? Is it white men who are arranging marriages for some women. Insert mail order bride comment if you like.
Let me guess...a white boy that failed to take advantage of the educational and other opportunities that Canada provided to get ahead, so he now screams 'white genocide' because a white girl chooses to be with someone that did take advantage of the opportunities but just also happens to have a slightly different skin colour. In other words...a loser.
The queen and her family are a bunches of leeches, as useless as the senate. Canada will not be a country until we cut ties with the monarchy. Who really cares about the Prince of Wales except most of the welfare crowd who want a free ride on the backs of the working people, just like the royal family. The royal family prefers being on the dough than working. I suppose the present crowd in the royal family are not as bad as Henry the VIII chopping heads off women but they seem to be flying around the world polluting the atmosphere a lot. The royal family has a long history spending the people's wealth..didn't that Henry fella eat a lot of chicken. I doubt he cleaned out the chicken coup and shoveled the poop.
I think he should keep his genital grabbing south of the 49th. We don't need to subject Canadian women to sexual assault from visiting heads of government
Unless you read Breitbart you wouldn't know that birth control makes women unattractive and crazy.  http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2015/12/08/birth-control-makes-women-unattractive-and-crazy/
It is a tough issue.  Trump's campaign rallies are hives of violence and bigotry.  His campaign is supported by the KKK and numerous anti-immigration hate groups.  When he and his supporters embrace such racist ideals it is difficult to say that a "Students for Trump" club is much different than the "Anti-Muslim" club or a "He Man Woman Haters Club".  Trump's campaign events are closer to a hate rally than a political rally.  You have to draw the line somewhere.  Trump needs to draw the line, but he so far has refused to do so.   The voice of love needs to be louder than the voice of hate.
Eastman is an uneducated zealot. He typifies ignorance of the Dark Ages and other benighted, repressive eras of humanity. He would be a witch burner or a man who stones women to death when their beliefs run contrary to his. Thankfully, he is not bright enough to rise above his lowly political position. Just as Miz Palin was revealed as a philosophical loon and the grande dame of idiocy, so too will Eastman ultimately be gored and meet his political demise at the hands of more smart voters than dumb ones.
" the party of angry, old, white folks"???   Doesn't sound or appear rational to myself, it appears and sounds very racist. IMO your bad  Black, Face, Jim Crow, Uncle Tom joke is in rather poor taste. And of course that doesn't address the women in the republican party. However, when considering the actual racial composition reflected with in the republican party of Hispanic, Asian and Black voters. Your statement can only be interpreted as racist! But not really that surprising that you admittedly admire Hillary who btw commemorated late Sen. Robert Byrd as "my friend and mentor". When it's well known Sen. Robert Byrd was himself a KKK member and chief recruiter for the KLAN.

It's one thing for people to not like Hillary Clinton's politics or to feel she's had her turn. But my mind boggles when people say they voted for Donald Trump because Hillary Clinton lacks character or she lies. Donald Trump has character? Since when? Trump can lie, cheat and steal with the worst. And "family values", "moral responsibility" religious conservatives are the worst hypocrites. Trump has no moral center, period. He has been divorced twice and married three times, he makes money off of gambling, he has boasted about his sexual conquests, he routinely denigrates women, and before he started campaigning, the only time he ever entered a church was to get out of the rain or duck a subpoena process server. But, he doesn't drink alcoholic drinks and will throw GLBT people under the bus whenever he needs to, so religious conservatives swoon.
For today's Trump, it's putting his tiny hands in a woman's underpants.
children are mostly born with male or female genitalia. that makes them boy or girl. very few have that strange condition of both. it is this perverted culture that lives to confuse the most innocent. shame on these perverts and purveyors of filth.
Kim Jong Drumpf wanted tanks and missiles for the parade. Really?!?! He's a wannabee dictator. He has and will continue to con everyone. For any of his supporters or defenders, ask yourselves: would you have also given a pass to Obama or Clinton if they have a book of Hitler's speeches on their nightstands; had their products made in China, Slovenia, Vietnam and other countries but NOT yhe United States; went out of their way to slander a Gold Star family; said that McCain and other POW'S weren't heroes; got 4 defermements from serving in Vietnam; said that not getting any sexually transmitted diseases while womanizing was his "battlefield"; said they want to grab a woman by the p#ssy; said of people in Iowa "how stupid can they be?"; had several bankruptcies; stiffed contractors; (and for the Evangelical crowd) is on a third marriage, bragged about sleeping around and more?? Supporters say he speaks for them. If you are a supporter, which of the above speaks for you?
Interesting.  And yet the gang rape of a white female and her white boyfriend prior to their murders by a group of blacks is not considered a racially motivated hate crime. It also seems like Baton Rouge Sgt. L’Jean McKneely made a prejudicial statement.
Imagine being proud to be an organization which deliberately attempts to keep its clientele ignorant....a website listing State social services will undermine their "religious freedom"?  Let women decide their medical needs, given all pertinent information and choices!
You are probably right but the travel ban also did nothing to improve secutity for either Hqwaii or the country as a whole.  Just another example of how republicans are ruled by imaginary fears.  The Muslims are coming for your women.  Be afraid, be very afraid.  Similar to the commie threat when republicans  preached be afraid of the Russians or Chinese.   They are coming to take over the country.
oh that evil girl that caused her old men to be unavailable to pay her off for years of abuse.  totally destructive of the old man to go to jail  - ONCE AGAIN - IT'S THE GIRL'S FAULT.  you are consistent - ignorant as anyone could be in this day and age., but consistent in your 1960's stance .  what should have  the girl done?  what do you believe outsider?  just WHEN would it NOT be the woman's fault? and why do you hate women so much?
You just learn to dislike Trump and his goon squad, and 60 million people who showed who they really are under cover of a vote--  arrogant, world bully mentality, women in the kitchen bare foot and pregnant,  and white supremacist lean more and more every day.  Everything you have always disliked but knew it was still around.
Compared to Trump, Bill Clinton is a paragon of sexual restraint and marital fidelity. Trump is in his third marriage, subsequent to multiple adulterous relationships. He’s been accused of domestic and sexual violence, including accusations of marital rape (by his first wife). He's a defendant in a lawsuit alleging the sexual abuse of a thirteen year old girl. He's had innumerable girl friends, mistresses and victims. He described his efforts to avoid venereal disease while living a notoriously promiscuous lifestyle as his "personal Vietnam." In that context, he described himself as a "great and very brave soldier" -- a manifestation of his contempt for real soldiers. He's a racist and a fascist who mocks the handicapped and attacks women.  The fact that some putatively pro-life and pro-family voters have glommed on to him demeans and disgraces those causes, and the fact that some members of the Catholic clergy are giving cover to vote for him is a lasting stain on the church.
Does this mean she will be to busy to continue as Deputy Mayor and sit on the city council? You go girl we are all pulling for you! Adios! Eres tan patético, que resultas entrañable.
ugg, who would vote for this woman. she is hideous, full of contempt, lies about everything, and wants to screw everybody over equally.
There is absolutely nothing about violence against women and children.  No mention of the untested rape kits.  Alaska rates first in the nation.  This platform shows why Alaska is a predator friendly state.
Ah yes,  another delicious moment.   Trump takes a phone call from a female leader of a free nation and a bunch of snowflake losers get their panties in a wad. Its these little head fake moves that President Trump will continue to keep the idiots busy crying while we get to the serious business of righting the ship. They had their chance and fudged the bucket. Keep giving them something on a weekly basis to make them wet the bed so they don't get in the way to much. It has worked for over a year with no sign of them catching on so no need to change it up.
Anglican priests left because they hated the gay bishop they had and didn't care about women being treated with justice in church either.
Leave the poor woman alone, you millenial cry baby fucktards.
You silly woman, my home is worth over 200,000 dollars. It is the height of ignorance for you to act as if the illegal aliens are not demanding everything from us, since new demands from illegals aliens are in the news everyday. How is it we have 11 million PLUS illegals in the first place?
A native HI resident that committed numerous atrocities upon myself et al woman & children is currently housed there. Since my terrifying nightmare with him, i whole-heartedly believe in capitol punishment. i hope he gets the fungus & dies.
This is a guy with a known mental illness... Not some battered women or man.
Are you just another Black man who has kids all over the place…."that my baby mama, that my baby mama too, and that one too," and don't take care of any of them? Even Black women say it's true. And a drug dealer and pimp? No job? Let a woman take care of you? That's the stereotype I've heard for decades dude. How 'bout it?
Gay men are only sexually compatible with other men. Gay women are only sexually compatible with other women. This is a scientific fact of their biology. Gay men only have sexual complementarity with other men, etc. THIS IS A FACT! If you are going to base relationships on biological appendages, then you cannot deny consenting adults of 'committed, consenting, life long incestuous relationships' as long as the plumbing is to your personal bias. I am not advocating for this and am strictly against this, but by YOUR logic, this must also be included.
Ofcourse, you have the reading comprehension problems and apparent inability to have an adult conversation common to most trolls.    As you have never met my children and know nothing about them, you should be ashamed with yourself.  However, based on your thoughtless, poorly composed ad hominem post, I highly doubt that you have the integrity needed to feel shame.  For the record, both my children are employed (one police officer, one writer), college graduates, pay their taxes and live on their own.  Beyond that, they are kind, funny, caring, smart and strong young women.  I'm insanely proud of them.  "Go, and never darken my towels again." - Groucho Marx
I gotta say, GBA, nothing but searing,  venomous, hysterical hate flows from the mouths and letters of the Demented Democraps (sp. intentional).  And they accuse us of hate, constantly.  We hate women.we hate muslims, we hate gays, we hate America, we hate EVERY  F*****G Thing in the world. The hypocrisy astounds me. And they have no idea whatsoever.  Recently I critiqued some Democraptic letter, it had 7 sentences and 5 uses of the word HATE.
Oh jeez,  There are hundreds of cops scouring this state right now for an abducted woman and child.  You out there giving them a hand.  You going to be there when the find a dismal scene?  How about quit generalizing a group of people based on one person's mistake.  I think everyone with a beard is a dork and a wannabe tough guy compensating for other failures to measure up.  You fall in that group or am I just generalizing what I see?
sure let's support a religion that discriminates against women, kills gays for gayness and wants to vaporize Jews - let's endorse the hatred and bow down to it - this religion is overall the most the tyrannical, intolerant value system known to man - hey editorial writer wonder why Canada is ripe for a populist uprising - its cuz u keep telling people that criticism is racism when it is not and for u to cherry pick single incidents as relevant proof shows how shallow ur arguments are - where was ur team when anti-semitism was rearing its ugly head at McGill or do u editorial writers at the G&M condone violence aginst a specific group - maybe we should punch a journo today - shows how limited ur thinking is but go on back to ur silo and listen for the echo to confirm ur bias - wrong on some many levels but that's the G&M Canada's answer to fake news
SJWs are the most fragile little snowflakes.  Ask them what they want and you will find 'justice' means money handed to them so they can live the high life.  She is free to move to Pakistan, lots of room to champion womens' rights there, just watch out for the non white guys throwing acid in your face, better yet why not move to a reserve and work with her beloved natives there, oh wait she's not allowed there because she isn't native and therefore excluded.  The stupidity of these social justice warrior communists is not surprising given they are usually gender studies or indigineous studies grads, totally useless degrees, which is why this crowd hates science and math.  When will Justine Trudeau be going there to take a selfie with her while he scolds everyone else for being a tax cheat and not doing their fair share?  This stupidity infects our government which is why the likes of khan feel so emboldened.  She should be expelled.
This news story has generated more letters, comments, articles, etc. than any other that I can remember in my 40 years in Eugene. Most have been thoughtful, honest, insightful, and have given me a lot to think about - particularly in regards to my own biases, both the ones I know and those I don't even know that I have. No matter how much I read, talk, watch, experience, empathize with, etc, I will never know what it is like to be Black, a Woman, a Jew, Gay, etc. I will never be able to fully know what it is like to be anyone else other than myself, and no one else will ever know what it is like to be me.   I doubt we'll ever be able to fully and collectively bridge the racial divides and prejudices in this country. We don't seem to be able to learn from our collective past without being labeled by it and stuck in it. Since I can't change it, I say live in the present and treat yourself and fellow human with as much dignity, integrity, understanding, civility, etc. as you can muster.
I am so not surprised to see a woman gleefully demean the character of men. Like she's doing us a public service by sharing her "here's how I like to hate people!" point of view. Toxic, indeed. Getting SO sick of this crap.
Trump cont - Pulled strings/paid to have current wife jump to the head of the line over others who'd been legally waiting for years for citizenship - Sued multiple times for fraud, sexual harassment etc. - Believes it's ok to sexually assault women; enjoys "grabbing them by the pussy" - Believes it's his right to walk into teenage girls dressing rooms unannounced   - Used money donated to his "charity " to pay off legal settlements, buy self portraits and other personal items -LIED about Clinton being "fired" from Watergate (per Snopes.com) - Has consistently LIED about Clinton in order to further his goal of becoming a dictator.  - Proven Pathological liar - Has installed proven white supremacists and Xenophobes as Cabinet members and part of his inner circle - Refuses to disclose income tax returns showing ties to Russia - Using the Presidency for personal financial gain - Refuses to put assists in a blind trust -  Lied about Flynn -  Repeatedly breaks Constitutional Law Cont.
Numbers 31:15-18 discusses biological warfare a psychopathic version of god sent against its own people followed by the edicts that innocent women and boys be put to death, and that virgin girls be taken and raped. Are the pathological acts of a deranged version of a paternalistic god holy or moral?
Do you realize how many of your silly posts are personal attacks on Donald Trump?  We get it, you don't like men who espouse a traditional image of masculinity, patriotism, and an eye for attractive women.  Just because you don't like him doesn't mean that everything he does is wrong or is a conspiracy.  It looks like snow....
This kind of adults forcing kids goes on a lot.  This time it made news because it was a sympathetic little white girl.  I taught for over thirty years and have seen coaches (football primarily)extol pain and inflict it in practices to prepare young boys for the pain they will feel in games. Talking heads even extol 'playing through the pain' and fans boo when a player will decide for himself when to sit out rather than go back in.  This is one of the few cases when being a white male in america can be a disadvantage. It's very similar to sexual abuse with adolescents.  We snicker and give light sentences to adult females having sex with underage males, but are horrified if an older man who diddles little girls and give him decades in prison.  Sexism at its most hypocritical.
Libs believed Clinton when he wagged his finger and claimed he didn't have sexual relations with that woman.
I have to laugh at you. So you believe that Planned Parenthood ignores serving 60% of poor people, and serves only poor blacks and Hispanics. Really? Our nation's largest women's reproductive health organization is ignoring 60% of women in need of health care and affordable contraception? You really believe that? Fine, but here you are trying to convince others of what you believe is the truth, without an ounce of proof. Without proof that Planned Parenthood is ignoring all the poor white mothers and serving only black and Hispanic women, you won't convince me or anyone else with a functioning brain and a dose of common sense that you know what you're talking about.  Here's AT:  "They are preying on poor people, the largest portion who are minorities." Two lies in one short sentence. PP is SERVING women with services they WANT and NEED; and the largest portion, a 60% majority, of poor people are white. You just can't get it right - your bigotry stands in the way.
Israel is a beacon of peace and stability surrounded by chaos, violence, and regression. Look at Hamas and Fatah, they are still teaching their kids starting from Kindergarten that Israel is a cancer that must be removed from the middle east - why would Israel negotiate with rabid animals who reward terrorists for stabbing pregnant women in grocery stores. Until Israel is recognized - they have no reason to negotiate with rabid terrorist cowards.
garycrum:    Nice post and I agree with you.  Kitz and his" Strumpet friend with privileges",  Hayes need to isolate themselves on their Marijuana Farm and stay completely out of Politics or any association with it.    I thought Kitz was a Intelligent Man up until he became involved with Hayes.  Kitz should be totally ashamed of himself for letting this woman suck(sorry for the pun), and screw(sorry for the pun), up his career and drag him  down to the bottom of the PIT.  As many Intelligent people state," Kitz and Hayes, quit digging, you have reached the bottom of the hole"................  Read the Sign:  DENIAL at Work Here................
Well if they pass this law grown men will be in the bathroom w your granddaughter because the law forces them too. They are men (with vaginas) that like girls.
I am going to try one more time to get my husband to stop our Sunday subscription to ADN.  WE stopped 7 days long ago but after this Sunday's paper where all the editorials either bashed Donald Trump or the GOP I think it is time to stop a liberal woman and her view of the world in publishing nothing but a continued far view left opinion of the world.  You are a joke!
I understand your position, but let me bring a counterpoint. "Someone may be uncomfortable" is not really the best comparison. The simple threat of bathroom bills like this have resulted in more than 20 women being assaulted for being allegedly "transgender" across the country. Transgender people have faced actual bodily harm and death at a far higher rate than average society. This isn't simply "feeling uncomfortable" it's actually a matter of personal safety.  As for non-transgender people being uncomfortable: Why are we so worried about what other people are doing in the bathroom if it doesn't directly affect us? I feel uncomfortable around people that open-carry guns because I know there's lots of idiots out there. Does that means I campaign against the right to open carry? No.
Isn't it odd that no comments are allowed that oppose the authors views? There is no truth here, just garbage from a woman ashamed of her God given hair .
And in the end, everyone of these city Council imbeciles will be reelected.  Hard to keep up, is that 90-year-old woman running again? If She is, I will bet the the farm she'll be reelected. ReMember who installed the city manager
The whole surfing thing is racist and sexist and a rip off of the native Hawaiians who got slammed into the dirt by the sixties surf dudes who established a mini dope funded empire along the seven miles of the north shore and today are a rich band of thieves using air bnb real estate they purchased using dope cash. how many kids got trapped in that racket, not only how many girls fell victim to their abuse....
He's a misogynist who thinks women are weaker than men and need to be given special privileges to compete with men.
I ask you about labour's socialist policy and you give me a diatribe about the Austrian school. British Labour to day hate the lower class worker/men. Plus you quote Krugman! What the hell do these two have to do with policy this election? You have a grasshopper mind that flies all over the place when cornered and a simple truth is asked. Krugman's Nobel prize means zero, for 8 years of Obama he defended QE and poo pooed the idea of a huge debt being a problem. Early Jan this year he questioned the correctness of a high debt, wonder why, confused or Lefty BS? In 1987 Kinnock's Labour said: 'this election faces the British people with choices more sharp than at any time in the past 50 years'. Corbyn 2017: 'what makes this election different is that the choice is starker than ever before.' Wonder why they got trashed both times? The British voter (most) have good BS detectors.  Both times it was un-loved women doing the trashing, wonder why? Tell Labour to jump into the 21st era.
If I were the Eugene Girl Scouts, I would take everybody I knew and set them up in front of a dispensary.... All those hungry stoners... It would be a gold mine for the girls.  And, threaten a city wide boycott of sales if the jerks in Portland object...  Adults can be real assholes.
sorry but it looks like this "boy" was getting what he wanted!, 16-24 times sneaking out of his dorm to have sex with her.  doesn't look forced at all.  boy got his rocks off!!! and now suffers from humiliation and crap!! back in my old days, we would've bee the stud muffin if we could get 16-24 from a adult women.  sorry but i don't buy this sad story that they are portraying this kid. he has some fun and now he and his mother wants money since they spend tons on tuition. and WTF is he doing there when his family is on the mainland. rich punk ass kid if you ask me.  ok i'm opening myself up to all the trashers, come on give it to me like he gave it to that supervisor hahahaha.
The Liberals don't know their history thats why they are letting all these people in..In 1971 The Muslims KILLED over 2 MILLION East Indians and raped 200,000 WOMAN. Such a peaceful clan..
Just checked-out the web site: "newemangalization" the author referred to. Yes "new - MAN - gelization". This is so ridiculous, sexist and retrogressive that it would be funny if it weren't so insulting.  It is something that NCR should shun and not render a shred of dignity.  "There is a strong emphasis on Catholic men asserting leadership in their famillies...."; "sports luminaries".  "They are told there are dangerous cultural crosscurrents  out there, threats to the family that Catholic men need to oppose... (feminism???? wink, wink) Cardinal Burke would be pleased.
Wow this lady just stereotyped all black women as automatically being Clinton voters. That's messed up. People have their own opinions, "black women" is not a monolith. You can't complain when other groups do this to you then turn around and do it to yourself without at least acknowledging the double standard (if you want anyone to take you seriously).
The fat lady is stepping up to the mic.....
He made a racist comment. He insulted her.  He sexually harassed women left and right and recently settled some of those in court.  You are victim blaming and it is dishonorable at best. I thought religious people were supposed to protect the women and children, not their demagogue.
heck no! you must be male. being female, i do not want you in my locker room/changing room/bathroom/shower. are you crazy? you liberals are certainly sounding more and more that way. yay, pepper spray!
Allan, killing more female fetuses than male fetuses? do you mean this is not equality for females?
But what about the other data from these 10,000 cases?   How many were alcohol involved? How many were friends or lovers already? \  The fact is 1 in 100 people are psychopaths but not that many will act on it. 1 in 100 women are psychopaths too, not just men. Women can hide their metal issues also borderline cases. These women will lie and claim they were raped as revenge.  ^  Must watch "Six Subtle Gateways to Borderline Hell "  ^  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iihsbrwqZLU
Anti-homosexual, woman-hating religious fanatics are not exclusive to Islam. Christianity-inspired terrorism is something with which Americans are already quite familiar and the fanatics even have their own party: the GOP.  Violent Christian fanatics vote Republican.
Trump's boasting of grabbing a woman's pussy without her permission is not locker room bragging. To call it that is to denigrate women, men, and locker room talk. He was the presidential candidate,. but given the alternative of Hillary, people minimized his behavior and the women who confirmed his sexual assaults. As Meleana said, "boy talk" from a presidential candidate.  You second assertion that we assume Christians agree with everything a politician does is not correct. We know Christians are generally not single issue voters, but many ARE Right to Life Voters. When Trump said a woman who gets an abortion must be punished, he got the Right to Life vote.  And no, they should not have voted for Hillary either. All I would ask is that they admit they are not so pious as they profess (but then deny because they are "humble before God). Trump is a narcissist who even complained that he got Person of the Year instead of Man of the Year. Winning for him is empty because he beat losers.
Step away from fiction for a sec, and consider something that's real: Man and woman agree, "hey, we're dating, let's have some consensual sex." "okay?" "okay."  "Hey, so we agree we don't want kids [yet]."  Yesses all around. Guy asks, "so you pro-choice?", she says yes. Later, she gets pregnant, and tells him she wants to keep it.  Law says he's obliged to pay child support for a child he didn't want, conceived unintentionally by a woman who reneged on her word that  a) she didn't want to become a mom, and b) also concurred about being pro-choice.  Effectively, she stole his sperm and used that sperm to extort him for money.  If you can find the man's reproductive rights in this picture, please let the rest of us know.  (Hint, no Margaret Atwood book is required to answer).
"Why don't you approach a breast feeding woman and ask for some human milk. (?)"  Umm... because I would get slapped. Or worse. But, your brainless comment actually points out the problem: human milk can't be picked up at the grocery store; cow's milk can.
https://youtu.be/4Ka-Zg4tlLE Making women sexual slaves, cheap, accessible, and exchangeable is preferred over brood mare.  Whether the woman is forced to abort or forced to carry, she is being put in this predicament by a society that values sexual freedom more then her rights, dignity, and personal freedom.      And then there is the children, slaughtered to the god of sexual freedom, freedom from parenting, and freedom from having to form family units, monetary freedom, education, and a life without commitments.  The infants blood is being spilled and their limbs ripped off.  As people reject God, are they forced to serve the devils systems, forced to get by depending on his lies, trusting in a belief system.  Whether you believe the baby should have human rights before first breath or not, you are depending on a belief system to make that call.
Nazis and white supremacists enthusiastically supported Trump's candidacy, are emboldened by his election, were given high-ranking positions in the White House, a woman gets murdered by a white supremacist at a white supremacy rally (for which the president bewailed the violence "on both sides"), and for some reason NCR devotes column space to racism. Go figure!  RD thinks the tail end of Jim Crow were glory years for the African American community and that racism is a "manufactured crisis." He's just clumsier than most conservatives about revealing the ignorance and racism cultivated by the GOP ever since Nixon and the Southern Strategy. I said "Southern Strategy." Time for the crickets to do their thing.
I think this whole thing is ridiculous. For crying out loud, it's a name, not a lifestyle. The things people are offended by these days has gotten out of hand. I no longer wish to be called white, cracker, caucasian, or racist. I am a light skinned, person of the female persuasion. How STUPID does that sound?  I am a human being. Why can't that be enough? The name of the restaurant signifies nothing more than a seasoning, and food from a specific era, but it is a catchy title. Should we all boycott McDonald's because the name sounds Scottish but they don't serve Scottish food? How about Subway, their food has nothing to do with underground transportation. Does the name Texas Roadhouse offend Texans? See where I'm going with this. It is just too much! If the name bugs you that much, don't eat there, and stay out of it. The owner doesn't want to force their beliefs on you or erase your culture. They just want to feed you. How about we find something important to get upset over?
I agree it is a grievous thing to seduce a 22 year old woman when you are a 50 year old married president. As you point out, it's an abuse of position even if it is consensual and legal.  As for cheating on Hillary, that's a private matter and the fact that it became a matter of state at the time is an indication of the stupidity of Republicans and by extension, Americans.  Bill is a sleaze bag. Trump is more like Jerry Sandusky. He should not be around female children of any age.
The story above does not point to much evidence that the parents have taken the actions of their son seriously. How does one convey to the child/young adult that what he did--taunt a boy with autism and a girl with a hearing impairment--on four separate occasions--with sexual references to oral sex and pornography, is not only serious but seriously despicable when they are using every technicality they can find to eliminate the consequences of his actions?  These young men who rape passed out women do not appear on college campuses out of nowhere. They're made by the parents who fail to instill a basic ethical foundation in their child. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. They seem like a family of scumbags and I hope the parents leave the area when their cretin-like son goes off to college.
Here's an interview with Trump's so-called campaign manager, Kellyann Conway and a CNN commentator.  The CNN commentator is presenting Kellyann with ANOTHER Trump video/audio of when he was the owner of a beauty pageant.  Trump is heard on this audio tape declaring ONCE AGAIN that because he's the owner of the pageant he has a right to go behind stage and walk in on unsuspecting naked contestants.  Come on people, this guy belongs in prison for a long time for sexually assaulting women.  Now there's three more women that have gone public with what Trump did to them.  And by the way, Kellyann is acting like a stupid dumb blonde with her hands behind her back as Trump is stuffing paycheck envelops in her hands while she's in the media center stage lying through her teeth.  Money talks and Kellyann Conway BS walks.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC9DhD0lxCo
"TV ads,guy is an idiot,woman is smart and stable." From my observation on modern sitcoms now even the family 8 year old daughter (it is NEVER the son) is smarter than the father and has to teach him about life, not the other way around. It is the reason that I mostly refuse to watch sitcoms anymore.
Father, aka "Vinnie Murphy" has been having an affair. His mistress has been blogging about it. Took me about two minutes to figure who she was talking about. (37 year old woman working in medical field)  https://myspiralingaffair.com  im fucking sick after reading this shit, and what he's doing to his family thats already grieving over this loss. And all she thinks about is me me me! Poor wife. Poor family. I'm so sorry.
Hmm. So, do you message women you don't find attractive on dating sites? Would you want to marry a woman you're not physically attracted to?  Funny how the idea of men being "visual creatures" is simply taken for granted. It is what it is.But how dare women want to date men they're physically attracted to. Who the heck do they think they are?
Islam is synonymous with homophobia.   They also treat their women like camel dung. Why are you coddling and protecting Islam?  http://pjmedia.com/homeland-security/2016/06/12/orlando-night-club-attack-by-known-wolf-terrorist-previously-investigated-by-fbi/
While NCR correctly promotes a dialogue on sexual issues, the laity have moved on. To admit of a single change in its current interpretation of sex is to cause its house of cards to tumble.  An issue near and dear to celibate men only. No women, even celibate, have a seat at the table. There is no table only a throne for pronouncements.  "If bishops like Paprocki were more vocal about their opposition to masturbation ..." This one issue would cause the house of cards to tumble.  It is still a mortal sin to masturbate. The RCC isn't even going to reduce it to a venial sin.  A male who needs to give a sperm sample for a medical evaluation commits a mortal sin. A one way ticket to hell!  "Every sperm is sacred."  Same-sex marriage will not be accepted, especially between  males, because sperm is not deposited in the proper receptacle .
Stop being politically correct. Since those assholes from hurricane Katrina showed up, Anchorage has gone to hell. What do you expect from people who act like barbarians. No moral values. Irredeemable. Nothing to salvage.  It's fascinating to see native Alaskans embrace and enable the lifestyles of these savages, especially the females of Alaska. Theres nothing admirable about these thugs. You can tell a pig by the company they keep. Lay down with dogs you get fleas. Just keeping it real. Police officers need to put leashes around those dogs necks. I just said what needed to be said.
"Many women will be wearing pink knitted caps with cat’s ears after a grassroots initiative called the Pussy Hat Project took off."  And who do they think will care? Seriously - who do they think they are going to convince of *anything*?  All the weeping and wailing that has gone on because Trump had the support of enough people to win under their system... what do people think it is going to accomplish?  The Dems lost because they were arrogant and too unwilling to think the the people who disagreed with them might have some validity to their positions.  Instead they lumped almost half the people into a group, looked down upon them and spat.  And having lost their reaction is - incredibly - that what they really need to is to dole out even more of what cost them the election because, surely, people just didn't hear/know/understand how stupid they were being and they just need to be told in even louder and stronger terms. They are already well on their way to guaranteeing a 2nd term.
Free speech takes another hit from the Liberals.  My taxes pay for women to kill their babies. I am in disagreement with this, and I now have no choice to free speech because they are easily triggered.   Step one- go to an abortion clinic and protest the suppression of free speech. Step 2- get arrested for violation of foreign feminist policy.  Step3-  Have case thrown out in court. Step 4- Protest abortion in front of abortion clinic  The law can not enforce this, unless they intend to violate your rights as a citizen to accommodate feminism.
This is why I always say never marry and keep dating many women at the same time. No hard feelings, then ultimately give them $2.50 so they can take DaBus to some other schmucks house as soon as they start yapping about their personal issues I could care less about.
It would be plagiarism if Sid took credit for Tom Burke's writing  What was Sid writing about? He was calling the President a big fat liar. He listed his sources and almost dared you to prove him wrong. All you could say was  "this man hates others". I can fill this comment with all the lies and hate spewed forth by Donald Trump. So is Donald Trump a liar? . Is Donald Trump an unrepentant sinner. I believe you are a serious Christian and a Christian supporting Trump. Is Donald Trump a repentant sinner? He lies again and again and is unapologetic, he has committed adultery at least twice that we know of and shows no remorse, molested women and is shameless, demeans women over and over again with no apologies, is he unrepentant; remorseless, unashamed,shameless, unapologetic! I side with Sid. . A repentant sinner would go and sin no more, “See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you”  . Donald Trump is a liar and a unrepentant sinner. or prove him wrong.
If I passed by Buddy (Mr. Scheer) as I walked down a bus aisle ... I would not have recognized him. Good luck with that. :( I like the idea of a PM who is (probably) as smart as me ... who has the stones to defy his province's stupid dairy policy ... who can seduce and poke a gorgeous dangerous woman (as opposed to leasing one) ... and who could pound me into a pulp if I "messed" unfairly with him. Just sayin' ... Basic Canadian lumberjack mentality ...
Keep these right wing religious fanatics off of trying to regulate women's bodies.  It's none of your damn business!!!
This chick is as idiot-liberal as it gets. She thinks she's smarter than all those bad guys out to get her for doing nothing wrong. She's just sure the national press will pick up on her story, paint her as a doe-eyed naif being shot down for innocence and scare all the bad guys off. Little Blonde Riding Hood.
Never hire a Muslim, a Black person or a female...ever!
Here's a rap:  Yeah I think my daughter's fine - I'd date her if I could I love women everywhere  I grab them by thepusy  They don't respond, they think I'm crass I don't wait I just start kissing They're just a pieceofass.
What a hypocrite that women and The BC Libs are.  First they jack up my premiums this year by 10% even thought they promised not to implement the 4% increase and now they say they are outdated premiums. If they are SO outdated then do away with them all together.   This is nothing more than a stunt that sadly will fool many. After the election and if they are elected those premiums will once again rise just like they have in the last few years to the tune of about 40%, Come on people don't be taken in by being bribed with your own money that should have never been taken from you in the first place.  Christy deserves to be punted to the obscure back waters.
I don't care who screwed who!! I want positions on the issues! Republicans always turn the discussion to sexual conduct, deny Women have rights, and taint the whole election process with their constant attack on human sexual proclivities. EVERY TIME!!!  ISIS is destroying the world along with climate change and all we hear about is genitalia!  What have Americans become?
"Simply, the word “sucks” abuses those who perform “fellatio” by referring to them as “contemptible” people. It is extremely misogynistic and homophobic, yet both men and women use it."  According to my research, both males and females perform  “fellatio" and on both genders.  And have for at least five or six thousand years.    I recently saw a mural in Pompeii that advertised the availability of the service in a business establishment of the time.   That was only a couple thousand years ago, (79 years after the death of Christ mentioned in this Letter) but it wasn't a new concept even then.  Sylwester needs to worry about his own "evil intentions, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander” and let the rest of the society muddle through.
Married priests are a no brainer, these men are already educated, ordained and ready to go. The deranged hierarchs that run the Catholic Church are amazing.....if you rape dozens of 8 year old kids you can say mass for the rest of your life.....if you marry a woman you are banned from celebrating the Eucharist. How many more parishes will have to be closed before the laity stand up to these ignorant leaders.
Dear miadonahue: Do you have personal knowledge that the accusation is true" Or are you saying the 52 year old woman making the accusation is the  creep?
All of us are treated differently....some because of skin colour....some because of ethnic sounding names....some because of age....some because of visible affluence. It is the way it is in life.  Most people treat police officers with respect, or at least cooperation.  Black culture (hip hop etc) treat police as scum who deserve to be shot. Perhaps black fathers should be present in the home and set positive examples for their black sons....or perhaps young black women shouldn't get pregnant by men who are unreliable at best.  Seems obvious to me.
No, it shouldn't be debated. Let's debate how a man gets zero blame or shame for impregnating a woman and rarely pays even a fraction of the upkeep for his offspring if he doesn't want to, and how his vasectomy is covered, as is his penis hardening medication and contraptions, but for women, not so much.
A co-worker of mine attended the rally.  He told a Trump supporter he was there just because he was curious and he was voting for Sanders and the man immediately started shouting and calling him lazy.  (He is working full time and going to school).  My friend then witnessed a group of African American protesters being called the n word repeatedly.  He also saw a Trump supporter with his grand daughter in tow, yelling at a woman protester and calling her a cunt. Get your blinders off.  The blatant racism and sexism displayed by Trump and his supporter is just plain wrong.  You should be ashamed that you can't see that that is a problem.  Race-baiting, degrading women, and name calling  by Trump has attracted jerks who seem to think that is OK.  It's really easy to just go along with the bully while he tears down others around him.  He is unstable, un-presidential, and manipulating people. He is a spoiled billionaire, narcissist, who plays on people's fears and prejudices.
To admit that Bill Clinton is a sexual predator would validate why people did not vote for Hillary. Third Wave Feminist would put on aprons kick off their shoes and start to make sandwiches before they would ever admit to that.
Yes, in 2012 the Harper government tried to revive the FMCT, “when it sponsored a resolution at the UN General Assembly establishing a commission of experts to push the matter forward”.  One would think that it would be in Freeland’s interest to underline that in promoting the FMCT the Trudeau government is just continuing efforts of the previous government , to underline that there is a bipartisan consensus on this issue. However, she is a mean-spirited and egotistic woman, so she prefers to ignore the efforts of her predecessors to promote the FMCT.
God is bisexual, eh? Both male and female. I guess that solves my question about sex.  As for Jesus, we're in agreement. Joseph was a cuckold and Mary was an adulteress.  Back to God's gender for a moment: Adam was created in God's likeness, not Mary. I think God was considered a "he." Certainly, but Church of Rome authority he was and that's the original font of Christian knowledge.  So, God's a guy with no woman around for eternity. That would explain a lot.
Excellent article. Women have become nearly completely useless while they actively try to destroy the very men who built society and and protect them from death only to receive nothing but ridicule in return. Men should let women learn a lesson and let them save themselves. I bet in a year a hollywood movie will come out that will have a lead actress saving men in herricane Harvey. Women are ungrateful and become a detriment to society.
Thinks he's picking up a hooker. Turns out it's a lady looking for a ride. Dude's hate takes over.
I actually do respect other cultures which are worthy of respect...9th century throwbacks who make women wear a tarp in public and throw gays off of rooftops on the other hand? You're right don't respect them and never will. He displayed an undue "level of respect" for the leader of a nation which is unworthy of it and the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks of you dig deep enough.
Quran (7:80-84) - "...For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)".  So the most intolerant and easily influenced followers of Islam feel that they have a duty to make that happen.  And the others ... are not sure.   Of course the Bible has a similar verse, but the New Testament then has a better message to love your neighbor and to love God.  And that helps considerably, for most people. Muslims are a greater danger to gay people than Christians are.  I stand with our gay brothers and sister in solidarity against Muslim terrorists.
So that mean that women better just get back to their natural purpose, makin' babies and cleaning the house?      What is helping our nation is the immigration of talented young people, many from Asia, comming to our nation attracted by the 'open' culture that doesn't demand for them to dance is wooden clogs, or wear shawls that cover their heads.        We're going to screw that up and sink with an aging population that is holding back nations such as Japan.     People who don't see immigrants as a potential positive to the nation are foolish.    *I support 'controled' immigration, not bigoted and racist banning of people who want to live in a growing and peaceful society.  The author is right, this is all about being a white America to people like King.  And if not King, just ask yourself if your happy standing next to cheering KKK members who clearly see him as 'one of ours'.
Turing was persecuted because he was gay, even after his heroism in the war.  That is the type of society we had in the west when the Church had more "leadership."  The same ethic is trying to block women priest, but it is dying out.
Dear oh dear oh dear.  Alceste is at it again.  Let me try to give you some of the common sense that my billy goat has.  While not every single solitary Muslim wants to create a shadow legal and social system in western countries, many do.  There are documented cases of this occurring in the US, UK, and Canada.    There are many Muslims who practice things that we consider abhorrent in North America - like making women second class citizens and throwing gays off buildings.  I suppose you are against the sanctioned misogyny and homophobia in Islam, but maybe you are not.  But I am against it and I do not want even an inkling of that hatred here.  And, Duke has as much right to a post a comment as anyone else.  Just as you do and just as I do.  If you don't like a comment then engage.  You and I have done so on many occasions, and while rare, I have found that sometimes you have made some comments that are nearly as good as mine.  : )  Seriously, though, debate, teach, and learn.
No - you are NOT right. Debate about abortion is fine when it is rational and compassionate. Under those terms solutions may actually be found. Our societal problems do need to be addressed and discussed, but what you and other "holier than thou"  one-issue obsessed Catholics do concerning abortion is not argument- it is bullying and demonizing the pathetic women who find themselves in a crisis situation.  It's not Christian behavior towards those we need to have compassion for. There is no "pro-abortion" stance. No woman could possibly want to have an abortion!  As soon as your nasty inflammatory language comes out - you lose any pretense of rational debate. You just end up looking like sadistic, sexist, insecure, schoolyard bullies.
Any group that proposed ordination of women or other forms of rebellion against legitimate Church teaching deserves excommunication.
the good sam that stepped in did so because someone was crazily bigoted against these women. had it just been two women, the story would be very different. there  would have not even have a motive.. no telling who this guy would have gone off on...he is a loon.
Trump: a sexual predator and racist hate monger who lost the popular vote.  Children, especially girls, and people with darker skin have excellent reasons to be worried.
You're a crazy lady/man/person whatever. You're just plain crazy.
Alaska......Breeding ground for terrorist, pedofiles, rapists and all kinds of deplorables! All you have to do is read the crime reports! You can run people over with your car in Anchorage Alaska and KILL them and do one year in jail........ More domestic violence and rape against women per capita than anywhere else in north America I bet you're really proud of yourself Alaska! Maybe we should just give Alaska back to Russia!

The men can see the park while peeing in the urinals the women's bathroom is on the other side so people saying this may be a feature are ridiculous
Between the porn industry and gratuitous, lighthearted sex scenes between unmarried partners, you'd think that there wasn't an STI epidemic.  For example, 80 percent of all people under 50 years of age will have a strain of the cancer-causing hpv virus at some point in their lives.  Cervical cancer is almost exclusively caused by HPV and it is the 2nd leading cancer in women. Worldwide, cervical cancer kills over 250,000 women every year.  And all that cutting-edge homosexual sodomy in TV and the movies?  Look up the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  Oh, those backward Catholics.
No actually. They will sit down like any other woman. Stop being ignorant
The last paragraph of this review... groan. Yes, Caitlyn's serious-- Caitlyn was showered with adoration until she announced that she was voting republican as Bruce always had. Suddenly the same people who insisted that Caitlyn Jenner was the most beautiful, brave woman on the planet — Glamour Magazine's Woman of the Year! -- were calling Jenner a pig and a waste of space because Jenner was a Republican. For Jenner, it certainly was easier to come out as trans then as Republican.  Pay attench, Rachel! Pay attench!
Evidence as in multiple witnesses?  So, your reaction is to make the women into liars.  Hmmm.......loser.
This woman is irrelevant.
Fake plastic woman who knows what else is fake.  She is the epitome of what is wrong with the culture of the fake crude American woman.
Please tompaine are you really going to try to defend bill Clinton's long and storied history of raping women? Starting with the poor girl he raped to get booted out of England and his Rhodes scholarship? Over 40 women have come forward and accused him of rape ... which one would you like to start with ?
.  Move on Ladies and Gentlemen,  nothing to see here.  Larry Smith is an idiot of mammoth/biblical proportions, whenever his name is mentioned, better move on in the name of sanity, intelligence and integrity.  Larry Smith never had any of these qualities/attributes and he is not about to acquire them at this time, now is he?  .
He called her a mongoloid if I remember correctly. Basically, fat and ugly. She got offended because she thinks she is the most beautiful woman in Portland and got him taken off social media and reported his followers to their employers saying they threatened to rape and kill her, even going so far to report someone to his own mother.
You can't be serious . As I've mentioned in another reply in this section I'm all against deadbeat dads . I even pointed out how Alaska needs to go to the system many states use of if a dad won't pay , or is behind , they go to jail.   A man knocks a woman up , of course he is responsible to pay until the child in 18 . In some states he has to pay until the child finishes college.   My point is , if women really controlled they're body , they wouldn't get PG and wouldn't do what it takes to get PG unless they had protection.  Sure , a man should use protection as well , but the buck stops with the woman. She alone can decide if she wants to get PG or if she wants to kill an innocent nearly born baby. Except in the case of rape. Rapists should be executed . If Planned Parenthood is all women have concerning health care---they are in deep trouble . IF PP really cared about women , they'd stop doing abortions and over night the conflict would be gone towards the use of taxpayer money.
Wow! This woman not only consumes drugs in public, but then endangers the entire community by driving afterwords. This is definitely NOT the responsible example that desperately needs to be set for our kids. How dare this woman expect to keep her job?!? If she has such an addiction that she is doing hard core drugs in a public place, she needs help...but certainly has no business teaching kids. Get help, and get another job. I work in health care and would never expect to keep my job if I was engaging in that kind of behavior. It's called zero tolerance for a reason, and the policy should be for the teachers, too. Not just the kids. How hypocritical that would be...and send exactly the wrong message to those middle schoolers.
Tell that to the Islamists who pray five times a day.  Tell that to the sex fiends who are teaching Grade 3 students homosexuality and gender identity  What kind of men and boys will these students be to women when they have no "SELF CONTROL".
Many milennial women like myself don't feel called to marry the immature losers that remain single.
An intelligent, educational review of the blight of fundamentalist christianity on this nation.  For additonal history and information on the entire mythological basis for the Jesus Christ/Christianity lie read, Man Made God by Barbara G. Walker.  An intensely researched, documented, footnoted revelation of the greatest lie and ultimate system of lies ever perpetrated on the world's humanity.  Jesus never existed and the creation of Chrisitanity was done by a 2nd Century A.D. Pope in collusion with a Roman Emperor to get rid of all of the pagan gods to bring all under better control under one god.  The miracle and tales were gleaned from previous religions to be applied to the Jesus Christ character.  None of it is true.  Everything coming out of the mouths of preachers, priests, bishops, popes is based on an absolute lie.  The patriarchal establishment of men superior to women and ruling over them isn't found in history until One God religions were created.  All by Men.
This woman is like that idiot dad...  now an idiot mom.  Quit politicizing your son's death you fool.  Dems will chew you and spit you out like they did with Weinstein..
The Lesbian commenting above is a perfect example.  They care only about themselves - no need to read the US Constitution nor accept that many of us are sickened by their actions.  A man showering in the same locker room at a pool where women and girls go to the bath room and shower??   Sick.  Call the police - there's a pervert who needs to be arrested.  Claiming that he is a she makes him a mentally ill pervert.
Yep. Feminism: the cause of everything from penile cancer to athlete's foot.
yeah...so speaking of trolls.  just pulling into the driveway of my friends house to walk her dog while she recoups, there is a guy on a bike PULLING BY HAND, A CHILDS WAGON!  had extension cords half hanging out..... god knows what else in it.....  these guys are truly creepy and predatory - both in the most truest form of those words.  they are as bold as one can imagine.  riding up someone's driveway all the way to peek in the backyard if they can.  I am surprised nobody has gotten shot frankly.  not what I would want to see, but it is risky business if a homeowner is home.  just read in 2 days that  an 80 yr old woman and an 11 year old boy shot home intruders.  the old woman was dead right...the kid's sounds actually a bit dicey, but - they didn't have their guns turned back on themselves.(  or taking selfies with guns.  what part of the trigger pull reflex do people not get? )
Best you change country Margeret, try and find Nirvana. The media has inundated us with stories of beheadings, female circumcision, stoning, honour killings etc;, all current. Who commits these atrocities?
Feminism is toxic. Woman don't have to be.  This works both ways!
I am the Joe Scarborough of the ADN comments section! Except I have not entered into a Clintonian power partnership where each of me and Mika Brezinski could achieve more power by being "together" than separate. She is the Hillary to my Bill. (They set the standard after all). Joe and Mika still have sex as I understand it - and it has a lot to do with their political arguments! So let me give you an opinion coming from a pussy-whipped beta male being dominated by an alpha female! Watch Out!
So, is Trump a liar about what he he is recorded boasting about, you know locker room talk, or are the flood of women reporting conduct simular to what he boastfully said he did liars? True supporters will not care, but more will.
With that said, Fall Kabib, here's more: From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
"So let me get this straight ..." She just thinks men shouldn't be masculine. She thinks they should be whatever women want them to be which in her case seems to be a woman, with male genitalia. In fact that seems to be exactly what most feminists want. They get there by deciding that the way they are is what it means to be human and anything else is there not really human and is defacto a problem. They are the ultimate xenophobes.
Correct, Trump talks trash, while Justin assaults female MP's.   There is very much a difference Justin.
Yet another example of "women who hate women".  NAFTA has destroyed the jobs, incomes and communities of millions of women.  Millions of women are struggling everywhere in Canada and the US to scratch out a living in the economic gulag created by NAFTA, and these wealthy elitists want them to continue to struggle.  Yet, the Fake News and liberals call Donald Trump the sexist. Nope, Donald Trump is the best friend women ever had.  The real sexists are these establishment elite "women" who want to make their "sisters" suffer.  As President Trump likes to say: sad!
perfect case in point.   and this stuff is still being trotted out all the time.   like the one about abortion making women more susceptible to breast cancer.    http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/david-daleiden-kohl-peifer-planned-parenthood_us_58f75e33e4b0de5bac426786?ncid=engmodushpmg00000003  About the jerk who made the fake videos about PP selling fetal parts.   Looks like he and his buddies will be doing some time in CA.
Thanks for confirming what I just said.  Yep, I'm a spoiled western woman who thinks her basic freedoms should not be sacrificed on the altar of "diversity". How disgusting! /s  Using a handful of "right-wing extremists" to dismiss concerns about the much more numerous Muslim extremists is an attempt at "intimidation.
So says the lady in the clown suit...
What a rude moron. I hope he is sentenced to pay for all restoration including labor and supplies provided by Mr. Perez and his daughters. Good on you, Frank and girls!
DAY TURNING TO NIGHT!!! TRUMP TO BLAME!!! Women, children and minorities hit hardest during blackout!!!!!!
I hear this comment a lot, Dromig.  You yourself have been sent away from each Confession with the same statement. Have you ever complied? Or have you sinned again? Like me, were you trying your best, improving even, but never clear of sin? In my opinion, you keep pretending a perfection in the Bible that doesn't occur there, then selectively applying it as a judgment.  It seems to be a sin for which many do not repent.  As welcoming as God remains to you and I, despite our persistent lacks of love and repentance, that's how welcoming we are called to be. This same lack of love was preached as gospel in May as we visited Boulder Co., only for physician-assisted suicide rather than gay marriage. The priest, to his credit, obviously struggled with the unloving mandate from his bishop. So we refuse to walk with those who cry for help, just like those abused by churchmen or women, just like those who dare to love, because Christ demands it?  Ridiculous, and unlike Our Lord in so many ways.
I picked up a few likes on my original comment. The majority were from women. Since there are now more women exercising their right to vote than men I'd say the gun rights folks have their work cut out for them. It is the newly enfranchised women voters (1920 for white women,1965 for all women) who will decide what we do about our gun problem. Maybe women can see the senselessly killed people more clearly than the pictures of the latest handgun at Cosco. Many probably know the mother of someone shot dead. And those that know their history remember how Mothers Against Drunk Driving took on the booze lobby, won and transformed America's previous dumb behavior permanently. I think women, like your mother, sister, aunt, daughter and wife, are the ones you need to convince that the status quo with American guns is just fine. Good luck.....
And the Republic party just loves its "blood and soil", "Jews will not replace us" core driving a car into a crowd and killing a woman. That's the Republic party's definition of a civil society.
Give me a break- we never even saw crooked Donald's taxed! Since when does every speech you make become scrutinized? The double/triple standard was quite ridiculous. I don't remember folks demanding to see that essay Bernie wrote about women enjoying rape, but then he was never vetted nor was the unfit monster who now occupies our WH. Hillary was thoroughly vetted and the best the nasty republicans could come up with was sloppy emails- the same practice VP Pense used, among many others. Oh how I wish we were in her capable hands now ... what s total disaster!
I can get behind what you're saying. But our society is obsessed with crying for equality. Same kind of example happens when an older male teacher statutorily rapes a younger girl but an older female teacher seduces a younger boy. The hipocrisy of crying for equality when you really mean special privileges
"Woman just want two hours of peace. Which, as many women know, is practically impossible" Wow, my wife and I just read your article and we are both embarrassed for you. Must be tough for you being a woman with all of these wretched men around. Get some help.
That's not true.   If a man comes into a women's bathroom, we most definitely can kick him out and report it.   If he was a transgendered person who was acting, dressing, and LIVING THEIR LIFE as a woman, he could then go in to and use the women's restroom.    Do you see the blaring difference now?
What are you talking about good girls getting demonized by good guys? Are women just randomly making up stuff to be worried about? Fact is, women are more vulnerable than men. If women walk alone and get attacked, that doesn't reflect on good men, that reflects on many men that prey of females. When was the last time a man said he was scared to walk on a secluded trail because he was afraid of some woman waiting to rape him?
Guns are very bad for women to own.   It is much more likely that they will shoot themselves, or a family member, than a criminal.  The appropriate answer to violence is never to get guns.  His latest victim made a major mistake, to be walking alone so late at night.   And she had some real bad luck too, as the passing bicyclist that witnessed her rape refused to do anything to help her.   He apparently did not even contact the police to report the crime in progress.
Totally useless leftist feminist BS. There are no barriers to success except for those who choose to whine.Work smarter , be a team player, and  show loyalty to your firm and be hungry to learn, and you will find success.
There's another "problem" with feminism.  The President is not a fan of it.  So, the day after he takes office, he gets half a million angry women on his doorstep.  And, as President Trump looks out behind the window of the White House at the hectoring masses, somewhere down the hall, in the privacy of a washroom, the new White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer is thumping his head on the cubicle wall, muttering, "dumb, dumb, dumb..."    It's gonna be a loooong four years.
That's right, insult the messenger instead of debating the message. It's women like you that are the reason sex bots even exist.
Palestinians are a rogue entity with no rule of law or independent judiciary. Honour killings of wives and daughters and female genital mutilations are the order of the day. Jew hatred comes with their mother's milk. The land of Israel is one of core ideas and precepts of Judaism, along with God and the Torah. Denying the self-determination of Jews in their historic homeland is anti-Semitic as it discriminates against Jews whereas self-determination of other cultures and religions are conferred upon them, just listen to the Palestinians, their leaders and supporters, who claim self-detemination for their people. Criticism is legitimate, however holding Israel in contempt and opprobrium and out of proportion to any other party in the Middle East, and claiming that Israel has no right to exist, is well beyond mere criticism.
