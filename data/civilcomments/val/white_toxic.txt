Dusting off that 'Hitler Youth' uniform, are you?  Think you'll get to wear it while you kick in doors?  "Double-tapping" Somali and Samoan kids in their beds gonna make you a hero?  Right.  NOW IS THE TIME for you to settle all those imagined scores!  Get out the "whites only" and "no natives allowed" signs!  What color the armbands gonna be this time?  And see if you can ask your heroes to get Penn Air to run on time while you're at it.  That way you won't be completely useless.
What a piece of crap.  He has a record 2 pages long on court view, yet he was free, and able to kill a dog that was a better person than he ever hoped to be.  Rest in hell you creepy criminal, death was too good for you, too bad you took out someone that was superior to your white trash human life while being just the average criminal trash that you were born to be.  Alaska is lucky to be one less trashy criminal, but is sad to have lost a noble canine life.
Relegating white males to the "white trash"pile is the order of the day.  I get it.  The new paradigm is to get more women in all jobs.  I get it.  Women are 60% of college grads today.  They don't get it.  Inequalities exist.    The bad deal about the white trash pile is that it is growing,   angry about society as a whole,  and will be a  handful for the PC police,  the establishment.   Jabbing that tiger just to see it growl will have a bad ending.  It appears the liberals can't help themselves,  however.  White Trash are probably the Majority in this country.    Elites are quite  limited by the paucity of exclusive private universities where they are educated,  meet mates, and live their lives in association with each other,  yet attempt to govern this country from such a small base.  Money can't buy peace in class warfare.    Overuse of  the adjective/noun "sexist",  "bigot",  "racist",  "deplorable" and others,   will precipitate   no good,  and will shake our U.S. foundations.
Personally, I would much rather be vaporized by a North Korean warhead, then go to bed knowing that one of ours has  left countless thousands of women and children writhing in agony with radiation and thermal burns.  Once again, we have bunch of stupid white and Asia men who hurl cheap threats at each other, when their peoples are wondering why they don't even make the attempt to sit down and talk. Bush didn't help things by calling this kid's dad a Pygmy. I guess Pygmy's get their backs up, if 70 subs, 700 planes and 1,000,000 men and women ca be said to be a expression of hurt feelings.  In July 1914, every European monarch knew that a general war would have catastrophic consequences---you can read it in their diaries---but they were too weak and proud to avoid it. Today we have two buffoons at the controls, whose lack of people skills make them totally unsuited to conflict resolution.   As if we are not all exposed. Where is our PM on this? Ducking? When he should be mediating?
Muslim extremists that commit terrorist acts are a small, fringe minority and in no way representative of all Muslims.....and yet many of your buddies insist that the other Muslims need to disavow terrorism to prove their goodness (for lack of a better word).  It's not hard.  All Trump ever had to say was, "I do not want or need the votes or support of white supremacists".  See how easy it is?
garycrum - Oh, the guilt you must feel.  Ad hominems always reassure me that I’m on the winning team. You don’t know my intentions any more than I know yours. Your definition of “rude” obviously means anything that disagrees with your PC narrative.  Chew on this…… “The point I was making was not that my grandmother harbors any racial animosity, but that she is a typical white person. If she sees somebody on the street that she doesn’t know (pause) there’s a reaction in her that doesn’t go away and it comes out in the wrong way.” - Barack Obama throwing his white grandma under the bus.  Can you imagine the political firestorm if Donald Trump used the term: “typical black person”? You’d be on him like Old Yeller on meatballs.  Have a great day!
I'm aware of that, and that the shooter was black. I'm aware of black gun violence and black unemployment, black incarceration, single black mothers. While going about my white business and enjoying my white life, I read the news, shake my head and wonder, When will they ever learn? Some group of black people decided to remind me that Black Lives Matter. Oh, I forgot about that. Black Lives Matter doesn't diminish my self worth in the least.
How exactly is pointing out the glaring media double-standards in their consistencies of reporting considered to be defending white nationalists?  Btw, it wasnt Trump but Obama, but thanks for including the info that Obama actually did his defending and excusing of the racist hate group BLM, whose role model is a wanted black nationalist cop killer named Assata Shakur, at the actual FUNERALS of the murdered officers.  Would you agree that was "disgusting and offensive to the families of the officers killed".  The hypocritical liberal media sure didn't, they loved his speech.  Imagine if Trump attends the funeral of the lady killed by the KKK idiot, and starts defending and justifying the KKK in his speech.  Do you really think the media would applaud that like they did with Obama?
All Trump voters may not be racists. However, they are all collaborators with the white racists to elect Trump. At best, they are Quislings. True conservatives need a new party. The last election has shown that the GOP is merely a white identity party. Just ask David Duke. He loves the election of Trump. BTW, I don't think the pro life movement is pro life. They are merely pro fetus. They can all justify killing folks once they can breath on their own. Their support of the death penalty and the killing of unarmed people by the police show they are not pro life. Heck, there have been hundreds of folks on death row that were innocent. They don't shed a tear for those deaths.
This has got to be the dumbest article I have read in my entire life. Last time I checked Hillary Clinton is white. Last time I checked the majority of US citizens are white. When the majority votes for a candidate, that candidate wins. It is simple math, has nothing to do with racism. When HRC pushed for Libya to be invaded, thus killing thousands of brown Africans, destroying Africa's most prosperous state, I guess people voting for her are racist AF, since they obviously don't care about brown Africans.
I'm still pretty conflicted. Very much having cut my teeth on online discussions via BBSes (sometimes very light moderation, but some ops didn't care very much. However, since people were often local, and might see each other IRL, things didn't devolve to the equivalent of Pepe memes and death threats and general Klan/Nazi white supremacy garbage and "jokes" about shoving people in ovens like you see in the conservative backwaters of the 'net now) and Usenet, I generally dislike the heavy-handed moderation and nanny filters of many commenting systems of today. But I do get it-without at least SOME moderation, the truly awful right-wing swamp creatures tend to take over with Nazi garbage and Pepe memes and push everyone else away.  Trying to make it "family-friendly" and filtering out the "naughty" words is something I don't agree with for obvious reasons. What I find really toxic is the constant lying by the right, and I consider that uncivil. If I must vote, I'll vote the lying down.
You honestly think you are not fanning the flames of hysteria with unsubstantiated posts forecasting "prison camps for Muslims, the loss of civil rights.....assaults and killings of anyone not white enough....."?     Where do you get this stuff?  This country has checks and balances, laws and process.  Don't be part of the problem - don't whip people up into believing all these things are imminent, possible and probable.  It is patently wrong and I can't imagine why you would do such a thing.
There's no scarcity of racism in today's America.. It was somewhat "hidden"; then, in 2008, the election of President Obama brought the racist out from under their rocks.  Millions of racist rants attack President Obama and his family were posted on the internet...websites were developed specifically to host those rants.  Individuals, led, by the way, by Donald Trump, proclaimed President Obama was even a native-born citizen....."born in Kenya and shouldn't be eligible to be President!!"  The election of Mr. Trump, who actively sought the support of racist America, has made things much, much worse.  You know, of course, that Trump's reactions to Charlettesville have strengthened the resolve of the white supremacist/white nationalist/ault-right community.  They supported Trump and they both perceive and appreciate that he is supporting them.  Did you read and watch the attack I referenced?  Gary Crum
Great news! We can deport our best and brightest in order to make room for European models willing to marry old, fat white guys.
We will see women as popes  when Islamic men stop raping women, playing tahharush, killing gays, forcing them to cover up, not allowing them to drive, stop performing genital mutilation etc. Jk we know neither will ever happen. Now run along and make my white self a sandwich honey!!
Your numbers show 5948 murders committed by whites and 5620 by blacks.   WHich is bigger?
It sure looks like the way more and more truth keeps coming out about your friends in the DC swamp world, the more people will agree with me that your constant, however well camouflaged insults to Whites, President Trump, & America itself are about as welcome as a good case of cancer. They, and your decade of unflagging support for one traitor after another mark you as a traitor yourself. No amount of your PC police couch thugs can delete that pure and simple truth. Seriously, wouldn't you be more happy among your own kind? Go to Iran, preach there, among your people, but try to not get stoned to death.
Yep. One Somali cop shoots a white lady and all cops everywhere are gunning people down. Well argued. I'M convinced.
This is good to hear.  It shows, once again, that ANYTHING controlled by lying, liberal democrats who constantly "cow-tow" to any violence by, or even suggested by, trouble making racist, anti American neeee--gro groups are always left to "pick up the pieces".  Tragically, it is usually the white American taxpayers who always foot the bills.  ALL liberal colleges and universities should be closed down...they are nothing but cesspools of racist, anti American, lying liberal democrat ideology.
Nationalism is this white supremacist ideology is nothing more than the German National Socialist Party extolling the virtues of one nation, one white population, and the destruction and enslavement of all others.  The usual mixed metaphors and revisionist terminology to appear to be pro-American when, in fact, it is anathema to everything found within the Constitutional laws of the nation.  This brainwashing technique has succeeded through mass media and a political party dedicated to overthrow of the U.S. governing system of diversity and inclusion.  Nationalism in the Jake tenet is obey or die the ruling Nationalist Party Dictators.  Nationalism is the new Confederacy enslaving all under the plantation owners and overseers.  The big lie personified.
More like dripping with facts.  Whereas you are dripping with self-pity based upon the false theory of "reverse discrimination." Firstly, there is no such thing as "reverse discrimination. " One is either discriminated against or not discriminated against. Secondly, assuming your reference to "the majority" means white people, then you perceive minorities derive some benefit or benefits solely by virtue of their non-White skin color that you as a white man do not.  Thirdly, you feel sorry for yourself because of this perception, which is wholly unsupported by any evidence whatsoever. In fact, the opposite is true: White people as a race enjoy far more perqisites and benefits than minorities and always have. Further, they have actively worked to demean, oppress and suppress minorities. That is historical fact.
It is based on religious discrimination.  Terrorists are not coming in from 6 Muslim countries to experience massive and lengthy vetting.  The danger to us is from folks right here, including white nationalists and embittered citizens with one gripe or another.
Nice obfuscation.  So Wilders wanting to ban all Muslims and just because he does not mention their skin colour is not an example of bigotry.  You can rest assured he would like to include all non-white races along with that.   And I for one believe we need slower immigration to allow for better assimilation and less multiculturalism but I will never ascribe to the likes of a guy like Wilders.
"i will be going to the usa often with trump as i did with obama in power regardless of all the harmfull and stupid policies he did. at some point you have to act like a mature person and understand it is not our place to judge what the usa does for it's own security...."  ....plus I just love hanging out with all those white, gun-totin' hillbillies down there in Orlando.
White male Anti-Globalists peacefully marching = Bad. Violent masked Globalist crypto-fascists throwing bricks = Good. Shut up slaves.  MSM
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay  Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI! - Hypocrisy is a greater crime than racism.
No. A ridiculous statement! The reason many people disliked (no"hate") Obama was because "President" Obama was an apologist of "Black Lives Matter" and violent racism toward Whites and also LE; as well as an apologist of Muslim Terrorists. He is un-American and an intensely disgusting person. He shamed all Americans and soiled American democratic institutions. His presence in government denigrated the nation."  THAT was Obama's "hobby"- denigrating the USA. After Obama had been elected in 2008, I supported him! He talked a good game...until it became clear to those who were supportive that he was doing all of the above.
Given those stats, I am expecting to see a headless white guy attending the rally!
When Trump refused to call out Nazis and white supremacists even after a domestic terrorist killed one woman and maimed more in Charlottesville, Virginia—and then averred that “very fine people” were marching under Confederate flags—the extremists recognized the signal. When, only a week later, he pardoned Joe Arpaio—a man whom white supremacists had made a cause célèbre—they saw him in their corner again. When Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the administration was bringing the hammer down on the DACA program, he cited two lies popular among far-right nativists: That “Dreamers” take jobs away from Americans, and that the program prompted the surge in unaccompanied child immigrants (who, for the record, are not eligible for DACA status).
Eh littleyoboboy -- You say Donne Dawson is (solely) Caucasian?  Tell that to her mother, Beadie Dawson, and her grandmother, Annie Kanahele.  While it's true that Donne and Beadie could easily "pass" as white, they have at least the one drop of magic blood which the race-mongers think is sufficient to call themselves "Native Hawaiian" and be entitled to benefit from hundreds of racial entitlement programs.  What a ridiculous comment you made!
You're confusing "cajones" with racism.  White Neo-Nazis chanting "Jews will not replace us" are "very fine people."  Black athletes quietly kneeling are "sons of bitches."  Rote patriotism is not an ideal of this country.
Dictionary definition:  Militia 1.(a) org., any military force... Either you are too ignorant or stupid to read the first dictionary definition.  The only "Well-regulated Militia" legally existing in the U.S. is those under the Department of Defense.  Your definition only applies to those white supremacist private militia created by your fellow racists and bigots under Posse Comitatus idiocy roaming the nation to intimidate government employees and scared citizens.  The current examples sitting in jail in Oregon.  A "Well-regulated Militia" has been in existence for most of the history of the nation without any need for civilian weaponry to defend it.  The only need for civilian weapons is for hunting or protection; therefore all should be licensed and registered with full background checks before ownership like any other threat to other citizens in the wrong hands.
On Williams Street!?! How thoughtless. But you know, white privilege feels no need to be sensitive to others. I guess Trump supporters will eat here. I will not.
There is no place for a bunch of Ku-Ku-Klowns in Canada. In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century an English  three Canadians was a member of the white supremacist organization Anglo-Saxon, WASP equivalent to the United States ("White Anglo-Saxon Protestants").  Four members have been Prime Ministers of Canada; Sir John A. Macdonald (father of « Canadian Federation » of 1867 but not « Father of Canada » which is Sir Samuel de Champlain in 1608 ),  Sir John Abbott,  Sir Mackenzie Bowell (a past « Grand Master » (?)),  and John Diefenbaker.   In 1927 the “Orange” movement gave birth to a more intolerant and racist group, the Canadian Ku Klux Klan, which had its deepest roots in small towns in Saskatchewan because of the "yellow peril", but also because of the blacks...Jews...Catholics... The “Ku Ku Nest” in the province campaigned against= teaching French + wearing the religious habit + the presence of crucifixes in schools (more to come)
Leftists are only open and tolerant if your views concur with theirs.The slightest right of centre opinion and,wham,you're a bigot,racist,xenophobe,islamophobe or a white nationalist.Free speech,Canada?Not anymore.
Evangelicals???? Oh yeah. The holier than thou's who somehow think they are Christians living gods words? To me, they are amongst the most prejudiced and self serving idiots around. They think they are going to their white mans heaven after their actions that are 180 degrees opposite of what their jesus lived and breathed. They defund, and support the defunding of programs that help the less fortunate, and give the same funds to the well monied the rich and the politicians corporate sponsors, the same kind their jesus punted out of the temples. The evangelicals thinking and expecting to go to their white mans heaven, makes as much sense as the Mideast terrorists going to their Islamic heaven with their 72 virgins after the wholesale slaughter of so many thousands of innocents. Washington is built on corruption, which is why we are sending all the taxpayer dollars overseas, unaccounted for with no accountability
Why should I feel shame for something done by someone else 6,7 or even 12 decades ago?  Should I bare responsibility for Custer and the Americans attempt to wipe out the North American Indians because I happen to be white?
Good white folks of Anchorage, make a stand. Confront yourselves. Confront America. Confront White Nationalists. Confront the KKK. Confront racism in your churches, in your neighborhoods, in your schools, in you homes.
hey Rochdale  - you pathetic troll - why not waste your rubles on a white supremacist publication  rather than spew your vitriol here.
Hey I like a lot of black people including Denzel Washington, James Earl Jones, Herman Cain and Ben Carson. So if we hate Obama does that make us racist? I have come to the conclusion that it  is not about race, but smarts. We have stupid white and black people that can't figure out how to make a living and smart black and white people that can. What are you? If lazy people got off their butts and worked hard we wouldn't need ACA,welfare for people to lazy to get a job and food stamps. I think if people want free food they should be limited to certain foods seeing I am tired of buying them better food than most working people can afford.
Give me a break. White men are in other nations killing off innocent people in response to terrorist but do nothing about the terrorist in they own backyard. Stop the race baiting already.
I'm not sure what else you guys want Trump to say.  He said he strongly condemned the violence on many sides.  We have something called the 1st amendment which allows public protest.  I don't like the message of the white supremacy guys any more than any other civilized person.  But regardless of the message and whether or not you agree, it is their right to assemble.  There WAS violence on many sides and ANTIFA as well as BLM are just as hateful and racists as the white supremacy guys.
In all fairness, there wasn't a lot in his speech that condemned the shooter's racism in what I saw was one sentence about halfway through.  And, a lot of the speech was about racism on blacks.  So, it was pretty much biased, but not to the subject of the funeral itself.  Obama did largely avoid pointing the finger directly at blacks who were either performing or calling for acts against whites.  And, the Dems/liberals kinda went along with it and protected him.  Kinda like how the Repubs/right are doing for Trump.  Trump is coming under much more criticism, and largely deserved since the idiot can't keep his stupid trap shut or, god forbid, actually say the right thing to begin with.  The problem are the various "sides" in our society.  If they mess up, they protect themselves and deflect.  None stand up and say, "we're in the wrong and we need to clean up our act."  Spineless.
Trump is a worthless stain on America. He's a sick, fascist, white supremacist traitor.  There is no excuse for Trump
A screed filled with racist and historical lies blatantly false in its entirety.  Disgusting wild rant from the mind of a White Supremacist thug.
Multiculturalism and Diversity are code words for white genocide.
What a joke.  I am going to round up some members of the Kalapuya tribe and come protest Wweek's ongoing use of a name appropriated from their ancestors.  The company should pay them back-royalties, and some pain and suffering for having to be reminded of the conquest of their people by the white man every time they pass a street corner and see the wweek box of papers.  This can't stand!  p.s. I wonder how many of these self centered, "look at me, I'm protesting" instagram pic posters who are at this "rally" gave even one shit about colonialism (as it is used to describe the negative aspects of british expansion, not food) before they got some alert of facebook from their "activist" group that a march was going to take place. Many probably still don't know a thing about it.   This is pathetic!
Let's see, widespread rioting, calling for violence against white communities (we need our weave shops, not that I use one), calling for violence against police, shooting at police, killing police...
If he was a BLACK old geezer, that's PRECISELY what would have happened.  And all these white posters who are pleading for mercy for this guy would be applauding and/or making excuses for the cops.  Double-standards are the root of all evil.
Blacks who weren't slaves fighting whites who weren't Nazi's over Confederate statues erected by Democrats.
Old Ruthie said what she felt - did she overstep?  Yeah, she did, but you know what, SHE DOESN'T CARE!  The 6 pointed star probably was the straw.  She said what I think - Trump is a phony (faker) and he's dangerous.  Putting that out there was far more important to her than her own reputation.    A New York hustler from a wealthy family, disowned by his own alma mater, Wharton, that he so loves to tout.  All you old white guys that think Trump is going to bring back some idyllic period in America (not sure when that was, btw) are so out of touch with reality.  This is a very different country now, get used to it.  Make peace with it.
Moron (non racist). She clearly mentions "white" people.  There were many racial groups that voted for him. Are you going to bad mouth all of them?  And that half a spark plug is still 100% more than Hillary voters. Like you.
So you actually do believe the police rounded up and arrested 100% of the rioters.  400 arrests means only 400 were involved.  If they weren't arrested, they didn't take part in the riot.  Am I alone in understanding how incredibly unrealistic that is?  I don't believe Trump commented on the incident last month in Fresno when a Muslim black man shot and killed three random white guys on the street because he dislikes white people.  I guess that means Trump condones racist black on white violence.  Did you express outrage over that too?
I'm sorry to disappoint you by, yet again, pointing out that the financial instruments you're characterizing here, commonly referred to as "liar loans," weren't created by Frank and Schumer, although Schumer certainly acquiesced to Wall Street in lockstep with his Republican colleagues.   Your commentary is rife with dog whistle phrases like "crib" and  "...People have become too accustomed to having others pay for their lifestyles, it doesn't work that way..." that fairly reveal an underlying sentiment of racism.   Let's set the record straight.   Wall Street investment bankers, overwhelmingly white and privileged, created these instruments. They paid the overwhelmingly white guys in Congress to loosen the regulations.  They bundled the loans and had the overwhelmingly white guys at the ratings agencies cook the books to call this junk "investment grade" and sell it to pension funds, and other large, institutional buyers in the stock market.   White guys created the housing crash.
White bigots?  I bet your white and hate your own skin and color!  American Progressives are the only people on the planet that act that way!
"Half black, which also means he is half white as well." How original.
There are many, many browny jobs on the line; if ( I'm one of them ) don't become President. A slow boat back to their root's. Clinton loves to surround herself with her bro's and sisters, not that white trash. And I seem to remember America intervening in elections abroad? The CIA throwing money at the candidate that was pro-American? What is good of us, is not good for them? Nothing more than a ploy by ( stay at home and bake cookies ) Clinton, to discredit Trump.
Playing race-card again, and falsely so.  REMINDING you of American institutionalized white supremacy and spotlighting your acquiescence to it doesn't make me a "waaaaaaaay-cist".  Stop whining, cupcake.
I'm truly disgusted by the Alaskans who claim they are Americans embracing hate. I find it ironic that the term snowflake which was started by Trumpettes implying that liberals are delicate. Now they carry machine guns and dynamite? Please stop watching Fox it has totally hoodwinked you. As the founder of FOX news said. I want to start a network for over 50 to dead white males. That are scared. You played right into his brainwashing. If your a Christian, where did your principles go? All I see is money grubbing elitest hell bent on taking away every bit of democracy we have sent young men to war to defend. If you are ok with Russaian collusion, nepotism, out right money laundering, sexual harassment, and the loss of your rights. Keep on supporting the 45th. One day you will either die or regret the decision you thought you made. And no I did not vote for Clinton. I voted for Josnston.
Trump does spend a fair amount of time thinking about pretty white women no older than 25. Just look at how he touches his daughters various body parts in public. What does he do in private?
Why don't you care about the gun dealers that are supplying guns in ghettos? White men make a lot of money selling guns to criminals. Of course, white people refuse to take responsibility for their behavior.
Dump on the white man all you want..... but ask yourself this question Ms. Khan... would the world be a better place if the Pakistani's ruled the world (your ancestral homeland)
Seriously - how many white supremacists, neo-Nazis, etc. do you really think there are in America? A few hundred? A couple thousand? Hardly worth wasting time on these idiots. And they're certainly not swinging national elections!
Racism against white Republicans is in full throttle here in progressive Catholic land.
It is clear you are a completely biased right-winger & your words prove my conclusion. I am calling you a troll because your words prove that you are a troll.  The "Establishment" Media has journalistic standards of integrity & truth. Outlets such as the Washington examiner, fox "news" and breitbart have no journalistic standards of truth or integrity.   You have provided opinions but no facts therefore nothing you say can be trusted.   Nazi right-wing "protestors" who attended the rally with semi-automatic weapons were the threat in Charlottesville.  Self-proclaimed Right-wingers have to stop with putin what-about-ism & false equivalence.  Until you can look at the situation objectively nothing will change.   White supremacist terrorists killed an innocent in Charlottesville - they are the violent terrorist threat in America today.   Zero sensible gun control in America, extreme polarisation & ignorance means the country will continue destroying itself.
I actually came to ADN to look for the article on the Kansas men who were plotting to bomb a mosque. I was interested in the article because none of the articles I found referred to these men as terrorists. They were clearly terrorists. They constantly drove by and harassed the Muslim people living in the area, and were charged with plots and weapons they planned on using. Every time there are Muslim men or women who plot to attack people for religious reasons, they are deemed terrorists. Instead of finding the Kansas article, I found this one. Again, white men terrorizing a person for religious reasons. The men are made out to be racist, but not terrorist. If a Muslim attacks a person for religious reasons, are they then racists or terrorists? Journalism can affect how the world is perceived. Please label all terrorists as terrorists, or else call them all racists. Do not change the label based on the religion or race. These men may be racists, but the are also terrorists.
Do you consider every "Black Lives Matter" supporter responsible for the death of each cop assassinated by OTHER BLM supporters?  Probably not.  Was this a "White Supremacist Rally"?  ABSOLUTELY not.   This "Rally" was organized to protest the removal of certain southern heritage monuments in the city.   Did some "White Supremacist" groups show up? Certainly. Did ANTIFA and all the other left-wing "anti-protestors" show up specifically to provoke violence and antagonize citizens who were lawfully trying to assemble and exercise THEIR First Amendment Right?   You're darn right they did.  This man wasn't responsible for the violence that occurred any more than the founder of BLM is responsible.   ONE individual made a choice and committed a crime for which he will certainly pay for the rest of his life.  Blaming the ENTIRE right-wing for causing this is hypocrisy at its finest. It takes "two to tango" and if the left-wing antagonizers had left well enough alone, this would be a non-story
If it is gaining strength, it is in reaction to those who gleefully make no bones about looking forward to exterminating the white race and "european culture" as just deserts for past sins, claim the world would be better off peopled by brown people only, that Muslim society is superior to western society, etc.  We have some of those people  right on these boards.
So in your view the members of the White Victims Club aren't foolish, childish and intolerant? The people who want to deport the Muslims and build a wall around Mexico? I guess if you think those mooks and broads are the paragons of reason, I can understand you taking offense at dirty leftist plebs disrupting the high-minded discourse that was surely about to take place.  I have to disagree though with the idea that Trumpism is somehow any different from old school conservative-style scapegoating, but for the veneer of brass and marble and bad hair. I see the same mentality as usual: Blame the worlds problems on society's weakest members and then rush to claim the mantle of victimhood when confronted in any way for having terrible ideas and hair. Only this time, instead of having a rich white guy as their leader, it's a rich white guy with a New York accent! Way to mix it up guys!
Congrats on being yet another person to change the narrative and blaming black people for cops mistreating them. Every race of people has criminals yet tons of evidence has shown that whites get treated way better by police when doing the same types of crimes. You're just another person blinded to the truth.
Boy,the liberals really want to make our white Oregon ancestors guilty, guilty, guilty.That whole racism movement is just meant  to destroy Unoversity of Oregon history---they were not racist.however, the bigots attacking the university ARE BIGOTS.
Hello GRWA,  Not sure why you think your post rebuts what I wrote.  Look, here are two scenarios that, to use your lens, happen in the north:  1. At a clinic, a smart female clinician teaches a smart female trainee in head cover who treat a white man who foolishly and drunkenly tore off his fingers.  2. At a clinic, a smart, white male clinician teaches a smart, white male trainee who treat a native man who foolishly and drunkenly got frostbite staggering outside after heavy drinking.  Look, you can bristle at my post all you like, but this is not about what is "pretty typical" up north, instead this is about what Canada's entertainment industry props forward as its CHOSEN samples of said events.  I suspect my reference to Liitle Mosque went over your head. Watch the first episode: Smart Muslim folks with insight face a bunch of stupid, ignorant white men in Canada. Ha, ha, ha, hardly tiresome political correctness at all (roll eyes).  Political correctness poisons entertainment.
How about calling them "white nationalist terrorists"?    I mean, Donnie was clutching his pearls that Obama didn't start WWIII by insulting all of Islam at every opportunity and now we have the Christian identity type of home-grown terrorists coming out of the woodwork and NOW he's getting all politically correct?
So what you're saying is, white peoples also have EBT and MediCaid??? I think you're right, Trumpers thought it was a black and latino thing...#MAGA
When everything is in favour of whites then how can trust those leaks too?
Most alt-lefties such as yourself consider most conservative white males to be nazi sympathizers or racists, especially if they're on board with Trump.  C'mon, be honest and admit it.  BTW, alt-left are neo-marxist.
The majority of hate crimes and acts of terror are perpetrated by white supremacists.  That's the group to monitor if you want to make your country safer.
http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/how-the-faithful-voted-a-preliminary-2016-analysis/.    71% of Jews for Clinton with 81% of white Evangelicals for tRump.  It is interesting how the most corrupt always wear their piousness on their sleeve, no matter their religious affiliation. They cry loud and clear for all to hear how holy holy holy they are while they violate all the religious ideals and principles.   Jews are historically Democrat and stood by people of color during civil rights and protested the Vietnam war.  They are victims of antisemitism from the right (again rearing it's ugly, dangerous head in public). They just want the Christians to leave them alone  but  Christians persist in blaming them for killing the Jewish rabbi, Jesus, when in fact it was the occupying Romans. They cultivate hate.    So please do not lump my relatives in with the white evangelical Christians, the white supremacists, the Nazis and the KKK. Those are the tRump voters.
What a load of Crap ! One does not have to belong to the ruling Party, to speak to other Governments, or be sympathetic towards certain people on the African Continent, HE IS AFRICAN ! As for Whites looking down on Black Governments ? the present Circus in South Africa today is a case in point. OUR Politics are separated by many hundreds of years from those of Blacks, Blacks do not understand Politics, to them it's like Tribalism, a feeding frenzy on it's "Colonial" wealth, different type than their white counter parts. All these African Countries completely fell apart upon the departure of the whites who brought much Knowledge and development to the Whole Continent. Most Africans hate "Colonialism" but ALL want and LIVE with ALL it's benefits, all things modern was brought by the "Colonialists" and Africa is living it ,whether they  want to admit  it or not. African arrogance knows no bounds, they ALL so want to be all things white, but cannot, therefore the hate !
Yeah that's what it is,your right I resent white racist like yourself,is that how you comment to everybody that you disagree with? Nothing with what I said was wrong but you are probably a triggered leftist snowflake who will only listen to one side of an issue,couldn't care less about my punctuation or logic my grammar is just fine it's leftist like you that have hard time with true logic,your mind set is the reason we can never have discussions on race or any other social issues your still butt hurt your queen Hillary lost the election and trump got elected,you ought to spread your horizon some try listen to different points a view on any issues,personally attacking people because you don't like the way they write,check out the documentary called the enemies within,it's sounds like your kind of people.Have a good day!
Well...since crossing the border "illegally" is in FACT a crime....Every single border crosser IS a criminal: 1st offense a misdemeanor, subsequent crossings are felonies.  PLUS, the impact of identity theft, perjury & false swearings, forgery of documents, etc. (which are all crimes) would impact crime levels immensely.  I'm not against free market, or freedom...but with freedom comes RESPONSIBILITY ( a word, seemingly absent on the left.)  I'm not a fascist, and I'm sorry, what racial groups?  If illegal aliens are of ANY race, you are correct!!  The LAWS (which Congress has had the authority to pass since the Constitution was ratified: specifically Article I, Section 8, clause 4) designate certain individuals as criminals, not a political party. A society cannot long exist without laws, and enforcement of those laws.  Study your history, it's always been the democrats and the left that are the racists and white supremacists.  Don't choose to remain ignorant.
The poor hypocritical left...  White male privilege is bad... so let's gush over Justin Trudeau  Religion is bad... so let's gush over a Sikh
Why do blacks riot when a black cop shoots a black suspect/perp, but whites don't riot, even if a white suspect/perp is shot by a black cop?
Seeking: Aggrieved, underqualified white people willing to serve as plaintiffs
Fascism is the politics of identity. We usually call "white supremacy" fascism. It can be any racial, gender, religion, political  or cultural identification  that becomes a rallying cry that constitutes fascist tendencies. Today all identity politics is from the left. Islam is as fascist and violent as Nazi Germany.  Leftist "Social Justice Warriors" thrive with violent censorship and  destroy anything they dislike ( Evergreen, Harvard, Stanford) .Trump accepts all law-abiding citizens of America regardless of who they are, and by that  openness is hated by the left for not playing identity favourites.  Comparing Trump to Hitler was inevitable.
Simple;  Canadians want and need politically correct content .  They particularly need and want content that show white men as backwards selfish stupid louts and women ,  coloured people and muslims as surperior human beings..  if you keep the focus on this approach as you have been doing people will continue to love canadian content
What about an open letter to the double the number of blacks and Hispanic Christians who voted for Trump?  This article is trying to double down on the false idea that it was the mad white men who put Trump into office.  In that sense this article is racist, because it fails to factor in the actual voting patterns among ALL Christians.
Those who marched in Boston marched against "FREE SPEECH". The rally was to promote free speech, and no racists, white supremacists, KKK, nazis, or any armed people were invited. In fact, they were specifically told to stay away and were denounced by the organizers of that event. The people who turned out to march forced the people who were attending this rally to flee under police protection. The people who turned out to march actually fit the definition of fascists. So stop with the false claims. Approximately 40,000 people marched against free speech, the very thing they were practicing while doing it. Talk about hypocritical.
gs - is totally wrong.  action speaks louder than words.  trump has always been a racist.  his father and himself are known to deny rentals to blacks in the apartment rentals they owned.  trump has been reluctant to reject the KKK, white supremacists and neo-Nazi who supported him during the campaign.  in the charlotsville fiasco, he refused to condemn the neo-nazis and kkk until he was forced to.  he also stated that they were good people - these folks are never good people.  hence, trump is a known white supremacist, his actions clearly shows this.  in the campaign he promised to help the blacks in inner cities with jobs, housing and better schools.  to date nothing has been done.  it was only rhetoric (lies).  it is quizzical that a minority like you would defend him as he really does not like you too.  if he had to choose between you and a white guy, he would choose the white guy 100% of the time.
Lovely stuff! Please don't think though that Bell Pottinger will not live on. They will. As will Victoria Geogehen with her dark hole where her soul should be.  Andile, the Gupta dog, is threatening to take Rupert farm/s. The campaign about white people being trash and just stealing everything from black people (only black people as they deny that the Coloured and Indian people have any rights) is being stepped up on social media. So anyone who thinks they can rest safely now is sorely mistaken.  The Gupta's, the thief called Zuma and the robot that is Geogehen, are still at work, they won't stop until they die or are put away somewhere dark and mouldy forever.  Why? Because the money. Always follow the money trail. Methinks South Africa is small fry compared to what this bunch of terrorists did to other sovereign countries. We cannot stop now. We have to get that woman to reveal all, and from there, to The Hague.
How I long for newspapers to start offering differing, contrary, and frank opinions.  The columnist has nothing to offer except the same pablum that she has written over and over.  She lost me at this sentence: The arc of xenophobic terror – whether "inspired" by the Islamic State or white supremacists – has recently increased in frequency and breadth.  Seriously?  The world is presently preoccupied with white supremacists?  Are you kidding me?  Either call it like it is or stop writing, but don't take your readers for fools.
Yes, this investigation will turn up no evidence of serious voter fraud, but it will keep the idea of voter fraud in the limelight sufficient for Trump and his alt-reality white nationalist media friends to keep pushing a lie that his supporters are eager to believe,  evidence notwithstanding, because they want to believe everything he says.   That's where we are at. Trump will persist in lying because his supporters like it, the alt-reality media like it, it confuses and annoys opponents, and it causes neutral people to turn off politics because it's incomprehensible, you can't even tell truth from fiction. That is Trumps goal in lying.
Seen this before - White guys always spell it wrong...
And how are they free market if they have an umbilical cord back to government? And how are they white capitalists if they are run by ANC cadres, most of whom are black and incompetent?
Asian countries for Asians.  Black countries for Blacks.  but White countries for everybody?  That's genocide.  Anti-racist is a codeword for Anti-White
Clinton and the leftist have nothing left but the constant false narrative of racism.  What's new?  If you hate the white majority like they do and want to reduce the white population that is what you do!
I am - for the first time in my life - objecting strongly to OLD WHITE MEN - ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH GRAY HAIR. Thanks GOP. You have convinced me you stand for NOTHING.
Can I use their safe space when they start in with their white male hate talk?
Affirmative Action hurts Asians the most, followed by Whites. If college admissions were completely race blind, it has been estimated that Asian enrollment would increase 5x, White enrollment would increase slightly, and there would be almost no blacks, hispanics or indigenous people.
You prove the point.  White males make up maybe 35% of Canada's population (depending on who is included as "white").  So why do you think white male identity is the norm when really you're just another minority identity group?  And of course who is included as "white" is a whole other topic.  If you're a Syrian immigrant you're not white, whereas maybe if you're the son of a Syrian immigrant, say Steve Jobs, you would be welcomed in the Proud Boys' fantasy of white Western men who invented everything of value the modern world.
Danepol  "black politicians"  Please, it is really really important that south africans don't dress this (gupta, zuma, zwane, buthelezi, sabce, saa, etc) in race terms.    We do that we are stuffed back in the 70's and 80's  The Guptas are Indians are crooks so all Indians are bad?   No.   Think of Pravin Most of the Zuma clan is corrupt so all blacks are bad?  No.   Think of Madonsella  What would your reaction be if you overheard four coloured folk in Mitchell Plain discussing this mess and one chirps that all white afrikaners are slimey sleaze pond scum traitors - based on Gert van der Merwe (gupta lawyer) and Pieter van der Merwe (ceo of their metal conduit and money laundering biz)  Most politicians are crooks regardless of race, it is the nature of the beast, let's not make this about blacks being crooks
I know you'll stop at nothing to defend white supremacy, but the police department said it was related to the white nationalist demonstration.   I look forward to your next defense of nazis. i know I won't be disappointed.
one of the reasons I voted Trump is that I believed he reflected to some degree the salt of the earth propensities of the Huckabees even as did say FDR. I say lets wait and see. Anyway The Denver Post is on the bottom my list for delving out moral comeuppance to any personage. May God curse you Whore for your white eye lies.
This time the (reverse) racists have gone too far....a black politician attacking a white president because he made a condolence phone call to a black family. Shameful politicizing. And stupid hats (Ms Wilson's trademark)
You boys just keep forgetting that the worst terrorist attack except 9/11 was committed by a white, native born American.
You are welcome to join the 21st century. I'm quite sure, we black folks know our history better than you. We know who the murderers were. That is why we know most of the racists in the in the 21st century endorse Trump. That makes the Republicans in the 21st century a white identity party. Don't take my word for it. Check out the Storm Front website. Klansman, David Duke, is on record endorsing Trump. The only thing the GOP has for black folks are police bullets. At least the Democrats will let us vote. The GOP is doing everything they can to prevent black folks from voting. The Democrats are just the lesser of 2 evils.
Racists comments made by Palin, Nugent, etc.. Such as....? BTW,how is the birther campaign racist? Maybe you don't know what that word means. It's o.k., I'll let that slide. Wait, was that racist? Obama,  who lied about how his parents met, who called his grandparents typical white people, who has more than one social security number..that's odd. Who did and did not register for selective service..that's strange.Who had his college records locked up tight. Whose real father is not who he said it was..Oops, I'm being racist. No, what you are thinking of is attacking someone based on the lies that they are telling. That does not qualify as racist. When Bush lied about WMD's, was that reverse racism if someone of color attacked him for it? .. No.  Did your everyday average idiot say something racist about Obama, probably and that is pathetically stupid on their part. However, the birther movement, which btw, there is more to it, was not racist. Biden did say Obama was well spoken. Racist.
We need our culture back?   The society that accepted slavery, child labor exploitation, segregation? Please. People in this day and age know right from wrong. The white trash in this case here knew better too.   They were at most lazy due to welfare. But they still knew better than not to supervise or direct the POS teen.
No We just won’t let white people dress up as non-white people for Halloween   Pretty straightforward actually
I am not surprised that you are still proud to be a racist.  Were you one of those white nationalists who cried when statutes of traitors were taken down?   Yes I am embarrased that whites were dumb enough to vote for the town butcher to perform brain surgery.  Doesn't take a genius to know that this will not end well.  Even you will probably have to admit this eventually.
Your wit is too much! You are burning my retinas with your biting social commentary....Especially the part about how evil Caucasians are. I've never ever heard *that* before. However, you are so right. Whenever I see one of those filthy Caucasians, I just assume they are serial killers and I go sit in my basement and rock back and forth and chant "sexist, racist, bigot, Islamophobic, Cis scum, white man" to purge myself.
Don't act like you are a superior white man from Los Angeles or New York and no one will tell you to go back to the mainland. Maybe you should say something like "I love Hawaiian food and music."
If this person was native or black and this was a mostly White community people would be losing their minds right about now.
Lefties are hilarious. You yap about democracy, yet when you lose - you go thug. Let's summarize a few things..  1. Trump is the enemy of Jews. Obama and Kerry throw Israel under a bus yesterday  2. Trump is a racist. White people can't apply for jobs in Obama's administration. White Middle class America under Obama's is destroyed and working class families lose for the sake of gang drug dealers and Black LIves Matter terrorists.  3. Obama is the defender of the West. Turkey announces it has proof Obama is funding ISIS.  4. Trump's man Steve Bannon hates Jews. Israels applauds his selection in Trump administration.  Now we have Obama trying to hurt Russia for hacks that came from inside the US infrastructure from honest Americans patriots who wanted the world to see the scumbag Clinton machine for what it was. The most corrupt Oligarch machine.  Thanks God Trump won.  The left after losing are outed for what they are Totalitarian thugs
What a load of revisionist nonsense.  "Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. " - Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, March 21, 1861  Care to tell me again about how the war wasn't about slavery? Not mentioned for two years? History proves otherwise. The confederacy was always, has always and will always be about white supremacy. Grant should have executed every confederate soldier as the traitors they were, then we wouldn't have to put up with this garbage about "honoring our heritage" from their still racist descendants a century and a half later.
Again Pandora - it is you who are talking nonsense.  Slaves were forced into this work and not allowed the same opportunities as white people in our country.  This work if done by the slaves with love and service to their masters does not make them not demeaned or oppressed by being slaves.  Slavery is always oppression and sin.  Pushing one gender into the less important and less respected work based on their gender alone is sexism and oppression.  Describing work as gendered is sexist.  Mops and brooms and dishcloths don't contain gender pieces - both sexes can use them equally well.  Domestic work like sacramental work does not have a gender attachment either.
Hopefully the accused isn't a white chick from the hillside. They seem to get off real easy with hit and murder of hitting a human with their autos.
Trump think: White racists should rule.
The civil war inside the White House is real, and it's nasty. The Daily Beast is reporting that the tension is so high that officials are now name-calling behind each other's backs, with Bannon escalating it to the point where he's calling Jared Kushner a "cuck" and a "globalist" behind his back.  “[Bannon] recently vented to us about Jared being a ‘globalist’ and a ‘cuck’…He actually said ‘cuck,’ as in “cuckservative,’” one official told the Daily Beast.    Interesting that "cuck" mattered more to that official than "globalist," when that term is generally used as a white nationalist sneer at Jewish people. But either way, it's quite Bannonesque. Breitbart was one of the first to amplify the whole "cuckservative" epithet, after all.  Bannon was already in trouble with Trump, according to a New York Times report published yesterday.
The idea that you can label ANYTHING as white supremacist, NAZI, hate speech, etc. is a bunch of mind control garbage propagated by state run media. So, congratulations, if you buy this shit, you have been thoroughly brainwashed by the Saul Alinsky playbook. Good luck with that, comrades.  And hey, anyone over the age of 40 remember when communism and socialism were outlawed in this country?
All white people are  simultaneously. guilty of all race hate crimes.
Well the liberal in me clearly believes this author is a racist neo-nazi, white supremacist nationalist bigoted skin head nazi loving bigot for disagreeing with Justin.
"I'm glad the shooter was not any kind of minority."   He is a minority.  White male.
That's a wildly false equivalence.  It was never about a message on the cake, it was always about the identity of the customers.    If a bakery refused to sell a cake to a customer because he was white, that would be illegal.  If a bakery refused to sell a cake to a customer because they were Jewish or Muslim or Christian, that would be illegal.  This shouldn't be a hard concept to grasp.
Soros has no scruples when it comes to making money even from his fellow Jews in Hungary 1944.....    KROFT: My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted godson.  SOROS: Yes. Yes.  KROFT: Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from your fellow Jews, friends and neighbors.  SOROS: Yes. That’s right. Yes.  KROFT: I mean, that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many, years. Was it difficult?  SOROS: No, not at all. Not at all, I rather enjoyed it.  KROFT: No feelings of guilt?  SOROS: No, only feelings of absolute power.  This Nazi collaborator pig spent millions trying to get Crooked Hillary elected, and is now spending millions to remove Donald Trump.  And liberals think white supremacists are bad?
' Ahhh, ……….would you look at that,   …don't those white nationalists clean up nice, though?  .  All GQ modern and everything,   ...just needs some $1000 dollar sunglasses and he can dine with the lobbyists. .  The suit and tie is a good touch,   ….covers up the swastika neck tattoo. .  . Geebus.
What a load of crap ! get over it already. You still don't have a clue - - - -  heard a story, shame. create your own wealth through Black Monopoly Capital, and less corruption from your fat cat Politicians who are stealing your future, but you so blinded by your own prejudices, that you cant see the wood for the trees !!! There ARE NO MORE  whites left for your pathetic story. There are now MORE black millionaires than white one's in South Africa. Go do your homework and stop playing the victim, you are one of the PRIVILEGED BLACKS AND HAVE NO idea what you talking about. !!!
I asked you for your thoughts on why a white male chose an event that was attended by a predominantly white audience to accomplish his unimaginable massacre. Still waiting for a reply. I could give a sh-- what you think about me but I'm stating facts while you twiddle out opinions.
The first white person ever executed for killing a black person in Florida?  Seriously?
Aw. Are the minorities threatening your white, male status?
If Obama, a black man, a Latino American or a Muslim group declared Donald Trump winning the presidency ONLY because he was a WHITE MAN and he had little else going for him except THAT (insinuating he was a WHITE MAN) you would be condemning all as racist.  . Above you clearly state  "On the premise that he was a black man. He had very little going for him than that" (insinuating his color or being a black man). . Earlier Gene Miller writes "His genetic color is only "relevant" to a racist."  . Your statement clearly is based on his genetic color and his color being relevant to his winning the election.  . Gene Millers words, Nor do I "insinuate" that Obama is a black man.  Gene states, He had very little going for him than "THAT", what does "THAT" mean?   You continue to prove my point.   Are you a racist? In your words, YES.
My word, so "sleeping with a white woman" (by marrying one) would automatically discredit a black politician? Gee whiz, how about Tokyo Sequale and many others?
How about back when black/hispanics used to live on MLK Blvd. instead of California transplants and yuppie hipsters alongside their organic food grocery chains and microbreweries?  I don't see this gentrification stuff going away.  Pretty soon, all the young white people of the next generation will be making similar claims about the good old days when Portland was "weird" instead of the semi-Oakland/semi-SF situation we'll have in 10-20 years.  People in Portland are so clueless sometimes to the things that don't happen to them.
I learned long ago that insisting upon, asking for an apology is a complete and total waste of time. It changes nothing and, the one to whom the request is made laughs at the petitioner. This carpetbagger is just like the white cops who beat on black human beings, they ENJOY it and, when asked for an apology, they laugh. Do not attempt to assign human feelings to them as, they are a life form or two below us.
Just dig that hole deeper and deeper.   Using terms like 'not a good look' and 'tone-deaf' illustrate that you know the content is offensive, reductive, and simplistic to the point where it paints all members of a racial group as less than and uncivilized (with a reference to movies to boot), but are unwilling to call it racist, because you know the writer.  It seems that because you are from Ohio (I can search FB too!), a place more ethnically diverse in population, you are somehow more of an authority on the realities of race (and crime) and that us safe, lily-white OR residents cannot understand.  Well, (and this is not the first or last time I've been lectured by a white male about why something is not racist and I need to get over it) you are wrong, sir.
This statement is foolish and ill-informed, at best. BLM, who advocate against racial violence, cannot be compared to neo-nazi, alt-right white suprememcists, who advocate for it.
Do you believe black people are more violent than white people?
Funny how she comments on the rapes at the Swedish festival without mentioning that they were not done by white Swedes but by the 'non white migrants' who have turned Sweden into the rape capital of the world
And in your exploration, did you find any monument or sign that spoke only of "whites"? That only whites were involved in building this highway. Or was it that they didn't even mention the skin color at all. Or are you asking that blacks deserves a special monument every ten miles or so? Your perception promote racism by separation races. No where is there just whites or blacks, they all contributed to the building of the highway. Why should any color get special honors??  I am well read on the Navajo Code Talkers. They provided valuable service in disguising commands over the open air waves. That stupid movie with Nicholas Cage really demeaned their contribution.
Ms. Parker got it right. The GOP elites built this hot mess of an election that led to Trump being the GOP nominee. They recruited the "poorly educated" white people that Trump found when he joined the GOP. He was surprised at how easy it was to high jack the GOP nomination process. What ever else Trump might be, he can spot a mark from a mile away. The GOP base is full of marks, aka rubes. They were great for the GOP elites when they kept their place. They laughed at their base of "deplorables" on their way to their off shore banks. All they had to do to get the rubes to vote for Republicans was to promise to punish those "others" and keep them out of power. When Obama won, he destroyed the agreement the GOP elite had with their base of white racists. That lead to the Tea Party, and that lead to Trump. The GOP elites have no one to blame but themselves for the mess they are in.
The fact that Trump got elected contradicts your opinion. He appointed a white racist to head the DOJ. He was endorsed by Nazis and Klansmen. BTW, why don't white folks take responsibility for their choices? No one is forcing them to live in red states that are net welfare recipients from blue states. No one is forcing them to do drugs, over eat, and other self destructive behaviors. Globalization is not kind to the poorly educated white folks that elected Trump. He can't change that, even with Putin's help. The coal industry jobs are never coming back. Republicans have been doing everything they can to keep the poor in poverty, breathing and drinking pollution. They are still using the Southern Strategy to recruit white racists to the GOP. The GOP is just a white identity party these days. Poorly educated white folks are the only demographic dying younger. They are killing themselves. No one is trying to prevent them from voting. They vote against their self interest.
So, I guess you're saying that Jehovah's Witnesses cannot be spiritual.  If you believe that, I think I'll send Serena Williams over to kick you lily white ass.
The classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug was alw”ays bogus with no scientific justification.  Marijuana criminalization was a racist act. Harry Anslinger, Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics stated:  “There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.” “Reefer makes darkies think they’re as good as white men.
White Imperialism is not FREEDOM. Get a copy of the Burning Spear newspaper and learn something that isn't pro White Power. Define Terrorist and you'll find that Every US President since Colonization of the REAL America fit that definition
So little vision shown here.  It's not even ultimately about the flag or the national anthem.  It's about a cultural rift, largely along racial lines, about whether America's white population is fundamentally decent. The kneelers say no, America's fundamentally racist.  Listen to Kaepernick: “America refuses to address the pervasive evil of white cops killing black men, and I will not stand during a national anthem that honors the flag of such a country!”  This is how the left sees America.  "The flag of such a country," indeed.  Those words should be ringing in the ears of every American.
My thought exactly.  How does one credibly position fringe white supremacists alongside Islamic State? This ridiculousness is symptomatic of the overwhelming need of some to reduce the bluntness of a position that could potentially result in a call of racism or Islamaphobia or other with a, "and whites are bad too don't you know?"  ISIS is a cancer on the world.  Period.  That has nothing to do with white supremacists or the price of butter.
This stuff seems pretty crazy but I do remember some of this craziness when I was taking my engineering degree. Of course us engineers in training, whether we were white, brown, blue, male or female, were too busy working to be whining.  And given all the interviews we do of graduating engineers for our firm, it feels like these whiners do represent a loud but very much small minority because the candidates sure want to make sure we know they are not from the perpetual victimhood crew and just want to  be known as smart and hard working and won't start crying just because they make a mistake on a project and are held accountable.
Correction: the whites are not the largest minority.
Radical islamic terrorists are not the same as fringe white supremacists. You know and I know it. We should all condemn all violence, but all violence is not caused by the same thing.  As someone pointed out earlier, ISIS and radical islamic terrorism is a cancer on society.
Ask yourself why Donnie did not clearly and only denounce white supremacists.
I live and work in Atlanta, we have "Black Flight".  I have co-workers and neighbors who have moved to my neighborhood to get away from urban decay, and fewer young black men on the streets.  I have also met folks who have moved to Atlanta to get away from Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago, because of dysfunctional neighborhoods.  But they really do not want to talk about it in terms of policing, what many Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics will do is just say "Hey I am not like those lowlifes, getting out of here".
This dude is a total phony.  He does know how to play on the hatred and biases of poorly educated white people though.  Give him credit:  he is a funny entertainer.
Trump is a bold-faced liar and a pure-bred racist. He is no better than a bonafide member of the Ku Klux Klan. He is probably a full-fledged mebmer of the White Nationalists. Trump is a disgrace and an enemy of America. He needs to be impeached.
Just another example of someone trying to make us think white people are as bad as the Islamist terrorists so we should stop criticizing Islam/Islamism and stop saying 'Islamist terrorism'.  Pathetic.
White people suck.. Black people suck.. Yellow people suck.. Brown people suck.. Humans in general suck... Rant over thank you...
Sorry, Prof. Kochan. You miss the mark like so many other out-of-touch pundits across the USA. The election of Donald J. Trump as POTUS reflects a broad discontent running smack down the middle of the CONUS, and largely bereft of urban and university/college towns. Take a look a CNN's election maps, and you'll see what I mean. What that demographic divide says to me is that a broad segment of our population is tired of liberal elites looking down their collective noses at them, snobbishly, derisively, dismissively, and disrespectfully. Clinton nailed it (in a bad way), like Jesus to the Cross, when she called Trump supporters "a basket of deplorables," giving a clear validation that indeed, po' white folk is just trash left out on the curb of Main Street USA by DC, intelligensia, urbanites, suburbanites, soccer moms, silicon valley geeks, and hollyweed elites. The CNN election maps show the vastness of Trump's appeal geographically, and the narrowness of Clinton's.
It's funny how black people are "activists" but white people are 'supremacists,' 'neo-Nazis,' or racist.
Rhyner, you know about as much about foreign policy as you do domestic policy. That's not a compliment. Trump's fan base is full of undereducated white makes like yourself, which is why stupid ideas like Trump's Great Wall get so much traction with the Trumpeters. I know you've said more than once that diversity is Anchorage's biggest problem, but even if Trump's fantasy wall were built, its not going to make us more white like you're hoping.
Trump is a worthless stain on America. He's a sick, fascist, white supremacist traitor.
White people don't riot, it's only the "coloreds", right? That's as clear as can be, especially when it's on TV in HD.
No kidding. That's why I get angry with all the white employers who base their decisions on hiring & firing on whether or not the applicant or employee is white.
"But I do believe Trump's violent rhetoric and sexually aggressive, hyper-masculine, entitled behavior has given the white men who would vote for him permission to return to openly expressing a craving for power and a sense of entitlement that is dangerous to anyone who isn't a white, heterosexual man, or who doesn't identify as such." Perhaps "Make America Great Again" refers to this "return to openly expressing a craving for power and a sense of entitlement".
So LGBT people are "dogs?" What about  fornicators ,  adulterers, or clergy that buy an anniversary cake or want a photographer at their church event - how does the business know that they're  doing business with an apologist for child sex abuse and trafficking?  Also, as far as even Catholicism is concerned, even in Latin America as in the United States, the Church was segregated ; in the former, special chapels were built for Black slaves. All this so called "religious objections " to serving LGBT people is a smokescreen and a slippery slope down the road to making it legal in the name of "religion " to refuse to do business with non White people hence, a return to Apartheid.  If you don't wish to serve the public, then cease being a business  owner that does just that.   Although I don't doubt that a return to Apartheid in America is what Trump supporters want.
I work on the reserve located near my home. I hear this song and dance daily. In fact, I have it memorized.  There are 26 employees at a casino. 19 are white, like me. wait a minute, maybe I should say beige.. or pink.. what ever. not native. there, that works. anyways, jobs are made available to the non native population because the natives crying about injustice and unfairness don't want to work. so we take these offered jobs. then we wait on the natives dumping their hard earned whined for cash into the vlts. when they broke for another week, we listen to them call us white whores and white trash for stealing their jobs. Nice....
You don't seem to be looking beyond your life experience. I served the public in Oregon for more than 30 years. I know more about white people than you. The lies told about white people by white people don't effect my judgement. I deal with facts. You want to ignore the role of whiteness in this country because it gives you rights the rest of us don't get, like being considered innocent until proven guilty. Black folks can be shot dead in the street by white cops for merely being suspected of having a gun. White men can get away with arguing with a cop while having an AR-15 slung over his shoulder. The Bundy family comes to mind. That family would be dead today if they were black and threatening government employees with guns.
I agree.  Trump is most definitely a worthless stain on America. He's most definitely a sick, fascist, white supremacist traitor.
Upper middle class white woman talking about "us" and "action".   Are you picking up a gun sweetheart?  Of course not. Upper middle class white women will do what they've done for a hundred years. Hand out white feathers to MEN. Men who are to shed their BLOOD to go fight in another middle eastern craphole (and defend our freedoms or something), because Lizzie's feewings were hurt after reading twitter comments from a "seven year old girl".
Whites never learn....you're making enemies with the world - Blacks (lives matter/cops killing innocent blacks), Browns (destroying entire region and creating chaos), Slav Russians (yeah, anglos dont really consider them part of their own, so...), Yellow (sending the navy as potential "PREEMPTIVE" strike; not allow China to take uninhabited atols, when white STOLE and KILLED other of their land). Whites should enslave all blacks in America or send them back to Africa (on the way throw them oveboard), Nuke the crap out of Middel East and keep their Oil. Nuke the Crap out of Yellow peril so you can not only have the Pacific Ocean as your backyard, you can have the Yellowman's backyard as well!
Perhaps you need to back off the caffeine. I think you are making a huge jump there with your "fact". As I recall yes, Trump was prosecuted for not renting to blacks many years ago. How do you explain the multitude of minorities he has hired in his businesses? By your logic he should have only hired blond white people. To say someone is a Nazi Racist for supporting the President is also a big stretch. Support that one
You just don't understand the situation.  When the shooter is white, the shooter is a "lone wolf" and we must all wring our hands at the impossibility of stopping such incidents.  It is *only* when the shooter is black or brown that they are properly called "terrorists" and we must then gratefully accede to low-rent authoritarianism.
Why would anyone in their right mind want to be Trump’s Secretary of State?"  Because  the far right lunatic fringe "alt-right" (racists, white supremacists, anti- Semites, gun nuts") really don't see the world as most sane people do.  On the other hand, Mitt Romney is as sane as they come, yet, he's willing to bend over for the far right lunatic fringe white-supremacists/racists.  Makes you wonder.........................................  .
Republicans are finally getting the point that the US is becoming less and less white by the day.  The timing of this action by Republicans - immediately after an anti-Trump thumping at the polls - suggests that they finally see the writing on the wall.  Trump is a failed president, imbecile and psychotic.  He must be removed from office as soon as possible.
Actually, he was half black. Obviously it was the white half that got him elected (/sarc)
Rich, white folks do not wish to contribute to the healthcare of those less fortunate than them, simple as that.
Some of you non-white folk can't think clearly because of your hate.
I find it telling, Richard, that you describe black Americans as "thugs","refusing to listen to reason or facts",  "stealing and burning", and I find it strange that you imply they're "not average Americans". That's the sort of language I'd expect sixty years ago, not something I read in 2016.  I am also confused as to how you assign blame to Obama--as the leaders of our country, were either Eisenhower or JFK responsible for how white people lynched blacks during Jim Crow in Alabama? Or is it only black people who are uniformly influenced by the president's behavior?   I finally find it unsettling that you're more angry about property damage and peaceability than you are about the extrajudicial killings of Americans of color.
Another white dude stealing the black man's thunder.....
If he doesn't post racist stuff, he'll lose his minions. You know, Nazis, white supremacists, bigots, misogynists et al,
Mr. Dalton:  I"m one of those "white liberals" who optimistically hoped the election of President Obama signaled movement toward "post-racial/racist" America."such a fool was I."  Instead, it opened the floodgates of racism as millions of "loyal, true, America-loving Patriots" attacked our President with every racist/xenophobic epithet known.  He was not just a "N#$%$#", he was a "N$#%$" who wasn't even born in America."    We now have a GOP Presidential candidate who openly parades his racism and xenophobia..and his followers love it.    I ask myself, "can we really elect such a man to be our President?"  Is the hatred and bogotry Mr. Trump's actions and comments have disclosed really OK with a majority of American voters? Do those who approve and support such a view really represent today's America?  I never believed a person like Trump could win the GOP nomination..I was so very wrong. Now I can't, in my heart, believe such a man can be elected President..I hope I'm not wrong again
Yeah, those "poor millionaire football players," in street clothes and out of their team uniforms, can be shot dead by power-mad fear, simply walking down the street or reaching for their wallets. Both of those things have occurred within the last year. The players are sick of this...I don't blame them. They're being killed by white cops, not black ones? I wonder how one of those trigger-happy cops would feel to find out they'd shot one of those "poor millionaire football players?"
Yes but blacks are only 17% of the population... And commit more violent crimes then whites who are about 65% of the population.
Problem with feminism it's proven to be like Hillary Clinton and the legions of women corporate lawyers - dishonest, hypocritical, half-hearted, selective, greedy, and corrupt. Conceived as a leftist counter to the rich white patrimony, it's now a force for the conservative status quo and increasing income disparity.
Trump is a liar, a racist and a disaster. He will never be "President Trump;" respect is earned not ascribed. Where was your respect for the office of President when you were referring to Obama by various racial slurs and spouting crap about his birth certificate and religion? I guess respect only needs to be given if the president is white, huh Lars? You and all of Trump's other white nationalist supporters have a lot to answer for, and make no mistake, sooner or later you will.
The Democrats wore out the meme "If you'e not a Democrat, then you are racist". Now they have switched to the new meme "If you're not a Democrat, then you are a white supremacist". Some things never change.
Your such an idiot you dont realize how shitty a life ib prison is. Shanking him is ending his sentence earlier and you just want to police the world but I doubt you are some saint but let me take a wild guess. Your a single 50 plus white female. Most likely overweight.
Some of you white folks just can't handle the fact that you benefit from a lot of rape, robbery, torture, and murder. Before Pearl Harbor the US sent a cruise liner full of Jews back to Hitler. I suppose they thought that was the Christian thing to do. All lives have never mattered in this country.
For several years now on the Lars Larson daily Radio show Lars has a gentleman on his show usually once a week  that quotes daily, monthly,  and annual CRIME  statistics, (Rape,Murders, Domestic Violence etc.),  and other statistics  like   food stamp numbers, welfare numbers etc.  He discloses on whites, blacks, latino, mexican whatever races.  Its quite STAGGERING to see the numbers of   Latinos, Mexicans that are incarcerated, or on Food Stamps.   These people are committing the most  VIOLENT CRIMES, and of course,  most are ILLEGAL ALIENS.    They need to be sent back and BUILD THE WALL.   Motley's post below is a good example.    The DRAIN on the states Financial Resources for these folks is HORRIFIC.
Thanks for this. Anyone who thinks for 2 seconds that racism, white supremacy and the oppression of blacks is worse today, or even worsening, needs to grab a mid-19th century history book and read up on Jim Crow and the humiliating & un-American things it did every day to  ten million blacks in the South circa 1948.  Read U.S. Senator Bilbo's "best" quotes, delivered in the Senate or on the stump in Mississippi. Trump's idiot tweeting and clumsy or inadvertent race baiting can't compare to the least bigoted Southern congressmen of that era. It was the Southern Dems in Congress like Bilbo and his ilk who protected Jim Crow from federal spanking for 7 decades while Northern Dems like FDR coddled or ignored Jim Crow's blatant sins to keep the "Solid South's" electoral vote in presidential elections. My 1948 history "30 Days a Black Man" details black lives under America's apartheid in the South.  Rothstein's great "The Color of Law" details how racist govt. policies segregated the North.
But if BLM wants to hold an anti cop rally at UofT and make outrageous accusation and speeches about racist KKK cops, 200 years of white people fascists, Canada's treacherous   history of racism and slavery, they would be more than welcome.
Oregon is last in the Nation for graduating white kids from high school.  The holdover  "white trash" expendable honky from 1550 Great Britain to the Colony is still with us.  400 years of education research,  undeniable now,  says that boys are two years behind girls in emotional development,  brain development,  physical development,  than girls of the same age,  yet we still send them to public school to share a room and teacher.  98% a female teacher.  With female cohorts and administrators,  to try to give girls a boost in STEM and send rambunctious,  can't help themselves,  boys to detention for being much more immature than girls of the same age.  Doing the same thing,  over and over,  expecting a different result,  is institutional insanity,  and does not deserve a dime of public money.  Boys should be in class with boys,  girls with girls.  Education research tells us that both do better in single sex education environment.  Unions kill science,   not a President Elect.
don't go away mad..............just go away "go white boy go white boy"
My, oh my - the white supremacists are on fire today!  LOL
I don't believe that Charles Dalton has ever posted that no black person can be successful or ever has been because of white privilege.  If fact I am 98% certain he has not. It seems you have to lie in order to make your dubious point. In fact, I find you more of a racist than Charles, since you yourself have implied that Charles's success was the result of affirmative action, rather than his own talent.
And when we, the United States of America under President George (bozo) Bush went and bombed Iraq over lies and deceit, the televised event was presented to the American citizens as a 4th of July expose.  People munched popcorn and cheered all the while forgetting that there were innocent people being blown up.  Families murdered.  Communities destroyed.  Look at all the great white leaders in congress that tout their religion  and deny any help to underprivileged, non white human beings.    AND WOW!  NOW WE'VE GOT TRUMP TO LEAD US TO...........ah................um..........sob........silence
Yes Q Hall, the poor brown pieces of cereal have had it so rough.  You sissies literally find EVERYTHING offensive.  When are you going to sue because mean clouds are dark and only white ones seem happy?   Thats the level of absurdity you have achieved.  Everyone except white people are victims right?
The left has committed most of the violence and the parasite globalist fake news Globe continues to hammer white people concerned about immigration calling them Nazi's, KKK, racists, ect. The media is pushing more people to the right.
The "white shaming" is part of the reason Trump was elected. Racism is a dispicable; but shaming of "white" people is in fact racist and had gotten to an alarming point and "acceptable" in the leftist main stream media.  I am a tolerant, accepting individual with an open mind and heart; however, I will not accept being shamed for the values I hold dear and the colour of my skin.
There is no Pride anymore, only Shame. She is a hate filled racist and homophobe. She hates the gay white men who created Pride in the first place and is determine to steal it for her own political ends. If the thousands of gay men of Toronto stop supporting Pride she will hate them even more. All she will do is destroy it entirely if she stays on this path of bigotry and division.
Lol I hope you say the same thing when it comes to child molestation and perversion because most convicted offenders are white males but you don't see me blaming a race for that problem. Thankfully for me I don't blame "white" people for sexual abuse  and instead a problem we should ALL be attacking. We all know your a troll Wavemaker no matter what side of the political spectrum your seeking attention from. Grow up and get some real political arguments, this isn't MySpace my top ten.
Just the White Supremacists emboldened by their leader to resurrect the 1930s pogroms of the New Hitler/Der Fuehrer  Trump and his National Security Advisor Herr Bannon.  Start with a small non-christian minority to appease the Fundamentalist Racist Christians following Judaeo-Christian ethics, expand to Islamics and all immigrants while imposing martial law in all Black urban areas.  The 4th Reich in full flower.
I love how this article fails completely to even identify, let alone address the real implications of Bannon placing himself in power.  He just usurped the democratic process and created a shadow government.  Is this democracy?  The manner in which he did it, by manipulating a simpleton (Trump) to place him on the National Security Council (which controls the army) and then blocking others from attending the meetings reveals his disdain for "the people" who he claims to fight for.  He's basically telling the Joint Chiefs-of-Staff: "Obey my orders, your opinions and input are irrelevant."  He told the media to "shut its mouth".  He IS a White Nationalist - not "just a Nationalist" (whatever that is).  He's on record saying that he wants South Asians out of Silicon Valley.  He ran a news organization that HE says is a platform for the alt-right and as the editor he ran story after story about "Black on white crime", "Islamic rape culture" and the denigration of women.
Since Puerto Rico is not a State, its citizens (who also are not white) are 2nd-class.
Nolz, there is  confusion on your part about what constitutes "inclusion". It means to validate and empower marginalized groups. Because a predominantly white male police force represents a power structure, it cannot be a target of exclusion and discrimination - only those from marginalization and - in the case of BLM - violence can be.
Bannon recently called Neo-Nazis and white supremacists "clowns" ............ ................ Trump would have taken that as a personal insult.
Yes along with any racism against whites and those who want to remove them, right?
Opinion, not policy? What kind of cognitive dissonance allows for this sort of magical thinking? That was the vice president of the confederacy, second highest public official in the land, laying out explicitly the white supremacist foundations upon which the new nation would be built. To claim otherwise is either disingenuity, rank stupidity or both. Confront history. Saying "I wish my ancestors weren't racist traitors so therefore they weren't" isn't being honest about your heritage.
The thing to remember about all the dismissive comments about Professor Schurtz' ignorant choice of Halloween costume is that a minority of white Americans elected an overt racist with close ties to white nationalists who has been endorsed by the KKK to become the 45th president of their nation. Even for those who didn't vote for the cretin, in a society such as this, understanding that well-intentioned racism is still offensive and degrading is very difficult.
"Sessions talked Tuesday of improving morale in local police departments, which he maintained had been unfairly maligned, and he notably refused to commit to leaving unchanged consent decrees mandating changes at certain departments."   Still the same old "let the police run wild" ( as long as white people arent killed) racist jerk who was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 because he referred to a black colleague as "boy," used the N word freely and "joked" about liking the KKK until he heard they liked marihuana. Same Sessions who blocked black judges from nomination and sitting on the bench when he headed the judiciary committee.  It just gets worse and worse.
Nonsense.  People are people, and white people are just the same as anyone else.  White people aren't all that great, they're just the same as any other people with a different colored skin.  That's not racism.
Yes it is just that this time the loser being people of a different colour, but not white, makes it more obvious.
I guess another thing, all 19 hijackers on 9/11 were middle eastern looking muslims, so why do white children and a 90 year old Japanese lady get frisked in her wheel chair? Why does a kid with a knife given to him by his grand dad who fought on the braches of Normandy have to surrender that knife in order to go on holiday? You see, it's the lack of common sense at TSA which reflects the madness in Washington that drives us mad. You are essentially ignorance 'boots on the ground'.
I notice some Muslims, Hispanics, and Blacks are claiming the the media, Trump, and Police are slow to call this terrorism, because the shooter is white, and likes guns and country music. On the other hand some white nationalists are calling this Antifa because it targeted at country music lovers. The divide in the country again.
Being called "Climate Barbie" is quite generous and civil compared to the gutless comment PM Zoolander mumbled under his breath while in Opposition  referring to Peter Kent as a "Piece of sh!*".  At least the tweet was open and honest rather than a gutless and cowardly mumble.  Oh wait.   Peter Kent is a white male Conservative so its perfectly fine to make these cowardly comments while in the House of Commons back then by our now substandard "feminist" PM and three ring circus government.
White privilege at its finest! "get over slavery" "get over genocide and the trails of years" "get over the holocaust." Basically diverdave has a statue of limitations for any crappy thing Western civilization does.
They killed my brother. and I believe I see a white person there. So stop with the race bait bullshit. A BLACK person KILLED MY BROTHER.
Behind their shallow, multicultural facade, the Trudeau Liberals are and have always been a party of white privilege.  They don't care about Muslim refugees, only about taxing hard-working newcomers to support their permissive and dissolute lifestyle.        ❧   ❧   ❧   ❧   ❧  Canadians felt safe under Conservative Prime Minister Stephen J. Harper, a devout Christian who extended a warm-hearted acceptance to people of all faiths. He lived modestly at the historic PM's 24 Sussex residence.  While coming from a family of Roman Catholics, the playboy Justin Trudeau abandoned his faith to become an unbeliever,--and pose as a pro-abortionist for radical socialist votes. After hiring nannies at taxpayer expense, this former snowboard instructor embarked on extravagant renovations at 24 Sussex, whose cost soon ballooned to $10 million, and now $23 million.  Canadian newcomers don't feel secure under Trudeau, a permissive free-spending fool with no appreciation of their dawn-to-dusk hard work.
SJW's don't care about middle-aged white males killing themselves because they are: 1) white (e.g. laughing at white male tears) 2) male (e.g. laughing at white male tears) 3) middle aged (most SJW's are very young and see the old as an impediment at best, e.g. "Why don't you just hurry up and die?" So yes being a target of hate and derision might make you more likely to kill yourself.
LOL...yeah, because white supremacists are uniters of all.  /s  Stupid.
White men are evil. We get it, Liz.
Trump you mean.  Yes I am speaking about Trump.  Trump says he's a white supremacist.    He doesn't give a whit about anything but his own weak and insecure egomaniacal neurosis's.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yh0jAxOxGE  He's an admitted eugenist.  His personal advisor is a neoNazi white nationalist.  Yeah, I'm talking about that Trump and his effeminate slob sidekick.
"...the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do,” I'm not sure that applies to a group in power. Look at government bodies and CEOs. Most of them are white males. Whites don't need an advocacy group.
Trump made fun of women's appearances. He made fun of women's periods.  His infamous line: "grab 'em by the p****"   And despite all of this:  He won 53% of the white female vote  45% of college educated female voters  42% of women's votes overall  And 9 million more women than men vote in the US election.  Women had the opportunity to break the biggest glass ceiling in the world and vote for a female candidate that was also the globe and fail's preferred candidate as they have constantly reminded us after the election, but chose not to. The biggest whiners, Ms. Renzetti, are reserved for those who participated in the women's march the day after he was elected and could not accept the result of a democratic election.
This must be someone who used to go by 3rd gen AK., who also said white men were the Earth's alpha males...LOL...I offer to wit: From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
It has been my experience that most white people can't handle the truth about white racism in this country. They really don't want to know about the rape, robbery, and murder that they benefit from. They think liberty is about individuality. That is a white privilege.  The rest of us are racially profiled. They also don't want to tell the truth about the so called pro life movement. It is just pro fetus. Once a person can breath they are own their own. Most of them support the death penalty even though hundreds of innocent people have been found on death row. Pollution kills mostly poor people. Think Flint kids. The pro life folks are quite about that. We are still killing Indians for what little they have left. There is just silence on the right. They don't want to know they were raised with lies about who they are and the country in  general. We have never thought all lives matter. BTW, that was and is a white decision. Take responsibility for your behavior white folks.
You are an ostrich! Trumpism is all about white supremacy!
You do, of course, realize that calling a white person a Nazi is as repugnant a statement as calling a black person a N%^er, dont you?  Lemme ask it this way.  Were you offended by the Kathy Griffin\Trump Head photo?  As i suspect you werent, ask yourself what would have been the social reaction to Griffin holding a black mans head in the photo?  There has been a desensitization of hating white people.  Trump is regularly called a Nazi by the media and democratic leaders, hollywoods elite, and nobody is outraged by it.  Now, Trump tells rich black athletes to respect the flag, and all you can focus on is the use of foul language?  The language was disrespectful?  do you see the hypocrisy?  So please, understand, when you call conservatives Nazis, realize that you are using a slur that we find unbelievably objectionable, and racially based.  I dont file you under Antifa.  So dont file us under White Supremacist.
What associations does "white violence" have with Christianity?  What associations does "Muslim violence" have with Islam?  Didn't mean to destroy your argument.  Maybe I did.
From the tone of the article one would have thought that Magaqa was murdered by white racists.
PS: Never know, James...  maybe "separate" commencement was a safety precaution to keep the black students from being run down by a bunch of drunken white frat-boys.  Could happen, and if it did the frat boys would get away with it.
Personally, I didn't care that Obama didn't call terrorism out at "Radical Islamic" anymore than I care that Trump calls out the white supremacist fools by name.  I do however care that the things the Rs used for years as a club against Obama arejust fine now that Trump is behaving the same way.    I have brought this up before, but before defending Trump, I would suggest taking a look at how you would have reacted if Obama had said or done the exact same thing.  If you would have had a freak out, then be consistent and be bothered by Trump's behavior.  Think about things like the election commission asking for voter info, how would you have reacted had Obama done that?  The protests and violence in VA, how would you have reacted if Obama had given the equivalent of a shrug?
Immersion schools are far from immune to racism. I think Mr. Cramer said the Third World War exercise was the extreme example, but overall he suggested that everyday racist logic and assumptions on the part of white people were more common and therefore the more problematic.  Instead of Mr. Cramer pulling his kids from public schools maybe there can be a special immersion school where the children of ignorant white people can learn about the social construction of race in the U.S. and other aspects of Anglo-European racism. Or better yet, they could simply teach kids about the history of white racism in the United States starting in fourth or fifth grade and throughout high school.
"The arc of xenophobic terror – whether “inspired” by the Islamic State or white supremacists – has recently increased in frequency and breadth. Within the past month alone, Flint, Portland, suburban Virginia, London, Manchester, Brussels and Paris have all witnessed acts of violence intended to maim, kill and sow division."  I applaud Khan for acknowledging that James Hodgkins, the Virginia shooter, is a terrorist, something others have been hesitant to do.
"The GOP can get away with being a whites only party"???  “It is time to end the slavish devotion to the Democrat party. They have insulted us, used us and manipulated us. They have saturated the black community with ridiculous lies: ‘Unless we support the Democrat party, we will be returned to slavery. We will be robbed of voting rights. The Martin Luther King holiday will be repealed.’ They think we’re stupid and these lies will hold us captive while they violate everything we believe as Christians.”  Bishop E.W. Jackson
And who are you - an old white guy, I'm absolutely sure - to tell any woman what she should or shouldn't protest? I doubt you actually care about Muslim women but use this as a convenient way to express your anti-feminism.
What a shock that Saunders tried to spin statistics.  I recall that when he wrote about the Cologne assaults (something that really couldn't be spun), the strongest word he could use to condemn the attacks was "distasteful."  I guess rape is only an outrage when white men are responsible.
Your not playing Brett, Ruben Reyes is playing and he played you. Surely you know the meaning of the term. . No need to get defensive about it, Ruben is a pro at manipulating people. Anyway how is whining about the misspelling the name Ruben on topic? And his bigoted white people and dumb Jews comment? What aspect of the topic exactly do those slurs address?
Clinton IS nothing but a bigot.    She doesn't give a carp about anyone or any race but herself............You want to talk white privilege and white bigotry...........SHE's IT.   Raised in a rich family in ARKANSAS , never wanting financially, never rubbing shoulders with the rabble like us working people, never rubbing shoulders with Mexicans or blacks only hiring them as servants...........Trump is right,  Clinton is a bigot.
You wrote:  <<I support that which follows the teachings of Jesus and of the Catholic Faith.>>  Good luck trying to convince God Almighty you thought the gospel meant appealing to people's worst instincts to gain power and enrich a transnational oligarchy at the expense of the poor. Which chapter and verse was that again?  Fr. Gruner certainly consorted with white supremacists, in addition to supporting the kind of Russian-sponsored propaganda we have come to know since Trump's allegiances came to light.  George Soros? Pathetic, Ebes.
Blacks had a legitimate beef, and were way too nice about it. What's the beef inherent with white nationalists? Is it that they are required to sit in the back of the bus? Are they slaves? What exactly is their beef? Is it that they are not allowed to own blacks as slaves? Okay.
Funny, when I make comments about angry, white males I'm supposed to be ashamed of my "sexist" language.  I have a feeling some broflakes really love their double standards. Women belong in the dentist's office because tee hee, but when a woman makes a statement about men and how they behave because testosterone? Interesting.
Neo-Nazis and white supremacists in the White House,  slobber and drool over Session's racism.
In 1968, the evening news was showing, in the southern states, naked black men lynched from trees for being seen with a white woman, some being set on fire, alive. In 1968, the evening news was showing US soldiers in Vietnam, mostly white, with necklaces of 'slope' human ears and fingers, and tobacco bags made of 'Charlie' human scrotums.  In 1968, you would see Huntley and Brinkley on the evening news, curls of cigarette smoke to the side or in the background. In this 2nd decade of the 21st European religious century, there is a tendency to white-wash the past, for emo-cringe reasons. In Hawaii, with the overthrow of the Kingdom in 1893 and the following annexation in 1898, the Hawaiian language was entirely banned from schools and government, and discouraged elsewhere. The Native Hawaiian culture was squashed because it was a "terrorist threat" to the Religious Republic of Hawaii. The ban of the Native Hawaiian language and culture in schools and government wasn't lifted until 1978.
Trump is no more incompetent than the folks that voted for him. They don't have a clue about how the world works either. They are quite proud in their ignorance, like Trump. Most of them are incapable of following the money. They actually believe that the poor and minorities get more free stuff from the government than the 1%. They refuse to take responsibility for their choices, like Trump. They believe their failures are always caused by someone else. They don't believe there is a thing called white male privilege. Yet none of them can tell you when it stopped, while they claim to prefer the original Constitution. Their uncluttered minds can't see the irony in any of this.
That's just ridiculous!!! Just because of this political correctness BS I'm dressing up as KKK. One of my kids is going to be a white cop chasing my other kid which will be a black criminal. He will be pretending to shoot at the criminal. My other kid will be a Muslim terrorist. Why you ask. Cause I'm sick of walking on eggshells trying not to offend crybaby libtards.
I see a lot of white people here complaining they can't wear racist costumes. Oh you poor precious people. I'm so sorry for you it's not acceptable to dress up and mock other cultures and races. Oh but that's your right! Or at least it used to be! What a dreadful world we live in now! How is little Chad and Becky going to have any fun if they can't do black face or dress up as an Indian, a group of people who have had to endure and survive a great genocide? Who have had everything taken away from them, culture, Life. And now you want to dress up as some white wash racist version of them for fun? Oh you poor whites! /s Seriously people get used to it. Race and culture are not costumes for your consumption and enjoyment. And yes this line of thinking is going do die with all the old racist white people, and I for one with my beautiful multiracial family cannot wait.
its  not about white identity.... this is about society, which is teaching, whites are rassist, and not white are victims...   it went so far, you have many cases, when situation went to oposite extreme....  being not white/not male become advantage for elections...    and for elections - Khan won, coz london is currently city of foreigners...   segregation,white run  is speeding up  ...just wait 10 years more, and you will have places without british, just with foreigners holding UK passport...    //sory english is not my native l.
My fear is that Tory will be a complete idiot and still believes  BLM is an honourable group of people who only seek to live in a tolerant just society. He thinks good will is the cure for the racist bigots  of Church Street, the  gay men, the leather men,   jocks and drag queens of Toronto are now classified as. That is after all what this is all about, the inhumane racism of Toronto's gay  white men. We are guilty as charged because Tory would never dare defend   Toronto's gay community from slander by  BLM.
White inbreeds?  Are you a member of Rev. Wrights church in Chicago. Or a brown or black, Cool, Cluck, Clan movement?  BLM?
No, "pasty white" is not racist. I'm white, and I am not offended. Why would I be? Is it because my ancestors were slaves? Nope, as my ancestors were not slaves. Is it because my mother used to have to ride in the back of the bus? No, as my mother never had to ride in the back of the bus. No, I got to go to the good schools because I was white. I know it's hard for cretins like you to understand it all. You have my sympathy for having to ride the short bus to school.
What the heck is "White Swiss monopoly capital" Is that your new phenomena to steal the mind of black people from real issues.
How is "increasing diversity" going to help? Why not focus on getting "the best cops we can"? Your suggestion is both nonsensical, and racist. That's not just pointless name calling, either. Specifically seeking people out for a position, and disqualifying others on the basis of their race... I know what they'd call it if someone posted about specifically seeking more white cops.
Point ,in fact , TRUMP is a racist, with avowed racist views on ALL non-whites. That cannot be argued (fact) . His nationalism is phony and artificial, at best (fact). He does not love his country (fact). He sorta likes money...(though)(fact).
Truth hurts, huh? Whining coming from the purveyors of hate and fear for a lifetime of Republican attack dogs of talk radio, fox news, and a host of white supremacist mouthpieces.
It's ignorant to say that 40-45% of French people are bad, racist, dumb, etc., and that is about how many people are expected to vote for Le Pen in the second round. This is not North America, a melting pot, this is a country of native, Christian-origin, French-speaking people. Foreigners need to adapt themselves to French customs or go home. It's amazing how progressives like Saunders are always wrong on this stuff. "White guilt, white guilt!" Sorry. This in fact is the way you create sympathy for real racism and white supremacist ideas. Progressivism has become a nauseatingly stupid ideology.
Trump continues to speak shibai to the poor whites who voted him in while doing nothing for them except mouth platitudes.  I hope they wake up soon before he gives away the house to the rich.
trumpy is no messiah, he is just a plain white bigot who likes to scam people who he does business with.  whatever he says, he will never do and will be impeached for incompetency.  he is phony from cover to cover and will lie with a straight face.  he has no morals or integrity.
David Who??? Did you watch the video? it is not long about 4 minutes. Also don't try to change the subject please.  But to answer your question, white supremacists and their ilk associate with whoever will listen to them.  Yes he ran for President as Republican in 1992, but he also ran for President as a Democrat in 1988. White supremacists are vultures and desperate. But I will say this about them they say what they believe.  Unlike a certain party and its followers that really are two faced about their hate.
Now my comment on the news story.  First off I'd like to apologize to Quinn Smith for our small-minded town, Our small minded Prosecuting Attorney. And most especially our small minded teens who tend to all look and act alike, and like they fell out of some  50s B movie about southern Justice.  The problem we have is being small and mostly white and isolated here on the Olympic peninsula many many of us are descendants of the few pioneer families who homesteaded here in the late 1800's.. I am directly related to two pioneer families on my dad's side. What with so few people there was a bit of inbreeding if you know what I mean. Lucky for me my mom's family was fresh blood... plus none of them were big drunks. Unfortunately, some of those drunken incestuous.bloodlines are still producing teens who are unable to walk and chew gum. It isn't that they want to be an embarrassment to the human race its a generational thing and they really are that freaking stupid.I apologize for my cousins.
Please, Charles, don't lump all us 'white folks' together.  It detracts from any positive message that 'all lives matter'.  It's not my fault I was born 'white', and I have a big problem with Trump and his 'me- and all my wealthy friends and family first, and to h*** with anyone else' mantra.
Partially??? The driver is wholly at fault for leaving the scene and not rendering aid. The woman may have been able to live. Partially??? I can already tell you're an "old white guy" as one of my editors used to say. And don't get preachy at me. I don't need nor do I want or deserve it. And yeah, you'll probably call me racist for taking a stand here.
Notice how the article only compares blacks to whites and leaves out other major racial/ethnic groups like Hispanics and Asians?   https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/racial-gender-wage-gap-persists-asian-american-men-top-average-n602076 "White men earn a median $21 an hour, making more money than women across all races, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. They also earn more than black and Hispanic men, who make a respective $15 and $14 median hourly wage. The only group that out-earns white men is Asian men, who earn $24, according to the report."  If there are factors such as "discrimination" as the article states, then why do Asian men earn more than white men? Could it be that Asian men work harder, value education and family more than white and black men and that discrimination doesn't have a GD thing to do with it? This article is a great example of how the leftist media tries to misinform the public in order to push its agenda.
Any thoughts about the number of black on black killings??  Or black on white attacks??  Or the huge number of Hispanic gangs, most illegal alien felons, that run huge areas of LA, Oakland??  How about the number of honor killings in this country?? Any thoughts on the liberal run cities like Chicago, Detroit, DC, etc. No!!  Why??  Because they are all liberal run cities, many for the past 50+ years, and liberals are no going to say a word to challenge minorities to get their act together-FACT!!  What about these parents??  Or do you what to blame that on the CBF, Repubs, G. Bush, or G. Washington!!  Dishonest, lazy and clueless liberals.
Because there is no history of black people enslaving white people in this country, subsequently dehumanizing them, denying them basic rights, and using whiteface as apart of that to caricature and stereotype them. History, learn it.
Ms. Hill's agenda is obviously racially motivated, referring to the president as a "white supremacist", and calling on all the "black and brown" folks to boycott the Cowboys. Are there no white, red, or you name it colors who deserve to join the boycott? ESPN has dug its own grave by hiring and letting loose the results of the so called "higher education" journalism graduates. These talking heads were taught that in order to be successful, and stand apart, they must make a name for themselves. These days, that means being political, and what better way to perpetuate their notoriety, correct or not, than to propagate their personal version of unfair race relations.
Good questions. I only stated that the registration of Muslims, not necessarily an injustice in itself, seems reasonable if high rates of crime, of a particular nature,  can be identified with a particular group of people.  Hypothetical references to whites and blacks do not defeat the above statement.   Now that I think about it, the fact of the matter is that Black violence in America does exceed the violence committed by Muslims in this country. But if we knew that their was a particular widespread segment of the Black population  advancing a particular ideology through violence, the society would not hesitate to cast some sort of  blanket over Blacks in general as a means to combat the violence. Would this be wrong?  It all comes down to the actual or potential violence that the society is responding to. Violence can rip a country apart and destroy the very foundations of a society leading to even greater death and destruction. You have to be realistic about these things
"Charles - Obama is half white so is he a recipient of "white privilege"?"  The one drop rule still applies in the 21st century. Obama does not get any white privilege. The Founding Fathers did not want to free their children born by black slaves. That is the beauty of race based slavery, if you are a white man. That is why they created "the one drop rule" in the first place. Don't take my word for it. Just ask a white cop. Most of them support racial profiling. That alone makes equal protection under the law impossible. Of course, you could ask the white racists that support Trump. That includes the KKK and Nazis. They will tell you the same thing. White men are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Black men are always suspect for just being present.
You wrote:  <<Steven Bannon, who allegedly has some ties to unsavory KKK types...>>  You're not grasping the argument. I doubt Bannon has "some ties" to the KKK. The point is he actively and aggressively promoted an ideology congenial to the white supremacist mission of the KKK.  You wrote:  <<The Confederate Army has been dead for centuries as well, but apparently we still face issues with the simple appearance of it's flag.>>  Typical conservative hand-waving.  Note the Confederate flag represents a treasonous rebellion to defend slavery and its legacy of Jim Crow, systematic terrorism against African Americans, and social and institutional racism.  I have got to wonder how you reconcile Christianity with the ideology of Donald Trump and the alt-right. Hypocrites!
Would you like the black privilege to be profiled as an angry black man with a gun? You might survive a month. As a white man you can argue with a cop while having an AR-15 slung over your shoulder and live to tell the story. That is a white privilege. BTW, the angry black man idea would only have to be in the mind of a terrified white cop with a license to kill. The police union will say your killing was justified. The cop that kills you will get time off with pay to recover from killing you. Living in an open carry state will not matter at all. Being ignorant is no way to prosper in the 21st century. Start by taking responsibility for your choices and behavior. It looks like you know more about rap music than I do. I'm more of an old school jazz man. Do you have some hidden desires? Do you have "jungle fever"?
So, now we're going to blame Obama for a rise in hate crimes, huh?  Obama caused more non-white, non-heterosexuals to be attacked?  How so?  I have zero problem calling BLM people morons and bad for their cause.  Tell me.....are you giving the racist white kids at my school a pass because of BLM, or are you justifying the white kids behavior because of BLM?
Too white. They don't matter.
the left: asian cop shoots unarmed black man- "i hate white people! kill all cops! pigs in a blanket, fry em like bacon!! no justice!!! Let's destroy the local convenient store!!!" obvious terror attack by an islamic extremist- "ok guys, lets wait for all of the facts to come out before we start pointing fingers. we dont want to spread hate, ok! besides, this attack is nothing compared to the Christian bombing on planned parenthood in the 90's."
This will never ever stop unless authorities get more serious about what they are doing. Must go very very hard after family and friends that knew. It doesnt matter whether they are Islamic, Nazi, white trash, BLM, or any other. Someone always knows. Not enough to prosecute? Get hot and make better laws.
"I’m going to be OK. And if you’re are a white heterosexual male with a decent job, you’ll probably be OK too." Do we need any more proof that 'Luke' is a bigot and who knows what else? Hit tirate is just that - garbage being spewed because his feelings are hurt, the career crook that he supported - that accepts money from countries that Murder GAYS, treats their dogs better than their women and thinks nothing of murdering Christians.... THIS is who HE thinks should be our President... His 'whole belief system lost' I'm crying for him....   NOT  AND Not getting my business any time soon...
Institutional racism? How is that possibly defensible when We have A Black President,  a Black AG, Black Senators, Black Mayors, Black Governors, Black soldiers, Black Generals, Black Doctors, Black Attorneys, Black actors, Black TV Networks, Black... Etc Etc etc. ?!   "What it demonstrates to me is that many white people in the US are still that variety of drooling thugs who would hang any unsuspecting African-American by the neck from a tree if given half a chance."  Now. THAT is Racism! Wow....
In any event, the meaning of kneeling has already been expressed; there's no ambiguity about it.  Said Colin Kaepernick:  “America refuses to address the pervasive evil of white cops killing black men, and I will not stand during a national anthem that honors the flag of such a country!”  "Such a country."  "Such a country."  That privileged little snot, like the ones who knelt at St. Ignatius High,  should thank God they are so privileged to even be in this country.  Their irresponsible comment that they're too good for "such a country" is revolting.
Yes, protest is needed, but it's how we protest.  Rev. King demonstrated to us how we can protest--with nonviolence of the heart--and change things.  Because southern racists never accepted they had lost the Civil War fairly and for good reasons the 1954-60s civil rights movement could have easily started a second civil war--and King was aware of that.  That's clear in many of his decisions of how to proceed.  Laws were changed, but not the hearts of to-the-death racists and now we are facing that unfinished business--and we are again facing a situation that could destroy our nation.   If our nation is to survive we must find the way to stand up to the white supremacists who have gained a strong foothold in the White House with Trump's complicity--without starting a civil war.
Uh.........  Derp.  (A) Trump demands that we also cut half of this "line" of authorized immigrants. (This was so much easier when you could push the lie of: I just want to enforce the law!  Stupid, white nationalists!)  (B) Gardner wasn't elected in 2014 to support a tee-vee laughingstock, serial moocher, and failed casino developer whose greatest political identity was a racist smear of our President. He was elected to represent Colorado, whose residents OVERWHELMINGLY support DACA.  Butting in line in what criminal Sheriff Joe did. Always a slap in the face of the American citizenry.
Given the author's logic, the safest places for Whites to live would be Black neighborhoods.  One solution for keeping cops from shooting Blacks would be to withdraw police protection from Black neighborhoods and let Blacks work it out.  "Hodad" echoes some of my other thoughts.
Your hateful and unsubstantiated list of personal slurs and attacks will not be tolerated.  Flagged. . "illiterate," "racist," "clueless," "White Supremacist,"  if you call someone these names- you better have the guts to back that up with facts- lots of facts- or at the very last have the cajones to use your real name.  You don't belong in what should be a place of civil dialogue.
Some People confuse protest on a singular issue as protest against the Nation which is a simplistic response. The protest by Caps and others were against the racism by the white majority against blacks and other minorities. It wasn't a protest against America as a whole. And, more importantly, it was a non-violent protest against what the white cop told the white motorist he pulled over, "Don't worry, we only kill Black people"
Monte you are totally wrong and uniformed re social justice. Study its origins and goals and you will see what it really is. And please don't make me puke by bringing up "white privilege." You sound like a real PC lefty if you buy into that garbage
The view from the other side, as a white male:  My mother's father was Ukrainian, her last name is constantly mispronounced, everyone gets it wrong. For me, people think I am Chinese because of my first name, and often use my family name as my given name, Chinese people in particular seem to think I am Chinese. My name is actually an old English name that happens to also be a common family name in Chinese. It's annoying, often I just don't correct people, but I don't worry that everyone is a racist out to get me. Jerks come in all shapes, sizes and colours, and from all kinds of different backgrounds, religions and cultures. It's not because you're black, its because they're a jerk.
If asexual reproduction is needed, history tells us that most likely a white man will discover how to do it.
Sheema is taking her usual position of excusing Islamist extremism, by equating it with White Supremacist violence. There is no comparison. Islamists have been and are killing hundreds of thousands of people (both Muslims and non-Muslims). White Supremacists make lots of noise but are not in the same killing-league.
Clinton has reached the last stage of Liberal Argument theory... When all else fails, scream "RACIST" and hope that your opponent will be shamed into admitting defeat. It's not working anymore, racist and bigot have lost their power, because apparently every single white person that isn't a die hard Liberal is a racist or bigot. You can only call someone something false so many times before they stop caring about what you think and you lose your power over them.
"We face a resurrection of the white death."  Uh oh, another "white oppression" for SJWs to cry about.
What an incredible pile of stinking manure. Trump's platform had NOTHING to do with white nationalism. He got basically the same percentage of the white vote that Romney got.  Trump no more promoted white nationalism than Obama promoted black nationalism in 2008 and 2012. Trump based his campaign on economic nationalism, secure borders, reduced regulations, limited government, and lower corporate taxes. Why do people insist on pushing these false narratives? The Democratic Party has not won the white vote in a Presidential election since since 1964. Were Romney, McCain, George W, George H.W. all white ethnic nationalists? They all won the white vote by huge margins as well. Trump is a marketer. His words were market positioning. Banning all Muslims from entering the country was said to differentiate him from Obama who wouldn't even utter the words Islamic terrorist. He later refined it to Muslims from terrorist hotspots. He was campaigning, not setting policy.
(a) misleading technicality; (b) put aside Afrikaner for a moment and consider the broader point; (c) (i) such heavily concentrated wealth at the top indicates economic disease, (ii) their race indicates a persistent racial problem; (1) you're defending the bantu education system?; (2) i'm not black; i'm white monopoly capital.   You'd think Afrikaners would do better out of Apartheid than 3 in the top 16 - perhaps they were too busy blaming the English for their lack of will power ... or the Jews... or the Arabs... or is that ignorant and racist?
while the hardcore neo-Nazi and white supremacists appear small in number, their philosophy has far reaching effects.  much of trump's hard core supporters have racists tendencies.  trump built his campaign based on racism; his slogan make America great again, is a façade for make America white again.  many dislike minorities believing that they are polluting the purity (white) of America.  and these people with this attitude is all over the us, not just in the south, and many are in the rural areas.  you say that Nazis cannot change America only politicians can; but you forget there are many politicians like trump who have white supremacists tendencies, many in the republican party.  so can we punch trump in the face?
Your anti white hate shines through and illustrates why white people need groups to protect their rights.
Ever since former justice minister Alan Rock feminized the custody laws and now we have a feminist PM.  The product of this are lost men who don't know their way because they know that their future is screwed.  Most recent opioid deaths (actually suicides) are men but hey who cares right?  The only gender issue on the federal radar is the MMIW inquiry.  Besides our parliament is filled with "old white grandpas" as stated by our now racist PM.  So yes the hate is on for men especially if you happen to be white.  So today's men are the product of marriages where the best advice for the man is "if you're right then shut up".  Yes we have to shut up - or else the obvious consequences.  And if things don't work out because the woman is always right - it's still the man's fault for being passive aggressive. Forget about sex, and let's focus on the family law system first.
SMH. "The world wuz better when wimmen couldn't vote or have a job!" Good lord.  I'm sure you're not interested in facts, but many cultures have been comfortable with TG people for millenia.  Transgenderism wasn't created by "feminism" just like feminism didn't create troglodytes who think anyone but a cis white male Christian is inferior to them.  The troglodytes always existed, but now we hear more from them due to their death throes. Bye trogs! We won't miss you.
Especially in Trump states, but generally in the US as a whole, those receiving Medicaid are 41% white in all states combined, 25% Hispanic, 22% black. 98% of Medicaid recipients are white in Idaho; 93% in West Virginia, 76% white in Kentucky, the state of Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul; and 60% in Minnesota and Nebraska. Whites receive 60% or more of Medicaid in 18 states.  So "them" isn't getting the "welfare", "us", meaning whites, is getting it.  What makes whites into terrorists is the sheer endless number of hate crimes against minorities whether by race, religion or sexual orientation. Except for 9/11, Muslims from our citizens or from abroad commit relatively few terrorist attacks compared to our white citizens. It doesn't help to deny the truth. Hate crimes are terrorism.
Tamura: "And the white sycophants far outnumbered their Indian friends at these camps" is a very racist comment.
I don't care what gender, race, or class you are.  I don't care if the person you murder is of the same gender, race or class as you are.  If you shove an arrow through a living man's ear into his brain (Eugene case) you deserve to die.  In that case, the black defendant got to live by testifying against the white bad guy, even though the black guy was the one who actually shoved the arrow into the victim's brain.    And all just to steal the victim's car so all three of them could commit more bank robberies.    And the black guy had gotten off on a previous murder charge in another State by testifying against the bad guy in that case, too.
It's White Nationalist terrorism, Trump.  Call it what it is.
Regarding the Flint situation, the Republican governor appointed a manager to run the city when it went bankrupt. No elected officials other than the governor had any say about the water system. Regarding Tamir Rice, he was a victim of state sponsored murder, not any random thug. Thugs don't have tax payer financed unions defending their behavior. You offer a false equivalence between a criminal and a government official. Finally, the GOP want the mentally ill to own guns. Those guns make murder suicides easy for the father to kill his wife and kids when they try to leave him. Democrats don't want to arm the mentally ill. I can't assume a majority of Republicans love their kids more than their guns considering what they support as policies. BTW, I don't hate Republicans, I just don't trust them, for my own safety. The GOP base that elected Trump are not conservatives. They are just white and angry. Do you want me to go to a Klan rally to discuss public policy?
That's BS, an affectation devised to inflame their racist movement.  When white police kill blacks without good reason, they're almost always  prosecuted. (I said "almost" because I can imagine at least one case where prosecution did not occur.)
This pretty well sums up my iron-clad conclusions that white privilege for too long - 200 years at least - has created these animals. And gives credibility to Lisa Bloom's findings of fact hereunder offered. From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
yeah, all those white people that died in the civil war. All those white people that died in WWII...I see your point ....white people are evil.
He's going to be all on his own as he doesn't fit in with the black, mexican or white general population in the industrial prison complex on the mainland. I'm placing a $1,000 bet the ex-chief is going to be wearing a lot of lipstick when the Mexican Cholos/MS13 gangs call dibs on him and demand he pick up the soap! LOL
cont'd  Now, it may be objected that certain drug statutes -- e.g. crack vs. powder cocaine -- are racist because blacks commit certain kinds of crimes more often that whites.  This is a ridiculous indictement of the system.  The ball is in the individual's hands.  It's ridiculous to cry racism when a black is sent to prison for using crack, when a white man would also be sent to prison for the same offense.  Each of the offenders had the choice whether to commit the crime or not. If blacks who are sent off in droves for PWITD crack don't want to be, they could arrange it so that by this time next year, PWITD crack would be known a "white man's crime."  How?  By simply leaving it to white men to commit that offense.
I'll opine that stereotyping is in the eye of the beholder, AkBorn's comments could have just as well been directed against those white trash punks in the Valley murder-oops, there's that stereotyping again:).  Seriously, I looked at this guys FB page yesterday and what's troubling as usual are some of the comments from  friends that can certainly be easily stereotyped.  What is it with this attitude that dwells on the in your face / F-bomb laden crap, the "gangsta" image most of us find despicable - especially when the wanna be turns into just that.
That's what President Teddy Roosevelt used to call "The White Man's Burden" and evangelical churches continue to do to this day.  To leave Oregon and go over to educate the poor and ignorant of the world so that our values become theirs because they are unable to take care of themselves.
First, no one even pretended that anyone has a monopoly on racism. But, whichever racists are in power will weld it. Show me historically in the US when you should have been worried about anything but white racism towards others. Yes, Jeff Sessions is that bad. If you refuse to accept that then you'll be happy with the policies reversed that attempted to make everyone a little more equal. But hey, I'm a white guy. I'm not at all worried that anything is going to happen to me. I'm worried about what other people will do to each other given the opportunity. It's already started.....read the news.
You don't watch much TV.  The man from Mars would think that most people here are black, in the power positions, and dominant over those around them.  What few white women exist are red heads and children are worshiped.
Most protests in America are peaceful. White supremacist nazis are the biggest violent terrorist threat in America today.
"Southern Democrats insisted on protecting slavery in all the territories while many Northern Democrats resisted. The party split over the slavery issue in 1860 at its Presidential convention in Charleston, South Carolina. Northern Democrats nominated Stephen Douglas as their candidate, and Southern Democrats adopted a pro-slavery platform and nominated John C. Breckinridge in an election campaign that would be won by Abraham Lincoln and the newly formed Republican Party. After the Civil War, most white Southerners opposed Radical Reconstruction and the Republican Party's support of black civil and political rights. The Democratic Party identified itself as the "white man's party" and demonized the Republican Party as being "Negro dominated," even though whites were in control." (PBS) Placing the 2017 Democratic party into 1850 America is a fool's quest.  Why can't Republicans stick with today? Because there's no arguing it's become hate-filled, racist, and fascist.
Before Charlottesville, the white supremacists were talking in a chat room about running a car into protesters.
what is your point, mcclelland?  what are you trying to convey with this article? i was born and raised on the southside of chicago. and i'm white. you did not walk through a rough neighborhood at night, no matter what color you were. hell, you didn't even stop at a red light.  although i no longer live in that area, i can assure you that that still stands true today. i know plenty of white people, including myself, who had their clocks cleaned, after that making that mistake. are you saying that white people should feel guilty about not getting shot, or potentially becoming victims of crime,while walking through a black neighborhood? white people have some kind of immunity from senseless violence? i couldn't be happier that these gangbangin' shitbags are killing themselves. granted, they could use some time at the range; may help to cut down on hitting' innocent people. nevertheless, that's street justice; shitbirds killin' shitbirds; saves the cops some work.
Isn't it a bit incivil, Monte, to say that those who don't agree with your highly assertion are simply being blind?  How is "white privilege" not  racist terminology? The inference is that my accomplishments and success are due to the color of my skin. And that strikes me as nothing but racial bigotry. Would you use the phrase "Black privilege" in talking about the disproportionate success of Blacks in basketball, football, track and field? Would you use that term to refer to affirmative action? I doubt it.   This is the problem with the vocabulary of "social justice." Like religion, it invents a sin lexicon to guilt and shame society into submitting to the tyranny of an artificial equality achieved by rule of law and social pressure. That's partially why 60 million Americans - fed up with the liberal shame game - just voted in a boorish, vulgar president who seems incapable of shame.   The culture of social justice reminds us that more laws simply occasion more "sin."
Zuma's final bid to capture as much as he can and then flee to Dubai where all his offshore accounts and shell companies are accessible. Would not something of this size need to go through parliament for legitimacy? It seems Jacob will transfer his debt for attaining wealth onto RSA's citizens. Treasonous!  The funny thing is that whites are still the enemy.
Can you name any woman who wrote a manifesto against men and then targeted them in a killing spree?  No you can't.    But if that were to happen -- or the times when men have written a manifesto against women and then killed a bunch of them -- I'd call it a hate crime.  Just like that white supremacist who shot a bunch of black people in a church was charged with hate crimes.  Yet strangely, there's a lot of resistance to calling it a hate crime when women are the hated group and the target.  Why is that?
Newsflash: if you are Jewish and you work for or stand with an anti-Semitic White Supremacist, then YOU TOO are complicit.
No but I was on the rebel media! 24.9 million views last month and growing spread the word.  Nothing wrong with calling out the G&M for what it is.  If you are Jewish, part of the LGBTQ community, a white female you have major concerns about Islam and sharia.  Rotterdam anyone? Maybe you are in favor of young girls getting gang raped but I can tell you, most of us are not!
Why do they need to do your bidding for you? Were you out denouncing white guys who shoot people after Vegas and every other shooting? No, so why do Muslims need to do it?
You are no conservative. Just plain 'ol white trash.
Yes, maybe I am a prat. Just to clarify....given SA's history, it can be argued that the white population (collectively) lacks the moral authority to pass judgement or criticise the current government. This is not to say that the critiques and judgements are not valid, but when coming from white quarters it can be perceived to lack credibility. The views of "black" commentators should be given as much exposure as possible - whether or not they are in favour or critical of the current situation in SA. Their voices should be given preference.
How could you have thought for even a split second that I was under a "professional duty" to go around to public schools warning kids about the consequences of federal crack charges?  You say you never called me a racist.  But you assume that I and the great majority of whites need to be reminded that black lives matter.  As I said, that in itself is a hateful, racist charge.  I tell you the truth:  That kind of race-huckstering is causing an increase in racial tension the likes of which I've rarely seen, and it's been going on for a couple of years now, fueled by false, ignorant race huckstering by Black Lives Matter.  When bad cops shoot without justification, they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  I know of no whites who disagree.  To hear you tell it, however, whites in general don;t care whether an innocent black man lives or dies.  What an outrageous thing to say.  If you really care about the future of race relations, get more honest in assessing them.
Spare me the pathetically transparent commercials.  "Israel" is a state so utterly 'race'/identity-obsessed it murders its own CHILDREN for being the wrong "color", that treats Arab and Ethiopian JEWS as 2nd-class citizens (don't ask about Muslims and Christians), and that dumped blood donated by the Falashas because it wasn't considered 'pure' enough to be used to treat Ashkenaziim, and that openly practices housing and educational discrimination--except when the TV cameras come round.  In that last it does somewhat resemble its hypocritical white-supremacist 'patron', the USA.  Further it is a non-theocratic yet self-proclaimed JEWISH state that in which full privileges are reserved for European--Ashkenazi--Jews; and concerning the Arabs it treads upon, it is no more and no less than an APARTHEID state so oppressive and tyrannical that Bishop Desmond Tutu and the late Nelson Mandela both said it was worse than the apartheid they themselves endured.  Khalas.
"Black men and women in Denver are twice as likely to die from gunshots — and five times as likely to be murdered by gunfire — as white men and women"  And why do you think that is?  Perhaps it's that they commit more of the murders and crime than whites proportionally?  Perhaps it is that their communities foster this type of behavior?  Perhaps they need to look inwards and fix the problems with their own communities and people, rather than blaming everything on the white man for once in their lives?
white trash punk big man with gun. ohhhhhh -so big - so tough - so insecure. what an insect. what a pathetic excuse for a human. so brave..... make america great again - let's dump this punk up in the state joint for a day or 2, "lost" in the system.   to be clear - i do not like, nor support mr. bryson.  wouldn't want to be misunderstood.
the solution is to investigate police involved in illegal activities like offering themselves as lynchmen,henchmen and assassins and punish them then dismantle the police and start on a new slate!the minister knows about the police terrorism against communities pertaining to school-bullying and drop-outs and gangsterisation as he grew-up amidst this threat and the fact he did not make it his priority to safeguard township residents instead constantly lamenting on white security and threatening blacks!this issue has now been hijacked by the third force to destroy coloured and black youths!the hordes who drop-out yearly where are they as they are not quing for jobs or roaming the streets!he,was battling financially after `94 so he came to the flatlands of joburg and the third force show generosity to him and his comrades in return they must shut-up about the attrocitioes and murders of black youths committed by security guards.we need nuremberg trials or martial law to deal with the po
Your white-washing of the details of the article is disturbing, Outsider77. The Trumps actively engaged in intimidation of witnesses (threats of physical harm) and used their superior status as rich, white people to attack the prosecutors, witnesses and anyone else who was a threat to their real estate empire. Being white and rich is like having a Teflon coating as we know from history. Trump is merely an updated version of his father. From what Trump has said in his speeches about non-whites, it's pretty obvious he's still having a hard time "figuring out what is proper behavior" and his daddy isn't calling the shots anymore so you can't blame him. It wouldn't matter if Trump were not personally racist because he race-baits and makes racist statements in order to achieve political ends.
Kind of like how people who defend conservative viewpoints and American culture are called "alt right" by CNN? Funny how Nationalism is racist, but nothing to be said about Antifa all over the country SCREAMING "MORE DEAD COPS, MORE WHITE GENOCIDE" or attacking the peaceful marchers on Friday with ACID AND FECES.
One more point: The anti-headscarf campaign and the muslim snitch line might have cost Harper another term, but Trump's anti-Mexican rants and his pledge to inventory and evict Muslims from his country have actually helped propel him to power.  So what are we left with?  Political policies in Canada that seek to disenfranchise or outright criminalize the poor and Muslims.... and a recently elected President who has pledged to do the same, but has thrown Latin Americans into the mix.  To someone on the "winning" side (wealthy whites) this may not LOOK like fascism, but once a party's political opposition are deprived of their rights, who's left to stop you from doing whatever you want?  I'm a stubborn fiscal conservative.  I hate seeing tax money get wasted on any service that isn't absolutely necessary... but I'm not an idiot, and I'm not about to stand by while an elected leader methodically eliminates the democratic rights of his opposition.  That's bad for everyone.
Okay, Trumpian nitwits, time to settle down and recognize a "dog whistle" when you hear it.  Everyone agrees that the welfare system needs to be continually improved and monitored, and laws need to be enforced.  BUT TRUMP IS NOT DOING THIS TO SAVE MONEY, and you know it.  It's done to get overweight, racist, white people (see photo) riled up with hate.  You seem to fall for the message quite easily.   The small number of immigrants or homeless people collecting benefits, pales in comparison to the money spent on defense or on welfare and social benefits going to US citizens.  Please use your brain (hard for you trumpians) to see how many Trump, red-state, white people have been on the public dole for years.  Also, your Fox-news, GOP facts about getting wealthy on welfare are ridiculous, as are you and the people who believe them.  Please keep posting, I love reading nonsense by trump-sycophants.  Thank you.
Some of the "poorly educated white folks" have noticed that as well!    It still doesn't explain where all those black and Hispanic voters who supported Obama went when Trump was elected, though.    I personally thought Hillary was that bad, but that still doesn't explain not voting at all by 80 plus percentages of those two minorities.
Yeah, It's only white men shooting people. Nothing going on in Chicago or Mountain View.
[Insert racist joke about coal black skin here.]  Oh, sorry, it's OK to make jokes about white people's skin color but not black people's or brown people's.  Because social justice.
Where are your numbers for all other races to give a fair analysis? I look at the mugshot page regularly and most of them are white men. I get you put the link but your post is to inflame White males 9000 ish on felony Probation, WOW
Bunch of cry babies.."Because I'm black"  is losing its steam.  Do your protesting at the door step of those you angry with (police and courts) or to make a great statement go to Chicago and support black mothers who lost their sons and daughters through black cannibalisim i.e. black killing blacks. And for the white girls who cried about doing splits, find another sport.
Ignore the racist rantings of John.  Hes been brainwashed into thinking 'white people' are the root of all evil.
How are they racist? Are they suggesting that whites become slaves of blacks? Need a citation. You're racist, right? Show me how I know.
I agree, Xavier.  If the 'pro-white' group had been allowed to simply have their demonstration against the removal of the Lee Statue, they would have said their speeches and then gone home. It "takes two to tango" or have a violent confrontation.  The pictures taken of the liberal Hate Group reveal ALL -the Red Fists: Communist Party/Workers Party (if that was not the intent, then KNOW What signs and symbols MEAN before you use them.)...The Expletives F#@* this, or that....the Hate just spilling over.  The death of Ms Heyer was terrible. She apparently was a good person who felt the need to support the downtrodden. I wonder if she protested about the Black Lives Matter Group?
The sickness is in YOU, self-loather. You concluded "murder" in the early days of the shooting based on conjecture. Oddly, you think it has something to do with white people when the officer is Latino. Can you tell us why? Yes, you're programmed with racial self-hatred. That much is glaringly obvious by your racist bilge here.  There is ZERO proof that cops "target" black people. That blacks get pulled over more is a correlation/causation fallacy. The New Jersey study showed it was because blacks were committing a higher rate of traffic infractions. Instead of rattling off narratives about "rich white men" and other pale bogeymen, learn to be critically-minded and stop blindly swallowing Critical Race Theory narratives. You're parroting absolute crap, and you should be ashamed of yourself.
Microagression and liberal white guilt.
There is no "alt-left" or "antifa." There are fascists (Nazis, KKK) and there are decent human beings. Every decent human being is opposed to fascism. You could just as easily call them "people." Nazis and white supremacists are subhuman.
Glad you feel that way......  Here is a video clip of Ted Nugent...who has been to the White House to visit Trump, as well as jammed out with that "Good Christian", Mike Huckabee, on Fox News.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q37iySV5KEE  To my knowledge, he has never apologized.  I'm not a fan of Kathy Griffin, and what she did was absolutely disgusting and tasteless, but at least she did apologize.
So far, only Ms. Demboski has targeted a neighbor and focused hate on them.  Statistically you'd be far better off with a single Muslim terrorist living near by. Yes, you can be confident she probably won't ever target you.  White crackers that show love aren't on her radar.  Supposedly this is a country where you can differ politically, but you guys don't seem to like that part of it.
Hodad, I'm an old white guy and I think the rail is a great idea.  Don't generalize on race cause you look stupid when you do  Pali Hwy saved a lot of drive time.  Went to Kailua many times over the old Pali road in the early 50s.  Otherwise your comment is good.
When we see gay people arguing for reverse conversion therapy to turn straight people gay, and black people working to systematically disenfranchise and deport white people, then we can talk.
The silliest column yet.  He cheers Rachel Maddow, who utterly embarrassed herself with her smug  TV explanations that it was impossible for Trump to win.  And, he has nothing to say about yesterday's terrorist attempted mass murder by a radicalized Muslim immigrant.  Nothing!  The claim that Trump's election "unleashed toxic venom" is simply not true.   The claim that millions of Americans (oh, and not just the white ones)  really haven't been gravely hurt by the loss of 70,000 factories shipped overseas?  What is he suggesting, that the rust belt voters were hallucinating their loss of  jobs?  When are these guys going to get over losing this election?  Why do they need to make stuff up about Muslim persecution, right after a Muslim immigrant tried to murder scores of young people?  You lost.  Get over it.  It's getting embarrassing.
What is wrong with you ?  My comment has absolutely nothing to do with race . It's about their anti-all Alaska policies .  Using your logic this group is against our Alaska delegation because they are white .  It sounds pretty stupid when you put it that way , right ?    If a conservative disagree's with a group they are called racists.by liberals.  That's sad , and worse than that---it's wrong.
White people do not believe they are superior ,it is dark people who believe that white people are superior . They may have a point because there is not one dark country in the world that  helps people as much as white people.
Utter NONSENSE.  Why isn't Trudeau forced to denounce the FLQ, the guy that murdered all those women engineers, the guy that murdered Muslims in the mosque??? They were WHITE CHRISTIAN MALES...   You are just a racist  with nothing else to show for yourself. SHAME ON YOU spreading such FILTH.
Sorry Einstein, but whites are killed at higher rates by other whites.  WHITE PRIDE!
My how fast this disappeared from the media.  Racist Black man shoots up white people in church is ho-hum.  But when the racist white man shot up black people in church it was all the media talked about for weeks.  How the hypocrisy continues.  No agendas here, nope.
Garden troll Jeff Sessions is a certified racist bigot. He said he thought the KKK were good people until he found out some of them smoked cannabis. His statement show support for white supremacist while ignoring the fact that cannabis is far safer than alcoholic beverages or tobacco products according to the Center for Disease Control.
It's ok to be condescending toward viewpoints born of ignorance.  White people are not all that great, and racist garbage spewed by hate groups is not based on good data.
Victoria are you aware of the fact that Bannon and Conway come out of the organizations noted by the Southern Poverty Law Center relative to white supremacy and alt white?  Trump selected these people and crafted a message that was racist, sexist, homophobic, anti Semitic, et al. (And these traits are part of the White Supremacy agenda) Trumps own father was a Klan member, and I recall an article where his Dad instructed Trump that he was very special and different... David Duke and the Klan are publicly celebrating Trumps victory...  If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck......
Let's see...No political experience and runs for the President of the U.S.  Beats one of the most qualified bunch of candidates the GOP ever put out.  Did it on a shoe string budget with the GOP establishment and biased media fighting him all the way.  Then he beats the well oiled and well funded Clinton machine.  He did this all with his head not screwed on right?  Losers will never understand the extent of his achievement and that's why they're losers.    I want to be a big fat racist, bigoted, sociopath, psychopath, narcissist, white supremacist, head unscrewed person like Trump!
.  "The Proud Boys""  --  How to describe these guys?  Doofusses? (Doofi?)  Embittered white males tortured by their loss of privilege and lashing out at their perceived enemies?  Refugees from the 1950s?  Obsolete at 25 years of age?  Whatever, they are classic fodder for the far right/white supremacist/alt right/nationalist fringe.  Crushed that simply being male turned out to be not enough to put them at the front of the gravy train, stuck in dead-end, no-hope careers while they watch women(!) and immigrants who were smart enough and hard-working enough to educate themselves for the 21st century cruise past them in the line, they dress themselves in their prejudices and expect to be taken seriously by anyone other than their similarly self-burdened brethren.  Let them march around with their little uniforms, their smaller ideology and their non-existent self-respect.  They are their own punishment for their own failures.  .
It's going to be fun watching the mean white men beat up on the poor little girl. Polis will crush everybody with all of his money!
Sorry, I was not calling you a hypocrite, i am saying the attitude in general is hypocritical.  words, actions or attitude can be hypocritical I agree the discrimination and racism and all that crap got to go. But I have a problem when I see people that say they are victimized against (in various ways), then turn around and do the same exact thing to someone else - and then attempt to justify their actions.  Or on a different angle, when the police are trying to uphold the laws, then the police themselves screw it up royally and break the very laws they are supposed to uphold.  Yes, shootings of unarmed people on the top of that list, and it has happened here in Hawaii numerous times.  I am curious though about your views on "the superior white man situation."  Just because someone complains, does not mean they think themselves superior, Make sure you are not "projecting" on them what you assume they think.  It can simply mean they have a different world perspective of things.
Wow you just couldn't help but squeeze in a reference to your so-called "white privilege," as if you were helped because of your skin colour. Jackass.
If Hillary's twin believes  it is only angry white men who will turn out to vote for Trump, he's totally clueless.
I think the point here is that if they racially profiled white people they'd find just as much shady stuff happening as if they racially profiled blacks.
he is not trying to get rid of Putin. He is trying to get rid of white race all together. One bomb from Russia will wipe out US and Canada, one bomb from US will wipe out East part of Russia and Europe. I am not sure who is the major beneficiary... ISIS or BLM ?
Obama without any question will go down in history as the president who turned back the clock once again to a divided nation not seen since the 1960's over racial tensions of black vs. white in America. Obama is a RACIST and anyone who says otherwise is either a damn liar or a bigoted racist ilk of Obama. People in my neighborhood are already planning on a block party to celebrate his last day in office!
Racism: an integral part of White America.   Period.
Kaepernick told us why he's kneeling:  “America refuses to address the pervasive evil of white cops killing black men, and I will not stand during a national anthem that honors the flag of such a country!”  The kneeling is based on a lie, as is the Black Lives Matter movement.  "Pervasive evil," my hinee.  Do racist police shootings occur?  Yes, indeed.  And they're prosecuted.  Even some cases that don;t have merit are prosecuted.
The most disgusting humanoid to ever occupy any government office.  The neo-nazi, stalinists are all proud.  Time to eradicate all White Supremacists anywhere in the nation.  Time for a Revolution.
At least the press now admits that Senator Tim Scott (R, South Carolina) exists.  When Senator Scott was elected in South Carolina, the Cradle of the Confederacy, by an electorate that was over 60% white, it didn't make the news in 2014 or 2016.  Senator Scott was the first Black senator elected from the former Confederacy since Reconstruction, but it didn't make the news.  Now they disparage Senator Scott by saying he's the only Republican Black senator.  The Democrats only have two Black Senators, Cory Booker (D, New Jersey), elected in 2013, and Kamala Harris (D, California), elected in 2016.  Senator Scott is a Tea Party Republican.  He won election twice on issues.  His race obviously didn't hold him back in what the press likes to call the racist Republican Party.  Democrats can't win without identity voting.  Democrats have poor governing results, but identity politics make that irrelevant.  That's why Democrats play the race card every chance they get.
What are you using as a stereotype? If that was a photo of a white male you would not have said what you said it, admit it.  You looked at the photo and saw that he was black and decided he was associated with a gang. I don't know who you are trying to fool but it's not me. Intolerant Dem? Seriously? Overwhelmingly Democrats are more inclusive in their platform and policies. What, are we not inclusive because we don't tolerate hate speech from conservatives, the alt-right nazis and white privileged men who are completely clueless? Yeah I'll own that then I guess.
You forgot to chastise the lefty WellWell who thought it would be "funny" if white people were beaten.  Double standards much?
Old white men ARE the swamp.
are you fcking kidding? What do you think republicans have been doing the last 50 years? Ooh,  right. It's not identity politics when white republicans do it.
Seeing as Dylan "The Psychotic" Roof is being portrayed by the MSM (and this idiotic poster) as "acting for all Whites", these Muslim attackers should be held as "acting for all Muslims". Nice to see that the Liberal censorship brigade is out in full force, today!
"White lapdogs?" Gosh Gerald, you as an Asian American sure have a tidy way of showing your own prejudice towards Caucasians. For someone who claims often of being a victim of disrespect, you sure are good at delivering it.
""""After a student launched an obscenity-laden tweet in support, engendering a complaint, the university decided to investigate, but withdrew when mounting anger seemed to preclude a mediated solution.""""  This tweet was racist indeed towards White people and the powers that be backed down.  Now if the tweet was made towards minorities we woulds still be hearing about it and no doubt someone would have lost their job.  Double standard out there.
"There were some very fine people on both sides of the truck attack... on BOTH sides."  Oh wait, he only does that when white supremacists murder.
I realize that people who are crazy enough to kill lots of other people seem to pick up some rationale for it. But you are intent on focusing on a small subset. "Gee, the -white- nutjobs never claim religion" except the anti-abortion murderers, and all the guys who killed people they thought were the "wrong" faith, like Jewish or Muslim. "Pledged to ISIS". ISIS isn't Islam, and pledging online isn't theology.  Others said it in this thread - white guys do mass murder and "gee, mabye they're not well" but somehow if someone's imbalance shows up as a twisting of a different faith, suddenly that person is a deep theologian, nothing crazy about them.  Right.  Read the Bible, here's Jesus: "19:27 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me. 19:28 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem."  Seems clear Jesus wants to kill non-Christians if you just read it, right? Explain otherwise.
The white folks were having a peaceful anti racist rally it was the liberal racists that caused the havoc, get a grip cory 😮
First day in office, eliminate water pollution safeguards in West Virginia coal country (sure helped the Koch Brothers), after that nominate buffoons for Dept of Education, Labor, State, etc. Bring in a white supremacist as the modern day Karl Rove, Create a budget that decimates everything except the military industrial complex (which is doing quite well already). I think 45 i doing very well in the decimation department, thank you very much. Luckily, we do still have three branches of government, sort of. The fourth branch is now Corporate America?
White mass murders can't be ignored or glossed over. As far as your FBI stats goes let's just be real the prison industry in America is huge so if you want to keep your jobs and keep creating jobs for your kids then you must keep a certain population in the dark and keep crime going. Those numbers make people like you feel like incarcerating and killing blacks is okay. But like I said you are the product of people who hung,  hunted, and hated blacks so why would you care. You just show up to hate.
I'm wondering if anyone calling this "racism" (or good grief "reverse racism") even read her post. Have none of you heard of Jonathan Swift? This was a blog post, not a policy proposal to her department, for crying out loud. Sure, the idea is extreme on its face, but she discusses some very real issues faced by underrepresented groups, and she challenges those in academia to think deeply about how they approach hiring and diversity. She challenges all of us who identify as progressive or liberal to think about whether we are genuinely making effort to create more equitable institutions in real, tangible ways: are you walking the walk or just talking the talk? Yet rather than taking an opportunity for a thoughtful discussion, we have a bunch of pearl-clutching over the fate of a bunch of cis white guys...who are going to be affected by this post how, exactly? C'mon, progressives - we need to better than knee-jerk reactions of the O'Reilly crowd when a black woman calls out inequality!
"Thus far, instead of legislating, he has focused on a succession of executive orders on immigration and deregulation,   written by Bannon's small West Wing team."  Bannon's team of neoNazi white supremacists.  Russia's fascist puppet government.
Just another violent murder of Black against White. Bello a victim of a hatecrime against Blacks? No, we all love them. It was  just another incompetent human  who was promoted to a job he had no brains to do properly - that's why he was fired!
Sorry Ms Maughan, as much as I respect you as a journalist, I contend that you got this one wrong. While the dire situation regarding economic transformation certainly requires urgent attention, the dire situation regarding some rather trashy journalism also needs addressing. And this was it - trashy journalism. And here I am not referring to the author, because we already know it was meant to be trash, but to Ms Pillay and Mr Hlongwane who performed none of the very basic journalistic requirements before rushing to publish this rubbish. And that alone requires a further question: Why? Was it because it supported their own views? If so, why should they be let off the hook and Joseph Goebbels not? For what was proposed for white males in this rattly little tale was not much different to introductory Nazi narratives on Jews, Gypsies, gays and other "unwanteds". We all know where that ended up. Do not defend the indefensible, rather, use your formidable journalistic skills appropriately.
What they want is to get rid of the white people. If it were anybody else it would be denounced as racist.
in all fairness, it should also be noted that the following perceptions:   "The black-man-as-criminal stereotype runs deep. The archetype is so prevalent that the majority of whites and African Americans agreed with the statement “blacks are aggressive or violent”    are perpetuated by what has become a very dominant part of black culture; glamorizing the thug life, gettin' paid- quick and easy, slangin' rocks, all the hoes you can handle, so on and so forth.  with having said that, perhaps the black community should also be focusing on the people who promote and peddle that horseshit.  because it's not helping their cause.
The Kennedys have always been rich white trash.  This is not surprising.
Looking forward to your article about how the angry white Democrats are wandering around with no sense of direction.
But if Trump called-out “white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups” he would be excluding them from the wonderful coming together/group hug he suggests we all have. And, of course, he'd lose their support; that would simply not do. Or: Trump is not really a racist hate-fear-monger, he just plays one on TV.
Aspirational self-identified gender? Griping about how two marginalized populations i.e. Native Hawaiians and transgender individuals tick the boxes sounds like you are an intolerant racist white male. You are a petty man.
Utter nonsense.  I deal with them in person, too, quite often.  Your own organizations acknowledge the demographics of their misguided, melanistically-challenged "movement", and we have example after example of open racial bigotry among them--Patricia Feral reviling Alaska natives, the racial slurs, death and arson threats you feral cat extremists hurled at the Monroe family in Savanna, GA because they asked their animal control dept. to trap and remove feral cats on their business property, and whale advocate John Hargrove setting a world record for how many "n-words" he could slur in one drunken rant.  And I won't even go into the anti-Asian bias of your movement.  Scratch an "animal rights activist" and a white supremacist pops out like pus from a boil.
Spoken like a true white supremacist
So why are we letting him in, then?  I mean, don't we have a border, too?  If the US can block muslim people at their border, we can block crazy white preachers at ours, no?
To dismiss the concerns of a white pupil on the basis of his race is overtly racist and the teacher should be penalized. An incident of this kind would not be tolerated if, say, a black student was discarded for being black.
I prefer he term "general welfare" to the common good. By that, I mean what he Founders meant, not some Wilsonian ideal.  I do believe taxes are needed to run gov't, but 60% plus is for entitlements, that can't be touch for some god awful reason. Welfare destroys the industry of the individual, enslaving him to keep his goals low in order to continue to receive "free" stuff. three and four generations after the Great Society are stuck in a vicious cycle who don't know anything more than a welfare check or EBT deposit. This has destroyed our inner city, mostly Black, but Hispanic and White as well. I don't see that as helping the common good.
Taught that white people are intrinsically bad?  Born with guilt?
Good point black rifls ...white is actually the combination o all colors together
Low-IQ Donald figured out one clever thing:  If you can have a very loyal 30-something percent base, you have a chance to compete in most any election.  All it took was a few Hillary careless errors and the Russian fake news campaign to get him into the White House.  The Republican senators and reps saw what happened, and now they're afraid to fight Trump and his base.  The proof is in the few who are retiring (McCain, Flake, Collins, etc.); having nothing to lose, they ALL say what an idiot he is.  But now that he's done little to help America, especially the undereducated whites who voted him in, that 30-something percent will not be enough next time--if there is a next time.
Contrary to liberal lies, kids are learning that being white is one of the worst things you can be, being a white male is a double whammy.  Liberals love to pit one group against another and spread their hate that way Unarmed minorities?   Is that why some of the most violent areas in the country are where minorities congregate?  I know from past posts that you are black and proud. From this post and others that you are pro-hate.   Why should it be any more racist for me to be white and proud? Anti-hate, white, proud, and unapologetic.
One side was Nazi flag-waving, Swastika-carrying, xenophobic thugs intimidating a college campus and city with unabashed hatred toward jews, gays, and anyone who is not white, male, straight, Christian and gun-toting.  The other side was objecting to this vile intrusion. If that's alt-Left, sign me the f*** up.
Ernie, whites commit 60% of the violent crimes in the US (DOJ stats 2015). However, a young black male is 20 times more likely to be killed by the police. Why?
The cry of racism doesn't wash anymore except among the left, who cry racism at every turn.  It doesn't matter to Trump what color the kneeler is.  He didn't say only the black kneelers should be fired.    The resentment and disdain, hatred and anger is in the minds of those who kneel.  They hate America because they see us as a fundamentally white supremacist country.   What a disdain-worthy crock.
Shaun King's a white boy trying to outblack blacks. That's what this is about. Has naught to do with Kolin Caepernick.
Your list is a bit ridiculous -  Russia did hack the DNC - both the FBI & the CIA say so. The CIA says it was done to help Trump win the election, the FBI won't go that far. The globe has never said all white people are racists, just that some are. There's racists in every ethnic group. Did the globe really say for certain that Iraq had wmd's? Pizzagate is definitely fake. Do you really believe that nonsense???? The white helmets are doing good work. Trump definitely called Mexicans rapists. The globe said stupidly that the cons should be elected but their leader should resign. They didn't say you could elect the party without their leader becoming pm. Your points range from ridiculous to manipulative but are mostly stupid.
Ok, you say Fox news and Breitbat don't tell the truth. So,I went back and watch Trumps press conference. Here were is exact words: The KKK, white supremacist and the Neo nazis are repungnant and violence has no place in this country. Yet, the left and the braindead media, CNN, ABC MSNBC, all lied and said Trump likes the KKK. So, there you go, just caught you and every news media except Fox lying thru your teeth like only scumbags can do.
Thanks for your warm cares and wishes everyone!! I really like how you turned my being shot into a fucking nit pick contest have you no compassion anymore ? That's the real problem nowadays!!! Sincerely the guy that was shot on Fairbanks street by a black guy and a white guy i. A black BMW
The players can kneel, as is their right. We, the fans, can criticize the players for kneeling. The players don't like being criticized, so they and the left claim it must be racism, even though white players would also be criticized. So the racial aspect is pure baloney. The players say they are not disrespecting the flag or the anthem, yet their actions SHOW everyone that is exactly what they are doing. If I go out on the field and start burning a flag but say I'm not disresrespecting it, is anyone going to believe me? Nope. Kaepernick said he would not honor the flag of a country that oppresses minorities and he started the whole thing. So this whole "we are not disrespecting the flag" is crap. Do the players really think what they are doing is going to solve all the racial problems of this country? That's just crazy and not what I watch the games for. I am so close to turning the games off and I love me some NFL. This is a loser for the players
I find there's a certain dark comedy in that subset of sorry white males* who hold libertarian and/or 'survival of the fittest' beliefs while simultaneously angrily blaming their lack of success on those nasty females, queers, colored folk.  * not necessarily referring to you, BrfY. I'm much too polite to do that.
You have failed at your attempt to blame the "white nan" .. when a black officer shoots a white man... No one complains. A white officer shoots a thug... People go nuts.
No doubt the question was framed to make you out to be a masochistic, myopic, homophobic, misogynistic white bigoted racist if you said no.
Barry said nothing much during the Ferguson riots or when a mob of blacks dragged a white man out of his car to beat him.   Said nothing about the black gang that killed a white couple just because, made the girl drink bleach and gang rapped her as well as lit her on fire.  The press glossed over that one, why? Because they are anti white
What a load of CRAP! Stop making excuses for the Church. The decline in numbers is due the liberal agenda spreading its venom into the Catholic doctrine with "social justice" and "global warming" nonsense. Where is the message about our Savior? The Church is losing touch with its congregation and if it wasn't for the rich Catholics funding all the Catholic projects, the Church would have been washed up years ago. They need immigrants because whites are not reproducing at the same rate as non whites! Ouch!   Why should the Church care where a person is from? Isn't Jesus the same in Latin America as in the USA? Why is this an issue with the Catholic Church? If it is not economics, than the DACA kids should be fine in their home country if they find a church where they can practice their religion. They don't need to come to the US to express their faith, unless the Church is helping those illegal immigrants obtain Federal assistance that can be used as contributions to the Church. Hmmm?
I agree.  Trump is most definitely a worthless stain on America. He's most definitely a sick, fascist, white supremacist traitor.
Friggin Baptists.  Can't stand them.  I took my wife to the Baptist Church on 5th Ave in Fairbanks.  The preacher looked right at me and my wife and preached his whole sermon on marrying your own kind.  I am white and my wife is Athabascan.  I wanted to get up and hit the SOB.
I see lots of triggered angry old white men posting in the comments today.
The 2017 Congressional Black Caucus is racist with a capital R, barring whites and Republicans from joining the club.  Democrats have been dripping with racism for over 150 years.  "All past and present members of the caucus have been African-American. In 2006, while running for Congress in a Tennessee district which is 60% black, white candidate Steve Cohen pledged to apply for membership in order to represent his constituents. However, after his election, his application was refused.[13] Although the bylaws of the caucus do not make race a prerequisite for membership, former and current members of the caucus agreed that the group should remain "exclusively black"."  [ouch]- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus  So,  where is the all Republican "Congressional White Caucus"?
If this is correct it would not surprise me in the least. Just consider all the lobbyists alone. All white, clueless, narcissistic, Millennials who worshiped our former closet-Muslim, racist, pervert, president Obama. These idiots do not have a clue, nor care about the rest of hard working Americans.
Isn't it such a great feeling when you find a twisted way to justify your hatred of everyone that doesn't have white skin and a penis?
As usual Shannyn Moore puts out her annual Easter/Thanksgiving /Christmas rant about the Bible/White"Christian" Republican politicians... What a hateful, self-righteous, unimportant column.
Well, Don, as someone once posted in this thread: "Without credible sources, your piece is just one guilty white man’s opinion."
Must be real proud of your alt-white buddies perpetrating hate crimes against minorities. Thank your PGPGPOTUS deflect worshipers.
There's a little race for governor in Virginia, and human-weasel manimal Ed Gillespie is going full metal racist in his ads.     Dems always think that "the media" is somehow the preventive measure for this stuff, that when Republicans "go there" the wise old white men of the editorial pages will write sternly worded editorials denouncing them and it will backfire.  It doesn't work that way. Those old white men of the editorial pages are often pretty racist themselves, even if they are offended by "the tone." More than that, they just don't have the power and influence they once did.  Working the refs has value, but unlike baseball, there are no rules to this game.  We all have to step up and heap scorn on the racists, our scorn is all they deserve.
Surprised blacks are even part of SBC as there YUGE numbers of black Baptist church not affiliated. Probably most white SBC would prefer blacks leave altogether. White persons need to press for change.  Should not be incumbent upon black persons who often lack any power and historically are the victims of institutional racism. But whites continue to balk at providing leadership for change. Change will come from outside the churches. As MLK said, paraphrase, churches should be headlight, not tail lights.
David Duke himself voted for trump, along with all the KKK, American NAZI Party, and most white Southerners. Trump is the only presidential candidate endorsed by the KKK who did NOT turn down the endorsement.  The Congressional Republican Caucus is open ONLY to Republicans, therefore open to only three three black Congressmen. The other 45 black Congress men and women aren't alowed entry. Those are FACTS, not your racist Rush Limbaugh/Sean Hannity crazy babbling and lies. Your entire political perspective rests on bigotry and lies. Now your head is about to explode, and you'll start talking nonsense in sub-civil language. It's back on mute for you, little snowflake. Or is that, just, flake?  Uh-Oh, too late! Incoming! But I voted it "not civil", and it's so nasty, in a schoolyard taunt sort of way, that it likely will never be published.
Yup, as was the "counterprotester [who] apparently deployed a chemical spray". Better response to the white supremacists would be to ignore them. If no counter protesters showed up the entire event would be forgotten by now and the first set of idiots would begin to fade into obscurity.
especially white supremacists.
Bannon recently called Neo-Nazis and white supremacists "clowns" ............ Trump would have taken that as a personal insult.
White supremacists hated the black guy, and it was the black guy's fault.  I guess if the uppity negro had minded his place you and your ilk would have been quite a bit happier, right?
Honestly.  Yes, I know the Republicans who made comments about Blacks and Latinos.  I took exception to their comments not because I personally know of whom they spoke but because of the way it was stated.  "Well, you know how N****** are" or 'Honestly, Mexicans are so lazy.  She always leaves my house not quite clean." That is offensive speech to me.  And I think this discussion is just a smoke screen to detract from the real issue.  It is wrong for any race to make assumptions about another race based on too little information.  That is not the same as White Nationalism, and don't try to pretend it is.
Thanks SANTEEIAN, discrimination and racism does NOT only come from the White community.  It crosses all racial lines. They are teaching in schools now that the only REAL racists can only be White people. Just silly.
Whoops...meant to reply to Bennice's post.  I don't get it.  I'm sure other races do it, but it baffles me that whites want to blame other races for some intangible issue.  Blame the blacks, blame the Chinese, blame the Mexicans. Uh, what are they really taking from us whites personally?  Nothing substantial I can put a finger on.  Certainly nothing from me personally that makes a hoot of difference in my life.  I've got it good.  I could have it better, but the only one to blame for that is me.
The sad part of is the Left is thrilled to have face to face confrontations with White Supremecists and Neo-nazi's and happy to incite the violence.  Not question whether the White Supremecists and Neo-Nazi's are scum and thugs - they are - period.    Just saying the left now is using them to paint all conservatives and all opponents as racists. This demonization of regular conservatives both de-legitimizes them as having policy alternatives which may be practical in solving issues and also scapegoats them so they should not have freedom of speech and open to hate attacks.  We now need to be clear. Neo nazis are scum. But doesnt mean Black Lives Matter or similar folks are right and not dangerous.
The only racism I saw during the election was Nenshi  appealing directly to east-Indian voters while playing the race card.  What  would Mason and Nenshi say if Smith would have appealed directly to white voters and played the race card.  The hypocrisy and double standards of people like Nenshi and Mason are disgusting.  They are the type of people who are doing their best to create racism in this country.
My, my, my, Paulie,  How quickly we forget what you wrote about Trump during the GOP primary season. Talk about galling hypocrisy:  "Donald John Trump, a billionaire bigmouth, a carny barker with delusions of grandeur, a narcissist whose campaign success is fueled by the fury seething in this country. In a nation of 330 million souls, that Trump could be considered seriously for president, much less nominated by a major party, could be a sign of the End Times. No, really."  "His supporters, like Sarah Palin's, are disinterested in facts. Their minds are made up."  "Trump, with his runaway yap and startlingly tempestuous idiocy…"  "During a campaign speech in a very white Michigan suburb, Trump fished for African-American votes by asking, "What the hell do you have to lose?" We as a nation are about to find out."
Using the term white privilege simply proves that you are a racist.
I see you have redefined racist to be anyone that points out inequality based on race. BTW, my success is do to me being more intelligent and better educated than most of the white racists that tried to abuse me. You seem very insecure for a member of a superior race. What is holding you down?
From the stats, one out five people shot by police, were black people. That is well within the population ratio. That mean other four were not black but probably whites, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Natives. How many times do we have to read about black person being shot by police? You read it a lot because that is part of the media's agenda. You don't read much about white guy or Asian guy or Hispanic guy being shot by police because it simply not in their interest to report it. Media, like so many elements of our society, got their own political agenda.  Was Castile's killing a racist one?? Would it help if he was white instead of black? Well, considering that the officer who shot him is a Latino, maybe that governor should have said that if Castile was Latino.....then he would have been better off. But in this case, I think that Latino officer just panic and for that, he deserves whatever punishment heading his way.
Jackie:  actually you should read the coverage of the case and the police report on the incident. Your "reading" is really quite mistaken.  You're spinning this to be a racist motivated incident.  You state "white chick gets drunk, has consensual sex with black kids"  Two issues here: a) the young woman involved was not a "white chick".  She was AfricanAmerican. b) ", has consensual sex with black kids".  This, of course, is the central issue of the incident.  The young woman claims the sex was NOT consensual...the young men claim it WAS consensual.  .......a classic "she said, he said" incident.  ADGardner determined the woman would not be a credible witness and, therefore, decided to not prosecute the case.  The coach, the AD department, and then the University administration each instituted disciplinary actions based on, first, athletic code of behavior, and, then, the University disciplinary code.  All the info is readily available.  Read it and educate yourself.  Gary Crum
I guess we'll see that when  we see white males protesting when one of their own rapes a woman or child, shoots up a theatre, church, school, mosque, etc. You know? Those things which happen DAILY?  I mean, it's just right, right?
hoods aren't the only places riots are found. did u forget white people riot over silly things such as sports?
republicans own these people. They brought them in in force when Reagan campaigned on getting rid of the so called welfare queen. Most every white person knew what that meant. Blacks where all are problems begins. Hating gays and Mexicans didn't come till late.   Every person that pushed and repeated the birther movement is no different than the white racist we saw last weekend. Only they aren't afraid to show it. Others hide it and say not me, but...
True enough.  Alas, for many conservatives the world can only be black or white, and Mr. Trump is Dubya on steroids.  Not only are you "against me" if you're not "for me," you're a loser and stupid and (choose your Trump invective here).  Hyperbole should no longer be tempered:  Mr. Trump is a "leader" in the same vein as Hitler and Mussolini.  Consistently deprecating (and increasingly openly violent toward) to those who not only disagree with him, but are doing their jobs (or not) as journalists.  Not simply a cartoonish narcissistic blowhard, but a rallying point for the ignorant, angry and uninformed.  There will be violence, and worse, coming from the Trump camp, I fear.  The Republican party created this monster in 50 years since Nixon (both their racist, misogynist, homophobic "core" and the individual now leading them), and when you sleep with dogs, you get fleas.  They have no idea where to scratch, which is both gratifyingly hilarious and frightening.
You are wrong. Hating white men (and women) is a sign of social justice. Please apologize for being a racist denying the right of the non-white to hate you
I'm a Democrat and this may be the most rambling, incoherent, idiotic comment I have ever read on this message board. We protect airports to prevent terrorists from taking planes with hundreds of innocent people down. Remember 9/11? It isn't because of some irrational fear "old white guys" harbor.  So you are blaming  "old white guys" for the fact that a gay nightclub was not protected by TSA employees? Deborah, it must be nice to live in your little black and white bubble world where if it just wasn't for "old white men" the world would be a peaceful, and equitable place.   Get over George Bush. Find a new boogey man to blame your paranoid fantasies on. And sorry you married (or had a relationship) with a controlling man. That was your mistake, so don't paint all men with brush of the jerk you married.
' The white supremacists, the KKK, the skinheads and the nazis aren't going to be cleaned up and normalized.  Fascist wannabe's consisting of sick emotionally arrested play actors. . They're a small minority, an extremist fringe and that's all they'll ever be.  Scorn is their due.    .
Apparently Udell(?) is a black guy, and there's this senile old white fart Carol Portugal who thinks her grasp of the black experience is more authentic than his. You can't make this stuff up.
I am still amazed that people actually voted for Trump. I thought better of the right. But what kind of a wanker do you have to be; how delusional; what kind of messed-up self image do you have to have in order to see yourself in Trump? Is being like Trump your aspiration? Ugh. And what kind of nihilistic idiot do you have to be to vote for a man who has put so many unfit people in charge of blindly destroying so many important departments and institutions in our nation? Thanks to Trump, we now have an unbelievably ignorant, old, white male racist elitist who is the top law enforcement officer in the nation: Sessions. He is determined to turn the clock back to a time when male white power was supreme and anyone who wasn't part of that elite group was required to bow to it. I'm proud to say I have absolutely nothing in common with Trump supporters. Nothing, nada, zilch. I really don't know how they can live with themselves.
calling people racist, white supremacist and other derogatory names is dangerous and not true !  There is no proof for any of this and it seems the Liberals are very sore losers. If you think the president is a racist you need help !  This country is headed in the wrong direction and I would put a lot of the blame on the liberals trying to make this a PC world when people think thier feelings are more important then facts!
Radical white terrorist. Supported by and encouraged by the words and actions of this pathetic and embarrassing sham of an Administration. Look the subhuman scum up for the rest of his life and continue fighting these fragile white neo-nazis at every turn.
What an idiotic contention.  It wasn't the party of Lincoln that acted as you claim. The KKK was assisted in it's creation with the support of Democratic victories in Southern state governments after the Civil War, in opposition to the Republicans Party's platform during and after the war.  The Dems pretty much controlled all Southern state governments from the 1870s for the better part of a century, during which in the early part of the 20th century the ranks of the KKK were in the millions.  All big cities in the U.S. have been under Democratic control for decades; how well has that gone for the non-Whites who live there, especially in the gang-controlled massive (ware)housing projects?  Just seeing how Dems attack and slander any Black Republicans tells us all we need to know about how they really feel.  Phony compassion.
These Antifa hooligans are worse than nazis. I even did an interview with two of these  thugs in Chicago. They are violent terrorists  and revolutionaries who want to destroy America. http://mainestategop.blogspot.com/2016/09/coffee-with-communists.html They are pure evil.  GOALS OF ANTIFA 1. Demise of The United States sovereignty 2. Demise of capitalism 3. Demise of the bill of rights and the US constitution 4. The destruction of all whites through violence, forced sterilization or interacial marriage 5. the abolitiion of banks property rights 6. One world government 7. Demise of morals, religion, Christianity in particular and human freedoms 8. Complete domination by the state of personal life, economics and education 9. Abortion, homosexuality an absolute right on demand  Just to name a few
Peter, they were shocked about what I thought of my experience there. They never thought they were acting like bigots. One of them even told me he was married to a Latina, like that inoculated him from being a bigot. Slave owners made a profit center out raping their black slaves. We know most white men are willing to have sex with just about anybody and anything. I earned every penny of my Tier 1 PERS retirement, working with these people.
No, when white men act like terrorists, they're called mentally disabled. But they do seem to have a brand of christianity in common. Your last sentence though is pretty funny and ironic.
question arises - why aren't other minority groups marching also - black, Hispanics, muslims, gays, American Indians, native Hawaiian, Asians, etc.  dumpy is going to make it miserable for all of these groups.  he only favors white Europeans and rich people.
we need to stop all the white folks from Outside we come to Alaska and keep having 'anchor Babies' to keep getting more Free PFD money, Limit the amount that anchor baby families can get to 4 PFDs no matter how many anchor babies they make
The Trump movement is a classic example of mob rule, the mob here a bunch of angry white people, and an example of what our founding fathers were most afraid of, pure emotion over rational and polite policy and discourse.
"If they want to make change, the do something positive. Go into the cities and find out why most of the families are single parent, find out how to stop the gangs, improve schools and school attendance. Do something about the black on black killings."  How do you know black leaders aren't doing these things? As Jon Stewart put it (I'm paraphrasing), Just because you're unaware of something doesn't mean it's not happening, just the way that when it snows in your town that doesn't mean the earth isn't getting warmer.  But in a larger sense, why do you feel it is incumbent on black people to correct behavior of other black people? When a white person does stupid things, we don't blame all whites. And before anyone gets outraged at me bringing up race, I would point out that your comment says "Go into the cities..." (we all know what THAT means). Please examine your own biases before telling others what they should and shouldn't do.
Of course.  Everyone knows that all Republican voters and all Republican politicians are white supremacists and racists.  Do you ever read what you write and not even realize how ignorant you sound?
Trump is a liar. He conned his voters. He only cares about himself. He cares about them less than he cares about his 1st wife. They deserve what they get from him. He is 70 years old and he is not going to change for them. What has he ever done for someone other than himself? Any gifts he has given were just the price of access to the people he thought could help him make money. He told us that. The only thing he has in common with his voters is their whiteness. Trump voters most valuable assets are their white skins. They care more about being white than being Americans. Hopefully, they will learn from the next 4 years of suffering they will experience.
No I am not in favour of that but unfortunately and tragically numerous women in Canada and the US are gang raped by white Christian men but we are not about to make sweeping generalizations about all white Christian men bases on the terrible behaviour of a few.
This movie could not be more timely.  With the resurgence off white nationalism in the Trump era, the killing of non-whites by police is sure to increase.
She's so right! If it wasn't for white privilege, I would have never been able to pay for university by working night shifts at minimum wage.
Democrats and liberal medea are the true racists.  They invent it where there is none for ratings, and personal gain.  They are the party of divide and conquer.  Ever notice how most of the democrats, liberal media, antifa, etc screaming racism are white??  Think about it.  Just let that simmer for awhile.  Democratic party = racism
Easily proven false.  US authorities have for months warned that ALOT more people in the US die every year from white supremecists than Muslim terrorists.  And guess what the tactics are becoming the same.  All of it is wrong.  We must denounce all of it.  Neither is better or worse, if you focus on one and not the other you're soft on terror and don't truly believe what you claim.
“Our attacks will continue until a true sharia system is enforced in Pakistan,” the spokesman said, referring to Islamic law.  You see, Muslims are more affected (more killed) by the global Islamist movement than anyone else.  So-called Islamophobia slur doesn't make sense when all a person is doing is pointing out the dangers of, and wanting to do something about, Islamic fundamentalism and Islamism.  Unfortunately, the regressive-left shout-down and accuse anyone who criticizes anything to do with Islam or Islamism as a racist, bigot, xenophobic, Islamophobic white-supremacist Nazi.
At least you admit that there was a Republic of Hawaii.  Your other friends in the sovereignty fringe are still in denial, "3D". But, I do thinks that you have a "white" problem.  Maybe a circle encounter group will help you with you racism. I wish you luck.
It sounds more like you are projecting your biases and ideology onto others. Clearly, your post showed a lack of understanding American culture these days. Your assertion is not a fact at all. For some silly reason, we idolize dullards like the Kardashians who are rich white women you think we vilify.
The "Aboriginal" increase is due to whites pretending to be Indians to share in the goodies.
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI! - White male conciousness is rising.
Trump was elected by white racists and he knows it. He is just playing to the GOP base of racists and bigots. He and they know that he would not be president without the GOP white racist base.
wonder what that has to do with anything?  If I recall, the white Quebecker showed up at a mosque to kill Muslims.
I think what Jeremy Christian did was pretty atrocious.  He was a white supremacist.
Black guns cause most of the murders. To be safe buy white guns instead and put little rainbow, butterfly, and Jesus saves stickers on it. If you're a guy you might be labeled as gay because of your gun but at least you could protect yourself from a hate crime.
so, as a minority do you blame the White Man your not a millionaire by now? or as a millionaire in this Free World do you believe you'd be better off in another Country? Let's see the Black fb player play fb in Europe and rake in the millions! C if I care, they can take their wares out of the US for all I care. College fb, Baby! The USA ain't the Heavenly Heaven, we all humans with shortcomings. Deal with it if you got the millions! Run for an elected office and Change the Laws but i'll say you'll never change all the peoples minds. We're all humans, racism will always be here as long as humans roam Earth. Even if we had Aliens from Mars attack Earth we humans would still have racism on Earth and YOU can take that to the bank!
NEWSFLASH: Not everyone is a fan of white male supremacy.  Now, don't you have a shelf to put up or gutters to clean?
You have to love the idiotic comments by liberals about bigots and race,  the majority of crime in Alaska is perpetrated by blacks, indigenous or other than white,   so please,  by stating the obvious about a crime makes it bigotry.
Lee wrote that slavery was evil but the best thing for the blacks, and that whites had to bear the moral burden of it for their sake.  That's some pretty tortured logic; forgive the pun.
Hello Nemo,  1. Um, hello? The fact that Chicago had more murders in the year that happened 25 years ago, in the early 1990s, that horrific rate for that year back then does not make the rate in Chicago today any less horrific.  2. Maybe you missed the actual point I made, the comparison I made with the CBC's reporting? Um hello, white Canadians commit very few, um, mass murders using guns, indeed more than 99.99 percent of  white Canadians do not commit mass murders using guns, and yet in spite of that rarity, editors are A-okay with the CBC running an article titled: "Simple truth is Canada's mass shooters are usually white and Canadian-born". Got it? See the hypocrisy? They are saying it is fine and acceptable to collect and publicize data that allows finger-pointing at white Canadian-born killers, but to collect data for reporting on illegal immigrant killers, well that is somehow a disgraceful outrage.
Trump's voters are a scary bunch.  Not all are this poorly\ educated but many are.  This pathetic white man is really not at all welcomed by the rich.  He is scum under their feet.  Sad that he thought he belonged to the same country that trump belongs to.  The election saw millions duped by a skilled entertainer serving the rich.
I don't think the folks at ADN care nor do they even know what racism is because they're all white folks. If you have not been the object of hate and ignorant comments, or have been physically assaulted like I have (at age 65 by two racist rednecks) here in Anchorage because of your race, you can't feel anything about it. Or voice an opinion that's worthy of repeating. So they remain silent.
White Imperialism is protected by the US Military/ Prison System for Profit. #DepletedUranium. White Power owns the Global Economy & is responsible for the Genocide of Thousands of Species, Deforestation, Pollution, etc. White Power controls ALL MAJOR TV Stations, Newspapers, Radio Stations, & had a monopoly on Normalized Christianity a White Power Religion. Hitler was a copy of George Washington at his worst/best
There are many, many, studies which prove blacks commit a much greater portion of crimes than whites relative to their population!   All large cities with large black populations have high crime rates. We should stop pretending and tell the truth about black crime and black on white crime. Political Corrrectness invented by Democrats is a way of ignoring the truth.
The shooter said he wanted to kill white cops in response to recent incidents.  ALL lives matter
I feel like if I’m proud of my white heritage I will be seen as racist. There is a double standard. You can have Miss Hmong, but if you have Miss Europe that is a problem. You can have a scholarship program for blacks, but you wouldn’t be able to have one for just whites. I’m not prejudiced I’m just tired of being politically correct. I’m proud of my heritage and I won’t apologize for being white.

You probably don't consider yourself a bigot and I hope you aren't one, yet your post perfectly exemplifies how bigots think. They see some characteristic they think is true of some members of a group, and then make blanket statements about those groups, e.g. "white folks" or "black folks" or "transgender people." Nobody thinks they are a bigot, they just don't much care for ____ people because of ____.  Aside from the hateful nature of such characterizations, the biggest problem with this approach is that it perpetuates the racial and cultural divide and the profiling you claim to abhor. Please be part of the solution, and not part of the problem.
Mnuchin, you worthless, elitist, right wing hypocrite, why don't you take your OWN advice and stop flying with your Barbie trophy wife on the taxpayer's money?  I swear, Republicans are biggest gated white community elitists and hypocrites that Russian rubles can buy.
This article fails I so many ways.   "Right" is not always/only "White". (Btw, half of "White" are "Left".)  If the "Alt"-Right (whatever THAT is supposed to be) is a white-based, hate-based fringe, then it cannot have moved center stage - that would by definition make it no longer "alt" and no longer periphery nor fringe.  I laugh every time someone tries to make "Alt-right" a term or phrase. They remind me of that Gretchen character in "Mean Girls" movie who kept saying "fetch", "that's soooo fetch", I an effort to make "fetch" a hip word-phrase. Stop with the "Alt-" ness already... "Alt" is about as stupid as everyone now calling "drones" "drones". DRONES ARE REMOTE CONTROL AIRCRAFT! We've had R/C aircraft for decades, for GENERATIONS but now that the common dork (as opposed to a hobbyist dork) can readily buy one, and now that they are more electronically capable, we have to call them "drones" now?! Same for "Alt"-right. Ain't nothing Alt about it.
But of course White Nazi's never ram cars into pedestrians- Right?
White male Anti-Globalists peacefully marching = Bad. Violent masked Globalist crypto-fascists throwing bricks = Good. Shut up slaves, MSM
The distinction is that the neo-Nazis, kkk, and white supremacists don't like people because of the color of their skin.  The Antifa does not like the neo-Nazis, and white supremacists because of the content of their character.  Do you not see that?
"hey look, a white guy committed some horrendous crimes.  man, that guy is so white.  just look at how white that guy is.  sittin' there, bein' all white, thinkin' about how white he is.  stupid white guy."  that work for ya?  go race-bait elsewhere.
On that election cycle thing, you forgot to include the "sharp major difference" of little don and mindset of most rational American's. IMO, the repubbies are the party of angry, old, white folks who cover their meals with ketchup and the demos who keep ketchup consumption low with salsa and well brewed beer. It's amazing! It's yuuuuge!
Where all the deport people at. This guy isn't hispanic or Muslim. Most likely a white Christian male and its crickets in here but if you listen to Trump band of can't think for themselves morons you would think crime is only done by Hispanic and Muslim people. This guy stole a lot of money. Still 2 million he has not paid back. So many wanted the guy who justbgot pardoned for the video store robbery to be in jail for life but this guy stole alot more dinero. They are such hippocrits
Renzette, Southey, McLaren et. al must have some kind of Cards Against Humanity rip off game called Cards Against the Patriarchy. The constant haranguing against men backed up with unproven stats, discredited theories, cherry picked examples and the barely self contained rage of their own person grievances against anything male, white and not cuckolded to feminism. A group that will not be content until every white male in N. America is emasculated.
What was that racist chant that I heard at the so-called hate free march.  Yes,  I believe it was BLACK lives matter.   Not ALL lives matter, not Arab lives matter, not muslim lives matter,   not transgender or homosexual lives matter.  Just BLACK lives matter.  There is also offense taken if you insist on ALL lives matter.   Tell me again about racism.   Blacks can exclude whites or any other group from their gatherings, but let whites try to exclude blacks from a gathering and cries of racism  ring out from coast to coast.  Tell me again about racism.  Blacks can riot and yell racist chants, but nary a word is said.  Let all blacks be nominated for an award and it is cheered as diversity, let the same group nominate all whites and it is racist.   Now I have no problem with all black gatherings or all black nominations as long as it goes both ways.
A soldier boasting about his battles is a common and tolerated thing. Sajjan risked his life many times for you. There are too many low white racists in Canada. This is a brave soldier who gave a somewhat exaggerated account of his role in one battle. Big deal. Ordinarily, it would be shrugged off with a wink and an amused grin. But the man is brown and so all the white skunks have leapt on him.
Why, because he was a white guy running for the office vacated by a Black guy?  Get over it.
So says the next white psycho creep..
I have not tried to attend many.   Why does it have to be me personally?  Even one person being denied attendance at a meeting because of the color of their skin is one too many.   Why should we be forced to celebrate "black history" month without a corresponding "white history" month?
As I've said many times on this forum, nothing going on in our world today is comparable to the Nazis.  Not white supremacists and certainly not gays.  I don't believe some conservative groups compare gays to Nazis and I know for sure this conservative doesn't.    Regardless, there is no reason for any group to compare any other group around today because Nazism was the worst there ever was.
Sure thing sir, I will tell that to my Eskimo wife and mixed son. I bet that pisses you off too, you old racist. I live with natives and work with natives every day and its my goal to achieve cooperation in the best way possible with the PEOPLE I work with. You can't accept that a white person is capable of doing this because your so bitter and blinded by your past. Have a nice life, if that's possible when your mind is so polluted.
4 out 5 white people fear Muslims....... Source: Barneys neighborhood poll of 4 out of 5 white people who self identified as non black or brown. Poll is accurate normally 19 times out 20 but occasionally not.  Kinda like what happened in London today........
I have never read Garrison"s column and I won't do it again.  He needs to get to Portland for some riots and work out the emotions of a liberal loser. Eight years of stupid got you here.  Don't blame others. I'm white, educated and voted.  60,000,000 people aren't all uneducated, but all very tired and worried.
I Agree Totally on his "Many side" real simple White Supremacist Thugs -> BLM Thugs -> Antifa Thugs...
All these protests stem from Kaepernick's stand against police brutality, white police officers against black. Google a list of fallen police officers, google how many have died at the hands of others, to include black assailants. Tell me there isn't a great disparity between the two lists, one more honorable than the other. Our own Celena Hollis of the DPD, a black female police officer of Denver was gunned down by a black assailant. Is she, a fellow community member on any of these football players lists of protest. She was in a park giving security to everyone, race exclusive and was shot at for no other reason that she was a cop. Keep this in mind when you see a player kneel, our police deserve it.
Oh Randy, Don't you know that ONLY White people can be Racists?  ; )
Another Horrible G&M article based on Toronto, Sexism, Feminism and the evil white male . If you added some anti-trump rhetoric you would of had a Globe and Mail daily all in one article.
If white people had their own country most whites would move there to escape this forced genocide by corrupt globalists and the 3rd world immigrants they dump in here like an overflowing toilet.
send all the useless mouths back home, put women back to work raising high IQ white children stop the jews from robbing us and problem solved
A typical demented leftist. Good grief. Donald Trump, a businessman from New York City, who has employed thousands - whites, blacks, Hispanics - will win the election because millions of Americans are fed up with people like Ann, an arrogant leftist kook - most likely on PERS - trying to link Trump with Adolph Hitler. What is wrong with you?
So, this article is about a guy who converts to a religion within minutes of being exposed to it. He never read the books, he never went to a mosque, he never spoke to an Imam. This man is not an example of good decision making. This was the best example of a white guy converting to Islam they could find?
Last patriot - yes it DOES matter.  The black shooter said he wanted to shoot some white cops. Obama's outrage is missing here
Today was Trump's most disgraceful display of cowardice and incompetence yet. His failure to condemn the white supremacists and neo-Nazis and his blaming "many sides" is intended to further empower these racist, anti-semitic hate groups. He built his campaign on hate, he staffed his White House with white supremacists and Nazis, so we should not be surprised these groups feel sanctioned to spew their racist hate freely.
Non-whites should be banned also.
Where is the mayor in all of this and why didn't the newspaper get a reaction from him?  He was the one who appointed White to his current position and it has been a mess ever since.  The rank and file do not respect him ever since he ordered his officers to stand down while Occupy Denver idiots desecrated the flag and vandalized a memorial to fallen officers.  Throw in his "Cops for Props" decision plus the general lawlessness of his officers (do not engage w/ a DPD officer unless you want to risk getting beaten) and he has been a major disappointment.   So I repeat, where is the mayor in all of this?
The robot censor seems disinclined to accept some harsh truths, but let's try again:  Why is it that despite 70% of serial killers and 80-90% of child molesters and mass-shooters being white, most white Americans are fixated on BLACK crime?  Perhaps its related to a long-perpetuated double-standard that when black or brown (or Muslim) criminals commit crimes, it's held up as a reflection on their entire communities, whereas when white criminals do so, it's only a reflection on said criminals themselves.  And that in turn seems predicated on a widely held and nearly as frequently denied assumption that was first voiced by satan, when his Creator demanded he explain why he refused to make humble himself before 'Adam as he was commanded: "Anna khairum min'hum--I'm BETTER than him." (Qur'an, Suratul-A'raf, Ayaa 11-12)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTDvh5IiPPo  So many of the protesters are not the stereotypical white Anglo Saxon racists,  as is always the implication of such  stories, but immigrants from eastern countries,  Hindus,  Buddhists  and various brown skinned people who know first hand what living amongst Muslims is all about. Many are in Canada precisely because  Muslim violent aggressions  drove them out of their home lands.
Wait, I thought only white males were serial killers?  Finally, more equality in the mass murder department?
Victoria Leon Guerrero is a stupid white girl who pretends to be a native Chamorro.  She also pretends to hold a PHD, when, in reality, she has a terminal masters degree and will never have a PHD.  Stop playing Dr. Chamorro and go back to being stupid white girl.
We will NEVER get used to Nazis, White Supremacists, and their supporters like you. Or, are you man enough to denounce them? Otherwise, you don't deserve to be part of humanity.
"We can turn out all the black votes you want," Reed, chairman of the ADC, said in a telephone interview. "But somebody's got to talk to the white voters; it's not our challenge to do that. We can talk to everybody, but white voters got to hear from white folks."  And we conservatives are the racists?? Unbelievable...
Holy frijole trumps people are just blatantly lying now. Fake news heaped on more fake news. From a Corey Lewandowski interview:  "And then, Donald Trump won the election campaign by the largest majority since Ronald Reagan in 1984."  Huh. The largest majority since 1984? Really? Let's take a look:    There have been eight presidential elections since 1984. In popular vote margin, Trump is 8th out of 8. In the Electoral College vote, he's 6th out of 8. This obviously wasn't just a careless mistake on Lewandowski's part."   when the man or his people aren't insulting every demographic in America other than white men they are spewing gross lies to assuage the massive ego of the trumpster. This can't really be happening to my beautiful country can it? Have we devolved into a nation incapable of separating the wheat from the chaff? Are we really so poisoned by diets of fast food and junk information that we no longer have a moral core to act from? Trump is a sexual predator. He is unfit.
As a life-long Democrat who voted Republican for the first time in 2010 (Yes, I voted for Obama's first term!), let me tell you my perspective of what I've learned since Trump's election:  - Democrats are the biggest  dividers of this country, using race, sex, sexuality, religion, immigration, and political correctness as tools to lure voters.  Donald Trump's most racist, misogynist act was that he was a White male who won the Presidency following a Black President, and he beat a woman.  Democrats are sore because they believed that they could win elections based on identity (race, sex) without substance. - Establishment Republicans (now on the way out) like Flake, are no better than Democrats, legislators becoming fat and rich by taking taxpayer money, selling out the country, and throwing crumbs to their voters.  That's just a start of what I've recognized.
Now this is hilarious. When you have no argument and the facts aren't on your side ad hominem attacks are what you use. BTW, facts aren't racist or bigoted. Try to ease up on your obvious biases and maybe you'll open your eyes to the truth.  The following is what makes your comment beyond hilarious. I am from a multi-racial family. We are black, white, Mexican, Jewish, et al. To top all of that off I had a family member murdered by the KKK decades ago, so unlike you, I actually have valid reasons to hate racists and Nazis.   People like you just throw out personal attacks, while having no clue about anything. Pathetic.
"My bet is he is an angry White Supremacist. Look at his arrest records. He could be looney tunes too."  Yeah, like that crazy guy who shot up all those Republicans at that baseball game.  Or the lunatic who shot and killed 50-some in Orlando, or the crazy people who shot and killed those people in San Bernardio.  Darned angry White Supremacists!  We wouldn't have these terrible tragedies if everyone were a registered Democrat of a non-pinkish-beige color!
And, I believe Trumps condemnation also includes the blacks, the liberal students, and many conservatives who don't appreciate the angry white people outfitted in riot gear and weapons, promoting their hate for groups of people based on their color or religion.  Many American's of all race's have lost their lives fighting against this type of hate. And MAGA refers to what and when? When was America greater than today? Before blacks had the vote, or had rights? When Jews were rounded up and gassed? I would like to think America is greater now than it ever has been, but as of last November, I'm not so sure.
YAS !!! TYPICAL--white supreme race people looking down on others !! Get over it---all commenters so far as I read---are from urbania--cities and don't give a rats a_s   what goes on out in the wild---for us that depend upon nature--to provide us and ours--the food and necessities---It is a welcome wake-up !!!
White trash hillbilly of low intellect. Can tell by his looks. Met a lot of theses nebishes all over the USA during college and travels.
And as Obama said they "think like a typical white person".
You can disagree all you want but have enough guts to put your true feelings into heartfelt words or go crawl back into your cave. This sick f--- of a so called president is ruining our country and that's the bottom line. It looks like this white guy was targeting white people. It has gotten this bad.
His handlers obviously pulled his ears and made him call out the klan and white supremacists "and other hate groups". The man is an inept moron.
Whites commit the vast majority of financial fraud and white collar crimes.  When are we going to target them?
Oh....I almost forgot the law that states only white people and the Government are allowed to control land they own or charge for using it....silly me.
The liberal "politically correct" ethos is drowning out even Muslims that want to help and condemn this type of child marriages by their most radical flanks --I think they call this irony. No law abiding, responsible Muslim citizen wants their children involved with these insidious terrorist groups, let alone child marriages; no more than white parents want their kids in neo-Nazi gangs, or black parents want their kids hanging around with the Bloods and Crips. Let Muslims help by speaking out and identifying these radical elements within their community, so let's please not sacrifice more innocent blood in the name of politeness and pretend that we don't see any differences in our multicultural societies. Help be part of the solution, read "Heretic Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now by Ayaan Hirsi Ali"  1 Reaction Delete
It takes two sides to start a brawl. The fact is that there were a lot of protestors there looking to start trouble. White Supremacists are repulsive - BUT - they have every right to march and voice their opinions. I wonder how many of the folks wailing over the horror of the person who drove his car into the crowd laugh each time they see the scene in Blues Brothers where they drive into the Nazis? The march organizers got exactly what they wanted (as did the media). The best approach would have been to simply ignore them. No news coverage, no protesters, just a bunch of racist chuckleheads marching around screaming out their hate. In an hour or two they would have gotten bored and gone to a bar to watch NASCAR.
And what pray tell is disrespectful in my post? That I use the word "white?" I'll use it wherever and whenever. White. White. white. white. white….people.
And what about whites and their bosses. They don't even have a shred of integrity left in themselves
White women voted against Hillary because they have a brain! She is an embarrassment to our nation. How has she helped the women of the Middle East who are persecuted? She has given government money to those nations AND taken money from those nations to her family fraud, oh I mean foundation.
"Donald Trump and Kevin O’Leary are the embodiment of white entitlement – men who have never lived a life in service to others yet believe themselves entitled to power ... There is an entire generation of organizers like myself who will commit their skills every day for the rest of their lives to ensuring Canadians have leaders who serve their citizens and not their egos, and build every day for a more just society."  Thank you for encapsulating the scourge of our times, which is, all of us know that whomever doesn't agree with us is out for themselves, and "we" are absolutely sure that "we" are better than "you."  Whether Chretien, Trudeau, Harper, McGuinty, Harris ... do you really, really, believe they ALL got up every morning thinking of nothing but ripping off the Canadian public, maximize government money for themselves, and suppress minorities because of white privilege racist male hatred?  I can hear your objective viewpoint right now: "Of course not!  Only two of the above!"
I am upset that the two Women pictured, both with positive identities and relevant platforms, were overshadowed by two old white men, who neither followed  the rules of the panel, nor had positive messages to contribute to the event..  Yes the headline was direct in stating the two men were "Two Cantankerous Old White Men" but did that need to be the headline in the first place?
Trump somehow managed to not get over the very low bar of decrying white supremists and Nazis, but has managed to personally attack one of the only African Americans on his commerce committee, the head of Merck, for resigning BECAUSE Trump wouldn't specifically decry white supremists and Nazis. Nice job Trump, who stupid house ape.
"On Sept. 1st, 1853 I left my farm on the Umpqua and started for Jacksonville to hold U.S. District Court there. At the Umpqua Canyon I overtook Lieut. L.F Grover with an advance company of Col. Niesmith's company.  At Grave Creek I stopped to feed my horse and get something to eat. There was a house there called Bates House after the man who kept it. There I found Cpt. J.K. Limerick in command of a company of volunteers. It seems he had been sent there by General Lane... Bates and the others had induced a small party of peaceable Indians who belonged in that vincinity to enter into an engagement... They invited them to partake of a feast in an unoccupied log house just across the road from Bates House. While the unarmed Indians were partaking of the proffered hospitality, the door was suddenly fastened and they were shot down by their treacherous white hosts. Nearby I was shown a large hole which the bodies of the murdered had been unceremoniously tumbled."  - Judge Matthew P. Deady
The Nazi's and white supremacy murdered millions of people last century and caused a world war.  No, they do not deserve ANY tolerance for their vile and dangerous attitudes and actions and the rhetoric against them should be strident. It is false equivalence to equate Lincoln's attitude toward the south and the current reaction to the repugnant views and goals of the alt right.  In fact, I found your post insulting to the true greatness of Lincoln.  The civil war was also about the economic dependency of the south on slavery and Lincoln recognized that for what it was.  The south didn't represent the pure, unmitigated hate and violence that the alt right does. The confederate statues erected long after the civil war weren't symbols of heroism or even a "celebration" of history (to the losers), they were erected as signs of intimidation and on-going and growing racism. Here we are, long after WWII, should we put up statues of Hitler or Stalin...
Who is doing all the raping?  How many white guys and RCMP officers live on Reserves?
He'll distract them by blaming some stigmatized group and the racist whites will rally around their Savior--the guy who's f*cking them.  https://thewpsa.wordpress.com/2016/03/27/racial-resentment-and-the-rise-of-donald-trump/
And lastly, before you white guys get off on other wrong headed stereotypical BS, let's not forget studies and law enforcement data shows it is you guys who hold the blue ribbon for raping and killing children.
What a clever idea.  Now you can blame every problem in the country on a conspiracy of white supremacists.
I'm sorry you feel that way but are you also offended by the u.s. flag as white supremacist groups ALWAYS have it present in abundance?    Please note that many blacks fought for their states under the Confederate battle flag.  There are many photos of black confederate soldiers at reunions with the Confederate battle flag.  That flag belongs to blacks as much as anyone else.  Blacks are southerners and have helped make the South what it is.
Trump is the preferred candidate for "poorly educated" white people. No more and no less. Putin loves "poorly educated" white Americans too. Unfortunately, Trump voters don't care why Putin loves them. At least Putin is a white man. That is enough for Trump voters. Too bad he thinks he is a Russian first.
I gotta respectfully disagree with the characterization of the "scuffle". No one in the march was there to start a fight. They were there to make a statement about legitimate grievances against gentrification, how Uncle Ike's plays into it, and how it was put right next to a black church when that would never be allowed next to a white church.  The scuffle started when him and his goons laid hands on people. I was on the fence about Uncle Ike's, but now I'm not. Fuck Uncle Ike's. Don't shop there.
Do you people condemn reverse discrimination ?  The. White's just did what every other race  has done. So it's wrong because there white ? How many people have been hurt or killed in other racial riots threw out time ? I think we should have a white only college fund  ! Don't you all ? That way the negro college fund wouldn't be racist ! It's about time the white race quit bowing down to all others why in hell should they ! All is fair you people cry for equality well let's be fair with the white race also!
The problem is that it's a lie. More white people are killed by police than black people, even though blacks commit half the violent crime in this country.
Yanno, us "others", who aren't a part of that white supremacy movement, should just start ignoring those clowns.  They're just a bunch of angry, racist, selfish jerks, with no real agenda.  They're just whining. They want everyone to fight them...because that's all they have.    So, when they march, at most any of us who object should show up with lawn chairs, some snacks, and just sit there and laugh at them.  Heck, take pics and post them on your social sites and mock the heck out of them.  In reality, except for a very few whackos, those guys are nothing to a modern society.  They're not worth the effort, other than to laugh at.
We are on the cusp of a Fourth Nazi Reich. Heil Trump! Seig Heil!!  With folks like 3rd gen Ak saying white men are Earth's alpha males at will on these pages, hell yes, we're headed to Hitlerism. Won't be long before Fuhrer Trump will start talking concentration camps and gassing brown and black people. And starving them to death at his personal labor camps. Seig Heil!
Instead of hating on them, why don't you blame those businesses and individuals that create a market to hire illegals. If the jobs aren't here for them, they won't come.  On another note, it's not just Mexicans.  People from all over the world including white people travel to the US illegally.  The hate towards Mexicans is bigotry.
C'mon South Africans, Red, Black, Purple, White, Coloured and Green, let the teeth of the sheep now clearly be seen!
...except for the part where Muslim isn't a "race," and 99.99 of terrorist bombings are by non-white Muslims....
"I will surround myself with a staff that is reflective of the diversity within this city," was Multnomah County Commissioner Jules Bailey's answer.  Bailey  continues:  "I  will also paradoxically attend and tithe to an almost all-white fundy church that demands that my female staffers submit to their husbands, unless those female staffers are lesbians, in which case they are bound for hell along with gay guys."
PHILCO and Alceste "racism" has indeed been "overused" and "run their course" proof the left is no longer satisfied shrieking "racist"  now they shriek "white supremacist" and "neo-Nazi" -
Republicans are following Trump's sick racist and xenophobic lead. At the first Virginia gubernatorial debate, Ed Gillespie admitted Virginia doesn’t have “sanctuary cities. But that didn’t stop Gillespie, the Republican gubernatorial nominee from grabbing the white supremacist baton from failed Confederate candidate Corey Stewart to release one of the most racist ads in recent political memory. “Ed Gillespie clearly believes that his route to victory rests in demonizing young Latino men and the immigrant community as a whole,” said Luis Aguilar, a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient and CASA in Action member. “He may believe it is an effective campaign tactic, but the people I speak with are furious with the abject racism of Ed Gillespie’s campaign and plan to deliver that message on election day.” Resist Trump and his agenda.
In Amerikkka, “black” people (because identifying someone using a colour is just so enlightened) are only allowed to be “grateful”  Anything else is “uppity” and makes people nervous because it does not fit the traditional narrative of “white” hegemony.
What a bit of convenient  governmental  deflection, aided and abetted by a credulous Globe, claiming the real  terrorist threats in the world are phantom hordes of white Nazis inspired by President Donald Trump. Meanwhile,  Islamist terrorists opportunistically ram cars into pedestrians and our borders are overrun by  fraudulent asylum seekers inspired in turn by our Prime Minister's narcissistic invitation.
If the shooter is black, I thought Republicans wanted black support. He was just using his 2nd Amendment rights as the GOP has threatened. I guess the 2nd Amendment is just a white privilege.
Several genteel regulars here are welcoming to white supremacists, anti-Semites, neo-Nazis and sundry bigots. Then they'll drone on piously about the faith, without a trace of irony.  Feh.
Reading these posts from the libs in CO. is exactly why the east coast thinks you all are a bunch unpatriotic white guilt granola pantsy socialists. Looks like they are right. Keep smoking your weed it appears to be working.  MAGA!
If the shooter was Muslim the right would have no problem “playing politics”.  Fox News and our fkkkg moron in charge would call for a Muslim ban.  Since the shooter was white their agenda has been derailed.
I hope that lynching won't become popular entertainment again. That was family entertainment for white folks in the good old days. Trump's Supreme Court could bring back race based slavery. We know the GOP base hates black people being considered equals. It is not like we don't have precedents for such policy decisions.
There is no Pride anymore, only Shame. She is a hate filled racist and homophobe. She hates the gay white men who created Pride in the first place and is determine to steal it for her own political ends. If the thousands of gay men of Toronto stop supporting Pride she will hate them even more. All she will do is destroy Pride  which she will blame on anybody but herself and BLM.
Yes indeed. The New Black Panther Party is a virulently racist and anti-Semitic organization whose leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews and law enforcement officers.
White people were never the slaves of black people nor do white people suffer broad institutionalized racism from black people.  To equate "white shaming" with "racism" is ignorant and another form of racism. You should be shamed for thinking they are equal sides of the same coin.
Oh, poor alt-right white supremacists, just excising their freedom of speech prepared with combat helmets, batons, pepper spray, body armor.  No they were't looking for a fight.  Must be those violent hippies.
If he was white and not Hispanic it would be s problem
There is as much evidence Quebecors are white supremacist as there is evidence Justin Trudeau is a white supremacist. Really disgusting to see the G&M inciting hate against Quebecors again. But that is how Globalist divide and concur. Luckily Canadians have great Nationalist pride and will not fall for these fake stories.
Right, so the folks you're calling "intelligent" would love to have a career criminal, and cereal liar in the White house along with her sexually abusive husband.  Maybe she should bring her server as well so it can be hacked. Really intelligent folks!  lol
look at all you self important, self centered greedy white guys out there today with all your racist comments....you are an embarrassment to the rest of us Canadians
It is appalling that the disgusting liberals showed up to denounce the ever peaceful white nationalists.  It's not like white nationalist are some extreme, violent subset of the population like women.  Remember when women actually had the nerve to march after almighty trump was elected - now that was a violent demonstration.
he's an ISIS terrorists! He fought for ISIS a caliphate. Now, who's the group the Nevada guy fought for but of himself? Do you know his affiliation with any terrorist group than theDonald could go after? The Nevada guy terrorist group died with him, lol. Oh wait! It's the WHITE man! But the Black mass of murders in Chicago is 10 times the amount the White man killed! Where's your distaste of the Black Man killings going on in Chicago?
Huh, I must have missed your earlier comment that this article about "white males" is racist and sexist.
Nope. He's going to go hard-Right because that's the agenda of the 1%ers who hired him. Ryan and Donald Trump have the same employers. They'll work together because white America has given the Republican party it's golden opportunity. They won't let it pass. What will be interesting is watching the expressions on the faces of ignorant whites when they realize they're also on the same sinking boat the hull of which they just shot a hole into. Tools.
It's only treasonous when you do it against your own country... What are you talking about?  And, your white neighborhood it's not the whole USA, I hope...
Richard get your head out of your butt. Go to Europe and look at the immigrants there. I've been there it's a absolute craphole danger and crime Go to 5 major cities in Britain where you can't walk because you  are white...  You pacifist academics are the scourge of the civilized world.  Get off your chair Buy a ticket LOOK!!!!! GET THE FACTS!!!!!
Sore loser liberal. Get over it. Your skank lost. Move on. You reek of liberal white guilt.
Obviously not a very good terrorist.  19 were injured/killed.  How many were killed or injured in the Las Vegas attack?  Be thankful Muslims do not have the kill mentality like good ole white boys.
Translation: A predominantly black school makes inflammatory and false accusations about the conduct of a predominantly white school and community and the blame belongs with the victim because of their mascot.  Not only that but the school who had false accusations leveled at them is told to make up wrongdoings, punish people for those made up actions, apologize, and institute a program to be tolerable of other races.  Are you freaking serious?
CAREFUL, officers!  Don't hurt the heavily armed old white guy living up on the hill!  Samoan kid with a stick?  Light him up!
Another brown-shirt sycophant blindly loyal to Der Fuehrer Trump in his Republican ideological traitorous acts to destroy the U.S. Constitutional Republic and all human and civil rights contained therein.  The wrong way to conduct news as epitomized by the blatant lying in every issuance.  The Roy Cohn and Hitler methods of operation against all who dare to dissent, lie, lie, lie, deny, deny, deny.  The pure traitorous White Supremacist ideology driving the entire administration and the Republican party from stem to stern.  Now for all to see in the public forums revealing the former operations in the back rooms of political conspirators made up of elected Republican traitors to their sworn oaths.  Disgusting.
There are too many low white racists in Canada. This is a brave soldier who gave a somewhat exaggerated account of his role in one battle. Big deal. Ordinarily, it would be shrugged off with a wink and a tolerant grin. But the man is brown and so all the white skunks have leapt on him.
Trump is so deranged and crazy he'll soon start a bounty on Mexican scalps. How much would it take for you trigger happy AR15 owners to partake? $20 bucks per? $50 per? $100 bucks? Thousands here would be on a waiting list for that to happen. But like I've said before and I'll say it again: White folks, he's your man. You own it.
Don't know what hatred of everyone whose not white has to do with race.  I'll think about it
School children should certainly not have to put up with being called names.  Any thoughts on the black people calling for white people to be burned in the Knysna fires, Siseko?
Oh boy...Haycox has really gone off the edge this time.  Alaska will be a part of the rebuilding of our economy and our country.  When haycox says the democrats have left the working class because they are "white trash".  Well there is a certain amount of truth in this statement in that this is the attitude of the yuppies, hedge fund managers and coupon clippers that HIllary hopes will elect her to the presidency.  No...when the democrats left the working class was when they signed up with the extreme environmental agenda and declared war on America's working class in resource development jobs.  It is one of the interesting  twists to this election that haycox in his own ivory tower completely misses.
Like Donald Trump these little white boys are nothing but a  bunch of babies blaming everyone but themselves for their miserable lives.
This guys is white blind. Now even the world's whites are in his sights. Just another JZ groupie. Such a racist this guy but that is ok.  We sit by the river and wait.
Not really upset if cops beat or even kill someone, regardless of the reason, as long as it isn't me or mine. (And it probably won't be, since I have never spoken to one or interacted with them in anyway) I am white, very middle aged and I think this is the key: I don't drive a car. Once you get in the car, I appears that you belong to them. On the other side, I wouldn't want one of them getting near my daughter or granddaughter. Avoiding thugs of all types seems the best bet, regardless what sort of costume they wear.
I'd love to see equality in Canada--not for women, but for men.  A white male in this country has been reduced to crap you find on the bottom of your shoe.   In the USA, you hear nothing but talk about creating jobs, not for women, not for minorities, but for AMERICANS.     Maybe one day, everyone in Canada will be equal, but not before this joke of a Prime Minister has been tossed out along with his white, male bigotry.
It was more cost effective to rape black, female, slaves and enslaving their children, than buying adult slaves. Rape was just a business decision and fun. The memoirs of Mary Chestnut mentions how white wives of slave owners didn't like the fact that so many of their slaves looked like their husbands.
They also may have been particularly unlikely to share their views with a visibly disabled, ethnically-mysterious-this-must-be-some-kind-of-brown outsider.  His ties to Imago Dei sank his campaign, IMHO. I am not alone in that opinion, as I do talk with a lot of other "Portland Progressives"...I'm more of a crotchety center-left sort. I'm not car-free or skinny or "not in East Portland" or "educated" enough to be a Real Progressive. And yet, in living rooms around town, those of hetero couples and gay ones, PoCs and white alike, the three big strikes against Bailey were his uncritical support of his creepy church, that he's done little for many of his platform elements like affordable housing on the County Commission, and, out here, his utter ignorance of East Portland.   I know, and am friends with, Mormons, Southern Baptists, etc. I used to be a Good Mormon Girl. I know shifty hate-filled churches when I see one, and Imago Dei is just that.
Let's dispel the immigration myth right now.   The current exploitation of fear of immigrants is co-ordinated by weak and insecure, fascist, white supremacist, neoNazis in the White House.
But if you're white and mow down 500+ people with a hotel room full of weapons, no biggie. No Trump headline making changes, life goes on.
He was running for President of Indonesia.  A lot of white Christians wanted Obama's head too. For being a Muslim African with a fake American citizenship.
That's not true at all, Philobiblon. The press is mainly interested in overthrowing our President.  Where is the howling of the press for Trump to condemn Black cop killers, as they did for the white supremacists?
This is absolutely ridiculous, if someone flys a flag who cares??? But If blacks wear their malcolm x that's ok right???? Some blacks are more racist than whites!!!
Really? So the video I watched of a weaponless young man walking along the White Supremacist/Nazi/KKK mob asking them to stop and leave who was viciously attacked by four members of the mob while a fifth mob member aimed a gun at him was made up? Of course it was. Just because a mob - excuse me, hate "group" well known for acts of violence, including murder - comes to exercise their right to free speech armed to the teeth with guns, metal staffs and other evidence of peaceful intent, why would anyone there to protest the hate group come prepared to defend themselves? Silly me.
I absolutely love watching sanctimonious liberals get their panties all in a knot when the truth is revealed regarding their white supremacist roots.
Old white folks huh? I wonder why racism is so deplored by the left? I mean really, for you guys, it's just another tool in your tool box. But then I guess that hypocrisy is as well.
Remember, our PM has had only one real skill in his entire life - talking. Therefore, he should never disappoint in a speech.  Other than that, he brings absolutely nothing else to the table. He is the epitome of white privilege - unearned wealth, boyish good looks and unbridled access to anything or anyone based on his last name. If PET was not his father, he would still be sweeping snow off a chair lift for minimum wage.  This government will never be able to deliver anything of substance. We'll all be poorer at the end of the day but I'm sure many won't mind because they feel so warm and fuzzy in his glow. So Canadian
He was sick with hatred of white people who were his victims and should have never been aloud in this country, can't you see he's a middle eastern muslim.
By the way, counter protesters need not obtain a right to assemble against these enemies to our Nation. Yeah, communists are bad.  The stock market is doing well and free enterprise is working well.  I'm not worried about communists gaining a foothold but these disgraces to America are horrible. Wearing MAGA hats did not help Trump here. I am certainly no longer interested in him or his hat until he firmly rights this wrong. Again, it's not left or right. It's about right or wrong. If the commenters here don't understand that, don't tell me your patriots. I know I am and I know the wars we fought. About the Civil War, secession is not patriotism to the Union. Another mistake of Americans who appreciate our long history. We've evolved. I have no intention of letting white nationalists who state that we should mimic a Nazi (fascist) ideology and claim my Nation. I'll not allow Nazi Germany to revisit America. I choose not to go back to 1930's Germany through 1945. That's garbage.
What!?  Hodad I am so triggered by your comment.  Everyone knows that Europe is full of WHITE MALES.  I have to go to my safe space right now and call the feminist crisis hotline.
Then why did the Declarations of Secession of Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas all declare that the white race was superior to the black race and the black race being enslaved was the only way they could exist in America?  "Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. " - Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, March 21, 1861   I realize you're a Trump supporter so you probably don't appreciate things like "facts," but you could stand to crack a book sometime before you go online and make an ass out of yourself with your ignorance.
The question is not whether in the distant past, some have regarded black lives as not mattering to whites.  The question is:  Do black lives matter in the USA?  Do YOU  need reminding that black lives matter?  If so, then count yourself a racist, repent, and make amends.  Don;t include me in your allegation of white racism.  Just speak for yourself, please.
I don't think anyone is afraid of different values-unless your values , DICK, are wearing a hood at night , working the police force during the day and just plain being a prick. Not all white people are racist, I know, but I guarantee a shit ton of them have just sat by , watching ...........privleged.
LMAO.  That's the GOP strategy with uneducated whites, except they rely on their base to enrich themselves.
How much of that landscape do you want to destroy chasing those goofy white elephants.
Yeah, you're Exhibit A alright. Parroting the GOP talking point of (last) week: Never mind the president's sympathy for the "fine people" marching with Nazis and white supremacists. Look over there! It's Black Lives Matter! And how "horrible" they are to virtuous, non-racist, Confederate-monument-opposing white guys like you! It's so unfair! Really, Counselor?  Considering a majority of white voters (and Catholics!!) opted for the racist Trump, I rest my case.
That' right, But Lee was a traitor to the nation of his birth, which gave him his military education and rank. States' rights at that time meant legal enslavement of human beings for profit. If Lee had truly possessed character, he would have sided with the Union.  But a other have pointed out, Lee had adopted a commonly held belief that "negroes" were sub-human and incapable of living without the guidance of the white people. Today, at least some of us can see what a preposterous idea that is. but as recent events have shown us, we still have millions of people who still believe that white people are better than black people. How they can believe such a thing is beyond me, given the stupidity of white people we see every day.
More fake news from the lying Globe, they have to keep pumping the propaganda of white genocide.
Rupert is happy with the sales of the resident keepers. because now he can now again start campaigns for ramaphosa with a collection of looted money by blacks and buying book against Whites.
Walter, you are wrong. Lynching is part of American history and lynching was entertainment for white folks. Can you handle the truth? If not, please don't kill your loved ones in a murder suicide when you realize white folks, as a group, are not innocent. You all benefit from white privilege. If you don't know how to benefit from that privilege it is not the fault of black folks. Do you know that you benefit from such violence? They did lynching for white folks like you. Today, cops can get away with murdering black children. I guess that is a demotion for white folks. In the good old days, any white man could get away with murdering black folks with out needing a badge. That includes murdering black folks praying in church. It is clear that some white folks miss those privileges.
Wow, the loser convention is all full of commentary about an issue you know nothing about. The only violent acts committed in VA was by the Antifa and BLM racists. the supporters of the right were on there side of the barricades and exercising there rights to free speech and had a permit to assemble. It was the counter protesters(TERRORISTS) who stormed past the police line and attacked the whites. If the had stayed on there side of the street there would have been NO violence at all. The guy who used his car as a weapon did so to defend his people from the terrorists crossing the road to attack lawful Americans  exercising there constitutional rights. You don't have to like there message that's not up to you or anyone else to stop people from voicing there opinions and exercising there rights The counter protesters of the left (Communists) will stop at nothing to crush this country, they are enemies of America. Free speech is for all Americans to excersize.
Why are black women dispropotionally represented? Excellent question. I would suggest that it's because they have less access to contraceptives given the fact that they earn about 17% less than white women. They probably are less likely to have insurance as well.  Ironically pro-life attacks on Planned Parenthood will increase the number of abortions.   http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/
So, lets analyze this a bit. In the top statement, you are observing, and we assume complaining that anyone being told "go back to (where ever)"  is BAD, when it is coming from an old white man.  But here in this statement, you have a method to justify when it is now appropriate to tell someone they should go back to the mainland. Again, it only appears to apply to "white men"  So, it is bad when said by one group, but it is perfectly fine when said by another group. There is a word for that : Hypocrite.  And considering that you failed to address when Micronesians are told "go back to your country" by Hawaiians, then that must be ok too ?
" Accusations of racism require lots of absolute hard evidence"--Well, yes, they do.  "That person said something mean!" is kindergarten-level logic.  "don’t you dare read anything into the fact that we have a high school in Colorado with a Confederate “rebel” as it’s mascot"--The Hispanic student body there doesn't seem to have much of an issue with it.  "god forbid you offend white people without proof."--Just because you hate white people doesn't make anything you say accurate.
I wonder how many of these protesters are white hipsters who moved into the former black neighborhoods?
I'm worried about Canada based on the reactions to this article more than I am about the server. The fact that he was told by a manager of an establishment to pick an easier name so white people can say it better is not PC culture, it's absolute racist ignorance. It's behavior that shouldn't be overlooked and passed off as "SJW" rhetoric; it should be cut off at the roots. When we let people get away with this crap year after year, suddenly you have a situation like the US where the racists get a massive foothold because, guess what, nobody stopped them. Followed by people throwing up their hands and asking "How could this have happened?" as if they don't already know.
White guy kills, tougher gun laws not the answer.  Muslim guy kills, tougher immigration laws are the answer.  And the right wing wonders why they are labeled racist?
After reading through most of the comments I continue to be horrified by the people defending Donald "Grab Her By the Pussy" Trump!. They continue to defend a man who may be the biggest piece of white trash America has produced yet! His accomplishments are: Lying, cheating on wives, lusting after his own daughter and calling her a piece of ass, groping his daughter in public, scamming investors out of millions with fake real estate deals and fake Trump U, multiple bankruptcies and failed companies, bankrupting many Mom & Pop businesses by not paying his bills, not paying employees, lying constantly about anything he doesn't know about; which is EVERYTHING, racism, misogyny, bigotry, vulgarity, bullying, sexual assault, narcissism, fake charities, insurance scams, tax evasion, stupidity, ignorance, brutality, the mental maturity of an 8 year old, , etc., etc., ad nauseum! I'm sure I left a lot off the list. Ran out of room!  Is this POS really your hero?
Hogwash, another drummed up Liberal false narrative to keep his voting base. I'd say Trump reallocated the funds in question to the Inner City Crime Prevention, that's one of the Big Issue in the US. <--- that's to counter your assumption he took the funds away from the White terrorist Grant so it won't diminish his voting base.
well, they are brown, they speak Arabic and call God "Allah" so they are probably Muslims in disguise, claiming to be Christians to get our sympathy.   everyone knows "real" Christians are white and speak English.    funny, I notice none of our regular righties are expressing any anger over their Catholic compatriots despair and danger.    they pay lip service to protecting the Christians in the Middle East, but heaven forbid they should actually help them.
Sounds like an excellent book, in the style of James W. Loewen's significant social history of the US, "Lies My  Teacher Told Me. "  Today we see the righteous  anger the Middle Class directs toward the top 1%. for their bloated incomes.  Too often, however, Middle Class contempt  for the "White Trash" passes unnoticed.  While the MC  is sure  they themselves are as smart and hardworking as the rich, too often they assume the poor and unskilled workers are  just "dumb and lazy" and deserve to be on the bottom.    But a special note on Oregon:  yes, "Land was the principal source of wealth", so the free  land given to the first Oregon pioneers--640 acres for a  married couple-- spurred a frantic rush to Oregon and many formerly landless folks were able to acquire significant farm land...but at the expense of the Indians whose land this was.
Some muslims support terrorism, most do not. Just as white suppremists terrorists and the KKK claim Christen values.
Well, Blue, I think that you and today's fellow Globe guest columnist, Summer, have quite a bit of work ahead of you.  Perhaps tomorrow's columnists, Sky and Moonbeam, will expand on this vision even more.  You see, Blue, what grownups understand is that populists like President Orangutan do not arise just from "entitlement", and "racism", and "hate".  Now, populists do indeed take advantage of those "worse angels" of our nature, but those alone are not enough to bring them to power.  What is it then, you must be asking yourself Blue?  It is a little thing we grownups call fear.  Now, this is where you chuckle and snort and pat all those silly white men and brow beaten white women on their heads and say: "get over it".  And then you offer us your bright vision of the future. One that meshes with the numbers. For example,  rationalize how Canada will be better off in 60 years as we become an Islamic majority nation.  Do that Blue. You and Summer and Sky and Moonbeam get right on it.
As a white male who's Great Grandfather fought in the 2nd World War, against the Germans, how do i reconcile this statement?  "We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is racial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by whites, we can mold them to the program of the Communist Party. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the Negro minority against the whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the Negro will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause."  -1912 Israel Cohen  And there are plenty more from prominent rabbi's.  How many young white men have died for lie after lie? 9/11? Muslim terrorists in a cave ?
So women and minorities can do whatever white men allow them to? SMH.
You know, I'm getting tired of getting beat up because I'm a straight, white male. Who can I file a lawsuit aganist....
the left are now digging up graves. forget White Supremacists normal citizens will soon be waging war on you crazies.
Poor Bill Northrup, growing up white in a country where dark skinned people get ALL the breaks.   But it is his own fault. He should have chosen different parents.  Stephen J. Remington
No he was bright enough to outwit uneducated white males and benefit from the HATE the republicans have for anything that is democrat.
..."if someone comes to my town and tries to preach hate, the white race, guns and a race-war, we are at that time when this is a threat to the community. They are terrorists in the making. Their kin in the KKK is ISIS." And of Course you also include the group Antifa, and you denounce their Marxism, Socialism, and stated desire to foment Violence to achieve their goals? They qualify as "terrorists in the making"...if (by definition; their own)...as well, "their kin is ISIS". Antifa is a clear threat to our community and Nation. I am also sure that you would include "Black Lives Matter"when they preach Hate, the Black race and a race-war-"kill the white cops! Fry em up like bacon"
One of Der Fuehrer Trump's loyal Deplorables created by him and his band of equally deplorable advisors and cabinet appointees blasting Nazi propaganda throughout the nation.  All immigrants and people non-white are to be fair game to be hunted down and eradicated just like the previous minority - Jews in Nazi Germany.  Der Fuehrer Trump's speech to the Klan of Konservatives clearly labeled all immigrants and Islam as worthy of eradication.  Time for a revolution.
I've had a very successful life with out one minute of white privilege to help me. You on the other hand don't know what you have earned and what you were given for just showing up white and male. You don't seem to know much about American  history. Your ignorance about your own history is another white privilege. You get to pretend to be only an individual, as if you don't live in a  society shaped by history.
"The most basic fact the Republicans learned is that their base is not united around a core set of principles, but that it can be animated by a core set of resentments, resentments that are dripping in the tropes of white nationalism."  Polls show that a majority of Republicans believe white citizens are oppressed in this country.  Just how and by whom they are unable to say.  The Republican Party has used Fox "News" and hate radio to build resentment among uniformed whites.  The chickens have come home to roost as the George Wallace constituency has taken over the Republican Party.  The Republican elite are too cowardly and opportunistic to stand up to it.
LOL!  You're response shows you are even more clueless than I thought.  If you actually were a prosecutor and can see no racism in the system then you were part of the problem.  Apparently, you actually believe black and white criminals are picked up at equal proportions.
Your White Supremacist hatred is exposed for all to see.  Thanks.
i acknowledge the fact that this stereotype has been around for centuries, and persists today. no argument there. i was merely suggesting that there are many very influential (unfortunately) people in the black community who are themselves fueling the fire- taking the stereotype that white devils created, and not only living up to the stereotype, but are promoting it.  "man, this is how it is on the streets; this is all i know, so this is what i talk about in my 'music'." well, ya selfish asshole, how about taking some of the money you make- the profits made, by the way, through your choice to destroy your own people's culture via the message you're sending- and put it to good use. gee, i don't know, maybe try a positive message..?unfortunately "stay in school" and "do something positive with your life" go against the gangsta grain.  you can point the finger all you want to. maybe you'll gain some ground with that tactic. but when a large part of the problem is within, that's on you.
"Your story is a little disingenuous in that a few wackos sending emails doesn't represent most Canadian opinions."  That is something else I can't seem to square the circle on.  When a handful of (presumably white) people send violent threats or commit violent acts... "we are all responsible in decrying them as bigots".  But when a handful of (generally non-whites... in this case Islamists) send violent threats or commit violent acts... "we must be clear that they don't reflect the majority".    Why the different rules based on skin colour?  Sadly, that sort of bigoted mentality is enshrined in the charter of "rights and freedoms".
Fine, let's say for every one of the white supremacists at the rally there is 100 more in the closet and 1000 more who are active sympathizers to the idea that all blacks and jews should be murdered.  That's about 110,000 people.  Sound better?  Again, there are 325 million people in the USA.
This is beyond stupid. This is disgusting. Where are the American People? Are they all standing up and cheering at the fact that their hero is literally dismanteling this democracy? They want to stick it to their imagined enemies (liberals, what do they even mean by that) so bad that they do not see that they themselves are being, um, done. Played. Is it possible that they are that stupid? From reading many of the comments on these articles, I conclude that the fat, white, male demographic love their Furher. "Hurt me next, Herr Donald, I love you." It is beyond belief. America houses the most angry, uncivil, resentful, moronic population on Earth. And I am talking to you, 50+ White Men. You should be ashamed. They will come for you next, and you will cheer to the very end.
Even Africans? You clearly have never met someone from Africa and are lieing out of your ass, most of them have a ‘we did it why can’t you’ ignorance towards African Americans. Same as most international Hispanic people. Just like every white person who has never gotten to know a single African American and judges them off of what the media puts in front of them. You guys really enjoy making things up.
The article fails to mention that there is a massive dose of present-day political indoctrination contained in the recommended replacements for the classical literary works in question.  The novel titled "Indian Horse" centres on a Canadian First Nations boy who survives the Indian residential school system without getting murdered there by the white man who ruined everything for native folks.  The book titled "Stone Thrower" centres on a black man spending time in 1970s Canada and the USA trying to succeed in a career but who is kept down by the white man, and his black daughter growing up in 1990s Ontario and the racism she faces in the high school cafeteria and reflections thereof, comparing racism in modern America to racism in modern Canada, the white man ruining things for visible minorities.    Visible minorities good. White man bad. The social justice warriors must be ecstatic with these choices. Next up in literature class: Pin the tail on the racist white man.
So says every government, police force and military of every nation.  But history SHOWS us what justice look like. It's not purely subjective. And Nazis are wrong. White supremacism is wrong. We fought a freaking WAR to depose the Nazis and then rooted out white supremacism at home, more or less.  There's little reason to be moderate in opposing people who are so very far on the wrong side of history as that. Their government would be doing us all a favor to shut down white supremacist hate speech. It disrupts the social order. No one has the right to cry "Fire" in a crowded theater. And the First Amendment is not a suicide pact.
That's it.  I'll dress as a fat, balding, one-legged white guy.  No, wait -- that'll offend my wife -- at least, it seems to.
Yep, Nazi's, white supremacists and all other left wing groups.
Knock off your cherry picking, oldvalleyguy.  Many of the black men and teenagers that were gunned down by white police officers were unarmed and not resisting arrest.  Almost all of the cases had bystanders or witnesses video taping the murders.  Videos don't lie, over adrenaline police officers lie and manage to beat their murder wrap.  I can easily understand why protesters take to the streets rallying for justice.  And by the way, the liberals aren't the ones passing open carry or concealed gun laws.  You can't have it both ways hypocrite.  You must've left your morals in the military locker room.
White on. Sad pathetic case.
BLM is a hateful, racist organization. They hate police, they hate white people. Why should they be allowed to take over Pride's parade through their bullying tactics? The organizers need to give their heads a shake.
Bannon is behind Breitbart but white supremacists are clowns?  I'm thinking clowns is a code word and so is economic nationalism.  I just don't like the sound of him.  He sounds like Stalin waiting in the wings, not who the GOP expects for sure I bet.  They are trying to get names from petitions and everything else in the fascist playbook.  We should be very leery after Crimea and Ukraine.
LOL!!  and you believe all of that crap?  get real!   Trump is liquid.  He owes a few hundred $million, and his loan to values are about 10%.  His net worth is in the multi-$Billions. That means that 90% of what he has is free and clear.  He generates income.  He builds luxury apartments.  He lists them for sale before they are finished and whomever shows up with the $Millions gets them, no matter where they come from, or what  color they are.  Americans?  OK! Russians? OK!  Chinese?  OK!  Asians?  OK!  Blacks?  OK!  Whites?  OK! ...etc.   That is the ethical American way, in case you didn't know that.  He also owns multiple Golf Courses around the world.  ANYONE can play there, black, white, brown yellow, red.  It doesn't matter.  Your fake news without sources is just that- fake news.
Another arch Liberal blames someone else for his hate speech. It's not unlike Hillary blaming the women her husband abused. Or Barack Obama  when he blamed White people for Black crime, or when he blamed Americans for Muslim terror.
You sound like a really, really fragile non-white person. Sooooooo oppressed.
The white supremacists involved in these violent demonstrations remind me of the Союз Православных Хоругвеносцев, the "Union of Orthodox Banner-Bearers" (or, to be jocular, the "Gang of Self-righteous Flag Wavers").  It's strange how these racist tropes emerge in such different contexts.
Yes, great party town, but I wouldn't want to live there. Rude workers, rude customers, rude waiters demanding 25% tips, way too many shopping centers in every casino. less and less water, broken escalators, sneering or uncaring front desk and security people, and so on. Wouldn't want your kids to grow up there. Full of unwanted kids, anyway. Worst part is I miss the $1 breakfasts and $5 buffets from back in 1970. Now all gone and the prime rib Popo gives you only thin one piece slice. Too many immigrants who don't even speak Engrish. Notice there's fewer and fewer blacks and whites. Plenty of Chinese immigrants and automated blackjack machines with robot dealers on the movie screens. Ugh! Mo beddah play the casinos games on my computer or on those battery operated toys from Long's. No can use money on the.
I do not like any of the dark groups, BLM is a good example . They are a racist group who are demanding black people take power by beating on white people . Africans as a group are murdering their own people . That is what dark people do with power. No need to explain what goes on where large groups of Muslims gather.
Chin is right.  The terrorists are already here and are citizens of all races.  Angry white men have been terrorists more than Muslims.  We need to get real for a change.
Yes, I know Republicans. Most of them are racists. They believe things like welfare mothers, gang members and drug users are all black or brown. That blacks are lazy, Asians are smart, white people were meant to rule. That has been my experience.
What's ridiculous to most people about it is the impression created -- that entitled white men have nothing better to worry about than being excluded from a few screenings of a Wonder Woman movie.  Seriously, do you really think this is a hill to die on?  I mean put this in perspective:  Black men in the US are protesting being routinely killed by police, indigenous men all over NA are protesting treaty rights and land claims, and entitled white men are protesting not being allowed in a few screenings of a movie.  And then they wonder why people are mocking them.
When you have NO evidence that in these days, whites in general do NOT believe that black lives don;t matter, and there is ample evidence that in general whites believe that black lives DO matter, it is a vicious racist lie.  More than 150 years ago, scores of thousands of white boys died to end slavery.  Jim Crow followed in some places, yes, but it was whites who ruled those laws unconstitutional.  Then there was busing, and "race norming" (giving an applicant for a federal job more points on a test merely for being black), and affirmative action in college entrance and private sector jobs.  And you still say that whites in general believe black lives don't matter.  Where is the everyday killing of blacks by whites?  Where is the everyday wanton maiming of blacks by whites?  Your statements reveal the utter moral bankruptcy.  I will continue to treat blacks as equals, as human beings, with respect and courtesy, despite your best efforts to make me hate.  You failed miserably.
The next US 'civil war' (primarily fought through the media on social networks) is going to be centered around the question of whether the US consumer should be subsiding US manufacturing jobs through higher prices of goods. You can already see it starting in the comments sections of US publications like The Atlantic. Mainstream America is serious pissed at the cranky old white men that pushed Trump over the top.
This article is absolutely pathetic. More "because it's 2017" harrumphs and patronizing about "white guilt" from champagne Liberals who get on one knee for Theresa Spence. Speak for yourself Renzetti - what an embarrassing article.
You're correct that when white people are dying, a law enforcement problem (when black folks were dying) morphed into a public health emergency.
Eloisa, is it not that the name "Reuben" is Jewish which is far different that Ruben, a Spanish name.  I believe that it is a common mistake by those who have little knowledge of people outside White society to mistake Ruben a Spanish name for "Reuben" a Jewish name. The tenor of you comment, Eloisa, that  you inserted  in my discussion with Brett seems to me comes from racial discrimination - "are you taking a class in high school" - meaning an uneducated Jew.
That statement is ridiculous!! That's like saying it's okay if 2 white people were switched and raised in the same town!! Nothing is okay with being switched and raised by a completely different family!! Never will it be understandable.  This is an atrocity or maybe that's only if you are white!!
The Jack Kemp kind of Republicans are called RINO's by the GOP base these days. The 50 years of GOP recruitment of Dixicrats motivated by white racism has been a complete success. They have managed to bring the KKK and neo-Nazis back into mainstream politics. Trump didn't create them. He just found them. Like a good 3rd generation con man, he knew what to do with the "poorly educated" and the ignorant. Most of them are suffering from cognitive dissonance caused by their fear of losing the white privilege they claim doesn't exist. They think they are victims. If they are victims, they are suffering from self inflicted wounds. See Kansas. They remind me of those guys that kill their families in murder suicides when they can't get what they want. They all have easy access to guns. They remind us of that every time they threaten us with 2nd Amendment solutions to their problems. They refuse to take responsibility for their choices in life.
Multiculturalism and diversity are just code words for white genocide.
Islamophobia is perfectly understandable, even justifiable. Why? Four reasons:  1. While many Muslims are nice people, invite 20 million to come here, and Canada will be a Muslim society with a Muslim government. Some Canadians are asking themselves: Do we want to live in a society similar to those in the Middle East? Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for the introduction of Sharia law.  2. The violent conflicts between Muslim groups in the Middle East are well known. Do we want to import those conflicts into Canada?  3. Many Canadians from Europe are familiar with the history of the "white slave trade". Between 1600 and 1830, 2.6 million white girls and boys were kidnapped and sold in the Middle East slave markets to serve as labourers, domestics and sex slaves in harems. The Barbary pirates in North Africa sailed as far north as Ireland & Iceland to kidnap white children. (continued below)
White people are really strange. Every spring they all get out their "tanning" creams and lotions….LOL….and hate those of us who are naturally tan to dark brown….I gotta….I gotta….keep myself from….falling over…Donald Trump, tell your people to knock it off!!!
No such thing as alt left except in the White Supremacist propaganda altering the vocabulary to make their own evil ideology legitimate.  The ranting of a pure Aryan White Supremacist glorying of the pseudo-election of his new Fuhrer, Trump, to free the Neo-Nazi Aryans to begin the violence just like Nazi Germany.  This nation needs to stamp out this evil just like it did in 1940s.  The big mistake was not doing it to the embedded racist bigots infesting this nation since its formation.
I don't care if we see this as racist or whatever the hell you said. What I can't stand is that we have this black history month and gay pride month, what the hell. Where is white pride month? The fact that we months set aside for the people who have a different skin color or the fact that we have a month set aside for people who like the same gender. That is BS. Where is the white appreciation month, where is a Military  appreciation month? I don't care how much crap I will get for this but this is all BS, if you have a problem with me, my name is Logan Hanner, come look me up!
What a despicable, filthy post. Apparently the murderer did support Sanders -- but he was also a White Nationalist and an anti-Muslim bigot. However, apart from his political or religious views, or his emotional and mental problems, what kind of person gloats about the murders and the murderer? A truly filthy, despicable post. http://www.denverpost.com/2017/05/27/portland-train-murder-suspect-white-nationalist/
Donald = White Trash  When Mueller gets on the Dem.s he'll  = White Trash
Who kills white people?
75% of the NFL is black males, 6% U.S. population is black males, 21% of crime is done by black males, 51% of murders is done by black males. Maybe white fans should take a knee to protest the real problem because it isn't the country or the flag or the police that's causing the problem.
White privilege doesn't exist.  It's a racist, disproven theory, which cherry picks it's data while ignoring millions of poor white people who have terrible lives and enjoy no privilege.  A quick trip to any washed up manufacturing town along the 401 will open your eyes, most white people have horrible lives and are the victims of the collapse of our industrial base, and they lack the mental prowess to adapt to the new economy.  Doesn't sound like being white is this free-pass to a life of privilege like the cultural marxist teachers would have us believe.  Whites should be proud of what their ancestors created, a wonderful free country that immigrants are flocking too, and is helping people from all over the world escape persecution, rape, poverty and genocide.
I'm not going to blame Trump personally.  However, it is worth noting that the white nationalists references Trump's election for becoming emboldened.  I never heard of any of the cop killers saying that Obama emboldened them.  Trump having a Hungarian-born neo-Nazi (Sebastian Gorka) hanging around the White House doesn't help (an I only point out his background because he is from a country in which the Order of Vitez originates; in other words, he isn't some dumb kid from the American suburbs that became fascinated with Nazi paraphernalia).
Pretty efficient at stopping those redneck white guy terrorists (a good thing), homegrown islamist terrorists; not so much.
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI! - Hypocrisy is worse than racism.
It's disgusting and should be banned from all public places.  I don't care if it's a homeless person or a billionaire white guy.
Put your money where your mouth is and sterilise yourself so your evil white DNA can not enter society.
Here is your "White Privilege" Boulder, you should be ashamed of yourself!
White guys like you think you've earned everything you've got without ever recognizing the one-up advantages you sailed on to get there along the way.  Many others work just as hard or harder but encounter obstacles based on gender or ethnicity that you couldn't even imagine.  "Merit" is largely a fallacy promulgated by white guys like you to pretend you are the great arbiters of what is right and fair and what "qualified" means.
I'm with you, and this creature was likely a domestic terrorist. Apparently a white American one.  Thus, I'd hate for the delusional Trump to decide the right response to this atrocity is to attack Iran.
[CLIP OF SEAN SPICER PRESS CONFERENCE IN JANUARY 2017]  SPICER: Carter Page is an individual that the president-elect does not know..         In March of 2016, Trump was asked who would be advising him on foreign policy.  TRUMP: Well, I hadn’t thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names… Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and counter-terrorism expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, he’s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg;  Jeff Sessions was named as Trump's chief foreign policy advisor later that same day.  March 2017:  Did you meet Sergey Kislyak?  PAGE: I'm not going to deny that I talked to him.  Extra credit:  Joe Schmitz, jumped out at me. Extreme Christian fascist white supremacist tied to Blackwater.  http://tinyurl.com/hq48ekk  One happy family, of fascist traitors.
What you wrote shows you did not listen or follow along with the narration of what occurred. On a serious note I am NOT defending Nazis. I am stating reality, which you willfully ignore.  What you and the other trolls keep ignoring is that I have stated many times here I am from a multi-racial family. We are black, white, Mexican, Jewish, et al. I also had a family member murdered by the KKK, so save your ignorant accusations for those in your bubble. People like you are as ignorant as the racists because you only believe what you want, reality had no part in it.
Interviewing self professed white nationalists who showed up for the latest Nazi gathering in Tennessee, …interviewees found out that the people who drove to the supposed white lives rally found out about the rally on the Russian version of Facebook pages. Not Facebook, the Russian hosted copy cat version of Facebook, or VK. This is all fine. Nothing unusual at all about American southern racists organizing on Russian media. Perfectly normal. It's perfectly normal for the Russians to be handling the planning and organizing of white supremacist rallies in American cities. Perfectly normal, that is, in Trumpworld. Welcome to Trumpworld. Where Russia calls the shots for Trump's base. Russia loads the guns and Trump pulls the trigger.
It's ignorant to say that 40-45% of French people are bad, racist, dumb, etc.,  LIKEWISE with the 45-50% that voted for TRUMP or HARPER  . This is not North America, a melting pot, this is a country of native, Christian-origin, French-speaking people. Foreigners need to adapt themselves to French customs or go home.  LIKEWISE with Quebec - I would say CANADA too but Trudeau would disagree  It's amazing how progressives like Saunders are always wrong on this stuff. "White guilt, white guilt!"   TRUE, guilt and denial of our "core identity" as Trudeau says  Progressivism has become a nauseatingly stupid ideology.  TRUE especially when it comes from the Left
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI!
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI! - Hypocrisy is worse than racism.
Mike Stainbank what in the world has your pathetic ambitions to do with the SARS  story as above? You worked for Bop TV? Is this an attempt to wash away your strong sense of culpability because of your involvement with an Apartheid child as a White man?
A. You can NOT get HIV from spit, you are spreading falsehoods and that is dangerous. B. The TPS as an institution has been racist, homophobic, transphobic and have targeted people of colour for carding in record numbers, far exceeding the population. That the police chief is black or any other colour does not guard him from being a police officer first and foremost. I assume you have heard of the 'blue line' where officers protect each other even if it lacks the truth of the situation. You really should look up the incident that was captured on video tape and there are many, many others that are not recorded. And C. to your point that the police are not a minority or cultural group...EXACTLY! and that is why they have no standing to be in the Pride parade unless they are GAY cops and then, very welcome. Perhaps you have never been hassled and good for you, probably white privilege but many others are on a regular basis. Again, the TPS are the ones that need to step up, not Pride.
Extensive info on the 'Patriot Prayer' group and it's Leader Gibson, but Nothing on the 4 counter-demonstrator groups. Huh...4 against One. That was sure a fair and balanced decision by the SF elites, who see nothing wrong with supporting Antifa and it's ilk. Pelosi assures us that the Patriot Prayer group are racist White Supremists....although Everything says "No', not true.": "Gibson, (has) said he denounced racism and wouldn’t allow any extremists into his event." "Indeed, the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, does not list Patriot Prayer as such, nor is Gibson considered an extremist by the advocacy center. In fact, the center ­reported that at the most recent Patriot Prayer event, Gibson shouted expletives denouncing neo-Nazis and white supremacists."  "Gibson counts the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. as one of his political heroes and on Facebook he preaches that “hatred is a disease.”  The Truth has never deterred the Hate of the Left.
Since most interracial rape and homicide are black-on-white, I'd say yes, we need a WLM movement.
"Playing the victim." Ever work in the feild you will hear those words out of abusers mouths like clockwork as justification. That's standard abuser lingo. I agree it's time to stop playing the victim lol, my personal opinion is to cut them down but I don't think my personal opinion should dictate to others situations I know nothing about. As stated by the amazing woman this article is written about, "it's not black and white." At 18 and a parent what were her options? All I know if you just made an abuse victim feel that much worse about herself. WTF man, have some compassion.
Lol yeah divisiveness, racism, bigots only represent the right. Maybe you've missed the protests. They seem to be the only bigots and racists I've seen and they certainly don't support trump. Seem to be pretty divisive as well with a war against whites. My favourite are the ones holding signs against hate and violence hitting people. You should add extreme hypocrites too the left. Also Neanderthals went extinct a long time ago. After seeing how the college "intellects" are nowadays with non stop whining and protesting I'd assume it's safe to drop the word intellect.
No. R or D doesn't matter. What does matter will be the results of Mueller's investigation, as well as his remarks about Mexicans, women, disabled reporters, white supremacists (or his lack of remarks, in that case), etc. I think he's corrupt - not sure if he's a idiot. He's clearly challenged in some fundamental ways, but he has enough smarts to have managed to brand himself and convince others of whatever inchoate wish fulfillment that brand represents. As for evil-incarnate - that's a bad concept. But he is yucky!
If you noticed, he said both sides were to blame.  How does that equate to support for Neo-nazism and violent racism?   Do you support blacks killing cops and other white people?
It's easy for a white person to claim another ethnicity commits all the crime, just as easy as it is for a black person to cop-out and say the white man is holding them down, and ADN's consistent omission of ethnicity details is borne of the stupidity of others. If a person commits a crime, ADN has the moral obligation to tell the public whether they are white, samoan, black, or Cree Indian. ADN Pay attention: not including these details make you look like a bunch of idiotic college-level SJW's that are committing the intrapersonal crime of cultural appropriation, being offended on another culture's behalf-and being overly sensitive. Grow up and do the work, enough is enough.
Really?  Because when Obama was president, and a Muslim killed soldiers at Ft. Hood, it wasn't a terrorist attack.  When a Muslim immigrant married and shot up San Bernardino with her husband, it wasn't terrorism.  It was only terrorism when a white "lone wolf terrorist" killed people.  Ah, but that was then, this is now.
A wasteful public inquiry that, irrespective of facts, will conclude the following: 1) White people are racist 2) Indians should get more money 3) White people are sexist.  Can't we just skip the inquiry and go straight the discussing the foregone conclusions?
Being white became a unifying agent for the folks that Europe didn't need or want. The easiest way to become white was to learn to fear and hate black folks. Of course, any racial minority will do in a pinch. This country has been a giant affirmative action program for white people. That also means that all lives don't matter here and never have. We still have a lot of work to do to become a "more perfect union". Trump is the preferred candidate of white racists so we won't get there in the next 4 years. They have re-entered public life with his election.
Hhhmm let me guess...white, male, uneducated, angry, world owes you a living...am I getting close?
On another point, there is a serious current increase in the manufacturing of Crystal Meth in NY.  Most offenders happen to be rural white residents.  This has resulted in numerous arrests and convictions of whites.  Can I infer some  racial issues  since those incarcerated for this specific drug offense happen to be white males?
So basically what your saying is you only want white people to immigrate to canada because your a racist and a bigot
Well Gary, If being tired of the ignorance those on the left constantly display and being annoyed by the lies they propagate defines me as a 'bigot' so be it... I don't see a genuine reason to buy into the term. As far as being a racist - NOT a chance. Most of the liberals we are hearing from during this election and post election time are the true racists. It isn't a 'black or white' thing anymore, it's gone far beyond that. For the RECORD - I care about the 2nd amendment and so do millions of other people... The CRAP about women being 'second class citizens' is just that. Trump has a great track record towards women, do some research and actually check it out instead of believing all the left wing garbage. Of course there are racists across our country - I'm betting more on the left than right. Every time i debunk some crap a left wing nut posts they end up calling me names - including racist - they don't seem to like the truth for some reason so using the 'R' word is their defense.
White people generally allow their police to abuse suspects of color, including with deadly force, when it is not required.  Police don't get a free pass anymore, or won't if white voters take the BLM demands to heart.
May I be so bold to suggest that the American political system is but a reflection of the intellectual and ethical debility of the white (supremacist) establishment that built and most benefits from it? Also, don't discount the role of doltish religion and its weak-minded adherents in the backwardness of the American political system. Its role is primary. Garbage in, garbage out.
At least there was a brown Corn Pop. Where were all the white Corn Pops? All the yellow Corn Pops represented Asians, and none represented Caucasians. Why were whites excluded?
Jeff Sessions is well known for judging people by the  color of their skin, and judging black Americans as unfit to share public accommodations, including public schools, with white people. Also Sessions is a shameless liar, claiming to have desegregated public schools. The content of his character isn't up to the standards Lynch upheld.
"Except for the racial element" --- my friend, you just answered why your point is incorrect about my thoughts pertaining to the 1%. And, being a Right-winger, you can't claim anything related to anti-Semitism, considering that Donnie Moscow has inspired the white knights to claim that Jews and other religions—along with many ethnicities—do not belong in white America.  Your points about Bezos and crew are off-base. You name a few of the "good guys", when the vast reality is that many of them are nothing but hedge-funders like Robert Mercer—men with undiagnosed gambling disorders—or they are techbros. Techbros are white guys who pride themselves on being an asshole like Steve Jobs, only techbros don't possess Job's God-given talent. These are fellas who open-source meaningless apps, then hold an IPO to get cash before the public realizes how useless it is. And tech is legendary for hating women and being racist. The people you seem to idolize do nothing for America.
All the terrorists that have threatened to kill me have been white Christians born and raised in the USA. Heck, some states even let the KKK, a Christian terrorist organization, adopt highways. Most of the Founding Fathers were slave owning rapists. This country was born in violence and racism and we have yet to correct those sins. See Trump and his minions. Sunday morning is still the most segregated time of the week in this country. As a nation we have no moral superiority over any other nation. Most Americans have no idea of how much rape, robbery, torture, and murder that they benefit from. They don't want to know. If we really fear Sharia law, why do we give so many weapons to Saudi Arabia where it is law. Trump recently crowed about the latest arms deal. Why arm the people so many of his voters fear? The truth is all lives don't matter here. They never have.
Trump is a super dumb ass mental case who will get all of us on this planet killed, or do it himself. Please white folks, come to your senses and choose another Great White Hope. We (brown and black folks) mean ya'lls no harm
Could it be a bit of misogynism, particularly among the white men over 50?
Sure, how about not navel gazing about how great it is to be white, and focusing on the real culprits here? The ANC kleptocracy, without whom KPMG would not have had any billable hours from our taxes.  Smart people can be bad. Diligent idiots, who mostly make up the journalistic profession, are the worst.
Are you a white person talking about what the black community thinks?  Go sit down. ALL the way down.
The fact is that the Trump regime is white supremacist Christian Republican extremists who hate everything our country stands for.
They don't care for this country. They are just so happy because they think he is going to be the Messiah of whites who will save them from immigrants,  Hispanics, Black and so on.
Harry, There you go again, changing the subject from Nazi-ism to reproductive rights. Read Erik's book "In the Garden of Beasts". You might learn something about the early 1930's  beginnings of this evil white nationalist movement.
1/ Now that is some major nonsense right there. Trump didn't need to explicitly endorse white supremacy to dog whistle to white supremacists. Lee Atwater's explanation of the Southern Strategy is helpful.  <blockquote> You start out in 1954 by saying, “Nigger, nigger, nigger.” By 1968 you can’t say “nigger”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “Nigger, nigger.”</blockquote>  https://www.thenation.com/article/exclusive-lee-atwaters-infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/  Neither did Trump personally have to have to "agree" for white supremacy to assume a central role in his campaign.
You do realize that all those revolutionary radicals and romanticized rebels, once they get a taste of real MONEY, basically become "Old, straight, white males" right???  Fidel, Carlos Slim, Robert Mugabe, Jacob Zuma, Hugo Chavez, etc etc etc...
You can thank the boy in the big house in DC for the 18 percenters and "pro-White" rally seekers hiding behind elitism and racism as though free speech is their defense.  Best possible case is find the rocks y'all crawled out from under and get to diggin!
You know who else thought statues venerating Confederates like Robert E Lee was a bad idea? Robert E Lee. He felt they would slow the healing process. Fast forward 150 and we have the KKK, neo-Nazis, and a segregationist president rallying around the monuments to white supremacy and treason under the guise of defending their "history and culture".   "I think it wiser not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered."  -- Robert E Lee  Trump and his white supremacist buddies are festering infected sores that Lee warned about.
this is wrong, this dude killed someone in tonga and should be tried for his crime.  he is subject to the laws of tonga.   just because he is white,  trump's government is protecting him, if he were black, he would be extradited immediately.  why should this murderer be allowed to go free and possibly kill others in America.  another racist conduct by trump.  hope he hangs so justice will be served.  so stupid.  tillerson is a joke just like Kelly who defamed a congresswoman and does no want to apologize,   what a coward.
I will spoil the outcome for you--the killers are Aboriginals-but the committee will lay blame on white society.
If it's a white killer, there is mental illness and the Orange headed fool tells us it is not a guns issue. If it is a brown killer, it is terrorism, we need to tighten the border, build a wall, increase security screening and ensure they don't bring in weapons. And make sure we all take off our shoes at the airport screening.... hopefully someone out there is registering this.
"Well, if you admire white nationalists, if you’re anti-immigrant, anti-trade, have a bigoted backstory and prefer an antediluvian judicial system, you too might want to join in on the tear-shedding."  The Globe editors are involved in Hate propaganda now.  Now anyone who doesnt agree with "big L" Liberalism or the Liberal party is automatically labelled a racist, a bigot or a as some who cuddles up with white nationalists ie. nazi skinheads.    Next time when someone shoots a Conservative politician in the US and Canada, Martin and the Globe should look in the mirror and ask if their words are fodder for people on the edge.  We need to keep our attacks focused on Policies and our words less inflammatory on all sides.
Oh. As long as the smartest people are white men, correct?
The idiot that started all this didn't do it because he has some "cause."  This is a guy who was raised by  white parents in a well to do home.  He was a mediocre player and he was going to get cut from the team so he decided to make a fuss to get his name out there.  He still got cut.  They tried to force teams to take him but no one wanted him.  So "the cause" was born and now they pay the price.  We don't care about your "cause" because of the way you went about shoving a non-issue in our faces.  Damage is done and there is no repairing it.  We can live without football.
There are so many things wrong with this article that I don't even know where to begin, this is truly a CNN level of fake news.   The rapes at the Swedish music festival were committed by immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, which is the reason police are investigating the immigrant connection. Muslim men have been committing huge numbers of rapes since Sweden made the mistake of admitting so many members of a 'rape culture' into their country.  As far as violence being committed against women and minorities every day by white men, the group most responsible for murdering black men in the US, by a wide margin, is other black men.   The wage gap is a myth. More men are raped every year than women. Far more men die every year in war, industrial accidents, murders and suicides than women. The 'testosterone empire' you're whining about really isn't a great advantage for men.  Yes, female-only screenings are sexist. Try having a male-only screening of Batman, and see how that goes.
The Comments reflect the effectiveness of the last 40 years of brainwashing against the evils of guvmint as defined by Republicans, DINOs, Fox News, Limbaugh, Fundamentalist Christian Televangelists, corporate media, etc.  All devoted to tearing down the very fabric of the governing system to return the nation into the racist, bigoted, conservative fists of the latest Robber Barons.  Billionaire Barons washing the brains with every technological means to completely redefine the vocabulary to turn black into white and lies into truth.  Haycox wrote the best summation of historical fact in recent memory, but the blinded fascist faithful deny, deny, deny with convoluted, illogical regurgitations of their Billionaire Baron agents.  Too late for this generation.  Looks like another Great Depression is the only event that will bring them and their progeny back to reality.  Or maybe just a Nuclear Winter.  Sad and disgusting.
In fact "Black Americans are twice as likely as white Americans to be unarmed when police kill them"  "Overall, police shot and killed 978 people in the yearlong period that immediately followed Kaepernick’s first protest, according to the Post. Black Americans made up roughly 21 percent of the victims"  Since Blacks are just 13% of the population, clearly they are being killed at a disproportionate rate. And let me remind you of the skin color of the Las Vegas shooter, Dylan Roof, Timothy McVeigh, the Sandy Hook shooter, the Columbine shooters..............  Yes, police are targeting black men and they are being killed at a disproportionate rate no matter how you want to spin it.  Get real.
Sad thing here is that Bannon was not pushed out for his affiliation with white supremacy and what happened this weekend.   But more because Donnie was butthurt that Bannon was talking to the press in the way that made Two Scoops very upset and jealous.   Again, it could have been very easy for Donnie to make amends here.   He could call a press conference, announce that he renounces the "both sides" garbage, also very clearly acknowledge HIS ROLE in the rise of these racist trolls coming out of the woodwork, and taking off their hoods, and saying awful things in public. Then he could apologize for his behavior both as "president" and on the campaign trail, and then, as a good faith indicator that he won't be doing it in the future, announce that he is firing Bannon, Gorka, Miller, and Sessions.    But....this is Donnie. He probably cannot even see how wrong he is, and why people are abandoning him...
False equivalency.  Nazi skin-heads are not a protected class.  Now, if the baker refused service simply because the person was white, that would make it a discrimination case.  And if that had happened, you folks would be screaming "bloody murder."  No one is forced to do anything.  That baker CHOSE to go into business and serve the public.  And in so doing, he agreed to abide by laws governing his business.  It is that simple.
Not at all...the "progressive" left hates documents that name the Creator as the the origin of our rights since they believe in no God higher than the state. The only people concerned with white supremacists are idiots who watch CNN and have been convinced by the fake news there's a monolithic problem when in reality a few irrelevant bumpkins are all that's left of the KKK. The Russia narrative died a slow and painful death and now "White Supremacy" is the new buzz phrase of the so-called "resistance". All hogwash.
They're ugly white nazis. What's more to know? Maybe having their names out there will prevent the next mosque shooting.
Carl Bernstein, along with the rest of the cia tools at cnn, which include chris cuomo, don lemon, anna navarro need to be rounded up by old white men which have employed russian agents with tarp dollars that appear at these clowns home and take them along with their families up and down the gene chain and one by one tortured publicly, humiliated, slaughtered and then their corpses desecrated and then fed to animals.
"white trash"! Wow! If black was substitute for white the term would be seen as racist. But then again only whites can be racist, right?
"White silence is violence". Riiiight.
"Don't be ignorant! This was caused by a third force! Those white capitalists funded by the CIA. The ANC is as united as ever and will govern until Jesus comes. Umshini Wam!"
Oh my god!!!! A politician told the truth He should have remembered that it is only permissible to bad mouth or truthfully point out bad things about white people
This has nothing to do with sexism, but observation! I saw it yesterday and I was pissed. When I see it, it is mostly a young white woman - however, this past weekend, I did see a young Asian woman do the same.  From what I've seen, it is the women who are the biggest violators. I've seen guys do it also, but 80% of the time, it is a woman. I call it as I see it.
No mention of the race of those involved? Any bets the shooter is black and the cop white?  Because if it were the other way around, guaranteed race would be highlighted. Lets see if I am wrong.
We're talking about black on black and white on white crime here, genius. And the rate for white on white crime is higher than black on black crime. Why do you get so butthurt about simple facts?
Not sure why Columbus is celebrated.   The dummy thought he was in Asia,  never set foor on what became the United States,  either.   Closest he came was south America.  Take down his stupid statues, erase the holiday, and teach history accurately.   Put up Lief Erickson statues of you insist on the first white guys here.
What else would you expect from miniature human & racist southern troglodyte Sessions? He's a 1st class racist, KKK lap-dog, Trumpanzee and massive coward. I' sure he spends half his paid time sucking on Dondi's appendage & his back door. This gang of filth is ruining this once-great nation...racism, white supremacy, hate, bigotry, lies & bleached-hair orange homos, the gang is repulsive & pathetic. I hope they all are tortured & lynched in public. Hang 'em high!
You wrote:  <<How could you have thought for even a split second that I was under a "professional duty" to go around to public schools warning kids about the consequences of federal crack charges?>>  It seems like an utterly reasonable assumption to me. You think educating the public about the law is outside your professional sphere? Uh, OK.  You wrote:  <<But you assume that I and the great majority of whites need to be reminded that black lives matter. As I said, that in itself is a hateful, racist charge.>>  BS!! Racism is a profound social problem, and many white people are simply in denial or indifferent about it. So yes, it's important to note that black lives matter. You seem confused about what racism is, and your insistence that BLM is ratcheting up racial tensions is histrionic. Maybe to white guys who think it's "racist" to point out that black lives matter. What exactly do you expect black people to do when they're treated as second-class citizens? Just sing the blues?
.  Hitler/Nazi supporters and racist white supremacists. These people are legally allowed to march (armed) through the streets of America? Because of free speech?   If they call on their supporters (as they often do) to kill all Jews and destroy the State of Israel, is that free speech as well?  .
Given that men back a form of media that dehumanises us, shows us enjoying violent attacks on our genitals cloaked as 'sex' and promotes gang attacks, rape and paedophilia, i think women are right to point out how being objectified, ie stripped of our humanity, effects us and our ability to live our lives. White men are used to keeping women, children and poc down by the judicious use of threats and violence, often covered up as humour. Without looking at the wider picture of male violence against women and children you are deliberately taking this comment out of context in order to strip it of its nature, ridiculing a human by comparing her to a sexualised doll.
How's this, "Lars?":  From Stormfront again:  "Annnnd guess where Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche works? The 100% jew run Cadmus group they are city state government contractor for the EPA and Homeland Security. So there ya have it folks a jew disguised as a rainbow buddhist actually works for an environmental company and Homeland Security contractor met his just domain at the hands of a White American druggie ex con jailhouse philosopher, who defended himself against 3 assailants. That's Portland, they wanted multiculturalism, they got it, this will long be remembered as the day Keep Portland weird, was no longer funny."  "Here's a pic of Talisen Myrrddin Namkai Meche feelin' the Bern:" --- Got that,  "Lars?"    The "jew" ...met his just domain.   Killed by a... "White...who defended himself against 3 assailants."  Who also killed a vet "Homeland Security contractor."  See?  Your buds think the two deserved to die at the hands of this Trump supporter.  Any more questions, "Lars?"
Anyone well educated that has any intellectually honesty will not be voting for Hillary.  Given the choice between a businessman with a rodent on his head (the unqualified and racist tags are nothing more than regurgitated media lines) and a liar who can't be trusted, give me the business person.  Trust the polls, not just yet.  The white trash inbreed thing, wow.
You're so spot on Sylvia! Like that recent event where the leftist ran his car into a crowd of peaceful white supremacists, killing one and injuring many others.
Young treats his constituents like garbage -- you got that right.  So why do a majority of his constituents who voted vote for Alaska's premier trash-collector?  For the same reason they voted for Donald Trump --they like, really really like, mean, old, ignorant white men.
The only racist I see in this sordid affair is Jamele Hill.  She is another example of someone raised by haters. The chip on her, and others like her, are enormous.  Who will she blame this on one, when just a few days ago, she was chastised for similar racist comments.  The moral of this?  Racism rears its ugly head everywhere. Not just by white people!
The 2nd Amendment is a white privilege. Black folks are shot on the mere suspicion of being armed. That includes black children.
Please explain why, when it's a white perp, it's a mental health issue, but when it's a non white, the perp should be sent to Guantanamo. It looks like a colour divide to me.
The religious nutjobs and greedy pigs in the party want to increase immigration, keep pushing it all in the face of how destructive it has become to our quality of life. Insanity. That is what this is about, not white supremacy which is not a problem here, but putting foreigners first, that is what is going on - missionary christians and greedy corporate profiteers.  Not a recipe for social cohesion at all.
"Bannon damaged his standing by giving an interview to the liberal American Prospect this week in which he was seen to be undercutting Trump's position on North Korea."  Missing here is the OTHER comment made by Bannon that undercut some of Trump's base support.  Bannon called Neo-Nazis and white supremacists "clowns" in the same interview, I believe. THAT might have been the tipping point.    About Bannon blithely stating he'll go back to Breibart?  Hmm, maybe.  Perhaps he won't be welcome there, either.  Not for his ideological beliefs, necessarily, but simply because, in his absence, the website's management has "moved on" so to speak, and he's simply not wanted on the voyage. What an irony that would be.
Why come here if you hate white people so much? Funny how everyone wants to come to White nations though isn't it! I mean Mexico for Mexicans, India for Indians, China for Chinese, Japan for Japanese, ME for Arabs but White Nations for everyone?? Your anti white hatred shows? Why come here if you don't like music, pork, beer seeing women dressed normal, dogs? There is lots of room in the ME for you. Oh I know why they come here, it's for the welfare! I do miss the old days of European migrants who worked their butts off and made this country great! Built this country, defended this country against that dictator you seem to associate us with. You are anti white, please leave you aren't good enough for Canadian values, why don't we let smart hardworking Latino's or Asians in ?
The alt-left is the huffpo, little green footballs, elizabeth Warren/Bernie Sanders crowd.  They are the modern movement of the communist ideals.  They are many times larger than the white supremacists in VA and far more dangerous.
Tell you what, when white women form the The Right Ladies, we can vilify and openly mock them. Deal?
This editorial is spot on. Folks, we fought a war against white nationalists. I was curious as to what was being chanted in Charlottesville. I watched the HBO special called Race and Terror. If all I heard were the chants it would've been enough. However, the white nationalists that were interviewed claimed Jews and black people must be kicked out of the Nation. They firmly stated that our Nation was built for white people.  Only they made our Nation great. I've read portions of Mein Kampf. These people mimicked the words I read.  I guess our WWII veterans were alt-left. Ridiculous. It has nothing to do with left or right. It's simply right and wrong. Trump was horribly, horribly wrong. No good people marched with the Klan, white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville. I expect others to counter-march and not tolerate this BS. Let me tell you I'm a senior citizen and I know Nazis when I see them. We lost too many good warriors in WWII to let this disgrace go unnoticed.
They ( liberals ) are trying to destroy our freedom by divide and conquer. They are implementing racism on all sides where there is none. Did anyone notice its white liberals doing this? They are stoking the fires of racism to gain votes for the democratic party. The democrats, antifa, are pimping the black man to do their bidding. They are using you. They are using us all. They are practicing the same technique they have used to topple governments all over the world DIVIDE, AND CONQUER. Unity is their worst enemy, and the media is their machine gun.
Black Lives Matter is a pile of garbage that is reportedly saying its members feel unsafe around cops and so the cops have to go way.  Apparently the irony is lost on them, that what they are reportedly saying towards cops is historically what white folks were saying about black folks in the southern states...  ... don't feel safe around you, you have to go away.  So much for inclusion. Black Lives Matter is comparable to the Klan.
How long can we play the "blame whitey" game?  This is getting ridiculous.  Will any of them ever take blame for being horrible parents?
Why are papers like the Toronto Star failing. Maybe because they have been hijacked by radical feminists and anti-white militant.
The sad part is most black people in Baltimore won't do a thing to stop the violence due to being hypocrites. They burned down a portion of the city for a crack dealer (Freddie Gray) when the alleged perpetrators were white, but when black street thugs break into a black US veteran's home and execute him, it's no big deal and just another day in Bodymore, Murderland. No progress will be made until the black community drops the "us vs them" attitude and starts holding their own people accountable for their crimes.
Interesting dynamic emerging.  The Bully is getting bullied back.  When that occurs, it tends to mean the end of the Bully.  Clearly, America, and thankfully, the GOP leadership, will not follow Trump's lead and try to downplay or cover for the White Supremacist movement.  My compliments to the men and women of conscience holding positions of leadership in America, who have stood to condemn White Supremacy, White Nationalists, Neo-nazis, KKK, etc.  Are you watching your TV, Mr. President?  Take notes.  True American Leadership is on display, while you hide behind your in some cases anonymous, cowardly and "loser" (as well, alarmingly as potentially White Supremacist) spokespersons.
Trump has been around this long only because he’s a white guy with tons of white privilege. He should have been gone a long time ago, especially after screaming “tell ‘em to go f**k themselves” at a campaign and bragging about being able to grab women by their pu**y because he’s rich and famous.
my pastor says they go on white girl rape frenzies.
If anyone, including those in the NHL don't want to be involved in the political ridiculousness, that is there choice. They are athletes. To say that Matthews is white privilege and he never experienced hardship, well you don't know if that's true. While he might not have gone through what Black people do, he may have had to deal with something else. As many people of all races do. I am for what Kapernick stands for. But I am also for everyone. Everyone is shooting everyone. Everyone is scared of everyone. And Trump has instilled more of a hate culture. And remember this idiot was voted in! As was another infamous dictator who instilled hate.

"As George says....ignore the white nationalist and nazi protesters."  Yeah, I'm sure it is SO easy for Blacks and other minorities to just ignore the white nationalists and Nazis. Like really, what is their problem?  /sarc
here's another Fine Democrat for you today: http://www.opslens.com/2017/08/14/when-the-left-eats-its-own-white-female-gov-candidate-shouted-down-in-georgia/ Basically:  Protesting a Democratic White Woman candidate for the same seat, #trustblackwomen  it's sad, seeing Democrats condoning racism within their Racist Party
Thank God you are here Syringa.  These cis heterofascist white males are always making grammar errors and that TRIGGERS me!
Except his statement starts with black and white law - that is not the gospel starting point; even for a bishop.  We are Christ-centric; build our church on relationships before we start *dis-inviting* people.  Sorry, a known public pronouncing racist is very different from folks in a gay marriage - your comparison alone is contemptible.
One would think, given Bush's racist and other regressive policies, that Michelle Obama could not bare being in the presence of Bush. The Work Farce - oh dear, I certainly hope Michelle did not "bare" in the presence of Bush Oh these Democrats - Bush was racist? only racist" Not neo-Nazi white supremacist ???
Black lives matter is a pile of dung or do you actually think cops don't beat up people of other skin colors?  If black lives matter then perhaps they should try to educate their children more and take on leadership positions.  How you would feel about a 'white lives' matter campaign. Yeah, that's right.
You mean something like "white power"? She probably did. The alt-right seems to have an affinity for knives this week. That's what happens when you mix meth with hate and ignorance.
O.M.G. nine temporary jobs picking ornamental shrubs have been snatched (from brown skinned people) and opened up for all those (mostly white) men cluttering up Eugene's downtown area, freeing them from harassing the envied employed class who dread encountering them.  Way to go P***Y Grabber in Chief, ICE is awesome.
Move on people, nothing to see. By the end of the day, the MSM will blame this on Trump and white supremacists. What where they thinking putting a statue of a Basque separatist in the middle of La Ramblas.
No, YOUR posts have been ranting about white people and "white supremacy" over a case about a Latino cop. You cried "murder" and provided no evidence. All you have done is parrot neo-Marxist narratives which came from Critical Race Theory circles.  You have SERIOUS racism issues. I'd love to see you rationalize how it's racist to assume is a criminal for being black but it's not racist to assume someone is being a racist if they're white, or even a brown cop.  You have issues. Big time.
So you agree that black children should be killed. I got it. So much for innocent until proven guilty. That is a white privilege too.
does anyone know how many times these two berated their buddy obama for not condemning the hate group blm when they made videos on youtube calling for the deaths of white cops and burning our flag and a callout to kill whitey?
Mental midgets think that the chain saw is the only answer to forest health.  But forests were doing extremely well until white men and chain saws came along.  Stephen J. Remington
I very much disagree with your assertions that tRump and his supporters embrace the ideals of America.   I, liberal lefty, embrace tolerance, the idea of America as the place of opportunity - including migrants, morality (tRump clearly defies any moral teaching and his supporters support that), education, science, creativity, responsibility to take of care our own and responsibility to the rest of the world etc etc etc- NONE of which tRump or his supporters embrace.  Your tRump America is one of hate and division and blaming the other - making America hate and trying to make America white - not making America great. So, do not tell me I am wrong because I am not. The divisiveness is spewed from tRump, his supporters and the GOP and has been since Newt in the 1990s.  Personally, I thought that while Hillary didn't show the best judgement, she is right that the deplorable Americans support tRump  - just like the deplorable Germans supported Hitler.  How is that for a response?
Yes, I used it. I'm not blaming anyone for anything, just pointing out your hypocrisy for calling me out on it while you have nothing to say about the protestor. You also called me out for racism, but my only mention of race was the white woman driver. I think you're just wanting to post something so you can write "cheeto face von clownstick and the handful of deplorable miscreants," sort of like Beavis and Butthead.
I'm a staunch, hardcore dirty stinking anarchist feminist weirdo (also a straight, white cismale, for the record). I hate AVFM and the entire disgusting MRA/PUA/MGTOW misogynist circlejerk. Their efforts to downplay and minimize the harm society still does to women is utterly heinous.  But I have a bit of an issue with the tone of some of this article because I feel that it supports behaving in a similarly crappy way to how a lot of anti-feminists behave. If a group wants to start men-only shelters, who cares? If they're not obstructing women's shelters or other useful projects, I don't see an issue. Yes, their rhetoric is misleading. And yes, their stats are incorrect compared to more recent sampling. So we can criticize that.  It's just rather noxious to me when a group that is purporting to do good (misguided, perhaps, but hey, there might actually be a need for a male shelter) gets obstructed. Let's let them create a shelter. Let's support positive acts, k?
"We've seen criminal photos of blacks and Pacific Islander adults wanted or accused of felony crimes."  But we never see photos of white adults wanted or accused of felony crimes. LOL!!  Now crawl back in your hole racist.
It's unfortunate an unsavory group such as the KKK has been associated with those against the removal of a statue depicting a brilliant Confederate general and Virginia native son. But their meager ranks,  estimated between 5,000 and 8,000 nation wide and extreme racists are not representative of the true reason to let Lee's statue remain. Vietnam is often described by African-Americans as a "white man's war", having made up of 12.6 percent of the soldiers in country. I guess the next effort will be to eliminate all monuments dedicated to that conflict. Absolutely ridiculous.
isn't  a  feminist   either  a  rich   white  woman married  or  divorced  from a  rich  white  man or  a  hairy  legged, manless  lesbian?  Certainly  looks  that  way  to  me.
What a hypocrite. She is just as responsible for any genocide as every non-indigenous person currently alive in Canada. She is living on 'stolen land' and enjoying the benefits of previous generations of immigrants as much as anyone else. She should move somewhere where no person has every stepped foot and live off the land. Her attitude is not surprising given our education system indoctrinates our youth in code that all the ails of the world are due to white Christians. A white person making similar rants about people of brown skin color would be expelled from the university to great fanfare.
I agree that Lee was doing his duty and was an honourable man. However, the guys trying to stop the removal of his statue aren't interested in that, they are interested in a form of white control of the South and having the black people put back in their places.
“where people can feel comfortable to speak freely.”  That's code for white males to keep quiet.
Yeah, 500 wounded, 59 dead and this is not the time to wonder when it is my turn , my families and friends turn to be out in and killed by one man from a hotel window on the upper floor story. Now if it was a Muslim terrorist who killed 59 Americans and shot up another 500 while praying to Allah and seeking all those virgins after he committed suicide you would be with the rest of the wingers and Trump saying "I told you so"  and using this event for the biggest Ant-Muslim campaign since 9/11 and turn it on from all news media outlets and twitter before the bodies of the victims were even removed. In fact some right wing news media started on the Muslim terrorists attack when the event was still going on. They were hoping... it was not some old rich white since dude that does not play into their narrative.
We do have white racists, the big problem is that we have millions of black racists, also, who are calling out white racists, and are on the streets, every day,  proving that fact! Perhaps if it were only one race with racism,  we may be able to find a solution but, that is not the case!!
Freeheels, and Brills, what real name these folks live annonymously while being 18th century. First off Jack of trades is the senator is an American African, not an African American. For us constitutional idiots in the world, streets run two ways. The problem you have a white reporter, slim of the earth, Trump even hates them more than all the others on his list. Reporting the American victim s crime, I was assaulted by A minority, that is old as slavery, no. #1 in my America. Cops and you are quick to beieve Blacks folks kidnap, or do whatever the white host alleged, pure American horse manuer, won't see a white reporter aledge that of  trump or any white guys. Not a contest, equals out, so they throw those out. But mighty funny the agitator (reporter) is poking a senator, A minority is right. The last American African senator, that let aguy get really close and pray with him and others membrs at church was killed.  Dillion roof after prayer executed nine God loving, fearing folks.
Why ? I'm sure Muslim men would be just as butthurt as you white brodudes.
Chrisin, that was a truly a idiotic rambling of nothing. You are correct this is not a left leaning country, Hillary is. What are you upset about??? I bet you are just ranting against the white man...
I agree with Dung Saunders.  White people are to blame.
The history of this state began about 15,000 years ago, according to current evidence.  All but the last millimeter or two of that long timeline belongs to Native peoples--who didn't subscribe to your Boys' Life myth about "rugged individualists hacking a life out of the wilderness."  Traditional Native communities believed (and to some extent still believe today) that survival is a shared enterprise.  A man was proud to share his good fortune with the group; equally, a man stayed with his group during hard times.  He didn't run off and take care of his own ass while they suffered.  You whites may do it differently, but I can't see that you've got much to brag about.  Your budget deficit, after all, was made by your own stupid and greedy every-man-for-himself white politics, not according to Native values.
The righteous ALT LEFT will eradicate fascist inbred redneck white supremacists like cockroaches. We will hunt them down like pigs and lynch them in our town squares and cities. We will gut them as they emerge from their backwoods swamps. Be warned white supremacist/nationalist scum. We will kill you and burn down your homes and destroy you and your families. The righteous ALT LEFT will cut your filthy throats in your homes in fort of your children.
What the White Supremacists were doing wasn't "free speech"; it was terrorism.  I too support free speech, but not terrorism.  Take a seat in the back of that dark theater and when someone screams, "Fire", talk to me about free speech.
Anyone who doesn't understand what was wrong with Trump's "condemnation" is part of the problem. The white supremacists took Trump's words as encouragement and support for what they are doing. That was intentional. It would have been easy for Trump to condemn then in no uncertain terms, no ambiguity, he chose not to. If you're defending or excusing Trump on this, you are aligned with the Nazis.
So I get what you're saying if more blacks kill other blacks then it's okay if everybody does it too. This wasn't  a hate crime but whites will still take this opportunity to paint all black as bad. But that's what y'all been doing hating on blacks 😂
The White Supremacist, KKK and Nazis were not there to protest the removal of the statue.  I don't recall Robert E. Lee or the civil war involving Jews, as in the "we won't be replaced by Jews" and other related epithets shouted by by the "protesters" of statue removal.
This past weekend I saw on television footage of a woman marching against fascism and racial intolerance.  She was carry a sign that said, "White People Suck."  Which "side" do you think she was on?
The best way we can help is to continuously  question the idiots in Washington DC - their interests, their motives, their objectives   For if they hadn't armed the rebels in Syria - there would not be an unending war there  Had they not bombed Libya and removed Qaddafi from power the arms flowing from that country would have never reached the rebels in the middle east (including ISIL)    Had they not  invaded Iraq  over a decade ag while lying to the american public about WMD they might have the  world on their side  And had they  not continuously provoked Putin in his own backyard he might actual be working with them to find  a lasting solution  Without the idiots in Washington DC there would be no victims for the white helmets to rescue  Name ONE Muslim state that has attacked the United States of America. Name One.  Now count how many Muslims America has killed, assassinated, declared collateral damage, targeted,  tortured, bombed, shelled, annihilated
3D says, "why don't white people realize that".  Really 3D? The majority of Polynesian-Hawaiians want the TMT, as well as Japanese, Chinese, Portugues, and all others. Your hatred of "white" people is showing.
I think the fact that he didn't look up the crime stats speaks to my point: He was just writing a blog post about his daily life in an era where people did that. It wasn't hateful and the whole point was that he was ignorant and conditioned to be irrationally afraid. He was recognizing his own flawed judgement about a situation. Isn't that the journey we're supposed to be on? In the five years since, he's posted about recognizing his own white privilege.
Wow... what a stupid response. The challenge was to find examples of Christians committing the same amount of attacks as Muslims, you mainly posted about white people.. not only is your comment far reaching but also slightly racist against white people. For example- you pointed to Sandy Hook. Was he white- yes. Christian? No... that is equivalent to me saying that a black man shooting someone is a Muslim attack. And shall we compare death tolls to your examples vs the daily attacks in the name of Islam? While I was writing this post, several people were probably murdered in the name of Islam for offenses such as apostasy or homosexuality. Do yourself a favor and start paying attention to the REAL concern of Islamic terrorism. Also, read the Quran a bit.. then study the history of Muhammed, a man who beheaded many, many people and also married a 6 year old girl. Then ask yourself why you are defending this religion.
Oooh found the white guy who hates chicks and brown guys.
The more you enable and defend and coddle and run interference for them, the more the white nationalists and nazis will feel at home in your party.   The Republican party's complicity is ushering in the next generation of hateful white supremacists and bigots and giving them legitimacy. Trump is the hero of the white nationalist movement for a reason. And he never fails to deliver.   The mainstream Republican Party's stance on fawning monuments to treasonous anti-black white supremacist Confederate is the exact same as the klan and nazi stance. That's why they were in Charlottesville, that's why they branded their rally "Unite the Right". Republicans in North Carolina even passed a law making it illegal for local jurisdictions to remove traitorous white supremacist Confederate monuments.   That's why nazis feel at home in the Republican party. You guys own this.
Only in your Fox News/Limbaug/Spicer mindset as millions peacebly hit the streets while Rent-A-Cops assault same peace protestors and illegally round up those not involved in any violence or vandalism just like Nazi Germany.  Your usual attempt to redefine the very term fascist to divert from the evil of the Republican tried-and-true lifetime fascists.  Canadian White Supremacist slaughters Islamic prayers while Fox News tries to put the blame on a bystander.  The same lies and deceit found throughout the White Supremacist, Fundamentalist Christian/Catholic government of Der Neo-Fuhrer Trump.  The rights of the people to peaceably assemble will not be denied by any law.  This fascist administration and Congress has already violated all of their oaths of office to defend all of the U.S. Constitution.  Crawl back into the bunker, dolt.
SATs and ACTS are actually racist and biased.  They are predictors of whiteness.
The article completely leaves out the fact that Ms. Khan used profanity and ethnic slurs in addition to her comments about 'white fragility'.  The standard here has been set several time before at universities that have had similar problems with white idiots who have acted similarly. The students in those cases have been expelled from university. Anything short of that treatment for Ms. Khan will be discriminatory.
"The police acted stupidly." - BHO    My grandmother was a typical white person." - BHO  Barack Hussein Obama is the most divisive president in the history of America.
Guess you have no problem with the black drug gangs. the huge number of Hispanic gangs, etc.  Any thoughts on your kind anarchists, bigots attacking innocent citizens because they support Repubs/Consv, rioting, burning, looting, etc. You're ignorant enough to talk about white nationalist??  Plsssss walk down parts of Chicago, DC, Detroit, Oakland, LA and see who comes out to meet and greet!!  Plssssss, you're the type that richly deserves to come face to face with real hate, racism & bigotry!!
Geez Ms. Harrop, aren't you a bit late to the party?  Like REALLY late?  Mainstream media have spent a TON of time minimizing and excusing the behavior of drug addicts in general, both white and black and brown etc.  I agree this is a matter of a pregnant drug addict being stupid and paying the ultimate cost for her stupidity.  And for those who might come trotting along to decry the judgmental nature of your column and my comment, let me point out that this woman was the perfect example of how nothing is going to help these addicts until they help themselves...this woman was court ordered into treatment which she promptly ignored.  In other words, you can lead an addict to treatment but you can't make them participate.
Check his criminal history take a look at his Facebook. And I said gangsta wanna be, I've lived that lifestyle and was lucky enough to get out with my life while some friends were not. Its pretty easy to spot. And I called that stupid white kid in the valley that murdered that 16 yo the same thing. But I would assume that you like to try to shame people from your high horse and sanctimonious accusations. Do us all a favor and go back to the states
Last year 16 tds, 4 int, 2,241 yards, 90.7 qb rating.  I'd take him over what we have now in a heartbeat.  Too bad Elway and the rest of the owners are right-wing dingbats who cater to dumb rednecks and white racists.
Even though a non christian, I believe in what goes around, comes around. I believe true justice, is to have everyone of the haters of President Barak Obama's skin color, come back as blacks, to experience what happens when stupid and littleminded prejudice rage filled self rightous indignation, fills ones life with deliberate suffering, oppression and death. All of us have to stand in front of our Creator's, whatever race we are, or what we believe. If I go to the whitemans hell, so be it, but, many of you all will surely be there also.
The photo for the medical show has a female health care professional earnestly guiding a female medical student wearing head cover.  It looks like the show is boldly going where no politically correct show has gone since...  ... Little Mosque on the Prairie.  But am I correct to assume that they cast a white man as the moron who tore all his fingers off while drunkenly snowmobiling or something?
White supremecy is a "political viewpoint" now????  What am I reading hear!  And why are you trying to defend it?  If these defenses continue it simply gives the impression that the right = white supremecy.  Is that what you want?  You guys should be distancing yourselves from these people.  Do you know realize what a political loser this tact is?
an inexperienced government in Ottawa panicking already and Trump is not in the white house until January. What a bunch of fools we sent to Ottawa.
you are hating on Amy like she is a feral cat owner. what she said was what was already being said in the media, so bfd. so many lame cowards who lost to trump and can't attack him so they go for soft target like Amy.  you live and breed hate for all Caucasians  christians and especially white males.
Yeah as if Agent Orange gives a hoot. Only if it supports his white supremacist, racist agenda.
In light of the election of Thatcher, we can safely conclude that English men are not as biased or chauvinistic as the american male, who is rightfully subject to generalization and ridicule.  If only white males in "murika" were not all cap wearing truck driving stereotypes.
How dumb are they. They're trained and paid to perform for rich 1% whites. Like race horses.
Why involve the fat guy with the tie? Doesn't matter which side takes to the streets. Get suited up, (Don't forget to protect your head) bring the appropriate weapon and see who prevails. Tyrants of any breed are likely to be cowards. The skin color isn't important. It's always a pleasure to see some jughead go down, regardless of who they might hate. Everybody likes to see some fascist dummy hit the deck, be he black, white, gay or straight. In the meantime, get armed. Could be anybody coming for you soon.
How many times does trump have to condemn  David Duke, the KKK, and White supremacist before you guys are happy?  10 times?  100 times?  1000 times?  Look, there is a lunatic fringe on the right and a lunatic fringe on the left.  That is all the Trump is saying.  There has been non-stop violence from the lunatic fringe on the left every since Trump was elected.  If you are being honest I'm sure you will agree.   There was a lunatic on the right who decided to drive his car into a crowd and kill someone.  Violence tends to happen when multiple hate groups from the lunatic fringe decide to show up to the same protest.
everytime i point out hate speech - my comment gets removed. and, this "Bobby Groth"  poster spews white supremacist rants and puts up white supremacists symbols for targeting Jews for harassment etc and goes unremoved.        this is a pretty special community...newspaper and commenting forum.
In Canada the most acts of vandalism are still directed at the Jewish population although cases of vandalism of mosques is growing. Overt acts and words of intolerance are felt by a number of visible minorities including aboriginals, blacks, Sikhs, Muslims and Asians. Those bigoted acts however seldom reach a level which could be described as terrorism. Our white Christian majority is far from perfect but there is no comparison to attacks by Muslim extremists in Europe and the UK, attacks on Coptic Christians in Egypt or the more numerous attacks on Muslims by Muslims in the mid east and Africa. So far Muslims are much safer than blacks in the US or aboriginal women in Canada or Christians in Egypt. We should be ashamed of small acts of bigotry but let's not pretend that a single death in London totally counter balances all the deaths on 9/11 or throughout Europe in recent years.
Laugh all you want but I'm serious.  Most of us are not white and this election has shown we are no longer welcome in America (and perhaps never really were).  For us, soon-to-be president Trump is a safety issue.  Trump is a racist and his alt-right soon-to-be appointees are worse.  Trump is also a real estate mogul and he'd like nothing more than to whitewash Hawaii of all its minorities and claim our remaining land for himself and his friends and as president he will have the power to enact martial law and turn the sizable military already here against us and do just that.  We need to take the threat Trump poses seriously and we need to seriously think about leaving America.
"old white guy" huh?  Extreme intolerant bigotry duly noted.
"Trump’s national security choices reinforce his unapologetic views on terrorism "  "F" Trump - he's not my President!  We've got enough racists here all ready - we don't need one in the White House!  As far as I'm concerned, from here on out, the Federal Government has no authority - smoke that bubba (Sen Jeff Sessions looms large - Boy)  How many women will Trump appoint; no women seem to be on any of his lists?.  How many African Americans, indigenous Americans or any other "skins"  that are not White will Trump appoint to high office?   Brace yourselves folks - there's a "new," actually an old,  world coming.
Or the millions of American white trash criminals with citizenship
This article is poorly written, poorly researched, offensive, and completely out of touch with any kind of reality. As a millenial graduate student and state government employee, you're saying I can get what I need in housing, which is apparently turned down for 3 auto loans and living with 4 other people in a poorly maintained house in a poor black neighborhood, displacing folks who have lived here for generations and are less well off than I, commuting by bike and bus because I can't afford a car? Really?  Interesting how the comments on this article have to be civil, but the article doesn't. Thanks for being insulting and for your classist, ageist, wealthy old white guy perspective. Must have been nice being able to afford a house before you hit 30.
Arvin Kangas should be charged for 1st degree murder. He didn't pull the trigger but he set the stage and responded in a way that led to the intentional murder of two of Alaska's finest troopers. Right now in California Charles Manson rots in prison after programming four proteges to commit horrific murders in the name of shaking things up. I can't but think after the elements of this trial came out that the good people of Tanana, the LEOs who knew the law and most importantly the District Attorney's office( I know that they have had transitions during the interim of when this crime happened) would allow Arvin Kangas to get by with committing murder. He programmed that boy with anti-white hate and seated within him a great fear of law enforcement officers. He knowingly pulled the trigger by making those troopers wait and subdue him while his son acted in a predicted way. Nathanial Kangas is a murderer. But Arvin Kangas is also a murderer.
"In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest, most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied." Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  It has been proven by research, studies, and law enforcement stats that white men are at the top of the list for child rape and child sex killings. White men also commit the most heinous crimes of any group in the country, serial killings being at the top, studies show.  Need more kool-aid?
I do not  support mr. bryson either....But the "White trash" talk is racism. Can you imagine the howeling and knashing of teeth if we referred to some of our lovely young Black Criminals as  just "Poor Black Trash"?
Laughing. You think you are destroying me with reality.  Your video required someone else to do the thinking for you and then you attempted to label me a racist(or just as dumb as one) all the while attempting to make the not-nazis look bad when they were being beaten by nazis.  Again, keep those goalposts on wheels you are going to need them as much as you are wheeling them around.  You can call me a racist or stupid as one, but I am the one that is calling names? You assume I am a white male and yet I am the one calling names and judging.  Man, you need to stay away from mirrors.  Tell us more about how mean those people were to the nazis. Tell us how mean they were to people who's stated goal is the death of large swaths of the American public.  Oh wait, you won't. You will just ignore all this, pick one thing then attempt to vilify me on it. The only thing worse than right wing hate, is right wing haters and the completely predictable patterns they do when posting.
"A Muslim might refuse to something for a patron because of the fact that alcohol is served..." Actually, that is exactly the sort of thing that will be allowed to occur if the baker wins this case.  "...then what about if you owned a bakery and a white supremacist was holding a gathering for other white supremacists and ordered a cake for the gathering, you would be required to fulfill his request. How would you feel about that?" If they wanted a run-of-the-mill birthday cake, then yes, I would provide that item.  If they wanted a cake decorated that said "kill all the filthy Jews", then I would explain that I find that objectionable, but would be willing to sell them the cake and the materials with which to decorate the cake.  I'd side with the baker if the latter was the situation (the couple wanted the cake decorated in a manner that the baker found objectionable).  If the couple went in and wanted #17 from the wedding cake catalog, then what the baker did was discrimination.
That's a bit misleading. 1000 open investigations into domestic terror, including SOME of which were white supremacists. There was Obama's buddy, Bill Ayers.
The old white "fat boy".
CSIS highlights white supremacist threat ahead of radical Islam  Citing recent academic research, the unclassified documents note extreme right-wing and white supremacist ideology has been the “main ideological source” for 17 per cent of so-called lone wolf attacks worldwide.  Islamic extremism accounted for 15 per cent of such attacks, the document noted, while left-wing extremism and “black power” groups followed with 13 per cent. Anti-abortion activism (8 per cent) and nationalism/separatism (7 per cent) rounded out the list, while in 40 per cent of cases there was no clear ideological motivation.  "The threat from the far right in Canada is real," Ryan Scrivens, one of the new report's authors and PhD candidate at Simon Fraser University, told VICE News. "It doesn't get the same kind of attention and publicity that Islamic extremist groups get, but they have, historically, done more damage in Canada."
"Trump advocated divisive politics of identity — he raised racial and ethical tensions and inflamed passions against imagined enemies — Mexican immigrants, Chinese exporters, Muslim refugees."  Trump's rise is based on white supremacy.  Trump's bad guy is always some non-white boogeyman.  It is the duty of every American and Christian to publicly stand up against this racist tide.  People in Europe had the opportunity in the 12920s and 30s and failed.   What will history say about us?
214Montreal, you are correct. in fact Trump said the KKK and white suprecist are repugnant and there is no place for them in America is the words he used.  Yet, CNN says Trump is a fan of the KKK. CNN are the most racist bunch of people the world has ever seen , its disgusting to watch, they are all scum.
It's always fun to watch white people judge whether African American lives are better now or before the civil war.
As I recall,  it was a white Canadian who shot six Muslims in the back in Quebec while they prayed in church. Yes, our country will be "screwed up," to use your terminology,  if we don't find a way to catch illness like this at an early stage. I sense we failed with at least one other individual.
". . . they started hurling racist slurs at every white person within their sights."  If a white person stood there and started hurling racist slurs at every black person in sight, they'd get arrested.
Obviously South Africans are incapable of such complex tasks. Best left to the lily white Russians.
What colour is Mexico's president?  tan?  Good to know other countries have this privilege problem too...or is it more of an underlying racist problem cuz we all know white people are racists.
Do we question why white judges in the South for years threw black men in  jail with no evidence or sense of equitable punishment?  I do AGREE that we all carry bias and that includes judges.   And if bias is inescapable, and it is, then maybe we just have to work from the assumption that bias is going to show up in human behavior regardless.   I also see positive bias (which matches mine of course  lol).  A bias to love children is not common to all.  A bias for financial safety is a reaction to our more primitive instinct for self preservation* *cavemen didn't build up IRA's.     In a diverse society that requires cooperation, is a bias to one's own tribe going to damage the social structure and potential strength of the community?    If religious bias leads to charity, empathy, compassion, I'm OK.  If religious bias is toward killing non believers, I have a problem  Maybe the best we can do is recognize our bias consciously and deal with it.
BOOKS White People Commit the Most Heinous Crimes, So Why Is America Terrified of Black Men?  The new book "Suspicion Nation" addresses the Trayvon Martin injustice and why we keep repeating it. Lisa Bloom, 2014  Bigots read this book if you dare.
family of racists for me, too.  i was able to get an education, and that helped a lot, but didn't help my family.  my mother got better about it as she got older and had a grandchild who was not white, but the rest?  ew.  one thing i've noticed: it's always the white people talking about a race war.  first time i heard of a race war was when i met the daughter of the grand poobah or whatever he's called down in florida in the KKK.  she was convinced there was going to be a race war, because that is how she was raised.  it's a matter of tricking people into 'choosing sides' because 'they'll have to when the race war starts, so they ought to choose now so they'll have a place on the white side.'  the talk of race war is extremely racist.
Like Pitts I won't point out all of Obama's failures on many important issues today.  As a white person I'll just offer comments involving race .  Obama , as the first black president , had the opportunity to bring the races together . It didn't require votes in congress or new laws.  Instead of bringing us together he divided us based on the color of our skin . When incidents hit the front page he always sided based on color---supporting blacks . Instead of acting like everyone's president and calling for calm he fanned the flames of racism . In the D. C. black break-in case he said " police acted stupidly " painting police across America in a bad light . In Florida , instead of calling off the lynch mob he said if he had a son he's look just like the victim .  In Furguson , instead of letting police do their job he called in the Fed's . In Baltimore and Furguson rather than strongly calling for calm he allowed black thugs to steal and burn.  Race relations sank thanks to Obama.
Trump never hesitates to attack if he suspects the attacker is Muslim, even when the facts are unknown. It seems like the Republican it's-too-soon-to-talk-about-guns rule is a response that only comes into play when the shooter is a white male. The false piety reeks of hypocrisy.
And you 'out' yourself as a melanistically-challenged hypocrite by playing the 'race'-card and accusing me of what you are most guilty.  Or perhaps you're one of those whites who seeks to 'validate' themselves by claiming 'Indian' ancestry while they sing the hymns to white-supremacist ideology and privilege under a facade of "democracy".  I tend to lose track--y'all sound so much alike.
The sad thing is only muslims are terrorists.  A white guy who walks into a Walmart and kills 3 people isn't a terrorist just another blue light special.  Except for the terrorized people we have today as a result of shootings in schools, movie theaters, malls, at work, at a night club, concerts.  Selfish white boys with their selfish toys.  The 2nd amendment is deadly.  Since 911 more us men murdered their exes than soldiers have died in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I want the White House and Congress and State Houses and courts across the nation all open carry.  Stop hiding NRA supporters behind metal detectors or do only politicians lives matter?
"The president's reluctance to condemn white bigots also stood in stark contrast by his insistence of calling out "radical Islamic terrorism" by name." So frigging disappointing but not at all surprising, that that weasel and lowest common denominator Trump, has yet again refused to acknowledge and condemn this violent ruddy act of "radical White Nationalist terrorism" in Virginia!!!  Isn't this the same campaign candidate Trump, who could not or would not or flatly refused the political support/endorsement of the KKK too???  Bottom line: because Trump and his Administration have positioned themselves as the true and real representatives and supporters of white nationalists, that in turn, make up a large part of Trump's political support base, NO way will anyone ever hear that weak sleazebag Trump ever risk further offending his support base by ever calling them out for anything.
lol wow! ok well to start, you have no idea where ive been or not been.  Actually, I have spent quite a good amount of time in Arizona, including the slums of Phoenix, so try again.  Second, dont defend this tripe.  Its a terrible, Kipling-level, fear the unwashed hordes piece, implying that mexicans WILL shoot you just for being white and alive.  (sidenote: I don't usually find the WW's coverage of brown folks like myself as 'tone-deaf' as a lot of other people in this city do.  But holy shit, your defense of this terrible slice of hatred and white anger is really giving me pause.  I have always respected and enjoyed your writing, but I am shocked to learn that you think something like this is worthy of defense.  I have defended your paper against others who say that you are uncaring and uninterested in people of color in PDX, but perhaps I was misinformed)

" I am white" You blew your chances right there.
Uh... so? Is that the victims' fault? Are you blaming white male victims for sharing the race of this who usually assault them?
I'm so sick of hearing about "white privilege".  What was it O.J. Simpson had? I guess no one told all the white bums here in Boulder holding signs on the street corners about white privilege.
Calling Europeans "pasty white" is racist. Check your racism.
You mean the war criminals complicit in the illegal invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan? Those “soldiers”?  When was the last time the US invaded a predominantly “white” country? Oh yeah. Never.
That is an outright lie. I never conceded that "anti-white racism" is "prominent in BLM," and I don't "support" racism of any kind, including anti-white racism.  Shame.
Where this notion of White Privilege goes off the rails and moves into dangerous terrain is when it is used as an excuse to introduce the fix for the new lament of the socialist for "equity". This smacks of a return to failed communist attempts to artificially level some playing field according to a do-gooder's whim. This usually causes more problems for both the recipient who is maligned and those who are made the new discriminated class.  The very notion of the phrase white privilege stifles all debate and to challenge the notion makes one a defacto bigot. The newest members of the white privilege club now include Asians so take that for what it is worth. Pretty much anyone who excels in school better look out. The fact that white males are doing comparatively poorly compared to other groups academically will not be examined at all. The fact that adult white males make up the highest group to die by suicide? White Privilege
"heavily armed neo-Nazis are “very fine people,” and those protesting their sadistic, anti-Semitic, white supremacist ideology are equally to blame for the day’s violence, including one protester’s death." What does this say about the Democrats in Congress who just made a debt deal with the alleged Nazi sympathizer Donald J Trump?
Anti-racists say there is a RACE problem that can only be solved when the third world pours into EVERY White country and "assimilates."  What if I said there was a RACE problem that could only be solved if hundreds of millions of non-Blacks were brought into EVERY Black country? How long before people realize I'm not talking about a RACE problem, but the conclusion to the BLACK problem?  They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-White.  Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.
A just society helps all people who are disadvantaged and provides equal opportunities for all, regardless of the colour of their skin. Reverse racism, ie., the concept of "white privilege", simply perpetuates divisions based on race rather than individual needs and responsibilities. It also empowers the traditional racists and, I would argue, is one of  reasons the world is stuck with a racist misogynist idiot as US President.
"Not color, not gender identity-but" white maleness "only." TIFTFY
"“Ethno-nationalism – it’s losers. It’s a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more,” he said. “These guys are a collection of clowns.”  Still, Bannon said he’s fine with the issue of race taking over the national conversation. “The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em,” he is quoted as saying. “I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.”"  Wait, I thought the Trump admin supported the white nationalists.  I am so confused. Where is CNN to set me straight.  LOL!
Maybe America should issue a travel ban on white men given their proclivity for mass shootings?
Bill, that "all lives matter" stuff is so trumped up. Do you bash organizations about breast cancer because "all cancers matter?" Do you bash MADD saying "all bad driving matters?" You oppose abortion, I gather ... what if I complained that you should be saying "all lost pregnancies matter?" The BLM movement, right or wrong, exists to address a perceived injustice and imbalance in police treatment of black people. They are not saying "kill whites" ever; they are saying "don't kill blacks." It's different. Opposing racism is not racist. As long as they want a level treatment, equal to all, everybody who isn't racist should agree with them.
ISIS terrorists kill people who do not believe as they do. American neo-Nazis, White Supremacists and the KKK also kill people who do not believe as they do.
"I am concerned that, whether they are conscious of it or not, the white men who would vote for Trump have never fully accepted women and people of color as equals..."  Not only these, but also LGBT folks and Jews, two other groups many of these white supremacist types hate.
Nice try but all evidence supports Bello was not a nice guy.  Black or white, trash like him is better off dead.
So Trump started his political life with a racist lie, and found it resonated with some, so he has stayed with the same message. His strong underlying message is Make America White Again. Unfortunately, racism while not quite as blatant as it once was is still alive and well in America, and Obama's presidency brought it back to the surface.
The Drug War is a profit scheme run by the Police, Judges, etc it's called Prison for Profit. It cost $60K a year just to house/feed a Non-violent Drug offender & with their record the Economy forces them back into that system upon "release" generating a loop of profits for COPS. White People created Garbage that's why Europe almost died with the Plague & why my Irish Ancestors were Fooled into leaving their homelands instead of Fighting Colonization to it's END! Communism is Natural & has been around for Millions of YEARS! Money was only invented to Dispose people of their Land so stop praising Capitalism like it's a God that earned loyalty.
the next stage of deceit and lies of the LIberal Media just started. Making up stories of why Donald took away money to combat White Extremists. The problem is not the White Extremists but of the Liberals/Democrats and Media today.  Great, now Trump can use the money on the REAL extremists Liberal Democrats who spew Lies and Hate on the President of the United States . I'm appalled reading of a Democrat that threw F bombs and was happy Scallise was shot and should die. These Liberals/Democrats are no better than the Islam/Muslim Extremists spewing hate of the Western World. No better than the Palestinians teaching hate of Israeli's at a very young age. The Democrats have blood on their hands propping up the hate of Trump in which a Bernie Sander supporter went on a shooting spree of Republicans at a ballpark.
Well, in that case white men are an invasive species in this country and nearly destroyed the native population.
So you are now going to be willing to call out old soul and icon et al? Two folks among others here who have called for violence against all who have a different view from them? How about all who have called me and others racist when ever we opposed any of the lefts views? How about left wing politicians wishing for the presidents assassination? Do you believe celebrities who voice ill will towards our president should be held accountable for their despicable words? The aclu has fought successfully for even despicable groups like the neo-nazis, white supremacist blm and others to voice hate towards others. Both the right and the left citizens in this Nation have followed the leaders of the parties and use hate speech and fear towards opposing views. We as a people need to quit being used. Everyone has the right to free speech, no matter how hate filled and ignorant. I do not attend rally's or protest I disagree with. I support the Constitution.
The only good thing about Trump's election is that the poorly educated white folks that elected him will suffer the most. They deserve what they get. They think being white is better than being human. This country has been a giant affirmative action program for people that Europe didn't need or want. They have lied to themselves about who and what they are. As globalization takes effect, they are finding out that being white is no defense for being ignorant. The 21st century is not kind to the ignorant. Just ask Putin.
The all white male photo is priceless. Guess we know who knows best now don't we.
White male Anti-Globalists peacefully marching = Bad. Violent masked Globalist crypto-fascists throwing bricks = Good. Shut up slaves, MSM
You mean more non whites are immigrating to Canada, instead of members of the Master Race? You do have a lot in common with a German dictator who died 70 years ago.   Planning to build a few camps?
Sure I do.  My wife, daughter, son-in-law, son and in-laws are all (or were, wife is retired) hard working, taxpaying, law abiding black folks.  And I've been around them all for nearly half a century.  Once again, ASSUME just makes an @$$ of U, not ME.  And when you can report to me that ALL white folks behave as responsible citizens, come talk to me.  You exemplify the New Testament's definition of hypocrisy--expecting better behavior from others than you expect from yourself.  And five'll getcha ten I know personally at least two orders of magnitude more Muslims than do you, and am therefore far better qualified to speak on their views than you.  All you do is watch TV and visit anti-Muslim hate-site for propaganda.  And again, don't presume to try and teach me my faith.  I know far more about it than you do.  You'll just continue to make yourself look stupid.  One would think you'd be tired of that by now.  I'm sure tired of your stupidity.
Really? Is DM the new Huffington Post? First white men don't deserve to vote, now all men are trash. Even Guptaleaks is more interesting reading material.
You shouldn't have to be labeled liberal to protest Nazis. By referring to the rally protesters as alt left, the opposition party he, his family, and his 'real news' friends at Fox disdain, our president gives credibility to the 'white supremists' that support him. That's how David Duke understood it when he thanked the president for condemning the liberal terrorists.
More clear evidence of white privilege.  Whites must work harder to kill whites in order to eradicate this blatant example of bias and racial inequity.  And how about Asians?  They are killed at even a lower rate than either whites or blacks.  Maybe that has something to do with fewer Asian illegitimate births, a strong inter-generational Asian family support structure, a desire to be well-educated and have a good job and stay out of trouble.  Asians are much less likely than either whites or blacks to use hard drugs and engage in criminal behavior.  White privilege is very bad indeed, but Asian privilege is even worse.  Asians must abandon their successful life strategies so that there will be more racial equity in homicides, illegitimate births, criminal convictions, lack of educational achievements, and unsuccessful lives.  It's just common sense.
These ugly "monuments" were put up mostly during Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Movement as an attempt to intimidate and remind black people that they were "less than" and still inferior in everyday.  To defend the statues staying is a tacit admission that you support the ideals of slavery and white supremacy.
Surprise surprise suprise... Another Muslim Democrat committing a mass shooting.  You mean it wasn't a middle aged white Christian, Republican, NRA membership who committed this crime?? Shocking just shocking I tell you
"You seem to have more information regarding Mr. Brown than is provided in this article. It seems that you are calling him a racist. Could you please provide some additional facts to support your position."   You might want to read his own words. “they let their destructive brats run unsupervised. When you call them on it, you’re a racist, white devil."
The teacher is racist against whites, as are the teachers union commenters who support her.
How stupid can Trump get?  There is zero reason to interfere with Venezuela.  Stay out!  Didn't trump promise his white base that the uSA would withdraw from unnecessary interventions around the world.?  America First?  Ummm...the base got taken again.
Does this really surprise anyone? Trump has most likely either sent the money to an overseas bank account, or has secretly invested it in Russian businesses. He's the biggest scammer to ever have a role in politics and his voters were duped like never before. If it weren't for white supremacists, under-educated voters, and the help of Russia, he would never have even been close to being a candidate for president. It's really sad that so many people were fooled by his campaign of lies.
"...white candidate Steve Cohen pledged to apply for membership in order to represent his constituents. However, after his election, his application was refused.[13]"  RACIST!
I am not a friend sir, to racism, segregation, racial separatism, racial supremacy, special racial privileges, false history, or divide and conquer politics.   We are ALL Natives of the Planet Earth! I think you may have a "white" problem like Jane.
There is a special club of hypocrites whose members include J. Edgar Hoover, and Ted Haggard (to name a couple out of many). Milo Yiannopoulos is part. Can you spot the link?  All are, or were, active homosexuals who spoke out against homosexuality. J. Edgar Hoover had Clyde Tolson. Married Rev. Ted Haggard had sex with men. Milo Yiannopoulos thinks same-sex marriage is wrong, and wishes that homosexuals would go back in the closet (while loudly proclaiming he's not a white supremacist for reasons I'll let you inquisitive readers discover).  Remember the racist skinhead, Nicky Crane? Nicky Crane performed in gay pornographic videos and died of AIDS. There's Ambrose St John and John Henry Newman (a poignant finish to their secret life together was revealed when the Vatican tried to separate their remains--buried together in the same grave--for Newman's beatification. The coffins had decomposed, and their bodies had finally mingled).  Milo's hypocritical, tawdry dragface is irredeemable.
Ducksoup:  I agree with you about Japan but you are forgetting that Japan does not have the populations of black men and women, white men and women  or any men or woman  that have PTSD, mexican men, latino men, Huge numbers  of Mentally Ill etc.  ALL High Crime folks...
Am I really the 1st female responder to this article? A big thank you to Denby for bringing this to the attention of your readers.  I haven't marched in protest since the Vietnam War in the 70's, motivated by my classmates being enlisted and killed in that hated war.  And now, nearly a half century later, we find ourselves in an equally torn America we don't recognize - one that voted an idiot into power because - why?  He has money and people think that will rub off on them? White supremacy that captures the imagination of more idiots parading around in their KKK robes? The unemployed who kid themselves into thinking the orange haired guy cares whether they feed their families?  People claiming 'change' as motivation when they really mean destroy everything the alt right doesn't like?  The Russian puppet-leader will not be allowed to remove women's rights as if we are at worst slaves and at best window dressing. If you want to see angry women just stay tuned as this disaster unfolds.
Nice try! Called out on your cherry picking, and this is what you resort to? LOL! Pathetic.  Seriously, why is it so hard for you to admit that whites commit more murders than blacks?
Poor looser. She should tell her daughter Chelsea to stop making negative comments about world leaders. She is a nobody and she should refer back to her fathers many extra marital affairs. She was probably in her bedroom in the White House while her father was enjoying the company of white house interns in the oval office. President Duterte made reference to that in his response to Chelsea's comments. Duterte was wrong and should ashamed of making the rape comment last year. He has already received criticism from people all over the world. Chelsea Clinton is just like her mother, a looser.
And the saddest thing is... this guy doesn't even *know* how racist he is being. In a grand example of irony - idiots like you posting racist claims like this *actually* turn them into a self-fullfilling prophecy - because when you make racist claims like this - you make all the parties other than the ANC appear to BE racist.  When you speak like a white supremacist, about the inferior voting judgement of the majority of South Africans - you insult them, and they don't WANT to vote for the parties you support - because no matter how bad the ANC gets - it's better for them than ANY party that would welcome YOUR vote !
"yes this line of thinking is going do die with all the old racist white people"  No it won't, the push-back against this social over-engineering nonsense is coming (ie, this is how people like Trump get elected) and it won't be pretty...
exactly!  But let us be honest:  Hawaii is dominated by non-whites and Trump racist base will be happy to see Hawaii wiped out.  Trump is a disgrace.
Bernstein doesn't hate Trump as much as he hates white Christians and Trump's followers, but he's afraid to say so.  The little pip squeak's only claim to fame is his reporting on Nixon, as if that was something that took above average ability.  Actually he's a national security threat because of his rabid hatred of traditional American values and, especially his childish open borders, globalist fantasies about a one world government that is so nonsensical only a fool could ever entertain the idea, let alone work for it as if it's the most important thing in the world.  His kooky, insane ideas belong in a grade school classroom.  Personally I'd like to see him culled from the population by jailing him as a national security threat.  He's a worthless fool.
"Blacks commit about 6x the rate of murder of whites"  That doesn't sound right, since 83% of homicides against whites are committed by other whites, and 89% of homicides against blacks are committed by other blacks.  The population of whites is about 5 times larger.  To get to 6x times the rate of murder of whites by blacks, you'd have to assume that virtually all of the 17% committed by non-whites are all committed by blacks, and all other races are angels, which isn't the case.  Feel free to prove me wrong with some legitimate statistical sources, but my impression is that inter-racial murder is relatively insignificant.  I haven't found a source yet that supports your assertion, but my patience has limits.  Maybe you meant "as whites." As a percent of population, that might make sense.
Perfectly expresses white racist resentment, even with all that poor grammar, punctuation, logic and syntax.  (look that word up)
This kind of rally was a stupendously foolish and inexcusable way to express a very valid point.  White-washing (sorry for the pun) history in the blind pursuit of political correctness is not the way forward.  Worse yet, it won't make a difference.  Militant blacks have attached themselves to the "original sin" of slavery the same way Canada's aboriginals have attached themselves to the "original sin" of colonization.  No number of apologies, gestures or (in Canada's case) financial payments will ever suffice.  Name one prominent black or aboriginal leader who has publicly said "I forgive the white race for their historical transgressions.  Let's work together in building the future rather than re-living that past" and encourages others to do so too.    Given an unwillingness to forgive, there will be no true reconciliation.  All that's left is empty posturing and pandering in the pursuit of political correctness.
You never try to have any sort of rational conversation with anyone as I often read your commentaries. White is white, black is black, Asian is Asian so you speak in ignorance because it is your nature to troll. I am not the only one to think that people of the Slavic background is considered...."white". Maybe you have another word for it?? But have it your way, you started this trolling, I did not.
Do they make rolling papers that big ? Also, do black "dudes" smoke better than white "dudes" ?
Or Senator Robert Byrd... Also a long term clansman who  Despite being the only Senator to vote against both African American U.S. Supreme Court nominees (liberal Thurgood Marshall and conservative Clarence Thomas) and filibustering the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Byrd later said joining the Klan was his "greatest mistake." The NAACP gave him a 100% rating on their issues during the 108th Congress. However, in a 2001 incident Byrd repeatedly used the phrase "white niggers" on a national television broadcast.
A few years ago, when an american citizen was blocked from being part owner of a team, professional street rat Al Sharpton gloated saying, "This is ah whorl (our world)".  That was the first clue that the NFL was being turned into its own tribe--and one that is anti-white and anti-America.  What will players do when their salaries are cut and teams are disbanded, you ask.  Why, they'll cry, "America is racisss!!!"
"These "white men" you speak of seem to have very limited experience of anyone other than themselves."  I agree! Not to mention that they seem to fear the "decision-making" that may "be different based on their experiences with women and Jewish people".  What the heck would be wrong with that? We need input from all our citizens, yes, including straight white males, but not only straight white males as if they were the only ones whose "decision-making" was valid or of worth!  This is a very narrow-minded way of looking at the vast diversity of the people of the United States, a country that is great because of it's diversity, not in spite of it!
Well Skeexix, in case you didn't know, CD is a black man that hates white people, white privilege, white power, white government and white leaders.  If you're white, he probably hates you too.  I, personally, hate racists of all breeds, especially white supremacists.  But seriously dude, have you ever heard CD EVER say ANYTHING positive about white folk?  Not gonna happen, he's prejudiced.  (also I'm a dinosaur and can't read http/youtu.be/etc., what does that mean?)
I see on the Twitter summaries, Ms. Rampell has discovered H. L Mencken.  Here is one of his other quotes:  "I admit freely enough that, by careful breeding, supervision of environment and education, extending over many generations, it might be possible to make an appreciable improvement in the stock of the American negro, for example, but I must maintain that this enterprise would be a ridiculous waste of energy, for there is a high-caste white stock ready at hand, and it is inconceivable that the negro stock, however carefully it might be nurtured, could ever even remotely approach it. The educated negro of today is a failure, not because he meets insuperable difficulties in life, but because he is a negro. He is, in brief, a low-caste man, to the manner born, and he will remain inert and inefficient until fifty generations of him have lived in civilization. And even then, the superior white race will be fifty generations ahead of him."
For most of us white males we are normal and other cultures are identity politics. This is of course knowledge. White male is such a powerful identity it assumes it is normal. It is hard to find a better example of identity politics than the Proud Boys, or this comment.
Steve Bannon a vocal supporter of the Alt Right and white supremacists is in the White House.  Pretty much he needs to go first before you even try lipservice.
"And that’s before we consider the various incidents that have come to play a particular role in the public mind. Penny Sparrow’s Facebook rant was racist, the Spur incident was racist too; these were big issues even without the help of a group of people from a former colonial power”  Notwithstanding, ‘minor' isues arised when comments to call 'killing whites like jews', and 'killing or maiming white children' done through the social media with identifiable sources, 'under investigation’ and ‘under the carpet’ was the way to go….
The White Supremacist herd finds any opportunity to divert attention from the crimes revealed in the news article to their sworn agenda to further their racist ethos.
As an American Jew it's disgusting to see someone with and Israeli flag support a fascist like Adolph Trump. Israeli media and government have been Trump apologizers for a long time. It is mind boggling to see the Jewish state align itself with such a vile white supremacist fascist pig like our imbecile-in-chief. Any Jew who stands by Donald Trump is a traitor to the Jewish people.
This is a good example of how welfare payments and unconditional grants to the poor just paper over the real problems, while creating a profit-making incentive for politicians.   Since the end of Apartheid, substantial portions of the black population have been allowed to fester in poverty and ignorance and indolence. Many millions are no closer to becoming employed than they were back in the 1990s. South Africa could have been the economic engine of Africa: all was there to do it. They had the best infrastructure in Africa, the most investment wealth, the most advanced industries and universities, and the world's good will for them to succeed. Since then, a corrupt black uber class has misruled the country, seeking to just get political gain for attacking whites and even threatening to kill them on mass. Today's SA is broke, broken and heading towards being another failed black African state.
The accompanying photo of a blond, white girl as the prototypical Canadian is racist and xenophobic.
This is simple to solve. Just get rid of high school football games. No football games, no racial animosity. Besides, today's Football was invented by a white privileged, elitist, Yale university medical student and that alone should spell its immediate demise.
When you can't win on facts, just start spouting statistics. Whites commit more murder than blacks. Why are you so, so butthurt by simple facts?
"Are you seriously comparing BLM to white supremacists?"  Oh, heck yeah.  Both groups, along with La Raza, are disgusting racists groups.
Ugly, unfit, unwashed spawn of po' white trash (gen-u-wine hillbilly kind, gots papers to prove it) here with a question. Could you please explain what howeling and knashing is? They sounds dreadful.
This nitwit is probably the most hated individual in the south right now. I bet even the white racists probably want a piece of him as much as anyone else. Thanks to him, the famed symbol of the south, the Confederate flag suddenly became persona non grata all over the nation. I read somewhere that he had a black girlfriend who rejected him and that set him on this path of hate. Anyone else read that?? Death penalty is the only solution for an individual like him.
Yet when one mediocre white girl doesn't get in to UT Austin, it's a Supreme Court case because of reverse racism!
It's a fact... but a White stating so instantly makes them a "racist/bigot/etc".  :D
I'm white so no pudding for you Mr.Trump University pHD! LMAO.
The majority of white folks don't realize that our race relation issues were created by white people for white people. We minorities have had very little say about our public policies in this country. Heck, our 1st black president was followed by the guy that said he wasn't born in America. White folks did build our racist heritage. We have been working on becoming "a more perfect union" ever since the founding of the nation. The 2nd Amendment was necessary to commit ethnic cleansing and building the macro economics of the nation on race based slavery. Murder and rape were part of the business model for the nation. Clearly, Christianity doesn't prevent white racism, rape, or murder. This country is proof. The beauty of white racism is that it allows the average white person to go through life thinking they are innocent while collecting their white privilege. For example, white folks aren't racially profiled. This despite the fact that most mass shooters are loner white men.
BLM is a collection of racists intent only on promoting their hatred of police, white society and anyone not black. Pride was hi-jacked they have now lost their claim to promoting inclusion for LGBT residents and our multi-cultural community. That BLM can garner support from our politically correct politicians is shameful. Black uniforms and fist pumping are the trademark of thugs and gang members.
My life in this world, is only temporary on my journey, as is others. What I would worry about is after I pass on. I have to go over, and explain my life's actions, with my Creator as you will have to with yours, as will every one else, white, brown, black or whatever. I would like to be there though, when the racists, bigots, corrupt, and the ones who took part in the subjugation of races of people, including genocide, for white collar parasites and leeches who steal Native's lands and resources they covet, when they have to also explain their life's actions to their Creator. Do they get to go to their heaven, or to their hell? My bet is they end up in the same frying pan as the Islamic terrorists
"There’s a phone message we play during workshops that never fails to evoke reaction. It’s the recording of a woman who called our office last fall to express her deep suspicion of Syrian refugees, Muslims and women in head scarves." ~ `` ~ . . . what's with this Overgeneralization of 'Bigotry' based on "a woman who called our office last fall"??  What a pitiful excuse to stir up more s***t -- be sure to drag in others to suck up full sympathy.  Enough Of This Bull..   Would you like to know how many Indignities have been experienced by Women who DO NOT wear head scarves & do not belong to the above groups named -- All Women Experience Indignities, Madam -- ALL..!!  For your edification -- Muslim men can be Exceptionally Ignorant & Rude to 'White, Non-Muslim Women' & that Friend, is drawn from Familial Experience. Obviously a Norm For Muslim Men.  So, Do You Hear White Non-Muslim Women Whining???? Nope!.  Say, how about giving this over-wrought cry-baby whining a Big Fat Rest.. !?  / .
What racism?  here ya go, bootie-boy:  let's see how you handle the obvious.....  You:  "How gullible White America is. Embarrassed to be white." -Boots  Now let's see you say that about b***** if it isn't racist.  Go fo it!  Let me get the popcorn ready!  I give you 10-1 that he never responds to this folks!  It must be painful to be in your skin, boots.  Otherwise why the attacks on whites?    And I am still proud that I am white! ; ))
White people like you voted for Trump because you refuse to take responsibility for your actions. You love the white privilege you claim does not exist. Please tell me when white racism stopped effecting public policy in this country? It must have been after 1965. I missed it. It is still good to be a white man in America. You are not racially profiled, even though most cops are killed by white men.
Ha, yes, I see what you did there!  Interesting how when it's a white guy we focus on the individual's circumstances, but let it be a black person or muslim or pacific islander, and it's instantly "all those people . . . "
Since the trolls have shown up and are are accusing everyone they disagree with of being Nazi sympathizers, while copy/pasting their comments, I'll do the same with my response.  Now this is hilarious. When you have no argument and the facts aren't on your side ad hominem attacks are what you use. BTW, facts aren't racist or bigoted. Try to ease up on your obvious biases and maybe you'll open your eyes to the truth. The following is what makes your comment beyond hilarious. I am from a multi-racial family. We are black, white, Mexican, Jewish, et al. To top all of that off I had a family member murdered by the KKK decades ago, so unlike you, I actually have valid reasons to hate racists and Nazis. People like you just throw out personal attacks, while having no clue about anything. Pathetic.  P.S. My name is a combination of matter (as in forms of it based in science) and AK as in Alaska...you know, the state I'm in.  So much fail from the trolls
Hey Pocho (we know, you're not a white guy).  Could you explain to all of the sane world, how you can defend this.  Note that most of your fellow MAGAphants are pretty quiet about this one.  Is the baby-in-chief jealous that a gold star family might get more press than he does.  Ya, we know, you're not a white guy.
Huh?  I didn't include all white people?  Your post is so nonsensical, I don't know what you're talking about.  I strongly suspect you don't know either.
scheer needs to drop a few things...scheer was taught well by harper with his white supremacist/christian fundamentalist views from the days at the northern foundation...
No, white males committing mass shooting are almost always connected with some organized violent group including white supremacists, so called men's rights activists who harass women reporting rape, anti-choice on the abortion issue extremists and other hate groups.  The vast majority of them also have a history of domestic violence.
You're right, of course. I've encountered this often.  Conservatives often, decry anyone who discusses race as a racist. Their thinking is that racism wouldn't exist unless non-white folks agitated against it.
`There's a little race for governor in Virginia, and human-weasel manimal Ed Gillespie is going full metal racist in his ads. Dems always think that "the media" is somehow the preventive measure for this stuff, that when Republicans "go there" the wise old white men of the editorial pages will write sternly worded editorials denouncing them and it will backfire. It doesn't work that way. Those old white men of the editorial pages are often pretty racist themselves, even if they are offended by "the tone." More than that, they just don't have the power and influence they once did. Working the refs has value, but unlike baseball, there are no rules to this game. We all have to step up and heap scorn on the racists, our scorn is all they deserve.
Clearly   some  of  the  self  loathers  on here  don't  like  white  people  like  Trump.  PR  is  basically a  parasite,  receiving  billions  and  giving  us  nothing  in  return.  You  know  how  they  reward  our  largess  and  support?  By  buying  90%  of  their  automobiles  from  Asia. Give  them  independence  now.
Plenty of white anglo saxon born again narrow-minded judgemental bigoted Christians have had their educations paid for by the same over-privileged white people. Stop whining and learn to be the tolerant civic-minded person this country is so proud of.
This racist moron's comments are in line with Trump and the hordes of racist whites that support him.   No surprise at all.
My experience has been the opposite.  With a few notable exceptions, most of the white southerners I encountered when I lived in Mississippi, North Carolina and Missouri and when I visited relatives in Aransas were white supremacists, either openly or surreptitiously (what we used to call "uptown Klansmen").  In an Arkansas town 15 miles from where my in-laws live cops claim a black kid in their custody shot himself despite being handcuffed, with a gun that was never found, and they're still on the force.  The two white kids that were smoking dope with him got let off with a warning.  Tell me: are your feet wet?  Do you see pyramids in the distance?  'Cause you're DEEP in denial.  Or are simply lying.
This is about mass murder.  It's not about what a lawyer said on T.V.  You could care less how many people died or were injured. This is your time to shine. It's the liberals fault, right?  I wonder if instead of a old white male mass murderer, have it be a black dude or any color really. I bet you'll stay on subject then because that's your M.O. On display everyday, all day. So much so that you have to be getting paid. That or one extremely motivated useful idiot for the Russians.  When nobody responds to you. You spam the thread. Especially Sid's column. You spam that shamelessly. Well over 40% of 160 comments, probably closer to 50%.  Troll
The Republican Party is tripping over themselves trying to distance themselves from the Alt Right. It's all lip service. The Aryan Nation Party (GOP) pitched a hissy fit when the Obama administration tried to put white supremacist groups on the terrorists watch list. It is the their white trash president that for more than eight years demanded to see President Obama's birth certificate. It was their white trash congress that obstructed at every turn, even denying President Obama's Supreme Court nominee for nearly a year. It was because he was the first Black President. No the Republican / Aryan Nation Party owns this. No amount of lip service will suffice. It is time to call out the entire party. The entire Republican Party, every single Republican voter all the way up to the party heads, has the blood of this weekend on their hands.
True but some clarification here: this has nothing to do with race or a white person shooting a black man...it was a black cop. So go protest blacks i guess. Or in tulsa, go protest white woman since it was a white woman. The caricature of the yosemite sam white cop attack blacks is just as stupid as the caricature of blacks as  crackheads and thugs...
"Happy" I find it sad that you believe what you posted. I am White and consider myself 'average' for the most part. I have NEVER IN MY LIFE thought less of others of ANY race for what they are, what they look like, what they know or anything else. I'm retired Military and have traveled the world and met many peoples, all have their good points... All have bad...  I only knew one black family until my 18th birthday and had NEVER seen an Asian person until I went to boot-camp for the Navy! In my LONG life I have done my best to accept people for what they present to me..  Trump is NOT a racist, you listen way to much to the crap presented by the left.. He poses NO threat to any of us unless you plan to break some serious laws. We needed someone to support the 2nd amendment, think of our Veterans, fix our health care system and balance SCOTUS.  We could not survive as a free country if we were socialist bunch of left wing nuts (like Bernie wanted) where everything is supposed to be free!
Not really. It's a conscious attempt at rebranding white supremacist garbage. Richard Spencer is usually given credit for coining this.
Three victims in Fairbanks..a mother, a partner, an infant. Not Muslim, not jihad. Just your average American white guy with a gun and an anger problem. A church full of African Americans in Charleston slaughtered in cold blood by Dylan Roof. Individuals with anger management problems and mental health disturbances come in all colors. Generalizations of hate or fear toward entire groups of people of one race or religion are a danger to all of us.
What revisionist nonsense is this?! Stonewall was mostly a white gay male riot. What is wrong with these people?!
Hope Dylan is put in a cell with the biggest, meanest black guy who has a giant chip on his shoulder re white people.
The Leftist-media puts Trump in their typical lose-lose position: Trump must condemn those who they want him to condemn, before the actual assailant's motives have even been commented upon by the local authorities.   The anatomy of that awful day in Charlottesville will likely not be told. There were two distinct evils battling each other: White-racists and Leftists.   All rational people will condemn the man who rammed his car into the crowd, it was a heinous, horrible act. But no less heinous and horrible than the man who shot the Republican Congress people in the park or the man who murdered five Dallas law enforcement officers at a BLM rally.   Look at pop-culture. White people are portrayed as the Big Evil, as inherently racist, privileged, bigoted and hateful of, apparently, all but other white people and even then, only those who are not of the oh-so perfect Left.   Racism is racism and evil regardless of the race of the racist.
You mean the trend of hit-and-run drivers being young white drivers?
The disgusting fact is that most of the left-leaning decision makers at universities and black students want segregation again, don't go blaming the white man again for the social issues we face today. There are far too many people with complaints about the current state of our country but all the idiots rioting and claiming racism have no solutions just more complaints and then they seek help from the same people they revolted against. The welfare state may have been a good idea one point in time but without major reform the welfare state will be the death of America.
But it is.  Because the religion itself and practiciers of are not trying to kill you.  Specific radical individuals are trying to kill you.  But they no more represent Islam than all of the white christian mass shooters in the US represent Christianity.
PROGRESSIVES are a CLEAR and PRESENT DANGER to WHITES KILL a PROGRESSIVE and TWO NIGERS and 5 MUSLUMS to PROTECT HUMAN LIFE
"White nationalists want an all white country" And they aren't going to get it, this country has never been all white, and never will be, the whole concept is stupid, but, whatever.
You just explained why white white men needed the 2nd Amendment. They knew they had to kill the people they were stealing the land from.
Sure, there can be other reasons for foreign enrollment to be down.  However, the message is clear from the Trump administration: if you are not white, coming to America to study is dangerous and can result in death.  That one FACT is what parents cannot overcome.
What about Gupta monopoly capital? and corrupted African leadership (nicely illustrated through the insurmountable failures of Zuma's administration) Is that our solution? Yes Mbalula is spot on and factually correct historically. What then? We follow the dumb ass corrupt, malleable, unprincipled, immoral iteration that's become ANC now with active participants like your Fikile's and Malusi's?   Let's cut the white man out of it for a while and deal with real facts for ourselves. (We'll never change the white man's incredibly stupid, unjustifiable, actually laughable small minded thinking). They'll probably still rack their little brains as to what's been said by Fikile about history and still not be able to comprehend it.   What about us. Is a guy like Fikile, or Gigaba or Malema really the types of people we want representing us? Would YOU accept taking up a finance ministry knowing you know nothing about finance, and think you are adding value to society? Think about it.
I think you know the difference between gay pride and white pride Outsider, but I'll bite. "White pride" has a lot of overlap with white supremacy, which has a history of terrorizing and often killing black people.   "Gay pride" is more of a celebration. I'm straight, but I would be welcomed at a gay pride event. The Scandinavian Festival is certainly a celebration of white culture, but everybody is welcome. Gay pride is like that.
Also, all you people out there "of color", be very, very worried and do something about it with your vote on the next go round.  Trump is a White Supremacist, obviously picking on blacks, THIS TIME.  He has no problem pandering to the racism of his "base", stirring it up in a racist frenzy.  He's used Mexicans, Middle Easterners, Jews and Blacks as his foils to do that so far.  This is getting bad.  Even NFL owners, risking offending their white customer base, are pushing back - and they have NO PROBLEM killing their employees to make money.  Very bad.
There is no male equivalent  There are many situations where being a white male is a risk.  but you will n  reject all  examples no matter how many are offered to you.  You are the sort of racist we have to fear because you refuse to even admit your  own guilt.
Actually the pack districts with black voters, leaving 2 or three bordering districts lilly white and more likely to vote Repubulican.    They 'cleanse' the conservative district and isolate the black population so as not to 'infect' the voting pool that Republicans target.  You got it right in purpose though.
You can play stupid all you want.  JWB was a white racist southern conservative. It's not 1865 any more,  therefore your false assertion that democrats are the party of white racist southern conservatives is stupid beyond belief.   Keep ignoring history though. I know reality has a liberal bias,  which makes it tough for trump cultists.
Hypocrisy: the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform; pretense.  If the Dems were crying "racist" but still the same party they were before the Civil Rights Act and the Southern Strategy, then yes, they would be hypocrites. They are not however. They are the complete opposite. Of the two major parties, it is the Dems who are the party of diversity and inclusion. The GOP is 89% white, the Dems are 60%.   The hypocrisy is stating that the GOP is still the party of Lincoln or even MLK senior when it is clearly the party of Trump, who is an white supremacy apologist.
100% you will take no responsibility for anything that goes wrong with Pride , the parade or events.   You need scapegoats and the only question is who. Certainly white man like Tory,  Toronto's white gay male population , and white police officers are the easy targets.
In Europe, nobody would care. We are too law-crazy making too many things we like illegal. This schmuck really has a tool we all envy. He want to share his happiness through a photo selfie. No meeting took place. Fahgeddabouddit! He was just joking around. I remember a story about Sukarno who visited Russia. they knew he loved beautiful women so they procured a statuesque young blonde who fit the national pride of women. They banged into happiness and his dream of loving such a white beauty kept them awake all night. The next day the dirty Russkies tried to blackmail the President with colorful photos of his sexual escapade. He laughed and asked for a hundred copies of each photo. In Asian as well as Europe it is a man's right to pork any woman who so desires him. As long as he returns home to his wife, everything will be fine. Who or what brainwashed us into believing such a wonderful sport is so evil? Fork the government and its childish laws.
Your site shows the Hispanic women more poorly compensated than the blacks, the whites or the Asians.    So they should be having the most abortions according to your 'suggestion'.
The whole anti-white-male underpinnings of contemporary liberalism is just one of many  irrational, pseudo-intellectual pathologies that has been adopted by the Democratic Party. This pathology is a subset of the overall assault on the masculine and manhood that we find in the culture.  Any culture that has such an approach to men or the masculine is sick, sick, sick. It is this sickness that the above article advances.   We have seen what this anti-male, anti-masculine  spirit has done to the Black community and what it is now doing to American culture in general.  We see that this anti-white male view is actually a form of racism against the white race in general. This theme has infected all of Liberalism and the above article with the animosity it engenders not only lacks charity but is thoroughly anti-Christian.
Why doesn't any one riot when a black cop shOOts an unarmed white person? It happens a lot more than people think. Maybe it has to do with being more civilized.
The south rebelled in part because they feared a bloody slave revolt.  Haiti had just had a slave revolt where they killed every white and many mulatto.  Only those cornered in a port city survived.  The north was going to cause a similar slave revolt with all the propaganda.  Today we live the violence from blacks every day.  The South was right.
And you know everything about India because you ate butter chicken a few times?  Rape is underreported everywhere. But the implied idea (from the media) that non white men rape more is not backed by data.
My apologies rimrock! "This is all about racial injustice and white resentment that minorities no longer know their place in society. "  I didn't know it was said by DT, originally.  what an all around embarrassing trash of men,  DT is! Is DT makes all Americans the trash people since we elected trash for the president of this country? Great I Am a double trash, since I am Catholic beside! What the hell is wrong with 'men'! I hate to admit it, however, I never met a man who I can respect in my entire life in 70years. Why on earth, men can't rise above their Penis? I think the requirment for being a priest should not be a single but cas·trated!  well that is a sure way to solve clergy rape of children scandals!
The All Lives Matter white supremicists and bigots out in force today on this column, I see.
Here's the difference: Even a peaceful protest by the white supremacy crowd still signifies racism and even some aggressive racism.  A peaceful protest by the opposition signifies living together in equality and peace.  At its core, white supremacists are arguably the root-cause of the issue.  Sure, we should be able to know this without having to be told so, and accept that any violence is bad.  But, pointing out the root-cause, which is exactly the white supremacists, definitely has merit.    Trump a man?  Pfft.  More like a draft dodger.
Trump saying "alt left" is just him further attempting to divide this country and create chaos. You don't have to be fringe left to have a strong disgust for nazis. The vast majority of Americans are somewhere in the middle and sickened by the white supremacists and their love of Trump.
You are implying that I want to blame all black people. That is dishonest, insulting, and exposes your racism. I am just pointing out the hypocrisy and the racist bent of the media. If the suspect in Florida was white, it would have been reported. Just like they did in the other referenced article.
The non-white groups all play ethnic politics. I don't think they're going to like it when we get serious on the same level.
You're right. White people never experience dark clouds.
This editorial is embarrassing, it cites loud public belches from the uncouth as hate. Hate is Kristallnacht, Hate is lynching or beating a youth across from that pissy little rebel rag. Hate is angry, resentful, doped-up life failures like Dylan Roof, executing his victimizers. The banner, "White, proud, unapologetic",  could easily be applauded by the currently hysterical if it were written as "black, brown, red, turquoise, etc, proud, unapologetic". Stop discounting Hate, real Hate,  and the blood  and dying that flow from it and its worshipers. Walk around with sanctimonious signs, hug, and cry if you want. Or buck up and breathe. The answer to real Hate comes out of the barrel of a gun, you'll know when it's time. Death is the only outcome of Hate, it's also its only answer.
More nonsense.  Please provide some actual FACTS to support your claim.  Please prove that Donald Trump is a racist or supporter of White Supremacy with some simple facts.  By the way I don't care for Trump myself, but I am sick of all the falsehoods portrayed by the media.  Hillary lost the election, time to move on.
Trump! Make America White Again!
I can't be "racist" against my fellow white people, bro. Too many white people don't share racist white peoples' views. But racist white people have this tendency to bring in lots of other people to their side... even when these other people didn't ask for it. That's racist white peoples' problem: they are too insecure and aren't man enough to stand on their own two feet and own their racist views by themselves, so they try to spread their disgusting views to others as a way of diluting their hatred.
A person is a hypocrite if he tells someone not to do something but he does it himself. I didn't do this if you look at everything I said. Blacks protest things like discrimination and being killed by cops unfairly. When a old white man tells Blacks to go back to Africa, he is saying stop complaining, you are lucky to be in the U.S. If a white man from the mainland complains about how inferior Hawaii is, then the response from a local will be, if this place isn't good enough for you, go back to the place you are happy with. I wouldn't agree with anyone telling Micronesians to go back. If you complained that Hawaiians discriminated against whites, and they told you to go back to the mainland, I would be against it also. You did not give any example and I am only talking about the superior white man situation.
The antifa thugs are fascists themselves and are twenty times in number more than white racists..
Alt-Left must be the opposite of Alt-Right. So... opposite of racists, white supremacists, misogynists, and bigots.  Whaddya know, I'm Alt-Left!  Good vs. evil. You can be a Nazi, a Nazi sympathizer, or anti-Nazi. Only 1 of those is good, 2 are evil. We now know that the President and his supporters are Nazi sympathizers, at best.
More whites are killed by police than blacks. Look it up......
White people are extremely violent..!!
The rise in anti-white sentiment is a reflection of the rise of radical whites within the white community.    Christianity is a dark sinister force and for some reason the right continues to turn a blind eye to this.  Until so-called "moderate" white Christians publicly condemn and disavow the white-suprecacists' exhortation to remove all non-whites, there's nothing to talk about; except perhaps the banning of a hate organization.  Yes, of course not all Christians should be painted with he same brush, that goes without saying, however if a show of solidarity needs to happen one would expect that our Canadian Christians would perhaps show their outrage and disapproval when atrocious acts are perpetrated by white terrorists.   (amended from other posters' comments about Islam and Muslims)
Skyofblue, how many Islamic extremists have we imported?  Almost none.  How many white supremacist right wing nut bars do we have?  A large number judging by the comments here.  It's best to focus on the larger problem facing the country, which is right wing extremism.
USA hasnt won a war since 1945 but they showed up late and let our people shed the blood. Their Military is not that great compared to other great nations of the past. Poor hispanics, poor white people from the trailer parks and blacks from the inner city do all the fighting. Bankers, wall street crowd stay home make money and cheer them on. What an interesting system they have created. More data is needed.................
As a muslim women she is comfortable with her association to a religion that has a bloody history (as they all do, religions) and a system where human rights violations continue to modern day (stoning of women comes to mind). We can't associate any of that with her because #notallmuslims. Let's talk about literal race  (whiteness) instead?? And let's lump all the white people into a single group, which is okay because they happen to be a majority in Canada so you can't be racist against the whites because there are a lot of them (logic).  As a Canadian women, there is nowhere else in the world that I would feel more secure and free. Is she completely unaware of the apparent dissonance in her beliefs. Celebrating Canada day is about celebrating 150 years of progress- for me is about celebrating the fact that women have equal rights, which sadly is not the scenario for many women around the world sadly.
Speak up, what is your problem with old white men with young Oriental women? The two murderers are men who sleep with other men.
White supremacy still running rampant. I don't see too many conservatives upset about a black man, being beaten by white supremacists (those champions of free speech, remember, and just really Very Concerned (TM) about conserving "history" - as if people use statues to learn about history.) and then getting served a WARRANT for fighting back against those evil racist thugs.   Seriously, what is the message we are supposed to take from this? If you are black, don't fight back against white thugs who are beating you because they are blatantly, openly racist, because you are not considered their equals?   https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-brutal-beating-of-black-man-by-white-supremacists-still-roils-charlottesville/2017/10/10/e5994132-a515-11e7-8cfe-d5b912fabc99_story.html?utm_term=.07c9e9f11d6e
Was the perp tanned? White or black? What was his race?
I'm not a "entitled white male" lol  You of course haven't a clue about what you speak of. You should be embarrassed of your ignorance.
whitesplaining, mansplaining: Both legitimate words. Both suggestive of white mens' arrogance.
Some of you white men truly love to talk about killing minorities. It is part of your white privilege and white heritage. All lives have never mattered to you.
It's the Black Lives Matter activists (a species of Islamic Black Power movement of the 1960s), within the administration, who are spear-heading this survey. It's their modus operandi. I just got shut out of a TDSB continuing ed course (beginner Spanish) by a rude intake agent (black); the other applicants were even older but white Caucasian -- and they received tender loving care. Obviously they're trying to limit the number of Asian-looking students in order to facilitate enrolment of others, preferably white. The Continuing Ed programs raise much needed $$$ from fee-paying students.
Mr. Trump restarted the fire. His spewing hate and anger fueled the burning racism. He knew the embers of hatred of our President had been kept alive in our Least in spite of our best. His incitement and encouragement emboldened them with hate and reinforced the fears of these ignorant, stupid, damaged and defective among us.  When cops kill for no valid reason and preferentially kill blacks it isn't necessarily because of Trump but it is to those they target an act of terror against them. It is an act of terror toward those communities and peoples they are supposed to protect. Trump  told them, black and white, that our country needed to fight fire with fire and kill the innocent families and loved ones of terrorists. So that is what the Dallas cop killer did to the family of cops. They love their fellow officers and stand together like a family. I hope all the haters and Trumpets understand that we didn't start the fire and that Trump has doused it with gasoline
Hancock knows the Black Community will vote 99% for a black candidate, no matter how little that politician does for them. He can screw them over all he wants to try and get the Hispanic vote. Throw in the 20% of white voters who love to pat themselves on the back for supporting illegals and he is untouchable.
Because the politically correct movement is racist against white people.  Period.
Seriously dude? You are an Old-White-Male headlining a piece "reeks of entitlement".  Um, could you possibly be more tone deaf?
You are the one making the false claim , back it up. The fact is you can't. White people get shot by the police too, more black people are shot by police, but it may be due to the fact 6% of the population(black men) commit 50 % of the violent crimes. They have more interaction with police. We don't have a police problem we have a black crime problem. That stat comes from FBI crime data and is well known. Unlike the lie you keep repeating.
Hillary Clinton is a white supremacist too, by their very own standards.  She lives in an all-white community, had an ex-Klansman for a mentor, and called blacks super predators. But I bet most of them voted for her anyway.
More unarmed whites have been shot by police in 2017 than blacks or hispanics. That is according to the bastion of conservatism the WaPo and their 2017 Police Shooting database. So I guess by adding two minority races to skew the numbers you can reach your conclusion, but I wouldn't say that 44% versus 56% is "far fewer white folks". I would say that "far fewer" unarmed hispanics are shot than whites (11 vs 19) and "far fewer" unarmed blacks than whites (12 vs 19) are shot by police. The data would seem to suggest that when unarmed and encountering the police you are almost twice as likely to be shot if you are white than if you are black and almost twice as likely to be shot if you are white than if you are hispanic.
I think that the intent of the flag in this case in most defiantly reliant. The children should of been educated as well. This flag to a some means something different than hate. Mattie Clyburn Rice is the daughter (correction from 1st post) of  Weary Clyburn who was an African American Soldier, seen this flag as her heritage. She wanted recognition for  father an all the African Americans who fought for the south. This flag offended me most of my life. I was a foster child who was in a group home where I was one of the only white girls there. I was then placed into a home in racist town, coming out of St. Vincent, I did not really free as comfortable around white children. It was different from what I knew. I was a target for this, they thought I would corrupt their kids by being friends with the African American kids. So that home did not last long. I choose to recognize the forgotten soldiers. I will say it still boils me thou to see ignorant ppl take pride in this flag for Hate.
whites & their corrupt boss Johann Rupert. We'll not let their stooges to rule on us.
This family sounds pretty trashy. Dad and grandma have a kid that just comes and goes however he pleases and has some party trailer on the property. Since it's the valley I assume they're all on meth. This is why in some states they have laws that punish parents if the kid misses too many days of school. There is way too much white trash crap in the valley. Is anyone out there normal?
No need for refuting since everything you claimed is absolute nonsense.  All you did was regurgitate the pipeline propaganda without any foundation in fact.  The local Sioux have lived there for a lot longer than the oil invaders and know about the history and archeology related to their own people.  You must be one of the oil slime joining Pluto as a mouthpiece for the Texas Oil Monopoly.  "Liberal Nazi" is right out of that White Supremacist/Limbaugh/Fox News dictionary of oxymoronic falsity.  Enjoy your fat salary from the Oil Barons while it lasts.  They will jettison you just like all the rest of the loyal propaganda trolls filling the opinion pages.
When BLM accused the white gay men of Toronto , who started Pride in 1981, a bunch of racists and oppressor class white supremacist, NOBODY came to their defense.  Being gay is one thing, but being white negates that.
Now I suppose we will hear a cadre of explainers tell us what Donald 'really' meant. Unacceptable tolerance of the intolerant, unbefitting the leader of the Free World.  “These groups seem to believe they have a friend in Donald Trump in the White House, and I would urge the president to dissuade that,” Graham said. Oh, but they do have a friend. Who is advising the President? Racist white supremacist Bannon (among others)! Who does Trump listen to and often praise? Putin. Walks like a duck....
More treacherous than Nixon?  Yet, the outgoing tyrant called white, christian, conservative a domestic terror threat.  Hey, Berstein, GPS!
Those aren't white people. Its only cool to hate on white people
How dare you. How dare you, a white girl who didn't vote for the most asinine inhuman being who ever became president, give me a ration 'o shit without using your real name.
I am not a Trump hater like some people here, just bash him for the sake of bashing him. I want to give him a little time, observe his action before passing any judgements. So far, all I found is unpredictability and instability. Recently, he handles the North Korean issue badly. The most disappointing is his stance on the Charlottesville incident. Be it liberals or conservatives, we have to draw a line somewhere; this country has no place for Nazism, White Supremacy and racism. We just have to stand up against such bigotries. His 'two sides' talk is absolutely ridiculous. There are no two sides; Nazism and racism is outright wrong!
Didn't the donald say that there were "some fine people" in the group of white supremacists, KKK, and Nazi's that were marching in charlotte?  That's your idol cajaybird, he said it himself.  aloha
After 7 years, the report card is in. The grades are not pretty. By every key economic measurement, blacks are worse off under Obama. In some cases, far worse off.  What about poverty? In 2009, the black poverty rate was 25.8 percent. As of 2014, according to Pew Research Center, the black poverty rate was 27.2 percent.  What about income? CNNMoney says, "Minority households' median income fell 9 percent between 2010 and 2013, compared to a drop of only 1 percent for whites."    What about net worth and the black-white "wealth gap"? The Financial Times said: "The median non-white family today has a net worth of just $18,100 -- almost a fifth lower than it was when Mr. Obama took office. White median wealth, on the other hand, has inched up by 1 percent to $142,000. In 2009, white households were seven times richer than their black counterparts. That gap is now eightfold.  When looking only at "black net worth" white households are actually 13 times wealthier than black households
I'm tired of the feminist rant.  As a middle aged white male, everyone is looking to blame their problems on me - problems from the past that I didn't have a hand in.  Suck it up princess - you've got far more choices than I do.
Actually Mr Racial Stereotype, I used to be a radical leftist, probably more radically left than you are. A common myth among leftists is that conservatives were "raised that way" and will "die off" leaving a progressive utopia. Wrong. LOL.  Deflecting to the deeds of some dead white people has nothing to do with your unwillingness to accept the fact that 1) blacks commit the highest per capita rates of crime, and 2) blacks commit nearly all interracial murders, and as such 3) white folks have a right to discuss it.   What you want to do is tell whites to shut up about being victimized while you can prattle on bashing whites and their history at will as a crutch.  You're a racist and a hypocrite, and you're deeply in denial.
I hope this passes! After all my years going to Boulder, having an office there, I've found the people there, though progressive and ultra liberal, ONLY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR WAY OF LIFE! Everything in Boulder is so lily white though the liberals there all yell and scream for diversity... and also... NIMBY... not in their pristine world. Just got finished dating a Boulder woman there and I could not be more disappointed in her as a person! She harped about equality and racial values yet not once did I ever see a black or Latino among her or any of her friends. What a bunch of hypocrites there! Plus, nobody except for trust funders or very wealthy folks can afford to live in Boulder anymore. She poo-pooed Denver neighborhoods yet I live in a completely paid off beautiful ranch, on 1/4 acre in a quiet neighborhood and she lives in a cramped townhouse that's claustrophobic and she paid $600K for basically a micro townhouse to live in Boulder. Haha!
"B'nai Brith Canada spokesman Daniel Koren said in an interview the posters seek to embolden white supremacists.  "The posters included coded signs and messages to people in underground movements who espouse hatred against Jewish people and others, he said.  "When you're promoting imagery that says to people who understand what it means — Jews will not replace us — and all those connotations, especially given recent neo-Nazi rallies, yes, I would say definitely the work of white supremacists," Koren said."  All grist for Mel's "satire."
Eh.  I've never even MET John Tetpon and I'm proud of him.  He stands up and tells the truth.  And these in-denial, oh-so-SUPERIOR white folks who go into a panic whenever anyone even suggests they're less than perfect hate him for it and screech that he's a WAAAAAAAAAY-cist!  Yeah, proud of John.  You, not so much.
if someone comes at me with a hammer or screwdriver and I have a gun I will shoot them.  I don't care if they are black, white red or have polka dots.
I'm sure they still have NO idea what could have possibly motivated this guy...(as he shouts Allahu Ahkbar). The west is commiting suicide thanks to Leftist policies of white guilt and branding everyone racist. Now thanks to Islamic "migration" (aka invasion) the once peaceful Sweden is the rape capital of the world. But you cannot speak against it or you're a "racist"! (even though Islam is a death cult and not a race).
Is that the white kind?  I mean since you hate whites so much?
So when do we put a bag over Trudeau's head for destroying white culture in Canada with Muslim and Chinese immigration??
We can already hear the Progressive lamentations:   "We only kill bad people and try to bring democracy to those living under brutal dictators." Apologies for bombing your wedding party...now we have to go protest microaggressions and white privilege.  P.S.  The Obama administration dropped 27,000 bombs, on at least, SEVEN Countries around the world in 2016...helped destabilize Syria and Libya.  Warmongers at the Dem propaganda ministry continue to push the idea that war with Russia is what the US admin should be focused on.   Go figure.    Hildebeast wanted war with Russia.  She Lost.  Get over it.
Strange to see white catholics defending white supremacists attacking hispanic catholics.  I guess some feel they gotta stand with their race, rather than their religion?
"White nationalists want an all white country"  And they aren't going to get it, this country has never been all white, and never will be, the whole concept is stupid, but, whatever.
Louisiana cop resigns after Facebook post about drowning white daughters who date black kids
Is what stinks now is that players are knealing because they can..  Against the President, against team owners, because it is vogue!!!  This all originated because C. Kap THINKS!!!!! that there is an injustice between the Police Force and non white Americans, thats bull and C Kap is an idiot!!  The problem soreley lies in our education system.. SOLUTION...  We need to pay whatever it takes to entice our best educators$$$$  to want to leave their cushy Beverly Hills jobs and go deep down into our inner cities to teach these kids, along with more $ to better educate our police force...  This solution would take approximatley 18 yrs.  The only problem with that is that our NFL wouldn't include some of the best athletes, alot of them would be Doctors Lawyers and Judges!!  Oops!,  I forgot that we need an answer now...  Yep!!  It's got to be the police!!!!!!!!!!!
Geoff, you sound like a racist. Do you have something against Indians? Your comments usually has racial undertones and favor a white narrative. Whites are also implicated in Gupta corruption saga, not only individual from the Indian sub-continent. If you can't find any corrupt whites tight with the Guptas, just look at South African history. You living in the past.
Trump made fun of women's appearances. He made fun of women's periods.  His infamous line: "grab 'em by the p****"   And despite all of this:  He won 53% of the white female vote  45% of college educated female voters  42% of women's votes overall  And 9 million more women than men vote in the US election.  Women had the opportunity to break the biggest glass ceiling in the world and vote for a female candidate that was also the globe and fail's preferred candidate as they have constantly reminded us after the election, but chose not to. The biggest whiners, Ms. Renzetti, are reserved for those who participated in the women's march the day after he was elected and could not accept the result of a democratic election.
Sing it, Mr. Krustofski.  The only thing close to a violent incident I have experienced in Anchorage is when a white male threatened his girlfriend at my gym, my husband approached and told him to knock it off, the perp was about to hit my husband, and a recent arrival from Sudan backed up my husband, yelling loudly, so the white male creep backed off. Yes women have to be careful - that's what we've been told all our lives, it's nothing new.  The only male who was violent with ME (when I was a girl) was white, too.  I have learned to not pre-judge all white males as ignorant creepy perverts - it's ignorant to judge people by the color of their skin. So knock it off! Oh wait, I forgot the alcoholic who pointed his shotgun at me, way out on a trial north of Talkeetna - yeah, you guessed it, white male too.
The real Nazi's are the ones that call themselves Neo Nazi's and White Supremacists.   They are listed as hate groups.     When you speak of Socialist progressive scum, who are you referring to specifically?  Be specific.
You're happy to purposefully 'step on the rights' of black, brown, AND WHITE people( that's what you meant by 'these people', right? we all know it) when you speak of confiscation of all handguns/semi-automatic anything, and making sure no one is allowed any long guns unless they meet your strict storage laws, but mention a crackdown on any 'particular area or particular persons' and you'd scream OMG RACIAL PROFILING  MY RIGHTS MY RIGHTS DISCRIMINATION NO etc etc.  Funny, most of the meth heads, shoplifters, thieves, low-lifes, and drug dealers in my neighborhood are white... no stepping on rights of 'brown or black' people here... didn't see that in the article either... hmm...
The problem with the Catholic faith, other religions, government, the military, law enforcement, and criminal justice is this; they are all dominated by men, and mostly by white authoritarian men! Sorry guys, but most men aren't known for their empathy for others or planning for the long term versus short term pleasure. In Trump we see these negative qualities magnified a thousand times. Frankly, I'm sick of it! All the institutions that make countries a good place where their citizens can thrive would be much improved if at least half the people wielding power and making decisions were women! More than half would be even BETTER! Now we see what the world is coming to. Short term greed takes precedence over the environment. Short term greed is more important than people and communities. Make no mistake, we are killing ourselves. But the authoritarian white men causing this genocide will be long dead before their grandchildren start paying the price.
When Faye Steward used the word "we" above he was referring to the white majority not to any of his non-white fellow citizens, people who every bit as American as he is. The kind of "help" Steward espouses in the above quote is the patronizingly racist variety. He thinks he can "help" by availing himself of his god-given right as a white man to decide which "others" can participate in the "inclusiveness" he and those in  his privileged position might be willing to offer (usually very limited).  This particular part of his disgustingly condescending homily was particularly instructive, "then hopefully get them back to where they can live stably in their country." I say that Faye Stewart should be sent back to whatever country his likely ignorant, racist European ancestors came from since he's having a negative impact on the lives and safety of American citizens, not to mention that he makes me want to retch.
Yo ho, can you explain to me why white men commit 99% of child sex crimes, and usually kill their prey?
Diversity and multiculturalism are code words for white genocide, white people are being ethnically cleansed from Canada and the fake news Globe and Mail is a big promoter of it, even the picture in the article has to be a race mixing couple, they love to promote the mixing to wipe out the white race.
The title has been changed to "We need to talk about Islamophobia, white supremacy and far-right terrorism" . I say - we need to talk about radical Islam, mass immigration, mass migration, and about  Lefties NOT willing to talk about radical Islam, mass immigration and  mass migration.
"So I apologize to your white privilege.” George Lopez is a racist.
Yet had this punk, regardless of his color, shot an innocent person, people would be up in arms at the police for not stopping crime. Oh wait, that's only if the perp was white and killed a black person. It's okay of black people kill other black people. Just look at Chicago.
Oh poor white folks. Call me a racist because I have an opinion and say it just like the rest of you do. Poor white folks.
I want the totem poles removed from Stanley Park because I am offended by the behaviour of the Miqmaq in Halifax,threatening to tear down the statue of Cornwallis.Real civil behaviour.Why don't we all go back 268 years and file some grievances?We all have some.Even the evil white man.
You are adding oranges to the apples in a weak attempt to tweak the numbers.    You have been called out for your deceit multiple times by many people and you respond with childish insults and unfounded allegations of racism.  Is the truth that black people murdered almost a thousand more people in 2015 than white people that painful for you?  Own it.
"When BLM accused the white gay men of Toronto , who started Pride in 1981, a bunch of racists and oppressor class white supremacist, NOBODY came to their defense. Being gay is one thing, but being white negates that."  BLM was certainly lambasted on these comment boards for its self-defeating and ignorant stunt.
Minority borrowers are still more likely to get turned down for conventional mortgage loans than white people with similar credit scores. An Urban Insititute data analysis found that mortgage denial rates from government-sponsored servicers are higher for black applicants with bad credit than for white applicants with bad credit:  A study published this year in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that participants estimated black boys to be older and less innocent than white boys of the same age. When participants were told that the boys, both black and white, were suspected of crimes, the disparity in perceptions of age and innocence became more stark:  White Americans use drugs more than black Americans, but black people are arrested for drug possession more than three times as often as whites. Black men receive prison sentences 19.5 percent longer than those of white men who committed similar crimes, a 2013 report by the U.S. Sentencing Commission found.
Way off. 13% refers to men, women, and kids. White men 31% of the population.  Black men 3.5%. Black men are FORTY times more likely to commit a violent crime. I love it you think wikipedia is reliable. Go to the Us Census and the DOJ. That's where I get my "lies" OK Ericsnot?
All drunk white idiots, and yet none of them are dead.
Wouldn't that defeat the whole purpose of the term "alt-right"?  The term began as a catch-all for a mainly Internet-based melange of traditional liberals, libertarians, and conservatives who oppose the accelerating influence of the authoritarian left (itself a melange of radical leftists, radical feminists, Communists, pro-Islamist, pro-censorship, college activist types). It's purpose has been to delegitimize non-authoritarian forms of liberalism and their concerns (e.g.: civil liberties and human rights, anti-authoritarianism, anti-globalization, pro-labour, legal due process, media skepticism, free exchange in the marketplace of ideas) by associating them with authoritarian right-wing ideologies like white supremacy, Neo-Nazism, Islamophobia, etc.    I get why you would think that you're "calling a spade a spade" by refusing to use the term "alt-right", but the whole point of it is to slyly associate liberalism with Neo-Nazism without courting libel.
I think I saw somewhere that this White House, comrade Trumppowsky band Muslims from visiting US and to travel to this country, JUST BECAUE THEY WERE MUSLIM!! HELLO!! Who is intolerant?  Our President just sided with the Nazis and fascist and white supremacists.  Hello!
For those who think they are white as snow and without blemish I must repeat this truth: From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.  People, this is not gossip and hearsay.
Oh sorry, I'll explain. Pocho used to start many of his rants by saying "I'm not a white guy, but......".  So, what I'm saying comes directly from Pocho's past claims.  He would say he's not white because he thought it gave credibility to some of his racist rants and defense of racist white guys.  I have saved many of Pocho's rants as screen shots if you need clarification.   I agree, why is Pocho even posting.  Sorry if your delicate white, brainless, nature has been offended.
If the risk is high enough that someone would have to be a complete idiot to take part in it, why don't we have open seasons for the trails and closed seasons? Single track fatbiking in the winter has minimal chance of a bear encounter. Get real... its not black and white.
Anyone involved in the violence is rotten, not just the white nationalist morons.  We need to stop acting based on race and start acting based on integrity.
No shock there, Trump is a white supremacist and has been since the 70s.
Everyone should speak out strongly against neo-Nazism, white supremacy, and domestic terrorism. Just count me as a little cynical when it comes to Cory Gardner.
If you are white, then you are almost certainly already dead. No living person is white.
It was a culture of drunken violence and neglect the white man was trying to save the kids from. Still do.
It's cute to watch Corker fire back at Trump's childish tweets, and his concerns about Trump are obviously valid, but a larger problem looms; the 50+ million Americans who still think Trump is doing a great job as president. Although Trump is pathetically bereft of any presidential abilities, he does know how to communicate with his base of fearful, angry, xenophobic White voters.
Meanwhile "tough guy" white supremacist leader Christopher Cantwell is in hiding and has released a teary eyed video during which he whines (between sniffles) that there is a warrant out for his arrest and he doesn't know what to do.   Poor, poor, white supremacist - he now claims he wants to be peaceful and that all the previous talk about killing was just "internet talk".  Of course, following Charlottesville, he was interviewed on Vice (as described in this editorial) during which he said the killing of Heather Heyer was justified and in which he bragged about violence.  Now the white supremacist leader is weeping like a 4 year old caught stealing a lolly.     It's almost embarrassing to watch until you remember that this guy is a racist, white supremacist "leader".    Just pathetic.
Which is why we are not going to be a 'white' nation in the future. The world will be brown.
Wow. Lots of white tears here. Delicious!
The hard truth is that many minorities simply can't compete academically with Asian and White students. What most people don't know is that the best predictor of success on the SAT is race, not socioeconomic status. Even poor Asian students fresh off the boat will routinely outperform wealthy blacks and Hispanics. This isn't racism. It is what it is.
Seriously?  What's the problem?  These are young people who were brought here as children through no choosing of their own.  The U.S. is the only country they have ever known; they have gone to school here, worked here, started their families here, and been good and decent members of their communities (any who are found to have criminal records are not eligible under DACA).  The U.S. has, for decades, gladly allowed in - given them the old "winky winky" - undocumented workers from Mexico to do the jobs white people haven't been much interested in, jobs in the fields picking our fruits and vegetables and building our houses through the construction trades. Now, suddenly, under the racist demagogue Trump the tides are turned against them and we are telling them we're going to round them up and ship them off?  Just like that?  What kind of a stupid, racist, backstabbing country is this?  That's the problem.
Not true! white supremacist and ultra right-wing nationalist groups in the US and world-wide have documented their assertion that Jews are an inferior "race" and should be cleansed from their respective populations.. Radical Islamists do feel similarly...they all belong under the banner of hate groups and should be rooted out.
"Trump is a product of many angry, mostly white Americans"  What an ugly racist comment.
There was an interesting article in the Atlantic recently that exposed Mr. Simmons' and other HRC parrots who consistently accuse poor whites of being ignorant, racist, religious zealots who are mindlessly following Trump based on fear of "the other." The point of the Atlantic article is that many elite whites, especially those in  academia, are blind to their own deep seated hatred for the lower classes in America. Since they are boxed in by their own safe spaces of alleged racial tolerance, they have no problem whatsoever unleashing baseless vitriolic rants against poor and lower class whites. I call it safe hate. Essentially, this article is no different than Fox News code words like "thug". Far left ideologues are basically waging a Northern Strategy which routinely demonizes white lower and middle classes. The irony is that it is all being done to elect HRC so she can carry on with the incredibly racist foreign and domestic policies she has supported for decades. Utter hypocrisy.
Trudeau praised and complimented the women. But attendee Lianna Rice attacked Trudeau by saying with contempt that "white men" represented Canada. What a racist and misandrist.
i am white. no one disputes a right to express oneself. but you ought to have a good reason if your going to do it this way. they're saying there's a problem with the country in general, not just the police or some particular issue. your saying, despite all the anti-racism efforts in this country, that this country has/is oppressing black people, and by inference you're saying the very whites in the stands are blameworthy. meanwhile whites quietly put up with the massive amount of crime blacks commit. we're absolutely disgusted.
Oh, hey Yepper et al. I like this version of your latest user name (● ● ● ●● ● ● •●•●•). Cute. A little more subtle than this one: 'Trump is a sick, fascist, white supremacist traitor. A worthless stain on America.'    Not trying to be offensive, but perhaps you should seek mental health assistance.  You've let Trump's election totally unhinge you and it's doing no one any good.  Until your next identity... <mute>
I've said it before, but I'll say it again - the death throes of the racist, misogynist white male are really something to see. They are apoplectic that their time is almost over. It's a beautiful sight.
Another false, inane comment from one whose political ideology is directly opposed to the Constitutional Republic and all human rights and freedom contained therein.  Still hanging onto all of the false mythology of spitting on soldiers used by the same anti-American Republicans, White Supremacists, CONservatives and all of the rest of those responsible for the incompetent, criminal occupants of the current government, nationally and locally.  Patriotism exists only in the outward signs of flag waving, lapel pins, and clothing covering the black hearts and souls of traitors to the nation.  Denigrating one of the best columnists and this column which truly addresses the real veterans' issues ignored by this ideological moron.
While I know you'e trying to push buttons, let me point out that you are correct in your statement about these types of crimes. The majority of these types of crime are committed by whites.  Please be honest and tell us what race the majority of the violent crimes are committed by. No one said anything about whites being innocent. We all have our bad eggs.
I can't pick a winner, I was 1-4 in the NFL too. Crazy white guy shooting a bunch of country music loving, mostly whites. It's a crazy world.
I'm not alone in feeling uneasy about a public schoolteacher in Canada talking to 12-year-olds about how "the lesson of the day is white privilege... that white people enjoy unearned advantages due to their race."  And that feeling of unease isn't helped by the article's account of a teacher's response to a student, a kid who said in class that the "white privilege" mantra amounted to racism against white people. Shockingly, reading above, I see the teacher replied to the kid: "Coming from a white male...".  That is stomach churning. I wonder, is the teacher was bright enough to realize that, ironically, the kid's suspicion was verified by the teacher's reply?  The kid's correct: Stereotyping ALL white people, which is what preaching "white privilege" inescapably does, is racist. White people are diverse and sorry, but no, I DO NOT trust the public schoolteacher to walk students through the complexities of this, given that bullying, shut-down line of "Coming from a white male"...
Hail Trump!': White Nationalists Salute the President Elect Video of Nazis conferencing in Washington, D.C., where Trump’s victory was met with cheers and Nazi salutes. Watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o6-bi3jlxk Trump's advisors are known Nazis and known Nazi supporters. Here's some reading for any of you Nazi defenders who think you can deny it. https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism?utm_term=.pjbq6dyEL#.rubRY70KM
Trump is a mentally unbalanced weak and belligerent child.  He's a wanna-be fascist and a white supremacist buffoon.  He's conned all his supporters and his scam is falling apart all around his shoulders and their shoulders.
In the immortal words of St. Tonto:  "What do you mean our church, white man?"
`I can scarcely recall what I imagined the internet would bring when it bloomed a generation ago. But my speculation about an interconnected future did not include reading the real-time rage-tweets of a malevolent clown while he sits in the White House throne room, having been placed there by traitors, racists, misogynists and assorted goddamned nitwits. Nope. I did not see that coming.
Piper probably doesn't know the first thing about calculus had not white men taught her. This is ridiculous. She should be fired.
Nazism wants to eradicate all non-white races. This is a call to violence and an attempt to incite violence against those groups.  I do not disagree that we should allow everyone the ability to say what they want, up until it calls openly for the death of other people. That is against the law and that is what the nazis are doing. They want to kill all jews, blacks, and LGBTQ persons, oh yeah and anyone else they might have beef with that day.  So yes if you defend the words the Nazis are speaking then you are a nazi sympathizer and are equal to the nazis.  If you are defending their right to speak openly about it, then I agree, however only to the point where the start calling for the death of fellow Americans.  We(as a nation) collectively get pissed off when N. Korea kills one kid, or when ISIS says they will destroy our country, but we cannot be upset a bunch of nazi larpers want be able to openly call for ethnic cleansing the USA. That is silly. They are calling for mass murder.
Tom: The Southern Poverty Law Center is the leading organization for tracking racists and hate groups in the USA, outside of the FBI.  And they list the Nation of Islam as a racist group that spreads hatred.  And Ali has been a member ever since 1964.  They are an extremist fringe sect of Islam with less than 40,000 members.    So it is not I that is judging the Nation of Islam, the Southern Poverty Law Center is.   Just read what they say about the nation of Islam at the link I have posted:      https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam  Here is quote from their description of NOI:  "The Nation of Islam's theology of innate black superiority over whites and the deeply racist, anti-Semitic and anti-gay rhetoric of its leaders have earned the NOI a prominent position in the ranks of organized hate."  I guess that you are OK with their bashing and denigrating of LGBT people too.   I condemn all hate groups listed on the SPLC website.   Do you???
Trump only gets upset if the attacker is not Caucasian, or a white supremacist. The history is there. It's easy to see. He just wants to boost his racist base, and politicize these events by non-Caucasians in order to pass his racist agenda.
You said it, they just want to be white.  Same like some of responses to my comments.
You are correct by any definition. The difference is that the founding documents of the US did state that all are created equal and we have been striving to live up to that ideal ever since. The founding documents of the confederacy flat out stated that blacks are slaves and only count as 3/5ths.   In other words, the US had an ideal that all humans are equal and we have tried to live up to that ideal ever since. The Confederacy had the ideal that only whites could be free and blacks were chattel.  Slavery and white supremacy are evil and deserve no honor.
If you want to have a conversation about prejudice begin by teaching real historical facts.... Which Eugene 4j does not teach!  The journey of a black slave to life long servitude often began in the interior of Africa with his or her capture as a prize of war by other black tribesmen, as tribute given by a weak tribal state to a more powerful one, or by outright kidnapping by black local slave traders. European/white slave traders very rarely ventured beyond Africa's coast regions. The truth is blacks enslaved blacks! In America the culture of white guilt syndrome has become the poisonous ignorance of sensitivity cupcakes teaching [more like breeding] in public schools more ignorant sensitivity cupcakes the hallmark of Eugene 4j.
There is a culture war that's been going on long before i was born. The left is brainwashing whites mainly through TELEVISION and the SCHOOL SYSTEM. The result is a "liberal" white or a "liberal feminist white", etc that is trying to prove to other races that there not a "racist" by turning on there own race and helping the same people that WANT US GONE or OUT THE WAY!   These liberal whites are useful idiots for the Real Racists and are helping push there agenda of getting rid of the white culture and race. Whites need to all stand together no matter what walk of life you come from, defend eachother, reproduce more, hold other races accountable for there inability to control there actions and mouth, call out these unfair programs pushing minorities into hard working white communities and eating away at them like cancer through drugs and crime. Otherwise white culture will continue to slowly die, and more cities, neighborhoods and communities will be more like third world countries,
These illegal cockroaches have got the nerve, here in the country illegally and making demands. Mexico would shoot white people for doing the same. Send them all home to their homeland before they turn the U.S. into a sewer like mexico.
Bravo ! Old white males just need to.learn to "STFD" (Sit Tha Fuck Down).  this type of unjust inequality which pervades all throughout western society is in reality the contemporary version of the white supremacist ideology which has fueled white christian genocide, slavery, domination, oppression and imperialism throughout the world for centuries.  the world is changing and diversity and equality are rising up everywhere so old white men just need to "STFD" !
I never thought I would see the day that we would have s RACIST president in the white house that would bring this out in people to the point that we don't watch football because his absence minded self says it's about the military and disrepcting the flag. THIS SHIT IS FUNNY. I still watch football on Sundays Monday night and Thursday but it's planning on what good team is on. GOD is just shacking his head and crossing his children off his list to get into his HOUSE. All of this with the president is someting that the more and more he changes the focus off of him to something or someone else it's better for him and people just do what the KING says if your a REAL FAN of football your going to watch the games regardless, if your not watching your not a TRUE fan at all. But since it's about BLACK MEN WHITE don't want to hear it or talk about it like they say it's no rascism in America. BLACK players making all this money what r they complaining for. SAD all of u
Joe Arpaio’s tenure as Sheriff was characterized by gratuitous cruelty, racism, incompetence, and systematic violations of constitutional rights.   So Donald Trump’s pardon of him was overdetermined:  It is highly relevant that Trump and Arpaio first became allies while Trump was rising to prominence within the Republican Party by pushing the racist conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in the United States.   The Arizona sheriff actually launched a farcical investigation into Obama’s birth certificate, wasting taxpayer money to build his cred with his resentful white supporters.   That Arpaio and Trump would become mutual admirers was inevitable.  They are both racist buffoons.
We have not degraded the church as a moral guide, the church historically has degraded itself in horrific demented behavior. This is an excellent example; while white European Christians called us savages because of our gods, white PC liberals are calling us uncivil savages because of our mascots.
Why does Islamophobia exist? Four reasons:   1. While many Muslims are nice people, invite 20 million to come here, and Canada will be a Muslim society with a Muslim government. Some Canadians ask themselves: Do we want to live in a society similar to those in the Middle East? Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for Sharia law.   2. The violent conflicts between Muslim groups in the Middle East are well known. Do we want to import those conflicts into Canada?   3. Many Canadians from Europe are familiar with the "white slave trade". Between 1600 and 1830, 2.6 million white girls and boys were kidnapped and sold in the Middle East slave markets to serve as labourers, domestics and sex slaves in harems. The Barbary pirates in North Africa sailed as far north as Ireland & Iceland to kidnap white children. (continued below)
Too late Gerson, they're already the parody of their orange, pu**y grabbing prophet. Now when I think of white Christians I think of Donny telling his joke about 2 Corinthians (who walk into a bar?) or those hilarious photos of Christians laying hands on Trump while his former call-girl wife looks on (hey, their relationship is no doubt kinky but at least it's authoritarian, right?). Whatever model of ideal Christianity one would choose, there could be no person whose life is more an example of the opposite of that ideal than Donald Trump. This is what I find so riotously funny about the predicament of white Christians and all of their sympathizers. In Trump the finishing touches have been added to their two-bit, cartoon version of Christianity. Now every one can point and laugh heartily at the grotesque hypocrisy of this spectacle before it tumbles under the weight of its own crapulence.
The #MuslimBan is racist.  There is no rational basis for it and you are demeaning people by suggesting stereotypes.  You are suggesting ugly things about Islam despite the fact that I can point equally ugly things in the Bible.  Real people are getting hurt by Trump and his policies and his racist supporters.  There is a climate of hate that is being justified in this country and the innocent are paying the price because some uneducated white bullies in PA think that it is okay to hurt others because their own lives suck.
100% BS.....even "conservative" bishops spend 20-50X as much money on liberal social justice nonsense than they do on "conservative" issues like opposing abortion and defending marriage.   The Catholic bishops have been whores for liberal garbage like Nancy Piglosi, Ted Kennedy, Biden, and the rest of the Democratic Left.  Meanwhile, the civil rights of WHITE ETHNIC CATHOLICS have been under assault for decades:  forced busing...racial quotas....affirmative action....diversity garbage.  The black political establishment is the ENEMY of Catholics and the Church.  A Chuch whichi is 97% white has no business ass-kissing anti-Catholic Negroes.  Time to act accordingly.
Why are people (and especially, the press) unable to see the obvious: Trump is a white supremacist. He is a racist. This is not new. This is not some theory. His racism is one of the big attractions to his voters. The polls show this, his history shows this, and his current behavior shows this. It's like "The Emperor's New Clothes"!  No one wants to believe what is obvious!
"If I thought that gun laws would stop the deluge of mass killings I would support them"  that has got to be the stupidest comment I've read today.  Like you know for sure for sure, yeah?  LOL  You've said dumb things before ....and I've said dumber things before, but seriously?  Are you high?  HE'S DEAD!  HOW IN THE HECK IS HE DOING THIS FOR PUBLICITY?  oh my, wiping eyes.  I can't read anymore.  My side hurts: laughing and crying.    Stupid white men.  You and Jimmy Out.  You and Jimmy.  Go to the corner.  Do not stop.  Just sit there.
Your premise is truly stupid. No one was removing the statue at that time, and the march of the NAZIs and KKK was through the racially integrated University of Virginia. The chants were "You won't replace us" and "Jews won't replace us." It was a white supremacy march against an America where black and brown people have equal rights. It wan't about some cheesy statue of a general who became a traitor to the nation of his birth, the United States of America.
Your comment is insipid.  I never said there is no racism, so stop your brainless accusation.  And think about the implication of what you say --- that unless black and whites are picked up in equal proportions, the reason must be racism.  What idiocy.  Does it ever occur to you that the incidence of black violent crime far outstrips white violent crime?
Playing the race card is silly.  Also inappropriate.   Even mild reflection will show that this is not about the race of the man, but rather that he is a friend of Butts and is being paid extravagantly well above the normal rate for the position.  I would have exactly the same concerns if he was white.   Or any other colour for that matter.
WHEN is that guy in the white shirt and dark glasses, short hair going to be apprehended/arrested?  He has shown up in several photos, mostly notably he was one of those beating up that black teenager in the parking lot. geesus.
Hey Johnny, apparently you live on Jupiter, because you're so utterly uninformed that you don't know about Dylan Roof.  Racist, white supremacist Christian who committed a deplorable act of terror.  So in other words, you're an idiot as well as a bigot.
I just heard a wishy washy president where one day he tried to blame everyone, then he specifically condemned white racists, then he quickly defended them again.  Whiplash is a real danger with this clown.
This whole affair is getting scary. The media and the left are complete morons.  Donald trumps exact words were the KKK, white supremacist, and neo nazis are repugnant and there is no place for violence in this country. What do you stupid idiots in the media not understand. Those words can't be any clearer. The CEO's coming out saying we totally disagree with Trump and then they say the exact words Trump used. They sound like they are braindead never mind CEO's of corporations. The head of the Democratic party Hilary Clinton's mentor was Robert Byrd, a leader in the KKK, and Trump called the KKK repugnant and he disavows them. yet, the media comes out and says Trump is racist. No, the media  are the biggest racist we have ever seen and the democratic party is 10 times more racist the the Republicans. Oh, and it was Dems that started the KKK in the first place.
Of course you don't consider yourself a bigot, racist or homophobe. Most people like to think of themselves as good people. But your man actively and consistently appealed to white resentment, arousing the enthusiasm of bigots, racists and homophobes; racist dog whistling was a main driver of Trump's campaign. Nothing could make the essence of Trumpism more explicit than the appointment of Steve Bannon as chief White House strategist and senior counselor. Steve Bannon is a white supremacist, misogynist agitator who turned Breitbart into a neo-Nazi swamp.  https://thinkprogress.org/steve-bannons-disturbing-views-on-genetic-superiority-are-shared-by-trump-243d73866e2d#.7ah2i9nyn  You Trump supporters have the audacity to deny Bannon and neo-Confederates like Jeff Sessions are racists and jump into high dudgeon over being associated with the virulent wing of the Trump constituency. Well, that's too bad. You jumped into bed with neo-fascists, deal with the blowback.
The German National Socialists are the more obvious ones....also North Korean Communists carry out massive torchlight parades...a pox on the White Suprematists , BLM and the globalist black hooded rent a riotists.
Having white supremacists and neo-nazis in the White House and serving as surrogate spokespeople for the president is bearing its rotten fruit. There is nothing good about white supremacists and nazis freely spewing hate speech. President Trump should condemn this immediately and soundly.
hipsters, white people with dreadlocks, credit card hippies, and self-entitled self-righteous over privileged idealistic white millenials.   if i were a minority, a woman or gay, these would be the absolute last people i would want taking up my cause, or attempting to represent my interests and/or frustrations.  but alas, i am in fact the problem- a thirty-something white male- the sole cause of every injustice ever perpetrated on anyone or anything since the damn of humankind.  and i've never been so ashamed.
Wonder how many from this "sizable minority" also fear all the white guys here given that pedophilia and other perverted sex crimes are usually committed by white guys.
It doesn't matter how you classify it, it's not terrorism. If a white person walks into South Central LA with some racist slogans on his t-shirt, he's probably going to be shot. That's not terrorism either. He walks in there knowing the risks that he's taking, people are going to want to hurt him for my beliefs or actions. Showing up at a nightclub, church, school, or theater, we'd like to think we're safe. Radical Muslims are proving otherwise, and that is why they are terrorists. And they are here and now, you had to go back 20 years to find an abortion clinic murder.
Oh, Trump has a "black friend". LOL  The DOJ and the Urban League caught Trump committing illegal anti-black housing discrimination. He instructed his supers to mark applications from black applicants with a "C" for colored. The Urban League sent test renters to Trump properties, some black, some white, all with similar qualifications. The white applicants were accepted, black applicants were told "no vacancy" or they were steered toward a predominantly black Trump property. A black husband went to a Trump property and was declined. His white wife went to the same property almost immediately after and was accepted. Segregation. This isn't just words. This affects freedom of movement of black Americans. It's illegal. DOJ went after Trump a second time because he didn't adhere to the first agreement.  Did you think it was an accident that neo-Nazi Richard Spencer and Klansman David Duke and the international white supremacist movement were so passionate about Trump? Segregation.
I cannot process this.  Our country voted for a fascist.  Why have so few white men evolved?  I hope that all of the evolved, intelligent white men do not take offense because I do not include you, in fact I love you; but I despise white men.
The white supremacists march in with militias in bulletproof jackets, forage caps and assault weapons and Trump blames "many sides"? Hmmm.
Full of twiggy, pasty skinned millennials.  Are you suggesting that only white people like fried chicken?  I'd suggest that fried chicken is loved by all fat people.
Ronni:....well that takes care of that.  1500 people come out to march against racism and you simply dismiss them as "just another bunch of deadbeats trying to conflate Trump with racism."   Actually, the person "conflating" Trump with racism is  David Duke.    David Duke, the former KKK grand wizard, is unambiguous about what Saturday’s alt-right and neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, means to him: It’s the fulfillment of President Donald Trump’s vision for America. “We are determined to take our country back,” Duke said from the rally, calling it a “turning point.” “We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That’s what we believed in. That’s why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he’s going to take our country back."    It's no big secret that a solid part of Trump' base of support encompasses the ault-right, the white supremacists and the white nationalists.  It's silly to attempt to deny this relationship...it's right there in front of you.  Gary Crum
Most of the world has had and always will have racist at part of their base. "The biggest racist on Earth are American White Liberals that hate their own color, race, country and flag" This happens no where but here and is the main reason that indeed "Liberalism is a mental disorder" It can be explained no other way to a rational, logical person!
That is just nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, Purgatrix Ineptiae!  For example, for every Protestant Episcopalian or Presbyterian with a college degree and post-grad degree, making over 100,000 dollars, one can find 10 Catholics of equal income and education, according to Pew Researchers. Catholics overwhelmingly outperform Protestant America, if only owing to their size and critical mass of highly educated and wealthy adherents. Even if all Episcopalians and Presbyterians together were in the upper category, as it were, they still wouldn't equal the 8 million Catholics in the said category.  Finally, I think Sean is alluding to this segment of US Catholicism when he says without immigrants, the CC could become -- quite easily -- an upper middle class rich white church.
I'm confused by what you wrote.  Perhaps you would clarify.   You state: "we white practitioners are totally baffled by how we change the meta dynamics of family structure in Native communities."  Then, you go on to talk about the high level of child sexual abuse in those communities and the increasing rate of teenage suicide. Are you suggesting that white practitioners are changing the dynamics of family structure in such a way that abuse is increased?  Or are the two coincidental?  Or is it that you are baffled that you are unable to change the dynamics?   I'm sorry that my question may be stupid, but I'm really unclear about what you wrote.
There are also a lot more whites killing whites than cops killing whites.
On top of that, Bannon is the "Breibart man", an "alter-right", white supremacist and racist" entertainer, while Priebus is a part of the "Washington establishment", so much hated by the President Elect. There will be cock fights at the White House and/or, perhaps, a casino or two?
I suspect that all the criminals are white. Other wise they would be called thugs, or worse.
Majority (56%) Believes Use of Army to Build Shelters for Asylum Seekers Shows Issue is Out of Control and Being Poorly Managed   Six in Ten (62%) Believe Trudeau Lacks Solid Plan to Fix Migrant Issue in Quebec as Majority (67%) Believe Migrants are Just Trying to Skip the Line, Not Legitimate Refugees   https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/six-ten-62-believe-trudeau-lacks-solid-plan-fix-migrant-issue   In other news, liberals claim 62% of Canadians are clearly racists, possibly white supremacists.
Oh that poor "little (white) guy," when he realized he's really not that different from the poor brown and black people he decided to do what his 1% masters tell him. "Vote for the far-Right," they said. And he's so well-trained he did. He will be rewarded some puppy bites and won't be able to figure out why he's still hungry but he'll wait patiently because master says he'll have his special place in the racial hierarchy. He's so obedient and loyal, the 1% man's best friend.
White privilege is absolute nonsense.  I was raised in a lower middle class family with four brothers.  I worked from the age of 9 as a paperboy up until I could get working papers at 14 and continued working through College.  I paid my own way thru College because my parents did not have any money. I was hired as a Police Officer in 1987 and have worked there since.   I was not given any special treatment, in fact the opposite at the time due to minority hiring practices that required women and minorities to be hired in front of white males, even though the entrance scores on the civil service test could be 30 points less.  I did not have an issue with this, but to claim I had white privilege because I am a white male is ridiculous.   white lash is another made up term by the progressive left.    Can you show me some of the "advantages" that I received as a white male?
yes, this is stupid, cast at least a Polynesian person.  these Hollywood producers have no Akamai, just pupule.  can a non-white be cast as a white boy?
Isn't that a convenient excuse?  Imply that those who didn't vote for you were too stupid to know better? Then, fall back on a tired liberal lie that it must have been due to underlying misogyny and sexism? I'm sorry, Ms. Clinton. That just isn't true. And, it's horribly sexist and misogynistic to suggest that it is, implying that we white women are so stupid, we need the men in our lives to tell us what to do. As one white woman who has been following you and your husband since the 1992 election, I can say that it's the lies, corruption, class warfare arguments, and lack of a message (or a soul) that soured me on both of you long ago. There's no way I'd vote for you. But, if there was ever a female candidate that I agreed with and I thought could do a great job, with real accomplishments behind her, you better believe I'd vote for her in a heartbeat. But, like millions of others, my vote is not a lock based on gender affiliation. There are other things that matter more.
>>Duke Charles Martel >>Are you a muslim Alceste? ... To that question, Alceste has a canned answer - "Are you a White Supremacist?".. or "At least I am not a White Supremacist?" Either way - it is pretty telling how he feels about himself. And what does he equates being Muslim with. ..
No, it's you who's been thoroughly discredited here. You either don't understand what you're looking at or purposely misrepresent it. Either way, you've been owned. Blacks DO commit more homicides as a raw number than whites, even with hispanic/latinos factored into the "white" category, and a vastly disproportionate amount per capita. I've already linked to the data, you can keep your head in the sand and cry "racism!" all you want, but you're done here.
She just helped our cause for Oleary tremendously. Thanks for reminding us what makes a Marxist Liberal tick You self righteous Liberal people are obnoxious. Signed racist, bigoted, evil, white middle class, no-aligned but soon to be aligned male deplorable
Trump responds to accusations of racism with fake photo of black supporters.   At a Friday afternoon rally in California, Trump sought to highlight his support from minorities.   “Look at my African-American over there,” he shouted.  He seems to have made things worse, with many noting that his phrasing implied ownership over the man.  This morning on Twitter, Trump was back at it, highlighting the support of an African-American family.   Just one problem. The photo is fake.   It was not taken at a Trump event. Rather, it was taken at the “The 27th annual Midwest Black Family Reunion” held in Ohio in August 2015. Yhe annual event attracts more than 100,000 people over 3 days.  Last year, Trump attracted controversy when he retweeted fake statistics claiming 81% of white murder victims were murdered by blacks. The actual figure is 14%.  “All I know is what is on the internet.” Donald Trump
"the supremacist hashtag #whitegenocide"  Say what you want about the word choice, but whites not wishing to be displaced in their own countries is not "white supremacist". That is common sense self-preservation.
White evangelical Christians worship the Pussy Grabber In Chief. Gee, I wonder why so many people are checking the None box these days? We just had eight years of a President who was a loyal husband and wonderful father to two daughters. And he never called either one of his daughters and I quote, "A piece of a**" while talking live on the air with Howard Stern. Unlike Trump who has consistently lied, cheated, and disrespected his daughters and three wives FOREVER! Guess Barack Obama's skin was the wrong color to get any respect from evangelicals. If the lying, adulterous, vulgar, tax cheating, racist, misogynist, bigoted, narcissistic, ignorant, draft dodging, boy-man Trump is the new Christian hero, just what kind of Christianity is being practiced in the US nowadays?
Timothy Sloan is just another white collar criminal supported by the thieves in the house and senate, The head thief is our President.
Multiculturalism and diversity are just code words for white genocide.
I would bet ten thousand dollars you are a straight white male.
"John D. “Jake” Kennedy will serve a minimum of nine years in the Colorado Department of Corrections after he kidnapped a University of Colorado Denver classmate and sexually assaulted her in his room at Auraria Student Lofts."  Yup, how did this one get in our country?  Hmmm Kennedy and he's white, that explains it!
Idiots? Look..I'm a deplorable..I'm white..I find this despicable just as I find violent Left Wing protests despicable
So if a mosque has one jihadist member, they must all be jihadist? Since one black guy is defended by others for a violent crime, they are all violent criminals? Since a few anti-white Israelites show up to a black lives matter march, they must all be racist Israelites? Since a few members of antifa go full on terrorist and attack with weapons and acid, they are all domestic terrorists? Or do you just draw the line at righty-whitey and excuse the rest...
LMAO... MLB is putting on captivating  Playoffs..... while nfl Negroes  laugh and tell the folks who pay all the bills  to pound sand. Sadly, these illiterate racists are too stupid to realize what they are doing. Without White folks, Western Civilization, free market capitalism and America they're sitting on rocks eating bush meat.
The Muslim girl you speak of was beaten to death by an illegal immigrant from a Latin American country. He was not "white", and therefore probably doesn't actually fit your narrative.
Sadly, I must admit that the violent ones in the pics are counter protesters.   Punching a skinhead in the back of his shaven head may garner approval from anarchists, but it discredits anything you have to say decrying the hate from the white supremacists.   That disabled lady displayed a disturbing level of hate as she flung a water bottle, another act that deserves a date in court.   I find white supremacists distasteful and repulsive, but they are Americans who get my support to spew their ugly preferences because I support free speech.
An alien from Mars reading this would assume that Trump had endorsed white supremacy.  Just nonsense.  What if some media had accused Obama of being an islamist terrorism sympathizer because he refused to use the words "islamist terrorism"? Imagine the outrage at such a stretch.
Okie dokie then. This article comes off as a PR piece for Khan and for the diversity, tolerance agenda in general. She's been accused of being a blatant racist and her public comments show that clearly enough.  Her quoted, strange theory on racism and how it relates to white people -that this article failed to mention-  certainly calls into question her suitability for her position as a representative of the entire student body. Such as it is. I'm not sure why we're expected to give so much credence to some jumped up, power tripping student body president anyway?
What can be discussed on the pages of this newspaper if you have established pro-Islamic anti-white censorship on its pages and drop comments that you don't like?
To answer this from this post:  "And to think that there are those who still deny that race is the undrrlying issue that motivates people's behavior."  Yes. And it is the reverse race card being played. Victimized because one is the White Race.   RE: "When you call them on it, you’re a racist, white devil."
If you really are a Latino, you are reading from the wrong book. You need an update. The days of immigrants becoming white by learning to hate black people are history. The only Latinos for which that that strategy worked are old Cubans. This is the 21st century.
3 perfectly normal non racist white people out of 4 fear that a Muslim will blow them up.....
Oh, hey Yepper et al. I like this version of your latest user name (● ● ● ●● ● ● •●•●•). Cute. A little more subtle than this one: 'Trump is a sick, fascist, white supremacist traitor. A worthless stain on America.'   Not trying to be offensive, but perhaps you should seek mental health assistance. You've let Trump's election totally unhinge you and it's doing no one any good.  Until your next identity... <mute>
“The only white guy that I despise is the Chump.”  The only one, huh? For one so evidently hung up on skin color, that seems unlikely at best.  “He is sick, vile and disgusting. He is dividing our country.”   That sounds more like Obama.
All you people who support the completion of this pipeline,through standing rock, ignore the total racist statement this represents. This pipeline was rerouted because the white people further north objected to the danger of polluting THEIR water systems. As most trumpff supporters have often shown, F#c! the truth or the facts, we'll prove that "ignorance is bliss".
'oldvalleyguy' Your screen name says it all for me.  God forbid it happens to someone in your family and I promise you will sing a different tune.  Whether they be Black, White, Hispanic, or Other.  Resisting arrest does not give anyone the right to shoot an unarmed individual at point blank range.  You sir are a jerk and that is being kind!
Good for you, Baltimore and Maryland.  Take all 700 of them down all over the country.  No reason to honor the losing side in a civil war, especially when the confederacy stood for preserving the institution of slavery.  This is history that we'd like to forget.....  and for all those objecting to the removal of history, take a look at Lincoln statutes.  He is white, he won the civil war, he ended slavery, and no one is taking his statutes down. Abraham Lincoln is a white guy, too, but he deserves to be honored, not these confederate losers who represent odious ideas of enslavement and racism.
Wait. They were shot by a white guy. Let's ban all white people from entering the U.S. until we can figure out what the hell is going on.
Wow.   This is probably one of the most (if not the most) asinine,  lefty fascist propaganda pieces I have read in a while.  Göebels would be proud of Seattle Weekly.     There are no white supremacist bands here. I love how it says "it is more common for white supremacist bands to promote their ideas subtly".  Yeah,  that way the leftist fascists can call any band or person a racist or a Nazi, and distort their words into bullshit.   Also,  Death in June is not a Nazi band.  A Jewish,  gay,  immigrant who loves black dick (Milo, of course) is not a fascist.   The adjectives listed above of what he is, is every one of the things that Nazis hate.  And Anti-Sharia March was exactly that --  an anti-Sharia march against honour killings, FGM, and killing of gays.
hapaguy 1 hour ago "I said that the vast MAJORITY of terrorist shootings/bombings etc... in this country since 9/11 were perpetrated by RIGHT WING "Christian" extremists. Since 9/11 there were 21 instances of right-wing, white extremist, "Christian" terrorist attacks in the U.S. that caused 53 fatalities...." hapaguy 44 minutes ago "Nowhere did I say that a "Christian Extremist Group killed 53 people". I said that since 9/11 there were 21 attacks that caused 53 fatalities...."  You making me work haad tonight, lol I don't know hapaguy.  Maybe you misrepresented yourself or it's nai nai time. No worries hahahaahahaha, who's on 1st? What's on 2nd! I don't Know is on 3rd.
I was born here.  DD214 with "honorable discharge" on it says I'm an American and don't have to give one runny crap whether you like my religion or not.  Speaking of not understanding things, you should perhaps consider reviewing and ongoing conversation before displaying said lack of understanding, next time.  Not a "strawman" when addressed to Slayer SE, who is an unapologetic white supremacist.  To put it simply, "This is an AB conversation.  C your way out."
I remember that, it was horrible what they did to those two white people.  They kept this so under wraps because the vicious criminals were black that it was sickening.  We wonder why there is so much tension, the media just stokes the flames.
Any chance that his "white s..t" comment will attract a Penny Sparrow sized fine?
If OJ were white, he'd be on death row, where he belongs.
We live in the west, my family killed Nazis, only dealings with Jews was in school, neighborhood, friendship, business, Hunting, fishing trips, ect. Don't f-ck with my friends. I have had hunting and fishing friends that were native American, married to one, white boys, Negros, Chinese, Hmong, great hunters, some mutts like myself. This society has gone insane, letting a small group of manipulating revolutionaries control the weak minded, drug impaired zombies.
I just talked about this on Twitter. Young liberals are going to like his "freestyle", but his actual fans, people that have been supporting him and paying for his music for 18+ years are 28+ year old white males. Mainly the demographic that voted Trump into office. He's going to lose half his fan base with this alienation. He's criticized Trump before, that's fine. But to say you have to choose and if you're hesitant then fuck you? What an idiotic move.  Eminem made me feel like it was okay to be different when I was in 7th grade and now he's making me feel betrayed.  I'm with you bro, F you too Em.
Mr. Sherman... Quoted from Patrick J. Buchanan, We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude? What more opportunity is it that the White people need to give to help the Blacks? If the poor white got this much opportunity there would be no poor white or lower class of white trash people!! The main problem why black people are not progressing is the, "They owe me factor"!! Get it in your head! No Body Owes You Any Thing!  Talk about new 'ladders of opportunity' for blacks. Go to Altoona? And Johnstown, and ask the white kids in Catholic schools how many were visited lately by Ivy League recruiters handing out scholarships for 'deserving' white kids? Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America?
They are encouraging whites to speak up. Once that happens, they have their excuse to be offended and talk about whites' hate speech. If whites are silent, it's hard to be offended by silence, and they need to be offended to continue to be victims. Something like that.
There is no amount of facts that justify leveraging a terrorist attack into political attacks before the bodies are even wrapped up and carted off of the streets. No real analysis can be done in that short amount of time and no honorable or decent leader would open with an attack before at least addressing the very real human loss that occurred. Mourning and comfort first, BS political attacks after that. If the killer in this case was a 64 year old white man with a gun, you and others would be in this forum countering gun legislation arguments before they're even made under the false premise of not wanting to politicize the attack.   Trump may or may not be right about the law. Given his previous lies and attacks in the wake of one of these massacres, though, I somewhat doubt it. Either way, blaming Schumer solely for a law that was also approved by Dick Armey and signed into law by George H. W. Bush is disingenuous at best, disgustingly opportunistic at worst. An embarrassment.
It is more socially acceptable to be gay than to be white or male. Ultimately being a white male gets me accused of being racist by the BLM Pride Committee (with the tacit agreement of Tory, Wynne Trudeau and Wong Tam)  despite being gay and non malicious.
(continued from above)...and had left the force after being pulled over and 'dog-piled' by white fellow officers because he drove through a white neighborhood at the end of his shift.  When all was said and done he'd seen to it that several of those cops had to turn in their badges when he turned in his.  Once after a traffic-stop altercation I told him I'd gotten mouthy with the cop (I was 23).  He told me I was an idiot and lucky to be alive.  That's when I learned that if a cop wants to shoot you, he has prefabricated "evidence" to help him get away with it--a 'throw-down.'  Larry, 'racial profiling' is still VERY much a factor.  My wife and I were stopped on our way to a restaurant by a cop who asked me "where'd you pick her up at?".  If that's not racial profiling, what would you call it?  Nothing in her bearing, behavior or apparel would suggest to an unbiased person she was a prostitute.  On what do you think that cop based his assumption?  Neither of us had criminal records.
The Republicans longest running lie is that they don't recruit white racists into the GOP. That recruitment started with Barry Goldwater. They have been very successful with their recruitment efforts. I remember when Ronald Reagan kicked off his successful run for president with a speech in Philadelphia, Mississippi. That town was famous for one thing, the murder of Swerner, Goodman, and Chaney. They were murdered for registering black folks to vote in the 1960's. The Christian KKK did the deed with the help of local law enforcement. The crowd of white folks loved his speech.
Trump's racism is so blatant even corporate CEOs, no band of liberals, have abandoned him.  Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end for the white nationalist-in-chief.
' You think the white supremacists are managing their new and improved public image?  . (yeah, ...where is that emoji of the little skinhead with the swastika neck tattoo?)
With friends like that who needs enemies? The devilish White man has a propensity for violence and bloodshed. Without violence and genocidal murder there would be no United Snakes of AmeriKKKa.
For the record, I despise neo-nazi and white supremicist views as well as whatever views allow a person to falsely insinuate that I agree with them in any way. All for having explained the fallacies of a poll. Tazedandconfused, I note you upvoted yourself on both of your replies. That says more than your actual comment.
ENOUGH! Charles. Your brand of racism is a huge part of the issues in this country. You want danger, you want to fear for your life as you constantly bemoan about? Go to the inner cities, you know the inner city black neighborhoods. That is where you will have real fear, and it will not be white people or cops you would need to fear. Hear is a news flash for you, my son was MURDERED by a black person, and his grandfather, (dad was in prison) had the nerve to stand up in court and blame whitey for his grandson murdering my son. The murderer got all of 3 1/2 years in jail, that shows just how bad our system is right Charles? My life has been threatened many times, not by cops, but by blacks. FACT! Should I become as racist as you are? Your generation, teaching hate to the next generation is a huge problem. You should be concentrating your energies on fixing the huge family problems in the black community, but your happier just spreading your brand of racism. Shame on you and your ilk!
Feel free to prove that "white supremacy" is behind the largest per capita rate of domestic terrorism.  I'm sure your facts are as solid as the non-existent ones you offered to justify your Antifa-like blanket cop hatred.
Yes- Since most shootings are within racial groups and since the vast majority of shootings in Chicago are by its black citizens, a white person is much less likely to be shot. Inane.
This folks, is why we need white sharia! Properly patrolled thots don't abandon their children to shoot meth with their molester boyfriend.....disgusting!
Forget about the Gupta/Zuma stage front "White Monopoly Capital"....here is our very own Monopoly..pick up the Community Card and read:  Go straight to jail....do not pass Go (get those passports in)!lol...enough, we need to MARCH.... GO TO JAIL!
"Whether you think the person you elected is racist or sexist doesn't really matter. "  Actually, the line above coming from a supposed progressive non-sexist, non-racist white man is, in my opinion, perhaps the biggest problem.    Yes - It does matter that you think the person you elected is racist or sexist.    Sexism and Racism cause poverty, violence, jealousy, rage, rape, and wealth disparity in our government, businesses and schools, and divide a people who would otherwise grow peacefully together, creating a country with a well founded stable economy, and low unemployment, and even better health physically for all its citizens.    Like in our church, those who see the wrong of sexism and racism must stop petting the haters on their heads, and fight like hell against them instead.  Otherwise we end up with an unjust, and divided country and church for everyone.
Sorry, but white supremacists aren't the only bigots.  We now have black  supremacists and religious ones as well.  Most bigots I see are liberals. "Bigot:  a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices." https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot
I'm glad I don't smoke!  I'm just guessing that all the TAXES layed on Tobacco have made the cost of one's addiction so expensive and with Walkers veto of our PFD this poor skinny white dude has resorted to living a life of crime . Perhaps society should rethink its tobacco taxing policy in a move to reduce crime. Maybe we should set up free clinics that will hand out "safe" cigarettes,  filtered of course. All we are doing by taxing tobacco is to drive skinny blonde white dudes into the criminal sector. Skinny white dude dodged a bullet for now but can our society long remain free knowing the bonds of slavery we have placed on those poor unfortunate addicts?
For decades the 'black church' has endorsed candidates from the pulpit, why not the white evangelical churches?
The first thing the cops did after they shot him was yell for handcuffs while he lay motionless on the ground. Then they hand-cuffed a black man dying of a gunshot wound.  To give the cop some credit, he only shot him once. That really angers me.   The other day in Tulsa they stood around and watched a black man die.  There's some real cop bad conduct going on here.  Anyone can carry a gun in that state.  It's common for people to conceal a small gun with an ankle holster like.....white people.
" As someone pointed out earlier, ISIS and radical islamic terrorism is a cancer on society." Got it, I-Therefore.  But, I'm still wondering: what effect do "fringe white supremacists" have "on society"?    Awaiting your reply. Thanks.
Treated as equals? Here in America??? Are you kidding? The forefathers were all white folks. Most were slave owners. Some killed Native Americans as a policy. They did not include people of color in their deliberations. Only themselves and each other. You need to become educated. You are ignorant, dim-witted, and not very bright.
Being afraid of actual terrorists is being a "chickenhawk", but when a handful of "white supremacists" have a demonstration and say some nasty things, that is enough to justify a social panic that requires all hands on deck, ANTIFA mobilisation, predictions of impending fascism, cries of impending doom, etc....
"Only old white men'  Seems like a rather racist statement.
Deport these guys. Oh wait they are upper class white men. Well shame on me because fron reading responses on crime I thought only minorities committed these types of crime. Silly me.
Look like another ignorant racist needs some lessons. a) Jews are Arabs (confirmed by DNA testing) they were classified as whites by Apartheid government (whilst other Arabs where not)  So in fact there are 6 whites and 10 non whites. b) The minister specifically pointed out Afrikaners not whites.  How does this  endanger anyone?  Lets look as some realities 1) If the Bantu education system was so bad why were there more black lawyers than white lawyers in South Africa during apartheid, more black doctors than white doctors? All these blacks got their degrees from Universities funded by the Whites. The thousands of blacks who got their degrees during the 70s and 80s are proof that blacks did have access to good education, the problem was most were to lazy to make the sacrifice needed to get educated. 2) Whats stopping you and all other blacks from joining the 2 blacks on the list, after all they had the same hurdles to jump you did? So stop blaming whites for your lack of will power.
"maybe white people..."  Maybe you could get back to us when you've gotten together with all the other white people and have a definitive answer in hand.  Otherwize, I'm not taking you seriously.
The author says, illogically, that “white nationalism” is “an asinine term, since there’s no white nation”.   Obviously, the term is aspirational from the white nationalists’ POV, since a white nation is exactly what they would like to establish.  It’s their goal that is asinine, not only because it is odious in itself, but also (thankfully) unachievable.  As for the statues, here is one area where the Muslims  (although I am no fan of their religion) have it right:  better to avoid graven images altogether.
This idiot is totally confused by his hatred of white people.
Let me guess: Your'e an angry feminist with a bone to pick with white men.
The self-righteous hypocrisy, pomposity and arrogance is strong on this page.  Almost as strong as the stupid. You know who you are.   Yes, Black Lives Matter is a chapter-based national organization. Yes, for ha variety of reason, black people are stopped more frequently by police than whites for the same behavior. Similarly they arrested more frequently for the same behavior and they are often charged and prospected differently than whites.  So, it's not that black people commit more crimes than whites.
White supremacists are a cancer on the world. That has nothing to do with ISIS or the price of butter. Works both ways, see?
The Observer: That's like me saying why I'm not surprised when a child is killed by a white man who is also a sex perp.
What bunch of losers and idiots!  I clearly heard President Trump consistently state he does not support these racist groups or their points of view since the campaign last year.  Do these people think their down right stupid and worthless statements mean anything.  They are just adding to the chorus of the ANTIFA, Resistance and other sore losers that don't have a life or don't have jobs. How stupid has the Democratic Party become to fail to realize that throwing everything under the bus leaves them with no credibility?  Working class Americans, blue collar workers, unionized workers, middle class workers, Christians, minorities, legal aliens, legal immigrants and the myriad others that were the base of the Democratic Party are now shunned and vilified by the elected and appointed Democratic politicians.  Their shill creed is becoming the white noise on the 24/7 news cycle and quickly becoming irrelevant.
How is the Proud Boys belief that western (white) culture is superior any different from white supremacist belief that whites are superior?
Jesse Jackson is a politician. Al Sharpton is a minister. Neither one is anywhere near as bigoted as you. And in the Jim Crow South, lynching of black men, often following their genital mutilation, was done thousands of times, with many photographs of whole white families, men women and children, pointing and laughing at the hanging corpse. Real family entertainment, post-Reconstruction and continuing into the 1960's.   (  Allen, James. "Musarium: Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America")   Benjamin Tillman, governor of South Carolina and later a United States Senator:  "We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men, and we never will. We have never believed him to be the equal of the white man, and we will not submit to his gratifying his lust on our wives and daughters without lynching him."    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching
It's OK to be white.  The real hate filled racists go insane when they read that.
I am sure black guys will have a big problem with cops who carry riot shields. That can be seen as racist too: like cops use nicer riot shields on white people,.
Have you ever seen a white person who was actually proud of their culture/history WITHOUT thinking other cultures are inferior? Because I haven't and until I do, I'm going to call all "proud whites" nazis.
In every case he inserted his view in the national media rereatedly from the college professor to michael brown to ferguson etc. etc. official investigations, trials and grand juries proved him wrong 100% of the time. It was always with him if the incident involved a black person and always against a policeman or white they were always abused because of their skin. Choosing always by race only=Bigot...look it up!
So, when will we see a female Pope? Oh yeah, maybe a million years after there's a female priest, right?  We have enough white-boy misogynists right here and right now.
He isn’t good at anything a president has to do. From the simplest, like pretending to help out in flood relief, to the hardest: making the call when all alternatives are bad. He doesn’t know anything about the issues with which he must cope. Nor does this seem to bother him. He doesn’t care to learn. It’s not like he’s getting better at the job, or scrambling to fill gaps in his knowledge. He has no views about public policy. Just a few brute prejudices, like if Obama did it, it was dumb. I do not say he lacks beliefs — and his belief in white supremacy is one — but he has no positions. His political sky is blank. No stars to steer by. Nothing he says can be trusted. His “model” of leadership is the humiliation of others— and threat of same. No analyst unfamiliar with narcissistic personality types can hope to make sense of his actions in office.
The tea party doesn't compare to what happend all across the globe  yesterday with the Women's Marches. The tea party was full of white racists.
Really? How many White Americans were slaves? How many slaves in your family tree?
I once had an editor while a reporter for the Anchorage Daily News. He was the first white guy who was able to say “old white guy” in a matter-of-fact kind of way that I would never forget. It had an odd kind of ring to it. “Hell, he’s just an old white guy,” he’d say.  I asked him once what he meant by that. He said: Some of these old white guys are racists and bigots and they’ll never change their minds about anything. Stubborn old white guys.  Yes it does have everything to do with race. You figure it out.
I'm afraid I'd rather take someone I don't care for over a complete, blabbering, racist moron. I know white men don't have very much to lose, but if you have any women or people of color in your small worlds- please reconsider burning ours down, will you? Make America Great Again? You mean back when your granddaddies got to go a-lynchin? Or maybe before your mothers got the vote? Yeah, real great.
Are you suggesting that you promote misogyny, sexual assault, White supremacy? Supporting Trump is supporting these very things he has explicitly endorsed.
LOL "it is more alarming that the current administration is refusing to acknowledge that white nationalist extremists are a major domestic terrorist threat.”  What a joke.  Crazy Muslims way more of a problem world wide to boot.
I agree that the white bigot would be fired on the spot!  Those who seem stuck in the 50's and 60's, but never lived those times.  Isn't that amazing!  All lives matter!
Did you ever notice how white liberals just have to take care of everyone because they think natives are too stupid to do it for themselves.   I think they have taken enough care of native alaskans here and natives in the lower 48.  Any more "care" and both will be extinct!
Al-Salaam alaykum wa Rah'matullahi wa Barakatu: here's how it works: If an individual Muslim, black person, or Mexican does something wrong, their behavior magically reflects on ALL Muslims, black people or Mexicans. If a white guy does something wrong, it only reflects on HIM. Not the entire white 'community'.  This is why these arrogant, self-entitled white supremacists (a more accurate term than merely 'racist') will defend ANY state-sponsored murder by a cop, no matter the circumstances, as 'justified' because 'so many black people are criminals' according to them. But these same hypocrites remain utterly SILENT when it's pointed out that 79% of mass-shooters and 80% of child molesters are white.  White percentage in the overall population is only 62.5%.  They're disproportionately represented among mass-murderers and child molesters.  Eh.  That seems fairly consistent with white American history and culture, so not really surprising.
The support for Trump by white evangelicals says more about their Christian faith than it does about Trump. He knows and likes being a con man. He also loves the "poorly educated" white folks that elected him. The Trump voters care much more about being white than being Christians, Americans, or being human beings. This works for them, since they don't believe in facts. They have faith, ideology, fear, hate, and racism to inform them about how the world works. Too bad that the "poorly educated" white folks that elected Trump will suffer the most during his administration. When has he ever cared about any of  them? Trump is a tall, rich, lazy, fat, white man that has not respect for anyone that he doesn't agree with him. That goes double if those folks aren't white males. Too bad Trump cares about his voters less than he cares about the contractors he has stiffed. Trump voters will deserve what happens to them. Maybe some bleeding heart white liberals will care about them in 2020.
go peddle your white man's guilt elsewhere.
Living with the fact that I pay these goons to beat up or kill people I don't like, or collect revenue for the state(except that they are too expensive) but I don't really want to kiss their behinds all the time or genuflect to them as they pass by. I think their main problem is that their traditional enemies are fading into the background and the middle class white folks they could once count on might shoot them in the face on a traffic stop. Don't like it? Get another job.
White-o-phobia!!! Do the rules about race apply to some races and not others?  ***If you want to cry racism for any other race that's talked about, then be prepared to take the heat when you talk badly about Caucasian people.***
This is just Sessions continuing his lie that institutional racism doesn't exist.  It does, but he has lied for decades that white folks are disadvantaged somehow.  What garbage.  Trump is a psychotic.
It looks more like the lunatic white supremacist billionaires have begun to take the US people on a joy ride to oblivion. Sheep, how in the world can you support Trump? He and his thugs have absolutely no interest in the average American. His choices for cabinet are indicative of that. DeVos will, for example, destroy public education nation wide as she did in Michigan. There are already signs of how poorly educated the average American is and she will nail the coffin shut. Pence will throwback LGBT  and women's rights to the dark ages. I could go on but I think you get my drift.
So when do we put a bag over Trudeau's head for destroying white culture in Canada with Muslim and Chinese immigration??  Now this crap. Hey Indians !!1  If you worked more, like the rest of us, Instead of sucking at the taxpayers teat every day - you wouldn't have time to fuss over who kicked your asses
LOL  Really !  Today in Finland a man yelling in Arabic stabbed 8 people killing two of them .  There are only a few white supremacists . There are billions who  are Islamist's
Trump's alt-right constituency wants this nation purged of non-white immigrants, documented or otherwise.  It is the duty of every Christian to stand up to this new regime and its reign of error.  The problem is so many self-declared Christians voted for this guy.
If whites becoming a shrinking plurality is "the dust bin of history" to you, so be it.  But I would say your characterization is hyperbolic and right in line with some of what these protesters are saying today.
The masses become more politically intelligent as they participate in elections for example, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a significant margin indicating that although Trump's racism, xenophobia, and misogyny were big sellers with the Christian Far-Right and aging whites, a majority of Americans did not buy the garbage he was peddling.
short is short on empathy....he knows nothing about black experience...a lily-white Virginian...I am a white older person who Is happy to see that the players are more than their considerable salaries and are concerned with their racial brothers.  he and udell are seduced by the great blond leader....who has no intellect, scope, ethics, empathy, etc.  udell is so seduced by his leader as to not identify with his background.  I am surprised that he has not immersed himself into a vat with bleach.
Is it just me or does it seem odd that a group of people, wearing masks and carrying clubs, sticks, shields, walking down the street, doesn't draw a "hey, what are you guys doing?" from the police?  It's intimidating to an average citizen, but cops should suspect something is up.  Did the white supremacists in C-ville have weapons?  Maybe it is just me, but ironically, Antifa is a fascist hate group.
The thing that saddens me the most about the black face incident, is the lack of any concern by most white people about why we have never had equal protection under the law for all Americans. It seems obvious to me that white law professors that are ignorant about the role of white racism in every aspect of American life, including our justice system, contribute to us not having equal protection under the law. Of course, it is hard to see a problem when you are the beneficiary of that problem. Or maybe, equal protection under the law is just another white privilege. Most white folks seem happy with the situation. They think being polite and respectful to black people is like being lynched. BTW, the GOP wants to go back to the original Constitution. Land owning white men were the only citizens with full citizenship rights in the good old days.
Charlottesville video surfaces showing white supremacist shooting pistol at protester
The White House is only big enough for one raving white nationalist.
Wow D. Nationally (according to the FBI) 83 percent of white victims of murder were killed by white people. "Hispanic perps" are less criminal than the average white person on just about every count according to just about every source. And Black killers, just like white ones, are overwhelmingly likely to kill people just like themselves! This is all above and beyond your suicides. You people got to stop killing yourselves each other and finding ways to blame black and brown people for all of your problems before you roll out your white pride alternative facts.
I just need a better phone...so many silly spelling errors due to touch typing...apologies for that. To add:  IF whites in north america/europe are so privileged and racist why do so many people wish to immigrate into these societies they constructed over millenia (Europe) or at least since the enlightenment in North America?  Again,this doesn't deny the suffering of the12 million slaves the Europeans and later Americans brough, nor the wars against various first nations. But lumping all first nations together is also silly. Many had their own ambitions and wars against others and chose sides to.  Lest we forget history we are doomed to repeat! This silly SJW  revisionism and attempt to divide and rule is just that. Instead of working hard to get ahead they want to somehow make themselves special. I am not suggesting racism doesn't exist and it should be stamped out, but to label all white people as privileged or racist is counterproductive and shows the sjw movement's true colours.
WHO TAUGHT THIS GUY TO SCALP INDIANS, WASNT THAT A INDIAN THING THEY DID TO WHITE PEOPLE. HUM I WONDER WHY HE IS TO BLAME WHEN THEY STARTED!
Please show me where they are protesting cops killing white people.
Should I remind you and very other bigot here that Dylann Roof, a self-avowed White Nationalist and supporter of the KKK, is not sorry for what he did. He shot and killed 9 good Black Americans who had just bowed their heads and closed their eyes to pray. Then Roof unloaded 77 bullets into them. There's your hate-born and raised white man.
Are you supposed to be a journalist, Lizzy Acker? Does the truth mean anything to you? If you were assaulted by a black man, and the police asked you for a description of your assailant, would you say he was white? Would it be racist to say he was black?  You're so busy slapping labels on other people and their comments try this one, and see if it fits you: fascist.  By the way, I don't believe for a second that you are graciously keeping up these comments you have deemed "racist" just to show you're not a censor. No, dear. You left those comments up because your new comment system hasn't been generating as many comments as you would like.  I know this because I, like other commenters here, have received e-mails from "Civil Comments" inviting me to post more comments.
Trump pulled Gillespie down into the cesspool, but the voters of Virginia have obviously had more than their fill of Trump.  Trump is a racist, white supremacist sympathizer and imbecile who has been a complete failure as president.  He has accomplished nothing except to rile up his base of bigots.
HAH---this newspaper is almost a bigger joke than the fed.govt!  ---NO, they both strain the credibility  of the public.---This "liberal newsletter of the Organic-farmers-of-Diversity"---in a  Pacific Northwest that has very few black people----WHY DO YOU  THINK this state and county has so many liberals living here?---Because its so WHITE HERE.
No need wearing a white sheet over your head if you're as brazen of a white, Christian supremacist as Amy Demboski is.  The ethical standards that go along with being an elected official apparently mean absolutely nothing to her.  What position is she after next, Queen of the 4th Reich?
"GOP is composed mostly of white trash, inbreeds"? Says a whole lot about how intelligent and tolerant you are.
Bernie find a way to win himself? What is he Dumbledore? You can't win if you're not the nominee. He won't be the nominee.  We're going to have at least 4 more years of the white Obama with a vagina.  Americans should stop sh*tting themselves over it. They aren't currently smart enough as a society to do any better.
Way past time for blind and "patriotic" Trump supporters to look at themselves closely in the mirror in the privacy of their own homes and ask themselves some hard questions. Do I support White Nationalists? If so, you are a Deplorable. Do I support the KKK? If so, you are a Deplorable. Do I support American Neo-Nazis? If so, you are a Deplorable. I get it that some of you see yourselves as well-intentioned Republican "Conservatives". But really, can you stand by and let this scum of Alt Right conservatives speak for you, much less the rest of us? These cowardly terrorists do not represent the "Conservative" Republican party of Ike, Reagan and George H.W. Bush - nor of the vast majority of Americans.
you little censor hungry peasants working for minimum wage over there must be on cloud 9 whenever your masters print one of these boring wannabe sensationalist muslim stories. I want to see you continue to do that: keep simple and small, keep running to mommy and daddy to shelter your precious fragile minds. it bemuses beyond your comprehension - how wantonly self destructive you are. go ahead, invite daddy under the covers there with you, i know you can keep the secret - go ahead and have no other sexual experience until you are gifted to the old hairy bozo down at the used car dealership, enjoy that old world misogyny while you trumpet the open society and tolerance. and you know what? when the war DOES happen, i wont return your pettiness and scorn in kind - i, the big, strong, intelligent, successful white man, WILL rescue you, like i always have. im bigger than you, its just that simple. now go ahead and continue playing in your little mind control sand box. i will allow it.
So, we will have overt, systemic discrimination introduced by the federal government against white males, favouritism for females of any colour, and no new money.    All the researchers who blindly welcomed this government in are waking up to the ugly hangover that they were duped.  Mr. Trudeau pledged an innovation budget but provided zero new dollars for the universities that produce innovation.  Now Duncan cherrypicks the most questionable aspects of the Naylor report as her targets.    Canada will far farther and father behind its global competitors.  Mr. Trudeau's election will become a day all scientists will rue.
Everybody is a racist to some people.   Having people like Neshi and Mason accusing everyone of being racists is the worst kind of disgusting slimeball identity politics that exits.  This sort of stuff is the very reason that immigration should be limited to whites.
Trump is an idiot, white people are racist, and men are all pigs....there, that should make it through the denver post civil "moderators"
These whites were unable to dislodge guptas within the country, so they hired foreign power to find some evidences, be it fake who cares, at least it will ruin the image of guptas to some extent
Dude!, you mentioned Trump, "I notice some Muslims, Hispanics, and Blacks are claiming the the media, Trump, and Police are slow to call this terrorism, because the shooter is white, and likes guns and country music. " If that is not mentioning Trump, then I don't know what is.
Dylann Roof is an obviously insane mentally retarded person that the MSM is pushing as "The one that speaks for all White Americans", while this is just another in a long line of Muslim attacks on America.
To answer this:  Ted Bundy was white. You're white. What does that tell you?  Ummmm...Ted Bundy was a white serial killer?!    Next!
What is particularly amusing about this letter - is that Trump and a majority of his supporters are not conservatives.  Trump is not conservative.  Nearly all of his views on spending and policy are more in line with leftists and Democrats.  The support that put him over the top to win the election came from predominately white, non-college educated voters - many of whom had voted for Obama and other democrats in the past.  Trying to tie conservatism to the white nationalists is just a lame attempt to destroy the moral standing of conservatives.  It is intellectually dishonest, and really gross behavior.  The writer is wrong and should be called out for his despicable behavior.
JadedJade was pointing out that the Trump seems to have no problem with white, American born mass shooters.
Dermot, why don't you mention Dick Cheney's Dubai based Haliburton, which enjoys many billions of 8a contracts with the government but white trash like democrat Claire McCaskill never mention them when she is attacking Native entities over 8a
Not if they are White gay men
tie clearly shows that trump is a bigot and being supported by other white bigots.  they want to make America white again.  America came too black with Obama.  hence, this race is bigoted whites against all nonwhites.
You need to read what you just wrote..because it's a bunch of nonsense. I have seen many videos of arm white people taken into custody and not shot dead.  you must be looking hard not to find videos of unjust killings.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtPt6GrnE6s
The media here lies just as much, they cover up the fact that the parasites are trying to ethnically cleanse white people.
Eric Holder the blatant hypocrite.  You displayed your racial bias when your DoJ failed to indict New Black Panther leader King Samir Shabazz for appearing at a polling booth in Philadelphia, dressed in military garb, with his 'associates'.  This is the same individual that has advocated the killing of white people, including women and babies.   You allowed him to patrol a voting booth. ' Now, you are concerned about racial insensitivity.   Pathetic political hypocrite.   And of course this is just one example of many many more.
The way some of you throw around calling people racist, Nazi sympathizer a is pathetic. You have no argument so you deflect and try to falsely label people.   Again, I'm from a multi-racial family with black, white, Mexican, Jewish, et al members. And unlike you I have actually had someone in my family murdered by the KKK.   According to your logic I am racist and anti-Semitic against myself and family. Do you see how ignorant your comment is now? Probably not because you don't deal in reality, only wishful thinking and willful ignorance of said reality.
So after everything that's happened I'm trying to see if I got a grasp on the issue: 1- In Charlottesville, the left said the right is full of Nazi's and white supremacists 2- They made a big deal our of that fact and they continue to call the conservatives Nazi's. 3- They've been protesting the hate coming from the right (as white supremacists) 4- They, the left, attack a man because he's a Trump supporter 5- They attack him because he's wearing a MAGA hat and an Israeli flag...and he's conservative 6- They heckle him and tell him to "get the F**k out"  It would appear the HATE is all on the left not the right. I don't agree with white supremacists or Nazi's or BLM for that matter. This country allows freedom of speech and the way one dresses is a form of speech, so allow it! The right has as much right to voice their opinion as the left does and no one has the right to attack the other just because they disagree with what's being said!
Not a peep! Those Antifa were throwing feces and urine at people, Liberal Journalists were attacked.  That is a Bio-Terrorists attack.  Remember when Antifa blocked an ambulance that needed to be re-routed and this delay caused a death.  No word from G&M.  Or the brutal death of a white couple, in Kentucky, raped, hacked, burnt, bleached or the white man who was pulled out of his car and beat by BLM.  These Leftists are the same group who will gladly destroy private property, kill Police officers in a cowardly fashion and pepper spray girls point black.  They are the true bigots and by far the most dangerous.  Lawlessness, Godless and full of hate.  Odd that Obama didn't get this kind of treatment when Lakeisha Holloway drove over people in Las Vegas because she was "frustrated" and killed a young woman in 2015; or when Abdul Razak Ali Artan drove over people and then got out to stab some at Ohio State last November but then again Barry couldn't be bothered to attend NO after the flood
Idiot author is doing nothing but parroting the mainstream media talking points.  He was not stopped for a broken tail light, but for investigation of robbery.  The small handful of white police officers shooting black suspects is significantly outweighed by the number of white suspects shot.  Only a tiny fraction have ever been found to be unwarranted.  It's people like Parker who enable the BLM terrorists.  She's a large part of the problem, parroting a theme that isn't correct in order to push an agenda.
Fool, now hear this.  And lastly, before you white guys get off on other wrong headed stereotypical BS about Native people, let's not forget studies and law enforcement data shows it is you guys who hold the blue ribbon for raping and killing children.
Roof is not really an ignorant redneck or KKK white trash--his family seemed quite well-off when he was a child and according to reports he was bright in school.   He's clearly not normal--his OCD is likely from Asperger's or autism.  He got into drugs and someone like him, very obviously, should not have been permitted to carry a gun.
Kyle Stromgren, It seems that everything that Trump does is fine and dandy with you, even though many of his tweets and statements are designed to energize his racist and white supremacist base of supporters.  White supremacists are emboldened by Trump, and hate crimes have risen dramatically since Trump was elected president.  That's what you are supporting.
I don't blame you for leaving. Canada is no longer a place for people who have a competitive spirit or who are smart. It's also no longer a place where the middle class can work hard to get ahead, especially if you're white or male. We attract the down trodden, or the Chinese with money to invest to make a killing but that's it.
Most white Americans don't know their true history. I'm glad you got a good education. However, the folks that just elected Trump don't know or believe that history. You need to own your lesser cousins that are the majority of white folks. You have some family work to do. Just like black parents have to give their children "the talk". The talk that explains that we don't have equal protection under the law and that they could be killed for no particular action they take. They must be always aware of their behavior in the presence of cops, from the point of view of cops that may think they are about to kill them. Unfortunately, being innocent until proven guilty is a white privilege most of the time. For that matter so is the 2nd Amendment. Every time a cop gets away with killing an unarmed black person, they claim they were in fear for their life. It does not matter that they were not actually in any danger.
Obviously a liberal. Your cries of white privilege and racism have exposed you. Your comments are meaningless.
The pure venom of the unintelligent, uneducate, illiterated idolators of all things Trump, Racist, Bigotted, White Supremacist, Fascist pure evil incarnate.  Wallowing in stupidity with such a limited vocabulary.
Now we ALL know how the victims of the serial sex predator/rapist known as Slick Willy feel.  And never for a moment doubt that his nominal wife - - the one tasked to “manage” a tsunami of bimbo eruptions by threatening the victims - - knew exactly the Faustian bargain she made when she married this tawdry bit of no class white trash.   He was to be the political broomstick she would ride to the one and only thing that has ever mattered to her, RAW POWER.   And in exchange she would accept (perhaps even welcome) his rampant extramarital “adventures in whoopee” by way of maintaining her dominance over him. He may have thought he was letting his johnson make decisions but in reality it was Felony Shrillary who was holding all the puppet strings all the time.
Your comment epitomizes a lack of decency and humanity.  To not only suggest that because Blacks kill each other, what's a few more being lynched by white racists/supremacists and then to implicitly equate/associate the lynching of innocent Black men and boys (as young as 14) with white criminals and rapists by suggesting that latter were also murdered by said white supremacists, is beyond reprehensible.   BTW its 2016, not 1980s.  According to the  Southern Poverty Law Center there are some 190 active KKK groups in the U.S. with between 5- 8,000 Klan members, a rise which came with the election of a Black man to the presidency.  Its also curious how there the constant chant about black on black murders (`90%) but never any mention of white on white murders (`83%).
So in the end  because no native man will ever be interviewed or asked what happened,  we are left to believe the native  women were beaten to a bloody pulp  by nobody, raped by nobody,  and murdered by nobody  unless it was by white men or  RCMP officers.
Burn baby burn. SeaTac is Ground Zero for the Democratic Resistance Movement against President Trump. We want anarchy and violence because we lost the election and we cannot come to grips with reality. We are mindless fat white women that wear pink pussy hats. We will burn the whole I-5 corridor until we get free healthcare and free McDonalds. Black Lives Matter. Fat White Women's Live Matter. We are Fat and Proud. Long live Patty Murray, Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters. Gotta go...I just farted and wet my diaper.
Your post makes me glad I'm not white.
"It requires listening to people and thinking about what they say."  Yes, it does.  I like to think I have.  Do I "think Brown deserved to die because he was imperfect?"  No.  Do I "think his life was not worthy of a protest over his death?"  No.  Do I think bad things are NOT going to happen if I start fighting with a police officer?  No.  Brown was an 18-year-old black male.  Some white males that age do dumb things.  I do not "think" this - I know this.    I'm going to assert that some 18-year-old black males also do dumb things.  At one level, I'll concede EVERYTHING'S about race.  At another level, however, it's all about people, irrespective of race, doing dumb things.  Brown did something dumb.  Your article might have placed more emphasis on stupidity, less on phenotype.
The Left hate on Left White Women in race for the Georgian Governor's Race: "One of the main mantras of the chant was #trustblackwomen" http://www.opslens.com/2017/08/14/when-the-left-eats-its-own-white-female-gov-candidate-shouted-down-in-georgia/  I expect no less from your Racist Party! lol  BLM, Barry, Jesse, Al, Fredericka and Holy women Ms. Nadal and Ms. Brazille should be Proud of themselves. The New m.o. of the Democratic Party, anti-Whites! You got duped crafted by the Democratic Racist Tools
Racialized: to become racist; to hate persons f other races; to become insufferably hypocritical about racial matters, to make a religion one's own race, to espouse degenerate double standards towards persons of European descent, to invent new reasons to hate white people.
Leitch condemns support of her by "white nationalists" but she hasn't a clue as to why they would support her! Really? She should resign - she clearly lacks the judgment and common sense to be a member of parliament.
It figures. Why would Trump want to invest money into helping combat white extremism when that would diminish his voter base?....
"Where is all the report the guy people at when it is clear this some young white male who committed these crimes." You pretty much mutilated that one.
I care about all children. I just don't see that most conservatives do. For example, they don't seem to care about the children in Flint. They were poisoned by Republicans to save a buck. There were no Democrats involved in that decision. Those kids still don't have access to clean water. For every conservative that claims to care about children, there are just as many, if not more, that think killing 12 year old Tamir Rice was justified because he was black and playing with an air rifle in a public play ground. BTW, Ohio, where he was killed, is an open carry state. I guess the 2nd Amendment is just a white privilege for conservatives.
Multiculturalism and diversity are code words for white genocide.
I was pretty clear about this, MC:  I pity the Nazis. They need psychological help. Most extremists do.  I avoided nothing. Only simple people think there are simple answers to social questions. In fact, assuming that such answers exist is typically a component of white privilege.   But white supremos also need a firm hand, since they are heavily armed, glorify war, and espouse violence, and worse, against Jews and people of color, which is illegal and dangerous.  This is why the AntiFa should cease trying to kick their butts and instead shame them through outing on FB, Instagram and in the press and such. Hold them up for the losers they are and they'll vanish.  You're not asking not a simple question. Both groups--the destitute and the white nationalists--need justice to be done. Own it: you despise the poor, favor the white supremos over civil rights and equality, and you associate being on the right side of history with the supposed moral quibbling of "political correctness".
White guys took this land from the Indians with whiskey, and the Indians are taking it back with casinos.
What allot of rot.  I stopped reading at the "white guilt" section that is so de rigueur among the Liberal set now.  Hopefully no one reads his tripe or takes it seriously.
AJ, it wasn't a 'white' school.   Your miserable life as a child seems to continue in your protest abut just about anything!
Because the parasites that own our society have made it acceptable to hate white people, the parasite media like this rag has made it acceptable for groups like BLM to be openly racist. They are ethnically cleansing white people, they want to shut white people up while allowing other races and cultures to have their own organizations to promote their collective advancement.
Gordon Bowen, under those words, were the American Indians swept away by the "huddled masses yearning to breathe free....." How can a liberal like you called it "moral"??? My forefathers, were forced into American citizenship when Hawaii became a US territory after the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown.......yours came conquering through, eh? Is this what we called...."white privilege"?? How ironic!!
Anti-abortionists--I refuse to refer to them as 'right-to-lifers' because they're anything but that--are overly selective about which children merit that right.  Seven year-old black kids playing with toy water pistols don't.  And these white 'conservative' so-called Christians leap to defend any cop who shoots a black child, regardless of the circumstances.  And of course Iraqi, Afghani, Pakistani, Sudanese, Lebanese, Palestinian and Libyan children are excluded from that right on two counts--they're the wrong color AND the wrong religion.  I think the next time these clowns show up to protest at the Planned Parenthood clinic, I'll show up with my own photos of murdered children: like a particularly horrible one of a Palestinian toddler with the top of his head taken off by an IDF rifle-bullet.  Or another of the remains of a little girl in Fallujah who died screaming as she dissolved in a toxic, super-heated cloud of white phosphorus.  Where was their right-to-life, O "Christians?"
It's so much fun watching the Clinton media choke as they try to explain how they blew it. Even if trump eventually loses its worth seeing. What is not funny is watching these idiots on ABC say trump is winning because of uneducated white people. Funny I thought Oregon voted for Hillary.
For the love of God do NOT let this scumbag on our campus!  Stay out of our city!  You, nor any of these dumbass, inbred white-trash supremacists are wanted!  YOU ARE NOT WELCOME!
If you become a cop, you get to kill people and get a government pension. The dead don't even have to be guilty of anything. You get a vacation with pay for every murder you commit. Government work is great. You only have to work 20 years before you can retire. The union will defend you as long as you don't kill another cop. You might lose your job if you kill a white man with money. But never fear. You can go to another town and become a cop again. The cops that do this are called "gypsy cops". There is no national data base for bad cops. Many departments don't do good background checks if the hire has any experience. Unlike fire fighters, cops don't have to keep the physical fitness that they had when they are hired. It is okay to be a fat cop. You might even get free donuts. It is good to be a cop in the USA.
Not Nazi's, just traitors. However, Charlottesville was about white supremacy, Nazis pretending their real purpose was to preserve history.
NO country with black leadership, has ever prospered"  President Obama, a black man, brought us back from the Great Recession. And that's with white conservatives attempting to obstruct him at every turn.  You alt-right guys have no sense of actual history.
my goodness when that crazy white boy went in and shot the blacks in Charleston there was a 100 comments by now.
Nambia.  Namibia.  Holy cow!  He missed a whole letter!  Have that man drawn and quartered at midnight, he is clearly the devil and his mistake was intentional because he is a white man.    That is seriously what the media has devolved into.  Almost as pathetic as Trump himself.
The White Supremacist dictate of the day with the usual obfuscating illiteracy and outright lies and deceit just like his idol.
He wants to build a better Canada. Will he defend white university professors falsely accused of racism? No, certainly not. Life for white people in Canada may well get  progressively more precarious if more progressives  gain power.
Racism makes equal protection under the law impossible. Most white people have no clue about how much rape, robbery, and murder they benefit from and they really don't want to know. We have never had justice for all in this country. What exactly has this women taught her students. What ever it was, it didn't produce equal rights for all. Of course, white people are the primary beneficiaries white racism. Racial profiling makes equal rights impossible. Most white people like it that way. This even while most cops are killed by white men. Heck, most white people deny they invented the race card founding this nation in the 1st place. They can't handle the truth. It makes them look bad.
Just another insecure weak white guy, threatened by women and minorities. Yawn. You're a dinosaur, buddy.
You're a miserable little thing, aren't you? Let me guess: white male. Beardy. Prrrrrobably MRA.  How close am I?
There's nothing 'personal' about a blog post; its a blog on the internet for people to READ. Duh. Yes its old, but its full of foolish stereotypes and clearly Hurst was in no danger other than damaging his reputation by making his fear of a brown planet public. It was 'rumored' to have a high rate of non-violent crime? He didn't even actually know, just assumed from the mumblings of his majority white friend base. There is no defending his idiotic rantings, he's just neurotic and has never extended himself beyond posting things on the internet he should probably keep to himself.
If some chap wearing a black and red bandana around his face blocks off my street, I might be tempted to spit in his face and call him a word you've never heard someone call anyone. That's the kind of thing that generates sudden hostility that Seela Sankey seems to be surprised by. Actually, on Monday I did have a woman driving her Lexus SUV with a dog in her lap pull halfway into a street and then suddenly stop when she realized I was driving in the other half. OK, I didn't spit on her, but it wasn't because she was white. It was more an issue of my closed car window. If she could have heard the obscenity I screamed, she might have wanted to go share her victimhood at this rally, but being white she would not have been allowed to speak.
You insulted me with your *** "Mr. Reyes and Mr. Trump employ identical tactics. Their posts and tweets are juvenile." -**** "Juvenile", LesterP? I believe that You and Eloisa are both racist engaging in a put down insult as "juvenile" and "taking class in high school" on one that both of you think is not White.
Not True...but let's roll with your statement and modify it to reflect our past President: "President" Obama is an apologist of "Black Lives Matter" and violent racism toward Whites and also LE; as well as an apologist of Muslim Terrorists. He is un-American and an intensely disgusting person. He shames all Americans and soils American democratic institutions. His presence in government denigrates the nation." Yes...Sooo True.
I am really enjoying the new Martin Luther King Jr stamp - just think about all those white bigots, licking the backside of a black man.  ~ Dick Gregory
In case you actually want to know and are not just trying to leave another antagonizing comment, it means that all white people benefit from the white supremacy that our country is founded on.   And while this comment section can clearly show how many white people there are out there  still believing backwards bullshit, it is a call to action for all white people who desire true equality to shut down racism in their everyday lives. Because our white priviledge is giving us a voice that our leaders listen to.   No one should need to tell you how to be a compassionate human. If you see someone being discriminated against? SAY SOMETHING. If grandma makes a racist joke at dinner? SAY SOMETHING. If your co-worker makes innapropriate comments about someone's race or orientation SAY SOMETHING.   Make rascist pieces of shit uncomfortable by raising your white voices and telling them that it is 2017 and that crap will not be tolerated.
white supremacists do not subjugate people for their religion and this is taking it a little too far to say that.   I believe that Islamist do not like jews or Christians because they feel inferior them.
Jim Acosta cannot identify himself as either a reporter or, a journalist. His democratic agenda is clear for anyone to see. His vocabulary illustrates the only words the left can hurl; racist, white supremacist.  Look at what is happening with the NFL. Most Americans are fed up with the nonsense. Acosta and Maxine Waters are wearing out the listeners with their noxious rants.
And as for the white guys who keep bringing up the unproven and stereotyped statistics of sex abuse in the villages, let me just say this: According to proven studies and statistics, white men far outnumber any other group of men for sex crimes against children and for their killings.
Ah yes, all the cupcake libs are out in force today. Let me clue you folks in a little something. First of all, it's a big bad world out there and you better man up or you will end up in your little safe spaces for your entire existence. There's just so much play dough out there and after awhile it gets dried out and crumbles, kind of like your feelings...god forbid.  Second, the arts wouldn't exist if it weren't for the rich white folks, fact! Your industry is nothing more than entertainment and trust me, it's not a necessity. Frankly, you should be thanking your lucky stars that Pence attended your show, him and his entourage most likely brought $10,000 bucks into your coffers, remember stupid, it's the economy.  That little stunt put on was akin to the dumb @ss at San Fransicso that seems to think his refusing to stand during the anthem is smart. Considering he doesn't vote confirms he isn't.  Think before you open your mouth people, you can and will lose your audience.
"That may have an atom of weight if you could point to anything in this whole affair that suggests racism by Trump."  I am so very glad you asked.  Kaepernik says he is protesting the killing of unarmed black men by white police officers.  Trump says Kaepernik has no right to do that.  This is all about race and freedom of speech.  Trump is wrong on both counts.  He is just throwing red meat to his racist base.
Those on the right also seem to struggle with nuance, everything is black and white to them.  If I say that one group of Trump supporters are racists, they hear it as my saying ALL Trump supporters are racist.
They were all White Idiots , who are making America Great Again. LOL
I see, Mr. Miller.  We should all just shut up and hide in our homes while Nazis, KKKers and various White Supremacist hate groups march outside our homes and businesses threatening genocide.  Not gonna happen.
You get to keep your affluent white comfort, the poor and Christian values be damned. By the way, France is a secular nation; the United Sates is religiously neutral. Your self serving,(probably racist, certainly classist)) "values" offer nothing to the dialogue among people of faith who gather at this site.
If the shooter is brown, then action is required immediately and it must be politicized by those on the Right.  If he is white, then nothing can be done and it is not the time to politicize the incident or discuss prevention.  Only prayers can be offered to the victims.
It's pretty obvious, Hancock and Chief White collude in withholding black crimes to the media and social media to avoid racial stereotyping (part of their "Change the Culture " initiative). If you follow DPD on twitter, they never follow-up on crimes committed in predominantly black neighborhoods. It's sort of swept under the rug.
One thing for certain was going to happen with a column like this one....all the conservative hypocrites would come on here and lecture everyone on "disrespect."  When the president exercised his freedom of speech rights in support of all the hate groups in Charlottesville, he totally disrespected all those WWII veterans who fought and died for this country against the Nazi regime who killed thousands of Americans.  How ironic some of the same people on here ripping the NFL players about "disrepsect" were the same people defending the rights of the Nazi Party, KKK and white supremacist groups to rally, protest and express their freedom of speech.  Like those groups are role models for respect of the USA.  One's definition of "disrespect" has nothing to do with the national anthem, the flag, veterans, freedom of speech, etc...it is all about your POLITICS and how you interpret situations.
To 3rd gen Ak's claim on these pages that white men are Earth's alpha males, I offer these few facts. There are many more like them. From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
white supremacists=terrorists
I don;t believe it's been established that whites break laws against crack at the same rate as blacks.  In fact, I thought the left's argument was that the crack laws are racist precisely because blacks violate crack laws more often, while powder is the white boys' crime.
“White supremacists, white nationalists, they’re not a part of anybody’s base,” Gardner said. “They are not a part of this country. They’re a part of hatred, they’re a part of bigotry, they’re a part of evil.”  Wish people felt the same way about the black panthers, BLM (black lies murder) and the anti-fascist and were demanding Democrats congressional members and Obama to speak out and condemn those groups. I detest the white supremacists and white nationalist and all they stand for. I also detest the selective outrage from Democrat supporters who stand by and say nothing or very little a best regarding the illegal and violent actions of the BLM and anti-fascist groups. My guess is the attacks by the anti-fascist group that actually started the chaos in Va were totally supported by most Democrats.
TSA does not screen for drunk idiots, if they did you are correct that white males dominate that class.  They screen for weapons and explosives in which case Arabs are at the top of the list.  It's just common sense.
So I'm clear, there are 2 groups - 1) kneel/not visit white house = not racist 2) stand/visit white house = racist???? What's its like to live in a black and white world, forgot the irony that you work at a newspaper....oh, and for the record, Trump is a complete idiot and a terrible POTUS but I think there are better ways to combat racism than simply kneeling - that's a Holkywood answer if I've ever seen one...
Sure, on paper it looks one way.  But once you understand institutionalized racism, which includes republican gerrymandering to suppress the minority vote, slanted laws that unfairly prosecute minorities as compared to whites who commit the same crime (crack epidemic treated with incarceration vs. white heroin epidemic being treated as a health issue, affluenza case, Stanford rape case, MJ offenses creating minority felons exponentially more than white), etc.  As a white person who has done very stupid things as I was younger and always got away with it, I easily recognize when my son (who is a person of color, never done anything against the law in his entire life and is graduating from a University in December) is followed around in stores by people who are just positive that he's going to steal something.  The way we're racist, is very devious and sure - it won't show up on any traditional chart.
"whites commit more murders than blacks."  That is not correct.  FBI table 3 (Murder Offenders by Age, Sex, Race, and Ethnicity, 2015) clearly shows...  White: 4636  Black: 5620  Other: 283  Unknown: 4787  I'm sorry you're having such a hard time understanding all this.
This is a sad legacy of the feminism of the '70s. American white women have made themselves so unpleasant that  men look elsewhere. Mail order brides, for example. I've got a catalogue of Russian beauties right here. They're beautiful and they're not cranky.
What  did  racist  liar  Bath  House  Barry  ever  do  for  any  white  people  other  than  his  rich  white  contributors?  Nothing.
Trump is a worthless stain on America. He's a sick, fascist, white supremacist traitor.
I figure he belongs to organized religion that preaches give more money so I can live in mansions on earth. May he be cursed with his own decisions and economics. He is a little man with visions of kingdom with the Jerry Prevo's of this world. He does not know The Almighty God or Jesus. Hypocrites. White shiney tombs with filth of corruption seeping through cracks.
Well, this white woman did not want a rude, alcoholic, violent, thief in charge of the nation I love.  I am also someone who has followed her career closely for thirty years and I was not interested in supporting a corrupt lying dirtbag who is likely into witchcraft, pedophilia, and child trafficking.  The idea of this disgusting immoral pathetic excuse for a human being standing up as a role model for girls just twists my guts into a knot.  Would someone please lock her away for one of the many crimes she is known to have committed?  Jenny Hatch www.JennyHatch.com
Hahaha.  What a joke.  Albertas' Conservatives mismanaged oil wealth for 40 years. 40!  If they had been smarter and more responsible like say Norway Alberta would have savings to deal with the commodities cycle up and downs. That's just responsible. Oh but no it's much easier and more cowardly  to lie and blame others - socialists, Qubecers, Canadians..  everyone but the fat white guy in the mirror who made the mistake in the first place. Playing the victim card on this deserves the finger and the finger violin for an outrageous lie. Where was the thanks for all the Fort MacMurray fire money and help ? Notley is one of the best premiers Alberta has had in history and trolls on here can't even see it. She is getting a pipeline for petes sake which is better than Harper or any other premier in recent history has done. Alberta,  I love you man but wake up and stop believing Conservative lies. They are screwing you.
Anthony "The Ant" Weiner and most probably Waldo Clinton's chance at POTUS taken down by a white trash gal from North Carolina.  Ha Ha Ha Ha!  It doesn't get any better than that folks.  Time to revisit Waldo's use of a private server and forwarding e-mails to a very unprotected laptop shared by The Ant and his lovely Muslim Brotherhood wife Huma.  Lock 'em all up!
What you are actually saying is that the myriad of gay guys, the leather men, drag queens and  and jocks of Church St, the people who founded Gay Pride 35 years ago,  are in reality a  hate filled bunch of sick racists.  That is the accusation made by BLM in 2016, against  the gay white men of Toronto and you agree with them.    If Pride dies will you blame BLM ? Certainly not because  you will lame the gay  men of Toronto.    Pride is being crushed under the jack boot of fascist army called BLM. and you are telling me its from my own good?  I was at the very first Gay Pride  in 1981 and have attended every year since. It is sad to see the institution being destroyed by mendacious  and selfish people of BLM with  the fawning approval of  the media and coward politicians.
Trump's inanities are dumb but reflect far more evil than stupidity. The line, "we didn't need to have the Civil War" means "why did we kill all those white soldiers, on both sides, just to free some slaves?" This is a permanent meme of the re-segregationist bloc in the US, for which Trump is the current buffoon. They were saying it 100 years ago, and seem to have new energy.
The discussion appeared to be about how he is perceived, not how he sees himself.  African-Americans perceived him as one of their own, and voted accordingly.  When they were faced with the same programs from an older white woman, they bailed.  There was a letter from prominent religious leaders in the African-American religious community pointing out to her that much of the program of her party was diametrically opposed to the core religious beliefs of their churches.  She did not even bother to acknowledge it.  The inability of the losing side to face squarely the reasons for their loss, not just at the national level but across the country, and insistence as this article demonstrates on attributing it to the stupidity and dark desires of "deplorables" seems to indicate that its run has ended unless the Republicans - as has been their custom - completely blow it.
Yes, but even on a less traumatic level than Stockholm Syndrome, women typically do not identify with gender as a class, they identify or assimilate with the immediate men in their life.  Behind every angry white man who voted for Trump  there was an angry white woman who also voted for him. They found it easy to dismiss his bragging about sexual predatory behavior as mere "locker room banter" - just like Trump's own wife stated on TV, because it's important for their psychological survival to keep their solidarity with  these key partners in their life. It's interesting to note that when women have lived among other groups of women, and shared their common experiences, and identity (such as our LCWR nuns) they began to identify by gender as women, and this led them to see the root of their oppression more clearly and to question the truth and their loyalties.
i denounce white supremacists AND black lives matter AND La RAZA.  what else did i leave out?
"ANTIFA as well as BLM are just as hateful and racists as the white supremacy guys."  Where you're wrong is the white-supremacists/neo-nazis are claiming they are superior, and their "protest" are a catalyst for violence (and came ready for it).   The people protesting them claim everyone is equal. So, no, they aren't as hateful and racists as the "white supremacy guys"
(Cont'd) The other abandonment of principle relates to the nostalgic "make America great again - like when the "in's" were all white and "out's" were either all blacks or some "white trash".
And you're in need of a lesson in grammar. It's "you're", not "your". Then you go one to  claim support for a white suprema-racist.
It is interesting how the DP is harping on this story, but they quickly buried the story last month about the African-American man in Fresno who shot and killed three people because they were white.
This isn't about Lee, or what kind of man he was. Perhaps he was a honorable fellow, but he was on the wrong side of the war. And after the war, Lee himself wanted to bury the hatchet, and was steadfastly against memorializing the conflict. This is a matter of historical fact. The reality is that the statues were raised many decades after Lee's death and weren't so much memorialize him, which was against his explicit wishes, but to support Jim Crow laws and White racial hegemony. Note that wasn't bespectacled historians in tweed that came to Charlottesville to memorialize these statues or protest their removal, it was ignorant Whites carrying Nazi swastikas shouting racist and hateful slogans.
Stupid white "progressive" trying to blame this on someone else. The people behind the murder, the genocide, were "progresssives"; the monsters that took our children and imprisoned them in government boarding schools were "progressives"; the "progressives" are still at it! Trump proposes restoration of tribal identity and rights. 80% of us voted for him! The next time you toss off some stupid partisan charge, I am going to be here, challenging you. I don't much like any whites, but Trump seems a lot better than anything we've encountered in a long time.
"white racist nation" LOLOLOL.  History shows that Barack Hussein Obama was elected POTUS because of black privilege.  He's been the Supreme Poobah (black supremacy) for eight years.  His grandmother was a "typical white person" who clung to her guns and her god.  Now what were you saying about thin skin?
Non sequitur aside, is that what your protestant public school teacher taught you about the EC? What else would you like purged from the Constitution. More importantly, what is more "racist" than white leftists keeping so many inner city blacks trapped in crappy schools and indefinitely dependent upon the welfare state?
when you go to bed with dogs, you get up with fleas or in this case, racist white supremacists.
"Your post makes me glad I am white."  I suspected as much...
Meanwhile, back on planet Earth. The problem with your BFF is that he say's stupid things on a daily basis, not to mention that he has no real answers on policy. Stupid Things + No Policies + Angry White Man = more coverage by the news media, it's pretty simple. No go on and say it's a liberal conspiracy and let Fox news rush over you like a nice cool wave and everything will be ok in your world.
Didn't you know, if your white and any one other than white cuts in line in front of you, when you call them on it your immediately a white supremacist racist dirt bag, you were supposed to realize that after the last 8 years of "conditioning".  What's wrong with you? You must be a white supremacist too.  [\end sarc]
Eminem must think that blacks and leftist whites are a majority of his audience, LOL. Detroit will "take care of you" Marshall. Bye bye now.. don't say we didn't warn you.. keep sippin on your cyanide home brew..
it's--a contraction of two words--it & is its--the possessive adjective Maybe it's just a typo on your part but what's with this "authentic American citizens" drivel? You're no more authentic a citizen than are your white bretheren who are serving time in prison or your non-white bretheren who live in poverty. You are also no more "authentically American" than the recently naturalized child of Latino immigrants.  You're just another American like the rest of us and you are entitled to your looney alt-right views even if you're not necessarily entitled to act on them. I assume that's why you're so vehemently opposed to the Southern Poverty Law Conference. It monitors the illegal activity of hate groups. Maybe you're a member of one?
Yes of course!  Purveyors of misogyny, bigots, racists, right wing fundamentalist christians, white people, gun toting nuts, Islamophobia and Nazis are responsible for her loss. Or it could be that reasonable American voters were just sick and tired of the predictable garbage she was selling.
He'll blame white oppression like they all do!  Even Africans!
An fb friend puts it well "I just hope the Trump, Bernie, third-party and non-voters are happy now. People you know — maybe even you — will die because of this. That is not an exaggeration. After moving to Texas, I couldn't get insurance as a self-employed freelancer with a depression diagnosis. Not before Obamacare. It didn't matter that I'd never been hospitalized. One wellbutrin prescription is enough to screw you when it comes to conditions they don't like. With a mother who died of ovarian cancer and a father who died of heart disease, I'm the trifecta of screwed. We all are — except for those ***hole white men and delusional women enablers sitting in Congress who don't deserve to be called human." Pre-ACA I too expected to die early because of no insurance. I've had some thru the ACA, but now perhaps I'll lose it. And yes, I again expect to die early because of no insurance.
Oh noes! It's the gay agenda and their plan of white/xtian/male genocide!!!!
White male Anti-Globalists peacefully marching = Bad. Violent masked crypto-fascists throwing bricks = Good. Shut up slaves.  MSM
Angry white guys with guns don't get this kind of attention from tRump. What big ideas did he have after the Las Vegas shooting? Seems like the new Thornton shooting is another  white guy with a gun. Terrorist attacks by foreigners are horrendous, but I have just as much of a chance of getting killed by a mentally ill or angry white guy with a gun, just by going to a department store or a movie theater. Why doesn't the orange one care about those killers?
Common sense is lacking where gun control's concerned Wanting drs to determine mental fitness?#1 It's already happening #2 Patients wont report depression or other minor probs for fear they'll be denied 2nd amendment rights Depression doesn't equate to psycho killer.#3 It's subjective,i.e. The dr's political beliefs WOULD affect decision Perhaps this man recently joined, or was a sympathizer of one of the newer VIOLENT LEFTIST groups who've pledged to kill white conservatives. They've already harmed many ANTIFA, BAMN (By Any Means Necessary).Google them,read tweets..they've declared civil war&pledged Nov 4 as dday.They've been blocking hwys holding banners w/date.They wear red/black, just as this man.hmmm.Most are white,ALL leftists. Firearms, boulders, knives, u name it They're violent, brainwashed zombies.Regarding CC'ers & Holmes, SIMPLE shot to head. BIG target Sadly misguided mgmt banned LEGAL carriers.Had this latest one taken longer, he would've been stopped--Fact
So according to the White owned media White privilege is bad. That's their message.
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye. I get this stuff all the fricken' time from Alaska racists and bigots. This is from someone with the false name of: "An Alaskan..." 2 hours ago "Do you hate all white people or just the white men? It is not surprising to me that you feel so secure typing in your racist remarks under a false name. I am pretty sure face to face your probably a lot easier to get along with. May you have a great Christmas and you get a new outlook for Christmas."  My response: "I don't hate. I despise racists and bigots of which there are many on these poor pages."  And let me add: The only white folks who call me racist are those who get all riled up seeing that I, a Native, would have the gall to say what I say. I have the same privileges as Donald Trump, and the same privilege as any white guy. OK?
Nice tirade against white people.
Kellie Leitch is digging herself a big hole.....her chatter about Canadian values is always to gain some sort of foothold with voters and this latest attempt is ridiculous.  The alt-right people in danger of becoming white supremacists are among us....they are already here Ms. Leitch.  Open your eyes!
Very true! And yet so many also around us! Just have to go to Whole foods to see those poor old white men fools being led by the nose by younger oriental women! Another type of perverion! Geez! Just because those are hetero relationships we can't let them pass unremarked!
A courageous man, in and out of the ring. When few would speak out, he risked his life's work to correctly point out the misguidedness of the Vietnam War. Certainly, he joined a Muslim religion, but this must be looked at in context of the black struggle of its day. I'm amazed at the conservatives who hate him for his belonging to a group seeking rights for its minority members, and doing so in a forceful way, yet these same white folks have no problem in strongly supporting idiots like the Malheur vigilantes whose only goal is to personally profit from land that belongs to all of us.
To those making light of a man who lost his arm fighting in battle for the USA; yeah, get it straight you knit-wits. Those making gist of a veteran are probably racists white folk from racists parts of America. And you wouldn't last five minutes in public with your racial remarks. The locals would take care of you. Disgusting bunch who don't deserve to be called Americans.
"No, America needs resentment management."  Very useful point.  Clearly, the resentment that has been building up among some whites over the last eight years has been very hard on the body politic.  Soon, the black president will be gone and the whites who voted for Trump have elected a man who will Make America White Again. As soon as Trump has Made America White Again, the whites who voted for him will no longer be eaten up by resentment.
NUKE the Rothschild-Bauer FORCED occupation of Israel. Talmudic infant killing blood drinking Jews created the Democrat, Socialist, Communist, and Liberal all to destabilise nations. Now we have Jew funded factions like Antifa'g popping up all over America. The Jews primary enemy has become the Moslem! Jews demoralised America over the last 100 years with Satanic Qabalist Hollywood. They RAPE our children. Their music "industry" screams modern slavery. Besides this TRUTH.... Why fight JEW Battles? Whites and Blacks usually get along... The Crypto-Jews ran the transatlantic slave trade. So why are White non-slave owner Americans in 2017 under attack? One answer.... Devious Evil JEWS.  Don't be fooled.... I am a Jewish anti-semite. I like being an anti-semite. When you study Jewish history for 47 years like I have you KNOW damn well who the enemy of humanity is. I am Judeo-Christian. I am on the right side. All blessings be to Jesus Christ and G🕍d!! #AmericaFirst #SimonOfTrentsRevenge
Probably got bumped to let Obama in. I was on the UCLA campus recently. Asians everywhere. But, it is not that they are bumping Asians in favor of whites.  They are bumping Asians and Whites in favor of Blacks and Hispanics.
I did not realize that those nice middle eastern boys who cut peoples heads off and burn people to death were white supremacists.
I am willing to condemn the murderers; not apologize for their crimes just because they are black.  I believe in personal responsibility; not mass white guilt or mass black guilt.
Nazi flags, bigotry, racism and cheers of "Heil Trump!" aren't coming from many sides. They're coming from violent white supremacists.
You’re a joke Why start with Chicago? All the nonwhite people the problem? Let’s start with Las Vegas or Dallas, where all the white mass shooters are from.
I am not hateful just because I hate everyone that is not a white american male.  YOU are actually the hateful one because you don't like my hate for everyone that is not a white american male.
A large percentage of those "poorly educated" white folks in the Rust Belt that elected Trump are more comfortable being victims than taking responsibility for their choices in life. No one is profiling them. No one is trying to deport them. They get to vote if they want to. They are the only demographic dying younger and they are killing themselves with their behaviors. As technology and globalization make bigotry and racism less profitable, they refuse to change with the times. On some deep level they realize that merit and equality for all are social and economic demotions for them. They would rather die than admit this truth. Sadly, like they do in their families when they commit murder suicides, they want to take the rest of us down with them if they can't have their way. Then along came Russia with their boy Trump. They treat him like their savior. This even though he has never saved anyone but himself. Being ignorant is not a good strategy for success in the 21st century.
When black folks profile white folks as criminal suspects for just being alive, get back to me. Until then you are just another white man happy to be white. I admit your most most valuable asset is your skin.
Besides white males, what other visible minority would it be acceptable to vilify, openly and exuberantly, as Renzetti has done here?
I'm Stella's age.  I remember being able to afford a health insurance policy and a country that led the world in scientific discovery.  During the last three decades, private health insurance became outrageously unaffordable, a big chunk of our population lost it's critical thinking skills and now it's an actual "thing" to not believe in science.  I blame the Republican Party.  They cozied up to the crazy evangelicals, and the idiocy became contagious.  I left the Republicans about 25 years ago, and have watched in dismay as they have sunk deeper and deeper into the abyss.  Hatred and division under Obama?  Yes, sadly it turns out that the racism never completely went away, and a lot of white people just could not handle having a black man as their president.  And the people who voted for Trump feeling a bit forgotten?  I wonder how forgotten they'll feel after he continues the Republican assault against the middle class in favor of the ridiculously wealthy.
IT would not be called peaceful if a group of angry white people commandeered Caribbana in the same way making 9 irrevocable demands for white  control  in the running of Caribana.   But being gay, we are expected to submit to being   slandered and abused.
Voter ID's laws aren't racist, and neither is getting rid of this asinine law.  Actually- Blacks Say Whites Who Think "Voter ID Laws Are Racist" Are Ignorant Racists: . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llDM-44Zb8w . BLM is the SAME thing as Antifa and the KKK- they preach and practice violence, oppression, and race-based hatred-- from the Washington Post: . https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/yes-antifa-is-the-moral-equivalent-of-neo-nazis/2017/08/30/9a13b2f6-8d00-11e7-91d5-ab4e4bb76a3a_story.html?utm_term=.8bcc5949c3eb . Your hate and intersectionality is evil, and your racism is bringing this country down.
Racist! Bigot! Misogynist! White Supremacist! Sexist! Russia! Russia!  Collusion! Collusion! Impeach! Impeach!  So stuck on stupid. No cure. So sad.
I think I heard one of the white guys yelling (between his rants about the Jews and Blacks) , " leave history alone, in fact we want that history where we could lynch the Blacks back". He was so nice about it - he said "please, let us have that history back".
But your comment is NOT hurtful in the white heterosexual male community?.Skip the postmodernism,Mel.Look up the word 'hypocrisy' in the dictionary.
Yes, these white people, for instance Alaska serial killers Israel Keyes, Robert Hansen, Joshua Wade, all reveal they are inhumane, arrogant and indifferent to the suffering of women, young people, Alaska Natives, blacks, etc.   What do you think should be done about them?
Well, that's just plain stupid. The Black Panthers weren't going around lynching people, stopping whites from voting, or anything even close to what the Klan did. Do a little research on the subject, then come back and pontificate if you still feel like it.
Oh come on and get off the black, white, blue lives matter merry-go-round.  Every human life matters.  Period.  We don't need bigotry and racism poking its ugly head up every time a police officer or an ethnic or white citizen is shot and killed.  Stop fueling the race game.  If you don't have anything constructive toward the healing of our nation, then keep your cotton picking mouth shut.  Go away.  We don't need to hear from you.
Surely the wish of Doug Saunders to radically change the definition of terrorism to his own new personal definition of terrorism...  ... has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with any interest in taking the intense media spotlight, in the West, OFF OF Islamist attacks...  ... by somehow, and vey creatively...  ... using semantics tricks to try to blend them imperceptibly with the habits of some violent right-wing white Americans such as disgruntled US workplace shootings and US school campus shootings and angry US mass shootings with high-power rifles?  Surely, surely nothing to do with any such "let's shift the spotlight and diffuse and dilute it out" goal, yes?  Surely?
South Africa is one of the most violent and corrupt countries in the world. Its current leader is looking more and more like Mugabe in neighbouring Zimbabwe.  In Zimbabwe Black gangs terrorize, rape, and murder white farmers. This is the example that the Liberals use?
I'd hire this guy by lunchtime The globalist left wants to destroy capitalism at all costs. It deploys agents everywhere. Then deploys this evil quota crap on corporations. Deadbeats must make up 75% of your corporation.....  How the hell this kid got fired for speaking his mind and his ideals is an absolute travesty  Business and greatness is about fire - not corn flakes You want debate You want discussion you want yelling That is how great ideas are born They are not born with cuddles, cookies and hot milk......  This is exactly why women don't succeed in business  Consensus is for communists and evil feminist white male haters Success is bred by killing your enemy - not cuddling him. Women cannot kill it is not in their nature There I said it  You all OK now or do you need a snowflake cuddle room
I think there's another piece to this issue, too.   We can blame the media ad nauseum....BUT Donald Trump's bullying and appalling behavior APPEALLED to a substantial number of voters who wanted to elect this appalling man, because he was a misogynist, racist, sexist, white supremacist, antisemitist et al...  Think we really need to ask ourselves about this "thin veneer" of civility that we thought was far more common (thicker) in our society?   I frankly had absolutely no idea that there were so many folks who shared Trumps values...  I thought our democracy rested on firmer ground....I don't think so today.  I'd like to see comparisons between media in the 30s in Germany and today's media...here in the US...sadly suspect there are sutantive parallels.
Wow - I just flagged someone for saying STFU, and then I read your post - and that's all I can think of to say, too.  Seriously, Chas - when will you stop blaming every evil in the world on white males?
White rednecks. Rabid racists. Haters. The KKK. They here.
Because rap has done so much good for the Black community.  Drugs, illicit sex, strippers, rape, and Michelle's fave, anti-white racism!
Yet white males continue to vote for this party. Emasculated, cowardly, and stupid white males.
yes, I think that the baker who is sole owner, has the right to say that he will not decorate the cake the way that they want.  This is true for when KKK, NAZIs, Muslims, Christians, Disabled, White, Pink, Red, Blue, etc. Heck, even a Zombi.  I will not be using this baker because I disagree with what he is doing.  Look, the constitution gives us rights and freedoms. And a big part of that is the right to be jerks.
Everything in that blog post is racist. It's a literal description of a racist's reaction to being in an area where they are the other.   The fact that you don't see anything racist in it tells me that you need to reexamine some things.  Also, ALL WHITE PEOPLE ARE RACIST. Having a knee jerk reaction and getting in your feelings when your racism is pointed out is less than helpful.
That's whey they murdered a protestor, and a bunch of white supremacists got charged with felonies, right? But BLM was "riotous"?
Hey Lil Dicky how stupid are you it's because black people are sent to jail 10 times more than white people it's called white privilege you racist piece of shit
Show us where Trumplethinskin disavowed support of white supremacists.
Wow, nice racist rant.  Let me guess.  You're an uneducated white male who either currently lives or did live in a racist red state.   Make sure no one in your family, or you collect social security or medicare.  We wouldn't want you to debase yourself with any handouts.  The crazier Trump gets, the more unhinged the MAGAphants get.  Keep posting.  Insanity can be rather entertaining (in a clinical sort of way).
Born and raised and live here for 40 years! If they want a better life for their families maybe they should be running for government jobs in their own countries and stop cowardly creeping over our border to loot our social services.  Stop with the cliches!  Everyone knows us white people are the devil. I'm just at home sharpening my horns as I write this.
To no ones surprise Trump immediately dissed Meryl Streep. But that is nothing new. He has attacked anyone who makes fun of him (Baldwin) cant be as good as him (Arnold) or just disagrees with him (too many to recount). He goes after companies (Boeing ,Lockheed) and their stocks plunge. Can't wait till he goes after someone really big and the stock market crashes and gold soars. He is an ego driven psychopath who doesn't know the phrases "turn the other cheek" or "take the high road". His over driven ego only knows one thing - attack and diss. For 8 years Obama has endured all sorts of abuse at the hands of people like Trump. But I never heard him attack and diss back. Obama has some class. This man is just white trash - very rich white trash.
So dumb. Q: What percent of white men hold executive jobs at their companies? A: A tiny fraction of one percent. Q: What percentage of white men are congressmen? A: A tiny, tiny fraction of a percent.   The white man has become the boogey man, when the job situation for 99.9999% of white men, and their chance of being promoted, is no different than that of women and minorities. Oh, and, given the reverse discrimination, in academics minorities and women are being hired and promoted at a much higher rate than white men, but based on their sex and skin color, and NOT on performance.
not to mention causing a mini-AIDS epidemic by defunding HIV testing in the state.  Oh, it wasn't among persons of color or gay folks, it white drug users.
So you're saying a white racist refers to a white guy who slaughtered mostly whites at a redneck concert in a nicer way than an Islamist terrorist?   My GOD grow up.   If "pure evil" isn't good enough for you, nothing is.
Got you.  If he's white and/or Christian he's just a disturbed individual who went off the rails.  If he's Muslim he's a terrorist.
So why would I want to call myself a conservative after the way them white racist thugs have used that word to hide behind? They call themselves new Republicans.  ~ Dick Gregory
Trump is nothing if not the virulently racist, anti-immigrant president he promised to be, folks. If progressives don't get serious about opposing his racist AG Sessions and the filthy slob Bannon who's running his racist sh*t show, these examples of human vermin are going to get away with this white supremacist project and bring our great country down to their vulgar level.
Try flying into anyone of the 7 countries (and others in the region) listed for the ban and see what happens to you…  you’ll be turned away because you’re white and Christian and they don’t want you, you’re not welcome there.
The President is aware that there is at least one other group of White Americans who are in no Way, Shape or Form either Supremacists, Racists, NAZIs or anything bigoted.  They are Conservative Patriots who believe that the revision of history is beneath a great people.....of any color.  This puts the President at odds with a Main Stream Media which is attempting to lump all whites who believe in leaving these monuments in place as NAZI Sympathizers, or White Nationalists.   To castigate the President for being more accurate than the Media belies only their great corruption and their willingness to perpetuate ignorance for political effect.   Jon-David Wells, Host: The Wells Report, Dalls/Ft. Worth, TX
I don't get it.  I'm sure other races do it, but it baffles me that whites want to blame other races for some intangible issue.  Blame the blacks, blame the Chinese, blame the Mexicans. Uh, what are they really taking from us whites personally?  Nothing substantial I can put a finger on.  Certainly nothing from me personally that makes a hoot of difference in my life.  I've got it good.  I could have it better, but the only one to blame for that is me.
Ignoring race and having a good life are white privileges in this country. Enjoy. It is a life and death matter for the rest of us.
Watch the trumpet goo gang try to spin this story around to say whites are the victims. An old homeless man and a cafe dishwasher trying to make a living. This is not America. This perp needs the death penalty.
Dear author, please stop being a bigot. It is every bit as offensive for your to condemn all "White Males" as it is for a neo-fascist to spew his (or her) judgments. The proud boys don't care if there are all women showings of movies. Please end your prejudice.
Our heritage or race is getting old? Wow, is that what you talk about at those rallies of white guys who can't comprehend beyond the third grade?
I've been told by brown people, asian people, black people, white people and indigenous people to shut the ef up. I never took it as racist. This broad should do the same.
No, He's Trump and he's a white supremacist who can't remember what he said yesterday.  And it won't matter tomorrow what he said today.  He's an incompetent, weak, mentally unstable, fascist buffoon.
I remember my father often saying, "It takes two to fight!" when breaking up sibling scuffles. Advice from a Bill Cosby book on parenting was to punish both combatants, regardless of who said what to whom.  Pres. Trump was quite correct to blame both sides of the Charlottesville conflict.  Granted the white supremacists have a history of violence. But you can't sell the anti-protesters as meek, little lambs after their antics in MO and Berkeley.  So yes, chastise both groups for their intolerance and violence.
So the words White supremacists is okay to say, but radical Islamic terrorists isn't, when radical Islamic terrorist murder Americans. Interesting. It's okay to now use the word evil, but not okay to use the words "axis of evil. Again interesting. This is ALL base on emotion. The emotion that the left lost the election. Extremism is Extremism regardless of what group, and terrorism is terrorism regardless to what religion. And violence is violence regardless of who is doing it, include taking a rife and shooting at Senators.
Don't white supremacists hate Jews? Trump is surrounded by Jews. His daughter is a convert and his son in law is Orthodox Jewish.
I would have agreed with you a year ago. But white nationalist clowns like this particular one actually win "elections" in such corrupt systems - you never know.
It isn't  just "white supremacists" who are upset at government largesse to fake refugees and illegal immigrants.
Kudos to the farmers and women entrepreneurs for getting the pullback. For the white, middle aged, balding, overweight guys running small businesses, you'll need to better market yourself next time to avoid being the cash pinata to be whacked at Mr Morneau's convenience.
"That's a warped version of Christianity."  Religious authoritarians everywhere are a menace to democracy and peaceful co-existence. ISIS is but the most extreme manifestation.  In the wake of Charlottesville not one member of Trump's Evangelical Council has resigned. Corporate fat cats acted with more moral principle, however calculated, than Christians. Good luck to the 400 dissociating authoritarianism and racial animus from white American Christianity. We need look no further than the conservatives on this forum, so offended by any suggestion that racism is a persistent evil in the United States, to get a sense of how how tough that row is to hoe.  White Christians put Trump in power and despite Trump's appalling tenure thus far continue to support him.  It's striking evidence that the prerogatives of the religious right are first and foremost theocratic. And if white supremacy is part of the bargain, apparently for Trump supporters that's a feature, not a bug.
Maybe white males are just smarter and more qualified than everybody else. Anybody ever bother to consider that possibility?
More white man shame.   We truly are God's damned creatures aren't we .
"Yet you are okay with an old white guy in McCallum as Ambassador to China, too funny!"  -  #whataboutism
"Some people debated whether Corn Pops have a gender."  Cereal has no damn gender. Jesus F'n Christ.  Somehow I bet he doesn't have a problem working on a character called "Black Bolt" who is actually a white character. Just as stupid.
After all the death threats emanating from the Nazis and the white supremacists, it's fitting that they might know the same threat.  I don’t condone death threats, but I do want to point out that his life is not over in the same way that Heather Heyer’s is.
1) So, is the REPUBLICAN Secretary of State of Mississippi also butthurt over the election as well?  43 states have taken issue with certain levels of the request.  Are they also butthurt about the election?  2) If this was Obama asking for this information, you'd be breaking out your tricorn hat, putting on your American flag shirt, and heading to the nearest Tea Party rally.  3) Kobach is considered a joke in Kansas.....a very Republican state.  He has uncovered 3 cases of actual fraud....all of which were committed by white people that were registered Republicans.  He has filed his papers to run for governor in 2018...and will likely lose.  he has lost nearly every court hearing in regards to his voter fraud activities.
Thank for whitesplaining and fat shaming. God knows  we wouldn't want to elect a man who gropes ugly women.
SAYS THE OLD WHITE LADY HER SELF outsider77 have to make it about so called oppressed niggers. and old people waiting to die? come the fuck on your're a moron
Then maybe those Nazis should stop holding up swastikas. They should stop believing that being born white means superiority.  No, they are not the same creature. Colleges also have the freedom to keep people off their campuses. It goes both ways you know. The alt-right use PC has a shield to be as nasty as they want to be. Calling people ragheads for example, isn't against PC but just plain mean, rude and stupid. It shows a level of intelligence that wouldn't rise to double digits in the IQ department. You really need to be in the here and now. If you think the KKK and neo-Nazis are liberals you've really got a comprehension problem. Again pointing out hate, doesn't mean you're a hater. Pointing out racism doesn't mean you're a racist. It is the actions of haters and racists that make them so. They blame Obama but all he did was get elected while being black. No logic involved. Just ignorance. I'm waiting for these mensa members to explain what Obama has done that is so bad. Still.
"Ostrem is registered as a Republican in Colorado, according to voter records. He is not married." My bet is he is an angry White Supremacist.  Look at his arrest records.  He could be looney tunes too.
Trump is a white nationalist, or at least he has certainly surrounded himself with them and is singing along.  Farange, Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon, retweeting from Neo-Nazis and white supremacists.   What do we have to lose?  EVERYTHING.
I'm not sure what this article has to do with "white supremacy"? When a miniscule percentage of the Caucasian community acts like a lunatic, is that white supremacy? After the London Bridge attack I do not recall a declaration of Islamic supremacy, maybe I missed Ms. Aziz's article that week?
MacKay was never a soldier. A soldier boasting about his battles is a common and tolerated thing. Sajjan risked his life many times for you. There are too many low white racists in Canada. This is a brave soldier who gave a somewhat exaggerated account of his role in one battle. Big deal. Ordinarily, it would be shrugged off with a wink and an amused grin. But the man is brown and so all the white skunks have leapt on him.
From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
"There were some very fine people on both sides of the truck attack... on BOTH sides."   Oh wait, he only does that when white supremacists murder. Notable we didn't hear the both-sides-izm from Trump this time that we hear from him when white supremacist terrorists are involved.
Basketball Black team beats another basketball Black team. Where's the equality in the NBA?  Look at the picture. Not a White guy in sight.  11 out of 13 players on every NBA team are Black. This is a sure sign of discrimination and racism!  The only cure is a type of affirmative action where the owners must only hire White guys until there are at least 7 on each team. (penalized them by one because they must pay for these most egregious past transgressions). Oh, and in keeping with the whole equality thing lately, Lebron must give me half of his money.  You know, so we are EQUAL. We can flip a coin for the Lamborghini.
I am so sick of the rhetoric that all white are rich and all blacks are poor, because it is a lie!  Of course there are wealthy whites, built on many generations of hard work and, yes, abuse of influence, bribery, murder and all things that we find repulsive.  But to generalise is to have an agenda that is clearly aimed at covering up the reality of black monopoly capital.  Just one look at our political leaders will show you how to amass wealth in less than one generation without a single contribution to the economy. You also talk glibly about the SOE's.  Every one is a basket case, run by inept, unqualified cadres.  Your comment about SAA deserves special scorn.  Without taxpayers money, this company would no longer exist.  How many times has it been bailed out by Treasury.  Just look at SABS, SABC, SANRAL, SFF and all the others that your government has ruined. By the way, what do your finances look like??  Bet that you have plenty tucked away for a rainy day.
jerry69, Unfortunately, racism in America is still alive.  The racists are supporting the politician who called Mexicans "criminals, drug dealers, and rapists," who said that a judge was biased because "He's a Mexican," who said that Arabs "were cheering when the World Trade Center came down, who was sued by the Justice Department for discrimination against African-Americans in renting apartments, who confirmed that the travel ban is a ban on Muslims, and who refused to condemn white supremacists who were campaigning for him,  Trump took advantage of racial animus, and it propelled him to win the election.  https://www.thenation.com/article/economic-anxiety-didnt-make-people-vote-trump-racism-did/
Buses and BIG trailer tractor trucks are to blame for the horrendous conditions of our streets. Our roads are NOT built to take the weight !! As far as Austin goes, it IS Texas, land of white supremacy. NO THANK YOU if you ain't a WHITE, God Fearing, conservative, & gun toting MAN !!!
Once again it is political correct to say WHITE people are out of touch with BLACK people, but if I say I am a RED skin Chickasaw who disagrees, I am shouted down as a racist by political correct morons.
Alt-right is just a catch all phrase for people that do not fit into your typical republican/tea party camp.   Richard Spencer is not a white supremacist he is a white nationalist...there is a difference.   Not that I would expect anyone at the globe to have the brain cells to discern the difference.   In its neverending war on nonpolitically correct thought the globe is a complete joke.   The globe is a living example of racism in action,  racism against whites.
Step one: Demoralization Step two: Destabilization Step three: Crisis (Civil War/Invasion)  Destabilization = Don't trust the cops (authority). Blacks think conservative Whites are all racists. Feminist think all men are oppressors and predators. Gay/Transvestites want to break what is considered a model family unit. Stifle speech by calling it hate speech. Re-write history, etc.  So if you are part of the BLM or ANTIFA, of Femi-nazi's, or any of the other groups, you are just a tool being used to tear this country down so it can be restructured in a more controlled manner (Communism).     If you think that's what you want, understand the final step: Normalization = Kill all the tools that think they will control any part of the country or cause any type of protest. So the new government will not tolerate BLM, ANTIFA, Feminist, or Gays.
It is just the opposite.  So called "white people" by the moron from the Washington Post keep quiet.
Hey G&M, re Barcelona..."Van Attack"? Few days back you called white supremacist, neoNazis, why is this not an Islamic attack? Get your act together b4 its too late.
But yes, it's significant.  Being killed in an auto accident is more significant.  But if you're murdered, it's nearly 8 times more likely that it will be by a white person, probably someone you know.
BLM encouraged hate. They wanted blacks to attack whites at their gatherings . Why are they not charged with hate crimes? If a white person so much as insults a dark person they lose their job and are publically vilified. The police and Trudeau's government to not speak at all. They are all enablers and suck ups to dark hate groups . There will be pay back.
I think it is just that a Muslim terrorist fits his narrative, while a white one does not.  All in all, pretty pathetic that he plays these games.
When I was in grade school,  Puerto Rican terrorists tried to kill President Truman at Blair House,  where he was living while the White House was being renovated post WWII.  So last weekend,  the alt left Democrat Mayor of New York had a Puerto Rican terrorist and bomber with dead NYC cops and others blood on his hands was an honorary figure in the Puerto Rica Day parade.  As ye sow,  so shall ye reap.  The only terrorists who are honored in this country are non white,  except maybe for Obama and his fascination for Bill Ayers,  the Weatherman bomber.  I don't get it.  Terrorists with Che' shirts are heroes here,  and people who try to make meaningful change are vilified.
"El Rubo" or "Hey Rube"- Richard Johnson Esq. Richard, you are one nasty snob and a racist.   Why does it upset you that one with a non-White (Mexican, Spanish) name as Ruben Reyes dares to enter into a discussion in this CB forum?
Jackie:  Your post here is based on INCORRECT information.  "These are black kids who's "crime" was they touched a white chick" is NOT true.  the young woman involved was AfricanAmerican.  If you read the Police Report you will see that the "race" box for the victim is marked AfricanAmerican (Black).  Spinning this incident to be a racial incident is really a shame.  I, for one, would appreciate it if you would either delete your post references to this as a "black on white" incident or make some correction.  If you doubt my information, do a little research and see it for yourself.  Thanks,  Gary Crum
Of course non-whites can dress up as whites, the more offensive towards whites the better. Where have you been?  It's not racist if it's against white people, it's justice.
This editorial is fine with me. I don't agree with Antifa's methods although I support most of the same causes.  I say the ends don't justify the means. But apposing Antifa's methods doesn't make be swallow the false equivalency of "on both sides" because I saw the video of the nazis marching and chanting with clubs and torches, the terrorism that killed a woman and injured 19 others, and the savage beating of the black guy in the parking lot. There were no good people marching and chanting as nazis. Trump's stand on Charlottesville encouraged nazi groups and KKK. And "on both sides" is code for white supremacy and racism. It's a damn shame that antifa, a small fringe group, feeds the whole false equivalency baloney. This fringe group on the left is wrong; but doesn't counterbalance the bulk of racism and white supremacy and KKK, and Trump's in-code approval of them.
"This does not mean, however, that Canada is immune from the waves of white supremacy, venomous nationalism and xenophobia sweeping the West".   hmmm...I await Ms Kendzior's denunciation of BLM Toronto co-founder Yusra Khogali's assertion then at a recent protest that we have already succumbed  "Don't cheer," Khogali said. "We know what that is, we know what that manipulation is, it is what this country is founded on—erasure and silencing of the real history of this land. The genocide of Indigenous people, in which the state is founded on. The enslavement and genocide of black people, in which the state is founded on."  Khogali continued, "When Justin Trudeau says that he is a liar, he is a hypocrite, he is a white supremacist terrorist."  Now I know Justin Trudeau is not a white supremacist terrorist...but then I also know that Sarah's weekly excessive hyperbole detracts from her message
These thugs are Caucasian.  Imagine that.
Trump's racial animus against Hispanics (Mexicans) started on his first day on his campaign trail-all Mexicans are criminals, rapists, murderers, and on and on. So that prompted the State of New York to lead a lawsuit against the United States along with 14 other states to stop the end of DACA. As with the travel ban, Trump and his Alabama-born and raised AG Jefferson Beauregard Sessions will see their ill-fated White Supremacist venture evaporate as it very well should.
Yup. If that were a white couple, with a white child in the back seat, the cop would not have been so quick to shoot. This is America.
Since I'm black, I have no arguments with my family about Trump. I hope the white folks that elected Trump enjoy watching the  cops kill unarmed minorities on the evening news. That is about all they will get from Trump. Of course they already have that. Maybe Russia will care about them, but I doubt it. Putin is not known for caring about the poorly educated.
"HTG, with so many more important matters at hand, do we now have to pay attention to whether we wear 'racially appropriate' jewelry?" I guess many white folks can't handle diversity, even when it does not effect them directly, like how black women wear their hair and jewelry.
Which means get rid of all the white folks and Asian settler colonials, right?!
Yep, I guess i am one of those "old white men" (about to be 50) that will easily challenge if the resulting, even current world has improved at all.  We just had a shooting on Christmas Day. my old white friends did not teach the cowardly man to solve problems by shooting someone in the back of the head and then go run and hide like a coward.  Just a few weeks ago, we had a drunken driver in Waimanalo hit and kill a child in a crosswalk, in a stroller.  None of my old white friends, nor did Trump, teach that young woman to drink and drive, and then run away like a coward when she plowed over someone.   A few months ago a woman deliberately ran over a guy on a motorcycle in order to solve her problem. Killed him and then she went and ran and hid like a coward too.  Turns out she has a lengthy history of driving illegally.  The primary and most consistent thing missing from todays "new and improved" world, is any shred of personal responsibility for ones actions.
I hate everything that the white nationalists stand for but regardless of my objection, there is something called the 1st amendment which allows them to assemble and protest.  You can't pick and choose which speech is allowed and which isn't based upon how you feel about the message.  ALL sides have the right to assemble and protest peacefully.  There was violence on all sides which cannot be tolerated.
Trump is an admitted white supremacist and eugenicist.  His 'base', and I do mean 'base', loves them some racism.  It's what attracted them to Trump.
"everything is a protected class now a days." Except the beleaguered white, christian male, amirite?
Yet another fake news leftist putsch to keep pressure on all people of Canada. Cranking up useless narratives to keep all of us off balance.  There are many great articles around how there is actually a leftist conspiracy to keep the pressure on.. Universities being the core of this conspiracy of the Left with Anti-fa as their army.  These G&M journalists apparently are being paid to do this by the Soros organization.  G&M is actually charging to run these BS articles. From what now is understood, there are actual leftist war rooms that disseminate this trash and pay papers to run this crap.  The only racism is the racism against normal decent white people who are fed up with this leftist immigrant sponsored crap. You uncle Tom white leftists are a direct threat to the sovereignty and security of Canada
How sad that someone in our community is just fine with cops planting evidence while playing judge, jury and executioner. We used to strive to be a nation of laws under the rule of law. Yes, we strove imperfectly, but at least we tried.  His false concern for community safety rings hollow unless he is also in favor of street executions of scofflaw motorists by traffic cops (which we don't happen to have at this time). More Americans are killed by scofflaw motorists than are otherwise murdered, but it's largely white folks doing that killing, so I suspect Mr. Twyford is just fine with those deaths.
What would happen if a person stood with a sign saying"WHITE CHRISTIAN GUN NUTS OUT OF POLITICS"? Think Trump voters wouldn't get off on harming that person?
Color or race has nothing to do with it . In comments to others you seem to be the one pushing the race card.   The court must feel this person isn't a flight risk to make bail five grand.  I base my comments on the story that's reported.  No person----white , black , any race , any gender should be out walking at night in the roadway.  Anyone who does this is rolling the dice with their own life.  Very little good happens out on the streets from 11 pm until about 6 am .  People who love their families are wise to tell them not to be out on the streets between those hours.  Of course they have the right to be there , but those who want to live longer should avoid it .  Sadly , one has the right to ride a bike on slick winter streets . Only fools with no common sense or a death wish do it.  Everyone needs to protect themselves and avoid all the risk they reasonably can .
Funny I grew up poor white trash with only one parent on food stamps the whole 9 yards. I've never killed anyone. Its a person problem calling it anything else is giving people an excuse
Naive fools or strategic globalists with an agenda to destroy white culture and Christianity and who refuse to acknowledge that radical Islam is growing in my country   Do not belong in my Canada
How do you associate picking the best, no matter the gender as saying only white men? You've only demonstrated a shameless subjective bias and unapologetic ignorance. Trudeau is championing a policy that puts gender and race before merit, #becauseit's2017. Monsef and Duncan - the best people for the job? Really? Canada deserves each other.
White liberals are teaching Native American youth to be ashamed of our traditions, just like white Christians used to teach us our gods are evil. It takes a shameless arrogance to lecture to Native American tribes that our mascots of tradition created by Native Americans for Native American's are racist stereotyping of us Injuns. It takes a shameless arrogance to lecture we must do away with our traditions and culture because white liberals find them offensive, just like Christians find our gods offensive. Long before whitey showed up us Red Skins have had mascots but why let facts get in the way when you're teaching a culture we are racist and need to abandon our traditions and culture to adopt the traditions and culture of Political Correct EMOTIONAL CRIPPLES
We should've started with NOT electing a President that states "thinks like a typical white person".
What a crap piece of journalism! So white (particularly male) people have now to be apologetic of their "privileged" position in life? With this type of reporting one should not be surprised that the "white man" feels threatened and that populist movements in Europe and USA will be further  on the rise.   First of all there are numerous non-white role models in our society, like Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, president Obama, or Malala Yousafzai. The fact that 12 year old children don't list these people has more to do with what they watch and read today. Don't forget "Bollywood" which is a bigger film industry then Hollywood and generates (non-white) role models for billions of people.   Canada has provided non-white people opportunities which they would not always have had in their home countries. Canada is a great country because we welcome these people and allow them to pursue their dreams. However, we should not start creating divide between white and non-white people.
Really unbelievable how many apologists for the white supremacists there are on this thread.    Read the posts and remember the fake names they use to hide their identity.  When they attack Hillary or Obama, they are excusing and endorsing this vile behavior.  When they claim that there is equality with the other side or deflecting, they are giving a pass to white supremacists and joining their ranks.   This rise in white supremacy and their claim of discrimination against whites is an expression of hate and inequality. They want to be more than equal and use violence and force to enforce it. And these apologists are tRump supporters too.  What a terrible plague they have unleashed upon this country and the world.  tRump turned his back on the working class and the little people as soon as he had his pathetic inauguration.  Except of course for his making Americans hate rallies.
Another biased, hypocrite article. Milo went over his free speech, but the author's rant is all about the fact that he is a male, good looking, white, on top gay Conservative. That's mainly, what this opinion is so against his 'free speech'. Take the case of a left wing bozo Bill Maher, "who took credit for the downfall of Milo Yiannopoulos, has also defended adult sex with children", according to the NP headliner. Ms, author, care to mention about leftist Bill Maher, I didn't think so.
all you are doing with this sorry excuse for an article, is perpetuating racial tension.  you are doing nothing positive.  you wanna feel guilty for being a white guy, join a gang.  then you can get shot at all ya want.   adn- why do you give people like this attention?  you guys suck.
Singh will get the majority of Sikh votes. - fine in a general election but in the NDP leadership were Sihks over-represented? , in the leadership election for NDP leader were Sikhs over-represented in proportion to their share of the general population - is that how Singh won? , if White folks vote for Trump only because he is white then All hell will break lose, , but Sikhs can vote for Jagmeet Singh and it is democracy double standards
If white supremacists were going around killing Native Americans in the name of the American flag, I would agree with you. But instead, white supremacists are killing black people in the name of the Confederate Flag, like Dylann Roof. Your false equivalency doesn't work here.
DRAFT THE 70 PERCENT INTO THE US ARMY FOR GUN FODDER ON THE FRONT LINE.  This will force North Korea to run out of bullets and artillery shells.   When that happens we send in our White Male Hetro-sexual troops to win the WAR.   We get rid of our Social Parasites and win a WAR.   When you need something done right, call on a White Male American.
White folks...How about serial killers? Albert DeSalvo, the Boston Strangler, David Berkowitz, New York City’s “son of Sam.” Ted Bundy, who called himself “the most coldhearted son of a bitch you’ll ever meet,” confessed to thirty murders in the 1970s. Chicago serial killer John Wayne Gacy, murdered thirty-three teenaged boys and young men in the 1970s, burying twenty-seven in the crawl space under his house.  Gary Ridgeway, Washington State’s Green River Killer, was convicted of killing forty-eight girls and young women but admitted to ninety murders during the 1980s and 1990s. Jeffrey Dahmer, the Milwaukee Cannibal, raped, murdered, and dismembered seventeen men and boys over thirteen years, Dennis Rader, known as BTK killed ten in Wichita, Kansas and was on the loose for decades.  Though each of these men was white, no fear of white men emerged. Their murders were considered individual acts for which they alone were responsible.
Mel   ....    I am all for freedom of religion and agree these young Muslims should be able to come together for their expression of faith.    What pisses me off is, you think it's a value to be tolerant, except when it comes to white, heterosexual men.
Uplifting stories: 1) Residents of Mountain View are proud of their community and working hard to make it a better place, 2) life is still pretty great for white, Christian, heterosexual males, despite their whining to the contrary. Those two are just off the top of my head!
Anyone who defends Trump's support of Nazis and White Supremacists supports white supremacy by extension. To claim Trump doesn't support white supremacy is true denial. He's demonstrated his support since from his first rallies to his latest comments on the issue, which means he does not represent equality for all Americans, so he's unfit to occupy the Oval Office.
Computer programs like this are forced to be made to show some modicum of objectivity because lawmakers don't want to be accused of 'raaaacism' by black racialists and white Liberals on something we all know.  Here's the good news about facts and statistics: they don't care about your feelings.  Blacks- specifically men- commit a grossly disproportionate amount of crime. There. That's a fact.  According to FBI data, 4,906 black people murdered other blacks in 2010 and 2011.  White males are 40 percent of the population and committed 4,582 murders. That same year, black males were just 6.6 percent of the population but committed a staggering 5,531 murders (http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf)  Employment history and family structure are also important: so why do Leftists refuse to accept that almost 75% of blacks are raised by absentee and single parents? (http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/walter-e-williams/true-black-tragedy-illegitimacy-rate-nearly-75)
What she is saying "Women and minorities are too incompetent to compete with white men, so the bar needs to be lowered." The irony of the SJW brain is they don't realize how stupid they sound or the fact that just because you believe in something so much, doesn't make it real.
"The greatest threat to our domestic security is white men..." Statistics and numbers tell a different story. All the gang related murders occurring every day, spread throughout the country, and goes unreported because it's so common.
White Catholic voters were instrumental in electing violence, hate, bigotry, racism, misogyny as a quid pro quo for a conservative judge, the remote possibility of rendering abortion illegal, and the exclusion of Catholic "businesses" from supposed intrusion of the Obamacare - a minor element.  White Catholic voters were heavily influenced by US Bishops and clergy. And then these same have the gall to decry racist violence?  Something, no, some people and their stuff, stinks....
As a non Christian, I look at the Christians and the evangelicals and wonder what kind of christianity they worship, or, how the Christian politicians who are defunding the health and social programs that help the unfortunate, sick, weak, infirm, diseased, hungry and the dying, and giving the same funding to whatever corporation or individual fatcat banker on wallstreet, bribed them, even call themselves Christians? I may end up in the white mans hell, but I will see many past administrations and congressional delegations there.. There are many bribed to allow invasions and occupations to enrich a few leeches and parasites, that end with the suffering ad slaughter of the Native inhabitants to get them out of the way of civilized theft and murder... And hallelujah... I will see many of the posters to adn.com there also. I see too many pious individuals go out of their way to cut down their fellow man, out of greed, racism,
Democrats picked a white Hispanic over an authentic black man?  Don't black lives matter anymore?  I hope one day the democrat party old white leadership is replaced by people of color.
Walter "white guilt" and your myth of "Democratic Party guilt" both represent an individual accepting guilt for the "sins of the past committed by other persons."  I don't buy into either one of them.  If you're so dedicated to "calling out evil" perhaps you'd like to call out the white supremacists, white nationalists and alt-rightists who are openly celebrating racism on the streets of America.    I make no attempts to "revise" the history of post-Reconstruction Era treatment of blacks during the Jim Crow Era.  I do point out the shift in Party loyalty away from the Democratic Party by southern racists because of the Civil Rights/Voting Rights Acts.  As LBJ said when he signed the legislation "we have lost the South for a generation" (referring, of course, to the support of southern racists).  He was wrong.....those racists are still at home in the GOP and are part of Trump's base.  Gary Crum
No one nominated these goons to represent the mythical white race. These goobers, with their raging inferiority complex, hate educated "white" people just as much as people of color.
White Supremacist terrorist groups are the only thing that Trump has made 'great again'..........
So there were a lot of "fine people" among the neo Nazis and white supremacists? Trump"s sympathies are clear. Now will that get him more support or less? That is the question. Don't be surprised if his support base is even more consolidated after this.   Trump's support may be 30% but its a solid unshakable 30%. The other 70% is a fragmented lot who have no clue why the 30% is so angry. Until they focus on Trump the person and do not understand his support base, the Democrats have no hope. Trump is a distraction to the real problem - a very angry 30-40% of the US population.   Everyone is focused on the clown, unaware of the circus.
Dear Peg. Did you not get the memo?  Human race is going to be caramel colour in future.  All marriages will be mixed race.  There is no option.  Whites are not reproducing very fast in their version of line breeding. So relax and quit rehashing  psychological studies that are still going nowhere.   We are reading complete and utter garbage once again.
The US founding fathers were technically traitors too.  And the whole US was "founded on white supremacy and slavery", by the definition you used there.
I agree : people of good will do need to talk this out. But Tory is an idiot and a coward if he think BLM is going to show any good will towards the gay white men of Toronto.   Like Geise here, he and all other  politicians  at city hall will throw  Toronto's gay men under the jack boot  heels of BLM,  and then they will praise themselves for being tolerant.   We gay men of Toronto are still low priority because clearly NOBODY is coming to our aid.   Ironically, the  gay community and the police are now in this together as allies with common goals and a common enemy.
What a piece of GARBAGE! Obviously written by a left wing nut that resents the knowledge, experience and power that comes with getting older. It seems that she (and many other clueless people) think that 'aging', working your way up and being a useful part of society in your 'golden years' is something to be ashamed of.  Being 'old' and part of society is not a dirty word, it's something to be proud of. Remember lady one day you will be an 'old white woman' how you going to feel then?
There is as much evidence Quebecors are white supremacist as there is evidence Justin Trudeau is a white supremacist. Really disgusting to see the G&M inciting hate against Quebecors again. But that is how Globalist divide and concur. Luckily Canadians have great Nationalist pride and will not fall for these fake stories.
OMG, you equate your privileged white male status with the hatred and oppression of others especially people of colour, women, Muslims, Jews, etc.  That someone would dare question or criticize that unearned status or demand equality for people other than white males does not make you a victim in any way.  The fact is your whining only shows ignorance and lack of regard for others.  Pathetic.
Oh? Since blacks commit 6x the rate of murder of whites, what do you suggest per your program of racially targeting legislation?
that movement only applies when white people kill black people.  not when black people kill black people.  confusing?  yes, very.
"(That was even before Helen Zille claimed that colonialism was not only negative, praising the piped water installed for white South Africans after colonial conquest and the apartheid judiciary.)"  False news...stopped reading at that point...this man is becoming increasingly bitchy.
be truthful, you don't love ben, you love what he stands for - anti rail.  about muslims, whose religion hates women, hates all other religions, will kill anyone who so much denigrate their religion, hates gays, etc.  do you love them?  do you love whites that hate blacks and all minorities?  or hate them?  do you hate native Hawaiians who hate haoles?  you are a hypocrite.
The argument that black folks are at more risk of violence from black folks than white folks is disingenuous on its face. When has the current incarnation of the Republican party cared about the lives of black people, much less doing anything that would improve their lives? The gang bangers are buying their guns from white gun dealers in red states. I have to go back to 1965 to find any national event that Republicans supported black people having full citizenship rights. That would be the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The current Republicans have done their best to gut that legislation. At least Democrats think black people should have the right to vote. That is more than I can say for Republicans.
How diversity wrecked it? In other words, because white people are so righteous? Purely racist statement--or alt-right as it's called now. Maybe you should move on, Dick.
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI!
Your stats are wrong.  Top put it simply , even though there are far fewer blacks , by proportion they commit  way more crimes.  In Furguson , after just robbing a store a half hour earlier , the thug charged a policeman . After he got killed in some form of twisted logic blacks thought they had the God given right to steal and destroy others property . Property owners who had nothing to do with the crime.   You didn't see whites hit the streets stealing and burning after Reginal Denny was pulled out of his truck by blacks . Nor did they riot or protest when O.J. was found innocent . Blacks celebrated someone getting away with murder .   Where are Black Lives Matters leaders this weekend as blacks slaughter more blacks in Chicago ?  Where's the march over that ?  It seems the only time black lives matters is if by bad luck a black is killed by a white policeman.   police were killed in Dallas yet there are no marches that include stealing and burning.
you mean to spread hate speech and white supremacist ideals
Because they have carte blanche from POTUS to be racist and bigoted. My guess is that you are white and not Muslim.
Wouldn't be surprised if he makes Donald's Hall of Fame yearbook.  After all, he does support white supremacists and bigots
For decades, religious conservatives attacked gay people to appeal to the Republican base and score election victories. But gay people can get married, and our country still stands. Now, transgender people are being used as religious conservatives' bogeymen. It's what bathroom bills are about. It's what scare campaigns in various cities in the South were used for to deny transgender people anti-discrimination rights. Trump can't get healthcare insurance reform passed. The Russia investigations are ongoing. Trump can't get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to get the hint to leave. Trump's White House functions like the movie "Animal House". So, Trump attacks Hillary Clinton and transgender people as a way to keep his base happy. A White House staffer gloated to a reporter that the president's ban on transgender people serving in the military would make Democratic congresspeople in midwestern states quake with fear. So, kicking out trans servicemembers is all about politics. Shameful.
You know,  the people I've met who were white supremacists, were among the most ignorant white people I've ever known.  They were clearly their own worst example of what they were trying to say.  It would be laughable if not so sad.
Yeah, those white separatist idiots don't much like me.  Don't care.
Being rich and privileged and crying about oppression is laughable.  The values that anthem espoused and the  men that have died , still die and sacrificed for it are devalued by a bunch of lazy selfish, spoiled athletes who don't even do their research. News media SEARCHES nationwide for stories of white cops killing blacks and in a nation of 320 million  you can find them. It is a rare occurrence however, Cops killed 1100 people nationwide in 2015. 300 were black. Twice as many black people are murdered in chicago every year by other civilians than are killed by cops nationwide.  There is no "epidemic" of cops killing blacks, more whites die every year by cops, and when you look at the FACT that blacks commit crime at much higher rates than any other group  you'd think the instances of cop shootings to be higher. Black males account for 6% of the population and commit 50% of the homicides . Let that sink in.
Pitts has made a nice living for a long time by insulting white Everyday Americans. In his world, if you're white, you're a racist. I suggest Mr. Pitts tries looking in a mirror one time in his search for racism.
WOW! Yes..."After all, lynchings are just a cherished part of white heritage and history." Wow! Where do you get this racist nonsense? That's racism on your part, Charles!
If Obama get credits for all the good things....he get credits for all the bad things. It is not the right of anyone to suppress free speech. And I am not talking about KKK or holocaust deniers but people whose views simply may not be in line with college cowardly neo-fascism that you support by your comments. And really, few blacks get shot, most of them are legal and clear. Then there are few bad apples (out of tens of thousands of good ones)  and all the sudden they are tried of being shot by police while thousands of blacks are being shot by thousands of blacks?? What sort of political creature are you??? All of your statements reflects that you are some sort of misanthrope or at worst, hypocrite. Being a minority myself, I don't blame white people for being people. I am not sure where you get off on your racist rant about white privileges and all that fantasy. Another invention of Obama.
Being an old black man, my first thought as I read the article was this guy must be white. He clearly is weak on African American history. The Obama years have been an improvement over the Bush years for us. For that matter, the last 7 years have been an improvement over the previous 200 years. Our future is bright. Of course, we don't have any white privilege to lose. Like most Jews, black folks are very good at identifying the source of life threatening danger. The ones that don't figure it out don't live long. The police make sure of that. I will never support the GOP as long as they are the preferred party of Klansmen and Nazis. I'm disappointed that the rest of the GOP seems unconcerned about this simple truth. The GOP has set a very low bar for Democrats to look less racist than them. At least the Democrats want us to vote. That is more than I can say for the GOP. The only thing the GOP is offering us are police bullets.
"They did lynching for white folks like you."??? I was right the first time you are indeed a racist and bigot who is completely clueless as to I am and proibility about 100,000 other things.
An African hero! "...20km to sell rat killer, passport covers and toothbrushes" Jesus, I have to admire these people. I would not get out of bed for that!  And it the reason why we need to see sense. We need to unshackle the economy. We place it in shackles with BBBEE and AA thereby restricting it so places are limited. Hey presto, you need BBBEE and AA because the economy is not expanding and therefore competition for jobs is fierce. A zero sum game if ever I saw one. It is not working except for the lucky and connected few. So what do we do? We ramp it up. Be brave. Try something new. Get rid of the restrictive red tape. The economy will expand, investment will arrive and, guess what? More jobs will be created. Blacks will fill most of those positions simply because there are not enough whites to fill them. Money does not care about colour.
After they're done hooting, hollering, crotch-grabbing, and laughing at the frustrated liberals, the final sad irony will fall hardest on the Trump supporters.  People who are educated, have strong job and career prospects, and make decent money will be insulated (at least to some degree) from the problems Trump causes in the economy.   However, the disasters Trump will bring on this country will fall on the white uneducated, middle class with little to no financial cushion much harder than on anyone else. The uneducated white males who elected him are the vulnerable ones, and they will not like what happens next. Little consolation for me, because I don't wish to see anyone get their house foreclosed or lose a job, but helps to put things in perspective.
Underlying much of that subconscious racial bias is the most enduring, corrosive racial stereotype in America: the black-as-criminal mindset. Historian David Levering summarizes it:  “Whites commit crimes but blacks are criminals.” While whites can and do commit a great deal of minor and major crimes, the race as a whole is never tainted by those acts.    But when blacks violate the law, all members of the race are considered suspect. Remember Zimmerman’s false syllogism? A few blacks committed burglary, Trayvon was black, therefore Trayvon was a criminal.  Similar logic is used daily in the assumptions police and citizens make about African Americans, especially young males. Lisa Bloom 2014.
Trump is definitely a worthless stain on America. He's a sick, fascist, white supremacist traitor.
These comments are amusing. If a native shoots a whale liberals love it. If a white guy shoots a moose they think he belongs in jail. That is why most people think liberals are mentally ill.
I won't use the word "white" if there were other non-Indians out there. But nearly all the non-Indians happened to be white people. If there were nothing but black people out there, I would write "black sycophants".  If a black man beat up a little old lady, I would called him a "black thug". If that person happens to be white, then its "white thug".  I don't see how a descriptive word could be considered as a racist. If a male attacked a female...would that be a sexist term?  Indian Lovers is a universal term is it not? Why would it be racist? If I am a Motown lover, would that make me a racist?? If you love haiku, would that make you a racist. I think we are throwing that word "racist" too much in this world.
WOW! If YOU aren't the 'pot calling the kettle black'! You'd better take a very serious look in the mirror. Your comment is nothing but TOTAL reverse DISCRIMINATION, hypocritical & offensive!! Don't stand too close to me (not that I'd let you) when lightening strikes! How do you know anybody here is white?! (yes I do happen to be a white male. So I guess that makes me a racist pig, eh?!) Here's an old saying, 'don't judge a person until you've walked a mile in their shoes. As far as I'M concerned, racism of ANY kind (including reverse-discrimination) is UNACCEPTABLE in today's world. Unfortunately I don't see YOU changing your POOR ATTITUDE anytime soon (I hope I'm wrong). People like yourself need to take a cultural sensitivity course. Don't take Hallowe'en so seriously people! It's supposed to be 1 day a year when kids can have some fun! As long as they aren't acting like criminals & dressing-up like, for example, terrorists then who cares?! Let kids have fun while they are young!
"My grandmother was a typical white person."  They cling to their religion and their guns"  He worshipped for years with racist friend and America hater Jeremiah Wright.  He mocked special Olympics on Letterman.  "The cops acted stupidly"  "ISIS is JV"  [that alone recruited more terrorists for ISIS than Trump's comments]
"Angry white men" Well, this sounds like angry anti-white screed to me. Until we stop with the simplistic thinking of people in terms of categories, fabricated to boost ourselves up and tear other people down, not much progress can be expected.
Trump adopted the phrase 'America First' because it was an old racist Nazi buzzword from years ago. It was a dog-whistle siren call to his white supremacist brethren. Then Bannon spewed out some word salad for Trump to further butcher in an attempt to deny it. They came up with the empty 'isolationism' that Trump immediately denied when he met with Merkel. Trump never had any foreign policy, other than looking to skim money wherever he could. He's got no comprehensive intelligent policy on immigration except to push his xenophobic racist ideas. He's a petty con man, not an actual reasoned or sane human being, he's a fraud. He's imbalanced, unfit for office. Now we have a weak and insecure, belligerent child who imagines himself a fascist saviour. He's no more than an egotistical juvenile buffoon. We need to remove him from the office, get him out of office now. And the courts should have heard the case before reinstating any part of Trump's illegal and immoral ban.
"...pander to Jewish voters..." - Alceste  My, my, look at the racist who usually hides under his thin veneer posing as the resident intellectual poo-bah dispensing truth and wisdom for  us lesser beings. Commentators on the Left not only continuously demonstrate reverse-racism against whites, Jews and older white males in particular - even when they themselves are washed-up old legal beagles - their complete intolerance for any view other than a so-called Progressive one - about as progressive as Communism ever was in its heyday (newsflash - the Dream is over), is sadly ironic. It is also rather comical to watch them bow and scrape to the multi-culti god they have created out of their deep and pervasive ignorance, shame and self doubt regarding our shared Western cultural heritage - the most progressive on the planet when compared to the truly xenophobic Middle Eastern and Asian cultures that either do not allow immigrants or do not grant citizenship.  Wake up Lefty "useful idiots".
I disagree. Do NOT revive people who OD. Let them die. They are the true drain on society resources. Which socio economic group suffers at a junkie's expense? This is self-inflicted drug abuse. Blame everyone. I get that it's a crisis because white people are dying, but they're worthless and don't deserve to be revived.
Notice anything? They're all fat white people..
Along similar lines: Trump is a pathological liar. So what? Trump is criminal.  So what?  Trump is corrupt. So what? Trump hurts the most vulnerable and needy in our society. So what? Trump is a self-absorbed child. So what? Trump has the self-discipline of a grease fire. So what? Trump is an admitted sexual predator. So what? Trump is a White Supremacist and Nazi sympathizer. So what? Trump is a racist and bigot. So what? Trump is a cheat. So what? Trump is a traitor. So what?  Trump has alienated all of our allies. So what?  Trump has insulted our enemies to the point of nuclear war. So what?  Trump is a misogynist. So what?  Trump is a con man and a fraud. So what?  Trump is mentally unstable. So what? Trump has packed his cabinet with white billionaire elitests intent on enriching themselves to the detriment of the American people. So what?  Trump is working on destroying our Democratic Republic.  So what? Trump is using the Presidency to enrich himself and his family. So what?
Saying Sarah Huckabee is a good person is like one zombie calling another one a good person so long as they only eat humans (non-whites) and not other zombies (whites)
""All the time he was a problem,” said Dr. David Lazala, who trained Bello as a family medicine doctor. When Bello was forced out in 2015, he sent Lazala an email blaming him for the dismissal."  If Dr. David Lazala is of Mexican decent then we can safely assume Dr Bello, a black Nigerian, was a target of Mexican hate crime against blacks so Bello got even. Tons of public crime data supports  the countless hatred, discrimination, violence and homicide rates against blacks by Mexicans. I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if Bello was falsely ousted with unproven allegations to make him go ape $hit crazy and kill others and eventually himself.
The officer that shot the man was black.... what do you mean "white people"?
May argument isn't moot so long as there are voices in America like "lespark"'s and "Pocho"'s above.  As to Trump and his psyche at least, not in my view.  The Diplomats, I think, are intelligent, knowledgeable and able.  T The President is unstable, and seems to blow with the direction of the latest hot air he hears.   Further, I expect that there were similarly intelligent, knowedgeable and able Presidential advsors iimploring him to make an immediate and contemporaneous White Supremacist naming comment.  He did what he did, in the manner he did.  We all saw that.  Unless his staff is White Suprmacist - which is a considerable fear.  Projected onto international dispute/conciliation behavior, it does not bode well.  DESPITE the involvement of cooler headed and intelligent diplomats.  Donald Trump is definitely his own man.  That "man" likes to threaten Armadas and Fire and Fury upon another nation.    Certainly NK is a problem that must be addressed.   BUT, carefully and artfully.
Sorry, Trump has brought racism and bigotry to the forefront by railing against Muslims, including insulting a Gold Star family; his claiming the judge's bias because he's a Mexican in the Trump U fraud case. He has a pattern of incidents of discriminating against African Americans since the 70s on, and his birther claim against Obama.   In his campaign, Trump  after African Americans, immigrants, Latinos, Asians, women, Muslims and even mocked a disabled reporter. And it's interesting how the KKK and other white supremacist groups have been emboldened under the Trump administration.
Ok, a lady who lost to pretty much a neophyte in Obama, was one of the worst SOS's ever who managed to have all of the money in the world on her side and a sitting President who was pretty popular just handing her the Baton...and she lost to TRUMP, all while blaming white women, Russians, Comey, the DNC, Bernie, WikiLeaks and sexism etc. You don't find that inept? She lost to a person no one else would have. So, yeah, that's pretty damn inept in my opinion.  This story is a lot more than what Trump is tweeting about, that's for sure.  I hope both parties go down in flames, I'm tired of them and their stupid games and their lies, and they can take their mouth breathing supporters with them.
Show me any Rep. Politician in a public venue using Race as part of their qualifications for their elected seat other than a Democrat(s)? Isn't this Racism in itself? People using their Racial make-up as a means to say they understand your Racial plight in itself is playing the Race Card for votes that's creating Racial divide in the US in itself.  Any White man running for public office let alone talking with someone like that be PUMMELED, called a White Racist Bigot!  This racist remarks can only be played by a minority race in ANY Party. A Black person standing up for a White man, be called not Black Enough or Unko Thomas! Insane  I accept groups for what they are, Racists is Racists no matter how big of thing they make or not. Using one's racial background in a good way to attract votes is Racism in my Book! they may not be using their race in a bad way but it's still Playing the Race Card! Democrats m.o.  Playing the Race Card has NO place In America!  Mahalo Barry! and Friends!
Steve Bannon, the Baron. https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mWq15lDh8yM/maxresdefault.jpg Why are all these Far Right Religious Right-Wing Republicans always so ugly? How can there be civil discussion about total incivility? Trump is a pathological lying psychotic megalomaniac and over 40% of white Americans still strongly support him. Trump is just a symptom of a large part of the "civil" American voting public.
Take all of them, of the left, of the right, white power and Black lives matter goons and put them all in the same compound and let them marinate.
If you think "white nationalists" got Trump elected, then you're whipping up quite a theory about the Rust Belt and Obama voters that turned against the Democrats. Let's hear more about it!
I don't understand this comment. White supremacists, white nationalists, Nazis and the kkk are killing people in the street, and you make THIS comment? Unbelievable...talk about obtuse.
2/ Now we know around 52% of Catholic Christians voted for...Tiberius (without the brains).  Since the election we've been offered plenty of pious talk on unity and dialoguing and healing that seems utterly divorced from reality. Sorry, I don't play with white supremacist thugs and misogynists. From my perspective, the US Catholic bishops were willing to sacrifice the well-being of millions and millions of people worldwide over their stifling obsessions with abortion and same-sex marriage. This is how the majestic Catholic Church has come to be defined in the US: a hostile, morbid cult that values fetuses above all other forms of human life.  So I'm done.
There should be a white only husband "ban"
There it is... can't prove a damn thing and is simply being a racist pos. What the F does it matter who does what crime. I'll call APD and report anyone anytime so all of you better not speed like an A hole, Tailgate, run with busted light and like and ass drive through my hood looking out of place or give me the slightest inclination you are up to no good cuz I'm a human lie detector and White Black Mexican Asian Polynesian I could care less!! All you law breaking POS are gonna go down sooner or later in my town and even if APD does nothing with my calls as I give them your plates or description, next time you have a run in with them I doubt they'll be letting you off the hook. Simply being an Ahole on the roads has me calling you in cuz you'll likely risk my life or someone else's with your disregard for public safety let alone your children buckled in the back seat. This is a warning I'm looking for all you.
Angry white guys on the right are nefarious. Angry "people of colour" on the left are darlings no matter what they do. Double standard. Thanks G&M.
"There's definitely some people out there with ugly opinions." Well that is certainly true - look at all the on-line comments that talk about "old white men".
Trump has never done anything for anyone that didn't benefit him. When did you decide that Putin is a better leader than Obama? Maybe it just as simple as Putin is white and Obama is not. I'm sure that is enough to win over the GOP base. They love being white more than being human.
Is that why the KKK, white supremacists and Nazis are all in little hands corner?  I guess it's because little hands has the best bigots, racists in all the land!
"Hillary got a huge percentage of the black non college educated male vote."  Of course.  Why would a black male vote for a white racist?
Quote: "Michelle Obama is taking some heat for recent remarks she made on gender, but I'm struggling to muster outrage given the sheer incoherence of what she actually said."  True, I've rarely found what Michelle says coherent, but I suspect that what she's saying is primarily directed at black communities. She could have gone much further and bluntly stated that blacks coddle far too much the criminality and paternal irresponsibility in black males. (I won't call them men.) That's glaringly obvious and different from mostly white schools where ordinary boyishness is attacked as "toxic masculinity."
This guy's been watching too much Western reality TV "documentaries" or else he's just regurgitating the current "white guys are unprecedented evil" theme.  I'd say Islamic headcutters in the Middle East and Islamic child and woman kidnappers in Africa (to name just the first two that come readily to mind) make these guys look like college kids.
Hey Fareed, while I am somewhat heartened by you FINALLY admitting that you so called "educated" elites missed the obvious, I am irritated that in YOUR explanation you assume all Trump voters are/were UN-educated white-trash Idiots. I am a college  educated white woman who has worked and travelled. I have friends of all colors and backgrounds, and I am NOT an ideologue.  The reason I voted for Mr. Trump is because I am tired of you and your elite buddies lying to get elected,  and then REFUSING to listen to our concerns while you vote yourselves into prosperity!
Forgive Pierre, I believe he is a great Constitutional expert, BUT, he clearly has a prejudice against whites - but especially Afrikaners, you just have to read his opinion on the right of Afrikaners to education at tertiary institutions in their language of choice, you would assume that only white Afrikaners are Afrikaans speaking and white English speakers didn't benefit from Apartheid to believe that nonsense.
You're obviously talking about poor whites, but that's OK. What would you talk about if the people were black? Referring to people living in "trailers" -mobile homes as, implicitly, ignorant or plain dumb, is racist. So is the word redneck. The LA Times has banned  that word from its comments. You yourself are a snob,  probably without any right to be.
People forget that Muhammad Ali stated on numerous occasions that, "All white men are devils." Check YouTube videos.  Unfortunately Malcolm X got his hooks into Ali the same way that Rev "GD America" White got into President Obama for 20 years. And all this means nothing?
"Obviously", anyone who criticizes a hateful, entitled, bigoted non-white racist must be both white and fragile.  Khan is the worst possible advocate for social justice, and the pathetic attempts to justify, explain, rationalize and excuse her intolerance do immense harm to the cause she says she represents.  A racist is a racist; there is no place in social justice for one.
How's it feel knowing that a white supremacist will be working one door sown from the Oval Office, Paul?  Feeling the pride?
What a total POS she is. Hollyweirdo for sure. Ya lets praise a guy who supports cop killers and thinks the american flag and veterans and heros are a worthless if they are white
#1 KKK whitey racists on the SA = Jojeja2 & oxtail01
This country has a history of killing black people for all sorts of reasons. Profit was a common motive. We have never been treated as equals to white folks. You have no idea of how much rape, robbery, and murder has been done to give you your white privilege. You don't have to know about the violence to receive the benefits.
1) So race relations have not budged since the mid-80's? Maybe update your "teaching": materials, more than 30 years have gone by and a lot of change has taken place. This invisible backpack thing is badly out dated.  2) If a teacher can shut up a white male with an insinuation straight out of Kafka's The Trial, then...what power/privilege exactly does this white male have? What systemic/institutional power is the white male using here? He is silenced, and powerless to even state an opinion. Where is all this power he has? Power is contextual, no one has all power all the time.   3) The black population of Canada is less than 3%.  White population is 80%.  Maybe, just maybe, white people have so much representation because they are the overwhelming majority. This is just a fact. There's no malice, no grand conspiracy....unless you are so racist as to think that white people are having and raising children simply to spite and hurt minorities.
Mr. Hecker, you ask what this country is coming to but maybe the question is "what is the country going back to?"  Remember those black and white photographs of the racist southerners, their faces pinched in expressions of hatred aimed at African American children attending schools in the segregated south? This is what America is embracing--ignorant white trash culture. Mmmwah! Americans are embracing vulgarity and brutality like an old friend.
Is snowflakes slang for white people?
The original rainbow flag is a reference to "Over the Rainbow" the song in the Wizard of Oz. It is a reference to being in a better place. Phillie's racialized flag in just a pile of dirt on that dream because it is done in malice against the white gay people who created it in the first place.
Anyone who thinks Sessions is fit for any office is holds the same values as he does. He's a long-time racist, white supremacist and bigot. If you support him, you support white supremacy.
Rich,    Yes, human nature tends to be prejudiced.   But the more primitive and simple societies seem to have no problem with prejudice.   As for Cuba, I don't praise them because they're socialists. I've seen documentaries and news stories through the years that indicate the whites, blacks and browns get along. Maybe because they are all equally poor. Maybe it's communist propaganda. But I believe corporate capitalism thrives on racism and discrimination, socialism and social democracy don't.
You might be right Neko, but I think it was the fact I dared compare innocent Sandy Hook elementary school children gunned down by assault weapons with innocent children in the womb.  The compartmentalization I speak of is predicated on who does the killing.  White men with assault weapons are somehow different from any other class of human engaged in taking life.  White men with assault weapons are mentally ill, every other human class are murderers.    I think the one thing that really threw me about this incident is my first thought when I read about it at 1:30am out of a dead sleep when my phone when off.  "Please God don't tell me the shooter was Muslim or Black." When I realized this I was like 'how is sick is that thinking?'  And then I realized, it wasn't really all that sick.  It was the sign of the times.  I have subsequently found out I was hardly alone with that first initial thought....and that is representative of the sick state of affairs in this country.
So what should be done, round up every gun-toting white guy and execute them?
God bless the patriots, they are the only counterweight to these parasite globalists that want to ethnically cleanse white people. They want to flood the country to the point the white race is gone, they claim to be for equality but that is just a cover for their anti white hate.
The Media, the WP in particular, labels any Caucasian whose loyalties lay w/our Republic as the Founders envisioned/established, as being 'White Nationalists.  They use that term as a pejorative being synonymous with anti-Semitic, racist, White Supremacist Neo-Nazi's .
Maybe the N Korean could bomb those poor white parts of ohio and Florida that put this idiot in charge.
Yes the antifas are a bunch of juvenile half-wits running around smashing windows.  But there are a lot of them, and they are creating a lot of destructive violence.  The fringe right is a much much smaller group of idiots spouting garbage and who get zero support from 99.5% of Trump supporters. For the most part they are harmless and ignored.  To suggest every one potesting the removal of the statues is explicitly supporting white nationalist 100% is completely irresponsible of the Globe & Mail.  The small right fringe is generally less violent than the much larger fringe left, and yes the right fringe are reprehensible and should be squashed.  But what angers the right is when MSM tries to pretend that Trump and every one of his supporters supports the extreme.  Just because someone is anti Trump I don't assume he is an ISIS supporter who believes in wiping the world of all non Muslims.
The reality is that nazis, neo-nazis, white supremacists are nothing but scum.  The confederate traitors lost, get over it.
The only white guy that I despise is the Chump. He is sick, vile and disgusting. He is dividing our country. My comments are merely pointing out the fact that a white male opened fire on an audience at a country western music concert. In all of the news reports that I have watched. I haven't seen a Black,Muslim, or Asian. Only Whites and Latinos. Thos why do you think the gunman chose that specific event to accomplish his unimaginable massacre.
Pride began fragmenting when the Dyke March allowed the females to have an event that specifically discriminated against  gay men.  It was further weakened by the removal of "Gay" from the name,  to be a generic  "Pride"   which simple worked to eliminate gay men from the identity of it.  TI was further damaged when the gay men of Toronto,were accused of being nothing better than racist KKK  hate monger  by BLM and NOBODY... NOT TORY>NOT THE MEDIA>  NOT KATHLEEN WYNNE > NOT KIRSTEN WONG TAM > NOT JUSTIN TRUDEAU came to our defense.  They all tacitly agreed that the white gay boys of Church St , who  started Gay Pride in 1981,  really  are a despicable bunch of curs because nobody dared refuted   BLM's accusations. .    Again and always the gays get thrown under the bus,  This is a boot stomp to the face of Toronto's gay population.
You are just as sick as he is.  White extremists don't like pochos.  Wake up or go live on the mainland.  We don't need your kind in our Hawaii.
Obama humiliates Trump by his mere existence. Eloquence and wisdom coming from a Black man...no wonder why Trump and his White Supremacists hate him.
This opinion piece is disgusting, out of touch and clueless. Why are these questions being asked of Mr. Singh? Would we ask Andrew Scheer to denounce Mark Lepine, the white male terrorist responsible for the Ecole Polytechnique massacre? No of course not, that's absurd. However the white centric media's push to associate Mr. Singh with terrorist activities is telling and concerning. I'm not surprised. I'v noticed some older white Canadians are losing thier shit because we have a Sikh leading one of the three major political parties. Get used to it. I can't expect a very white, very male media to have some sence about how to cover Mr. Singh. It's going to be racist and stupid. However, decent Canadians, non racist Canadians, Canadians of colour will speak up and resist.  Jagmeet Singh is the new, very handsome face of Canada people. Get used to it. And I'm not going to respond to clueless racist commments about how the brown people are taking over. I said what I said.
Hugh: Ali would have looked down on you, and not respected you, unless you yourself are black, heterosexual, married to a black woman, and a Muslim.   If you don't fall into that category, then you would have been a devil in his eyes.  When asked by a BBC reporter about his beliefs that black people should not associate with whites, he said this:  "There are white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?"  That is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.  The fact that his analogy for white people was that they are rattlesnakes says a lot.  What if a white person said that of blacks??
Most of the old white wise men in the GOP have had damaged brains for years.
Coming back after a year of volunteer work in Africa only to hear " they are too ignorant and should die of AIDS" was the sadest moment in my life as a Canadian. It is the moment I knew there are as many ignorant assholes in Canada as the US. Canada is the epicentre of white privilege.... just too arrogant to acknowledge their colonialist attitudes with systemic racist undertones. We just tell ourselves we are the nice ones. I am sorry you and your wife had issues, it happened to me as well.
Don't worry. Nobody forgot about white folks.
those wealth hungry whites can stoop very low to keep their path clear. Wont be surprised to know they had a hand in this. Guptas are just a distraction.
I agree Mike.....and I encourage everyone to go to the SPLC  website and explore it thoroughly....there is extensive info on sites that deal with alt white, with white supremacist, with neo Nazi, with Klan et al...all the hate groups in the nation ...think it's well over 800 of them..and the Hate Map identifies the locations...and types of sites...there are sites of extreme religious right .......Catholic sites as well and literally loads of info...  Of particular interest are the sites that deal with gays....as there has been much conservative religious hostility directed to them....and lists of Hate Groups ...with Catholic leadership or involvement...  Also ...please contact Civil Comments and ask that they immediately implement a blocking function as this thread has been taken over by trolls and the data is too important to be treated with literally hundreds of distractive troll comments.
Let's be clear.  Trump won by engaging in racial hatred and xenophobia. His campaign wasn't about "jobs;" it was about white identity politics and telling people that their lives would be better if we just got rid of the Mexicans and Muslims.  I haven't heard Trump laser-focused on "jobs;" he has spending all his time and energy focused on things like keep five-year-old Iranian boys and Iraqi grandmas out of the country.  And the jobs aren't coming back for a whole host of reasons, especially automation.   Trump is lying about this but hey at least he made sure that those Muslims can't come into the country.  (And the Muslim ban is despicable and any Trumpkin who voted for that has to explain to me why it isn't outright bigotry.)
You only fought for our Constitution, not some Fascist definition of forced, sappy Patriotism.  Salute, cry, sob, brag....whatever.  It's your choice.  It is also just as Patriotic to say NO to the white racists who oppress, demean, demonize and attack American Black Citizens.
What don't you agree with BLM?  The reason why they are protesting or the manner in which they are?   I've seen horrific videos of black men being shot by police officers and the black man in the video was acting COMPLETELY nice, polite, and was NOT a threat to the cop at any level, yet he gets shot in front of his girlfriend, who's also behaving completely appropriate and she watched her boyfriend die right next to her and all they did was have a broken tail light.   The police officer was completely wrong.  How would you feel if that happened to you?   Yes, there are a couple of bad apples that screw it up for the rest, but they are upset about being racially profiled, and there's been a rash of killings of blacks by cops and that's just not right.  Yes, I've seen cops behave inappropriately toward whites too.  I don't know what the problem is, but there are a lot of cops, not all of them, but a lot that have been just not behaving properly and groups like BLM is the result.
No one is going to defend these guys. They're garbage, and will rightfully rot in prison.   You'll notice when cops shoot a white guy, thousands of white people don't march in his defense?
Its pretty simple from my point of view, Penny was fired for her comments that were NOT declared HATE speech, thus these journalists who were found guilty not only of racism but in fact of HATE SPEECH, should immediately be fired and the HRC should charge them, failure by M&G and HRC to take this action is futher proof that they are both in fact racist organisations using their power to spread anti-white hatred.
Trump voters and supporters lost the right to comment on the word “decency” when they decided that a self-absorbed, selfish, egocentric, mentally unstable, White Supremacist, narcissistic, pathological liar, con man, thief, cheat, sexual predator, pedophile and traitor represents them and their “values,” with Trump being their idea of a role model.  As to your question, it went when you voted to befoul the country and the White House with the king of sleaze.
A true patriot emerges from the shadows of national intelligence to confirm the worst of the installing of a group of Republican, White Supremacist, Nazi traitors into the National Security/Intelligence apparatus.  All dedicated to serving Der Fuehrer in his quest to become the all-powerful dictator elevated to Emperor as his German heritage demands a re-creation of the Holy Roman Empire in North Amerika.  All the product of 1/2 a century of conspiracy by the Republican traitors led by the Oil Monopoly Monsters to end the U.S. Constitutional Republic forever.  The citizens no longer have an excuse to deny this monstrous evil spreading across the nation.  Will they resist or concede?  That is the question.
You should have looked in those statistics further.  Whites represent 80% of violent and sexual crimes against children--they are convicted of such crimes three times more often than blacks and five times more than Latinos.  And mass shootings?  Ye gods and little fishes--about 90%.
Sorry Ed, the whitelash vote against Hillary Clinton is most definitely racist, misogynist and fascist.  You and other tRumpfkins just have to live with the fact that you have handed over the American government to the political equivalent of the KKK.    Vladimir Putin is doing back-flips into the frozen Volga River just to celebrate:  American white people are about to inaugurate 'Putin's Pet' as president.  Congratulations!  Let us know how it all works out for you ...
Another deranged post from "I'm not white", POCHOloveswhiteracists.
Missing from the raw statistics are the denial, deceit and delusion surrounding who shoots whom...and why.  Pretending that suicides and homicides are symptoms of comorbidity in an otherwise disparate geographical area is lumping explicit discernible factors into one single cause - gunfire.  Suicides have virtually nothing to do with homicides.  There are as many reasons for suicide as those commit suicide.  Homicides, on the other hand, are clearly divisible between the three major categories (crime, random violence, & personal conflicts) as well as the occasional murder-suicides.  Blacks make up the majority of homicide deaths and have the highest rate of homicide of any racial or ethnic group.  Young black males are predators at a rate wildly out of proportion to their percentage of the population.  Whether the victims are black, white, hispanic or asian - the trigger is most likely pulled by a black male.
In 2012, white males were 38 percent of the population and committed 4,582 murders. That same year, black males were just 6.6 percent of the population but committed a staggering 5,531 murders.  In other words: black people–at just a fifth of the size–committed almost 1,000 more murders than their white counterparts.
George W. Bush Took a Shot At Trump: Called Trump a Bigot  George was not wrong.  Bush also said, "Bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed,”  Bush and Tillerson both have told America the truth.
Not to worry, white supremacists. Those "beautiful" statues commemorating the white supremacist Confederate regime can be replace by "beautiful" statues of Dylann Roof, Byron De La Beckwith, James Earl Ray and John Wilkes Booth posing regally, heroically, majestically. Y'know. 'Cuz history. /s    Seriously, Trump ought to have a talk with Nikki Haley, former governor of SC and current Ambassador to the United Nations in the Trump Administration whose state took down the flag celebrating the traitorous, white supremacist Confederacy in the wake of the Mother Emmanuel white supremacist terrorist attack.
generally you are correct.  but as I see it, trump's candidacy is due to the Obama's presidency.  many white folks were startled that a black man could be president of the us.  now, these folks were trying to take back America and make it white America again.  many of trumpy's policies are based on racism, anti minorities and gay, isolationism, etc.  Obama during this administration appointed many minorities and blacks to high level positions in government and the military and the whites felt discriminated by this.  they feel that America has become brown and want to make it white again.  I am referring to the white suprememists, there are also many whites who truly believe in race equality, but there are many, many whites who believe that they are supreme.
Der Fuehrer speaks! All thrust your "right" arms forward, fingers extended to hail the new Hitler of the 4th Reich! Time to cleanse the world of these defective beasts unworthy of existence! Next step, all disabled of any kind staining the pure Aryan genes of the Supreme White Race! Obey or Die! Sieg Heill!
Hmm. Arab, crazy white guy, black dude with a chip on his shoulder? Tough call, but I'm going with Abdullah and Allahu akbar. I've got $500 on it at -140.  But to better my odds I've got a whack black as a 2nd choice $300 at +105. The white guy odds are +375 but it was a country music festival so...staying away.
All of the sarcastic remarks about radical Christian extremism are offered in an attempt to get people to think about the fallacy of attributing all violence by committed by Muslims or people loosely connect with Islam to Islamic terrorism.  Christians are responsible for the holocaust and Christians dropped the atom bomb and Christians have exploited people all over the world  using some the most brutal means to to accomplish their goals that the world has ever seen.  Here in Alaska Christians decimated Native populations thru disease and brutality and raped countless children all the while  forcing the Christian god on them.  Christians bombed the federal building in OK.  I am offering this up because if you want to make a case against Christians there is plenty of fodder.  I happen to believe it is a lot more complex than the things I have outlined above.  But never forget there is a strong case to be made against the white devils.  Think about it.
King Zwelithini's Ingonyama Trust alone owns over 60% of ALL land in KZN. Over 2.8 million hectares. Not only that, but they pay zero taxes. I don't know how many people live on that land.  The point is that those who claim that whites own something like 80% of all land are clearly ignorant. And why do they always want to expropriate the land of white farmers when so much land is in the hands of kings and chiefs?  If black people do not have land, then why not give them title deeds to all this land? And what about all the land in State hands?  Then there is the small issue of something in the region of 90% of all expropriated land lying useless. And those who had been rewarded with this land not having the farming skills, selling off implements or the community rather wanting the money. Many of the cases at the land courts are backlogged because they fight about rather having the money.  This doesn't look like people want land. It looks like they want money. All hate-whites politics.
But but but He HAS to be a terrorist! He’s brown and he’s a Muslim!  Whereas that lone wolf crazy white guy that shot 58 people  He’s NOT A TERRORIST
You forgot the way that White Supremacists went nuts when President Blackenstein was elected? Forgotten the way that people like you said that he was a Muslim  that was comin to git yer guns and bring in Sharia law? Or the way that the Republicans held a meeting before Obama was inaugurated to plan how to obstruct him? There was no major backlash against Reagan...Trump is the least popular incoming  President in modern history;
A soldier boasting about his battles is a common and tolerated thing. Sajjan risked his life many times for you. There are too many low white racists in Canada. This is a brave soldier who gave a somewhat exaggerated account of his role in one battle. Big deal. Ordinarily, it would be shrugged off with a wink and an amused grin. But the man is brown and so all the white skunks have leapt on him.
Yep That’s ok There is no “horrible history of white subjugation” through racism, slavery or colonialism. So yes, that’s fine. It doesn’t go both ways, just like there is no “reverse racism”  You can see by the posts here that many, many white people are committed to their racism, see their inability to express their racism as trampling on their god given (socially ordained) right to be racist and reject any invitation to be more sensitive to non-white people. They can’t and won’t.  So now schools have to act like responsible parents and teach the children (and their parents) the difference between right and wrong.
That is not what I am saying and it is that kind of nonsense you just posted that turns people against your issue. Had the protesters, protested in a different venue they most likely would have received more support.  I noticed in those reports that the majority of murders were also done by members of the AA community and it is has been shown the majority of murders in Chicago for example is black on black shooting. But that's right I am not allowed to get involved in that discussion because I am white and I don't understand.
Although Trump was correct that everyone who participated in the violence is at fault, his lack of calling out the racists was telling.  Sadly ironic that the white supremacists wore MAGA hats and the idiot who drove that Challenger into the crowd was a nazi sympathizer.  Yep....these are the morons who helped elect Trump.
Like I have said, I would have no problems with the BLM if they were not so racist about it.   ALL lives matter.  I do not support the violence or the racism from either side.   By the way, was not the choice of speakers, racist?   What would you have said if it had been all white speakers?
Cracker is a disrespectful word  used by Blacks for Whites. It is the same as using the N word for Blacks.
Dave, we have to be careful about equivalents. Start with the fact that the white supremacists and Nazis want to purge America of Jews, blacks, minorities and immigrants. That in and of itself is the antithesis of what America is. They are hateful, racist and anti-semitic. Black Lives Matter wants to call attention to (in addition to many other things) the systemic aspects of our justice system that result in the deaths and incarceration of black people at a much higher rate than other populations. They not only do not advocate violence, they advocate justice, peace and love in engagements with others. Now, the reality with both groups may be that there are people who claim affiliation who act with violence (or others claim that the violent are affiliated with the organization.) But that does not make the groups equivalent. They are not. And to believe they are is to admit to some sympathy with the white supremacists. There is no other possible conclusion.
Trump's "rebukes" might be more believable if he walk them back a day a day later and if he didn't keep regurgitating the KKK's message and if he didn't keep retweeting actual white nationalists.
Isn't more like this?  Muslim guy kills, tougher immigration laws are the answer.  White guy kills, tax reform is the answer.
Try being gay, white, and a conservative male.  You get bashed because you are while and male.  You get bashed because you are gay and conservative.  Some people just think in terms of identity politics and don't realize that people are people.
I guess the centuries of female transgressions do not exist... for Denise, its ... what are you talking about?   straight white men are the evil ones....  women are without fault in this. When progressives operate, its whatever convenient lies will work. Take the Muslim student council female who made hateful remarks about white people. Now the progressive professors and students are claiming that when Dalhousie intends to hold her accountable that free speech is threatened. What a laugh... if a white person had said those same things about blacks, asians, muslims, native indians, GLBTQ people.... there would be a human rights trial and firing, dismissal, shaming and new stricter rules and laws. LYING HYPOCRITES... all of the progressives. Hateful and racist themselves.
We men? Ive raped nobody. Blaming an entire gender for a few bad apples, how does that help anything? People who will rape will rape. The average guy won't. Stop with your stupid generalizations.  Because I was born a white male I'M apparently a priveledged rapist? Stop drinking the kool-aid, you being brainwashed.
They call it "ObamaCare" instead of the "ACA" to remind everyone it was Obama's signature bill. They tell lies about it because they cannot stand that an African-American man could possibly have achieved what Bill Clinton and the Bushes could not, to craft a workable health care bill which was so promised before. In the end, Trump and his followers agenda is to undo all the great things President Obama did, quite simple because he was not White. When I see all the hatred in the GOP / Tea Party ranks, pure and simple racism is behind most of it. How sad!
Yeah.  Terrible few days for the Democrats (again).    First there was the Inauguration of a narcissist, racist, misogynist.  Then the eventual, but quick reveals (on almost a daily basis) that he's also unable to do the "deals" he promised, not only a racist but a White Supremacist (the worst kind of racist), ripping off the Federal Government allowing his subordinates to do so, an idiot who doesn't understand what he's talking about, an international provocateur who appears to WANT nuclear war, etc., etc., etc.  THEN, this.  One of the guys who was supposed to give us confidence that the bundle of severe deficiencies and disorders occupying the seat of President would be balanced by someone of cooler temperament, intelligence and unquestionable character.  The horror.  Kelly is either a liar or incompetent.    Now, I'm really scared.    And, I wonder what the military has done in the past that Kelly has either lied about or covered up. . . .
Shooting someone running away and unarmed is a clue. Trump relies on the soft bigotry of whites who do not believe that they have any racist attitudes, that if only black people would quit talking about race these issues would go away. That is simply not the case, as any black job applicant or potential renter or homebuyer will tell you. Racism runs deep and ignoring that is racist.
"I have seen the political cartoons decades later of the Irish portrayed as apes (very similar to those of Negroes at a different time)" That time would be now. The Obamas have been portrayed as apes for the last 8 years. The KKK is a Christian organization. Islam doesn't have a monopoly on rape, robbery, torture, or murder. Christians thought race based slavery was God's will. Today many still believe being white means being superior. They just elected Trump. They have not been shy about this.
These antifascists are more unpleasant than white nationalists.
Billions are going to wasted while the wall can be breached with a can opener and or a shovel.. Our Idiot In Chief working hard to waste our hard earned money so he can strive to have a " White America "  that only the Third Reich would admire .
It's not based on their opinions..any more than a "criminal" is viewed on his or her opinions.  It's based on their ACTIONS, or inactions.  Does the opinion of an all white utopian society, elimination of "human weeds" such as "Negroes and Jews", elimination or sterilization of those in mental institutions and prisons sound like someone with a mental illness?  Because those are "opinions" of the early 20th century "progressives" who not only "opined", but acted on those...and even Hitler borrowed some of their ideas.  The loons who "opined" on the evils of drink got the 18th Amendment passed, and the federal government finally resorted to putting wood alcohol in the grain alcohol, because everything else they put in to stop people drinking was distilled out.  As a result, the US Government murdered around 10,000 people.  Opinions are fine, and widely held...everyone has one.  Evil opinions put into action however, IS a mental illness.
White working-class Sanders voters became white working-class Trump voters. They preferred a fascist over a woman--they are reactionaries (and likely racists) and belong with Trump and the Republican party. Friends of fascists are fascists. If you vote for a racist, whether or not you espouse racism personally--you're still a racist. You cannot vote for Trump and not qualify as a racist.  Sanders cross-over voters are deplorables just like the rest.  They voted for the Rapopotus and endorsed his virulent racism by voting for him.
I understand that you are one of them categorically. So, if your category  (most of your under educated white man Trump supporters) is going to understand my post, I would probably be doing what I said above, until then I will just have to go along with you idiots, I can't afford to go off grid and shop at co-op markets and buy an elecrtic car. But I do refuse to stick my head so far up my @zz until all I see is $&!t.
Another hit piece from the resident Jew defending a self-proclaimed "victim" of revelations of abberrant human behavior of a religious fanatic feeding at the government trough while dedicated to the destruction of the same.  Dredging up the Clinton's as the latest sinners unworthy of association with the pure, white, holy, christian Trumps, Pences, and all the rest of the immoral, evil Republicans refusing to eat with women, but more than willing to assault their crotches.  Goldberg is pure evil in concert with the current nazi, Bannon, infesting the governing system and despoiling the national discourse with vile invective from a modern Judas wallowing in wealth within a traitorous, misnamed "think tank" devoted to the overthrow of all freedom and democracy wherever it may be found.
Also rednecks, cowboys, and white collar criminals. Don't forget those guys.
In general the usual result of a revolutionary change in government is to replace one repressive regime with another often worse one.  Stupid white elitism is now replaced by stupid black elitism.  The civilised world needs its elites. To date no one has found a really satisfactory way of ensuring that they are not stupid.
Not all Republicans are white racists. However, the rest of the folks in the GOP are collaborators with the racists. They may be victims, but minorities are not the folks victimizing them. That would be the GOP elites that are laughing at them on their way to their off shore banks. I always thought it was insane to believe poor people are getting away with the money. Like Willie Sutton said when asked why he robs banks, that is where the money is. The GOP base of angry and resentful white people are too racists to follow the money. I would pity them if they didn't think killing minorities would solve their problems. Sadly, the Dems are too feckless to take advantage of the Republican racist dysfunction. They want to win back those Archie Bunker Democrats instead of turning out that rest of the American voters, like Obama did. They should let the GOP keep the racists and their collaborators. Obama proved the Dems don't need them to win elections.
Your comments prove my comments. This is why BLM should not exist, you all get all riled up when any black guys gets killed but when it's another race white, red, yellow they don't give a damn. That's not what equality and liberty is about. That's not what MLK was marchin for. BLM is a fancy way of saying that black people will loose their minds if cops kill any blacks! But they can kill other races and they won't bat an eye for the loss. That's why BLM is a joke. Even if one time they would show support for a white death and protest the same way they do for would be criminals it would bring a little validity to their cause. But as of now they are just the other side of the KKK coin.
White male racists did it
' 'Hail Trump!': White Nationalists Salute the President Elect .  Video of an neo nazi conference in Washington, D.C., where Trump’s victory was met with cheers and Nazi salutes.  . Watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o6-bi3jlxk
Actually you are the farce.  You post endlessly about some grand conspiracy by Asians to rob white Canadians of their homes. You’re a disgrace.    The tax obviously works. The number of foreign buyers has dropped off a cliff and leveled out. The govt certainly did not intend to crush the market, only to cool it.   Decent job I’d say and the market and the giant industry it supports keeps churning while bitter bigots like you keep crying.
No.  What happened in Montana was rural voters went angry white, and most of them can't name our senators and previous representative.  Low information, don't care about the issues voters.  However, having said that, they will once again vote in a Democratic governor in 2020 to protect themselves from their national effects stupidity.  Gianforte will be an 18 month wonder if the dems get their act together.
Haven't heard from the IRA in a good 30 years,  but boy we better watch out for those Basque terrorists lol! I'm not sure your point. In case you don't realize Islam is not a race so yes there are lots of white terrorists among the Muslims too. Maybe that's the answer right there. The left is so afraid of being called racist they can't see radical Islam for what it is because they think Islam is a race
If he had hit him and killed him, there would be rioting in the streets of Anchorage, because White Lives Matter!
I'm tired of all these wanna be gangstas........oops he's white, guess we cant send him back to Insert Brown Country name here.
I guess being a white supremacist isn't as American as apple pie.
Please, your response is simply stupid. The KKK has always been right-wing. When the Democratic party of the late 19th and early 20th centuries was most racist it was a right-wing party. The early Republican party was left-wing--the anti-slavery party of Lincoln. Pro-slavery was establishment and therefore, right-wing. Anti-slavery was anti-establishment and therefore, if a political tendency must be chosen it would be more left-wing. The U.S. Nazi party was right-wing. George Lincoln Rockwell's ANP was founded in 1960 on the ideas Adolf Hitler espoused. FDR disdained Nazism while Henry Ford who rain for the GOP nomination in 1924 and was a Nazi-sympathizer like Charles Lindbergh.  The reality is that poor people--and Blacks are over represented in this category due to racism--are both the most victimized as well as the biggest perpetrators of crime. White collar crime costs $300-$600 billion per year. Wealthy white people commit the majority of those costly crimes.
Any word from tRump about white extremist terrorists in this country? No. Because they are inspired by him.
I agree my questions are indeed baited and a trap for people like you.  Let's take them one subject at a time.   You said you agree with affirmative action.   This is a program that lifts one race above another.   If it favored the white man over others, you would be screaming your head off.   That it favors others over the white man, does not make it any less racist.   If you therefore support this and similar programs, you must be racist.     The religious argument is similar in that you are favoring one religion over another.
You attribute magical powers to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Act itself did not suddenly "create all equal" simply because someone wrote on a piece of paper to that effect. I called you nothing other than what you implied about yourself and assumptions when you wrote this:  "If Blacks would act Human there would not be a problem” (paraphrase)." Arthur Ashe would not have written anything that implied what your paraphrase does. You have taken liberties with his meaning and no one need read his book to ascertain the truth. YOU asserted via your paraphrase that if African-Americans would only act human they would be treated like humans but 300 plus years of American history defies your claim, what is more, that same history makes the case that it was in fact white people who failed to show humanity toward their fellow human beings by writing into the laws they wrote that persons of African ancestry were less than human.  The Dred Scott case is instructive in this regard.
Peter, yes I am saying they bred their slaves like cattle. It was cheaper and more fun than buying adult slaves with skills. If you read the memoirs of Mary Chestnut, you will read her comments about how she and her girl friends resented the fact that so many of their slaves looked like their husbands. She was cited in Ken Burns documentary, The Civil War. Most white folks don't want to know this. Most blacks with English surnames are descendants of slave owners. That is how they got those names. Slave owners didn't consider themselves to be racists or rapists. They considered themselves just capitalists. So much for Christian morality. Raping black women was also common practice throughout the Jim Crow days. Black families sent their daughters to school more than their sons because their daughters would be less likely to be raped as a condition of employment if they were teachers, or nurses. Remember Strom Thruman's black love child?
You are correct. Pitts is a racist. I have seen the trash he writes for over a decade. He has "everything is the white man's fault" mentality. His columns are only good for lining pet cages.
Why do you think the truth is racist? Do you need me to say you are closer to God than me because you are white? Or do you just want your 1950's white privilege back? Facts are not kind to white bigots and the lies they tell themselves about themselves. That is not my fault. Of course, you are free to believe what ever nonsense you want. I have no use for the lies you tell yourself to feel good about yourself. That is your problem, not mine.
How about we reprimand white foreigners who emigrated to South Africa during apartheid ?Don't you think they deserve a few smacks for aiding and abetting apartheid. :)
The days of rounding up gay people are not, in fact, over. Gee should do a bit of research into what is happening in his own city so that he has some modicum of an informed opinion.  Not all reasonable people oppose BLM, it's mostly fragile, entitled white people who want to be able to dictate what's acceptable with regard to protest.  These are the same people who opposed gay rights for decades.  The very same people, using the very same arguments. Gee feels that he's entitled to pronounce on racism. What a shocker there.  Maybe he should look in the mirror, realize how white he is, and come to some understanding that, truly, he knows nothing about racism, despite all his internalizing and vocalizing of racist outrage.
Such simple minded snowflakes. So sure of your silly selves as you out hate and intolerate those you accuse of same .So quick to judge before you even finish a news report,let alone research the story further.  Its stated that the threats are multiple and sophisticated. The FBI has contacted Interpol about similar invents in Britain. Some are investigating that the calls  could had been generated overseas.   Whom internationally have attacked Jews repeatedly and have even called for the complete destruction and death of all in Israel? Couldn't be factions of your darling misunderstood liberal loved flavor of the month bunch could it,Sherlock? Heavens forbid!  Perhaps prudence would call for a moments patience for investigated facts to confirm identity be it Nazi white hate pieces of shite or a particular portion of your beloved Ali babas.
Your build your argument with fallacious logic and manipulative rhetoric.      More Americans have been terrorized bombed and murder by white Christian extremists  since 9/11  than by  Muslim extremists.    What about all those Christian Militia compounds in ID, MT, TX and other states around the nation?     What about those religious and polygamist compounds of the FLDS church  which range from Canada to Mexico from UT to ND.  MT to TX. ?      You can use all the glittering generalities, intangible nouns, and emotion triggering words you want.   You can use your passive aggressive  innuendoes to spark suspicions and fear.    But as you see they don't work well when your spun dumb propagandist rhetoric.
Right out of the demorat playbook, scream racism. Jeffries is the racist. He hates white people.
Wow! That's quite the Straw Man. Kaepernick did far more than just "kneeling", and everyone knows it. It's about what his kneeling represents. 1. Kaepernick accused white people of today of oppressing black people and people of color, which is an outright racist Lie!  2. He then equated today's police with slave catchers! Another despicable racist Lie!  3. He then said "America has never been great for people of color." all while he is making 17 million dollars per year in a country led by a black President! More anti-white hate and rhetoric. 4. He publicly supported Fidel Castro, while wearing a shirt with him on it. 5. He wore socks to practice depicting the police as Pigs! 6. And to top it off, here's what this genius said about both Presidential candidates Hillary and Trump: - "Both are proven liars and it almost seems like they’re trying to debate who’s less racist."  .  Yes, Kaepernick is an anti-American, anti-white, racist hatemonger. As are those who follow and support him.
I always try to judge politicians solely by their policy preferences.  On health care, Trump is a disaster. He wants to destroy that which exists without a replacement plan. That is a path to less availability for psychiatry and pregnancy care, two areas needed for societal health.  On guns, Trump is a disaster. He wants to reduce requirements for gun ownership and he denies that any new restrictive laws could be of benefit. He is a mouthpiece of the NRA.  On taxes, Trump is a disaster. His proposals are a road to benefit the top one percenters.  On the environment, Trump is a disaster. He is all for big coal in the midwest, a horrible pollutant.  On ethnic relations, Trump is a disaster. He advertises his policies with a loud singling out of criminals who are Hispanic or Muslim or foreigner or immigrant, while never singling out white folks.  He is the worst president of the past century based on policy. Anything diagnostic related to his brain, that's just bad icing on a bad cake.
diverdave, By "very fine people on both sides" Trump means there were very fine people on the white supremacist side and on the side of the protesters.  Now we find out that in a chat room the white supremacists were talking about instigating violence, such as driving a car into a crowd of protesters. Yup, very fine people, indeed.
Yesterday's bitter old white guys, with receding hairlines, helplessly toss verbal grenades from the sidelines, as the parade with tomorrow's blow-dried young leader leaves them behind. T'was ever thus.
"the rioters"? Oh right, those starving white people who'd rather riot over HD tv sets and shoes than food.
I thought the march was in support of women's rights?  Suggest you don't disrespect their goals through mission creep.  Typical white male, trying to take over to suit his own agenda.
As a one more, Where do the souls of McConnells and his ilk's supporters, go when they die? Do they go to their white mans heaven? Or hell? I recall that their white mans jesus was a refugee fleeing a guaranteed death from a propped up Roman Empire despot, who was no different than the double digit despots we prop up worldwide, for the same colonial reasons the Imperial Roman Empire did. I recall that the Jewish priests had the Romans kill the jesus, for messing up their corruption, no different than the Vatican being built off the backs of hundreds of millions slaughtered Natives through the centuries. Yah,I would say that McConnell, his ilk,and their supporters are on a one way ticket to their Christian hell, no different than the Islamic terrorists created by McConnell and his republican and democrat cronies, are on their ways to their Islamic hells, without their 72 virgins, for slaughtering so many thousands of innocents
I don't agree. White people commit crimes just like black, samoan, asian, etc. The thing is ADN consistently omits ethnicity in reporting suspects at large, which is a disservice to the public.  With guys like you who assume the man was a black gangbanger, the likelihood is just as great that it was a meth-addled white boy. A sad commentary on your bias. What I am asking for is ADN to tell the whole story.
And yet probably 1/2 of my passengers are non-white.      You should be careful there, your racism and bigotry are showing.
Black lives do matter.  If there were no blacks, there would be a million white cops in the US with nothing to do.
It ends when the Donald is arrested and locked up for collusion with Russia.    Come on Donald release your taxes or it is it better to assume you are Putin's lackey?  How gullible White America is.    Embarrassed to be white.  How could anyone fall for his propaganda?   Just shows that suckers are born every day I guess.
Is this Islam? It is time for honesty How could any religion not fight this within their domain. Yet we hear nothing form Imams but how bad, evil, fascist Canadians are for questioning mass muslin immigration. Only an idiot would not question. Or a Marxist hellbent on destroying white Anglo Saxon culture.   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/25/horror-mosul-sinkhole-became-biggest-mass-grave-iraq/
The author appears to be married to a white guy based on her last name. Maybe she is a self hater like all those other oriental women who lust after white men.
What a ridiculous outdated thing to say.  The police are not a minority or cultural group.  They are a government agency made up of a cross section of Canadians.  Where is your proof of all this undue harassment, this is just fake news.  What cop said what?  In some situations it is possible to get HIV from spit sorry to tell you, it may be remote but it is possible.  Police are often dealing with injured and bleeding people so you cannot speak for every instance.  The police chief is black and many members are gay, countless others are not white or males. Your arguments are archaic and not even true.
Trump is definitely a worthless stain on America. He's definitely a sick, fascist, white supremacist traitor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o6-bi3jlxk    Time to get the Nazis and the white supremacist out of the White House.
RACISM - A derogatory scare word to describe a natural tribal instinct that is currently forbidden to only one tribe.  WHITE PRIVILEGE - The honor of being constantly blamed for everything bad throughout world history.  RACIST - A word used by anyone, white or not, who hates white people.  WHITE SUPREMACIST - Any white person who isn't constantly apologizing for their skin color.  These definitions fit this board perfectly.
He makes a good point. It isn't the truth. If white guys did this all hell would break loose but us natives always get a pass because we have always been here.
Change white to any other race in your post and you'll see just how racist/hate-foaming and disgusting you are.
Cracker connotes white person; probably in this case a white person who is ignorant / bully / racist. It's not a racist term and certain not a racist term like despicable words Americans have dreamed up over the centuries to call other people who are not crackers.
It's OK a black man call you a white trash,  but if you say they are black, you get arrested for being a racist.  They pretend to brush it aside when ISIS killed innocent people and they are OK to let Muslim women wear Burqa on our streets but you wear a Great America hat, you are fired. They don't respect democratic vote and pretend to embrace in democracy.  Fck all these liberals idiots, they will turn your kids into Muslims one day.
I propose that the real source of the conservative's hate for Sanger (and by extension Planned Parenthood) is that she threatened male supremacy which is just as corrosive as (and closely associated with) white supremacy.
No wonder he had to move to a third world country.   Those mental gymnastics to justify his corrupt and criminal behavior are just unbelievable.    Somehow a white guy exploiting Thai culture (and their women) is traditional?
The problem Obvious is that she used her small platform to Shout loud and clear, grade seven schoolyard invective against what she labelled "white Fragility", which has aroused a certain curiosity from that same White cohort. Wearing the Hijab and saying these things in Halifax is behavior that is extremely unlike ladies of cover in this City . Ms. Khan behaved like a Thug and was answered in kind.
I realize that this is an older article and my comment may go unnoticed but Obama and all who support this are uneducated fools!   The term Eskimo is only thought of as "bad" in Canada (and fit throwers) due to White Canadian teachers using it as an insult toward Inuit school children during the 1960s. Inuit and Yupik peoples in Alaska, Siberia and Greenland embrace the term "Eskimo power", and when Barrow adopted "inuit" as a pan-Eskimo term, it didn't go over well with Yupik people.   Obama just enjoys making something out of nothing to increase the hate between us!
Deep down, most of us are racist – or are we?  ---------------- White progressive leftists in the West with typical "white guilt" think only whites are racists?  If only they understand what non-white immigrants say about them behind their backs
Can we say that these white men are lazier than most because profs don't do much except repeat the same thing to every class they "teach" year in and year out?  Could we say that people like Herron want her race to get more of the "do nothing prof jobs" because they are also lazy?    Who knows what her objective was to post that on a blog.  All I Or most can see is that she is a racist screaming for more blacks in lazy prof positions.
No, it's always about race from the media and liberals when they only take stories about black people killed in altercations with cops and make them viral.  Note a black Muslim immigrant shot up a white church and the media threw it into the memory hole as quickly as they could, while they prattled on FOR MONTHS about the legitimate shooting of Michael Brown, bashing cops and America in the process on a daily basis.  That's not an accident.
Bannon recently called Neo-Nazis and white supremacists "clowns" ............ Trump would have taken that as a personal insult.
Nonsense.  No decent person walks along side swastika wielding Nazis and white-robed Klansmen chanting "Jews will not replace us."  Walking in that demonstration -- as opposed to running away from it -- is entirely inconsistent with simple decency.  Trump disgraced himself, the presidency and the country by suggesting that it was possible for "very fine people" to march with Nazis and Klansmen.  No decent person makes common cause with Nazis, no matter what the cause.  It's a tragedy that, in 2017, this even has to be said.  What a disaster this president is.
His upbringing is a matter of public record.  Fred Trump was arrested at a Ku Klux Klan rally, at about the same time he was running a real estate company that was sued multiple times for renting apartments only to white people.  Donald, Fred's idiot son, then joined the company and continued the practice of renting only to white people.  The bloated orange apple in the White House didn't fall far from the tree.
You are a typical racist, blame someone else for your problems. I would fully support the natives of Alaska being cut off from all state and federal money, you want to do as you want. Fine stay in the village, no more subsidies from us evil white men, no more air service no more welfare, no more health care, then when you have slaughtered every animal you can get, you will all starve to death because you really don't know anything about how subsistence works. No more AC stores for you, better learn to live off the land.no more packaged foods will be shipped out to the bush.
Some of you white folks view the world in peculiar ways. Obama's birth was public knowledge the day he was born. It was in the paper and public records. The birthers were just racists. I thought you were the advocate for treating everyone like human beings yet you support a man that started the birther movement. It thrilled the white people that elected him. Most of you white folks care more about being white than being human or Americans. Most are quite comfortable with the rape, robbery, and murder they benefit from. How is your Russian?
Anti-white racism is rampant in this country, especially on many university campuses. If anti-white bigots are allowed to spew their hatred with impunity, then the country's human rights laws are meaningless.
White Amerika is that portion of the population who have expressed their hatred of Barrack Obama since he became President.  The expansion of White Supremacist groups since his election along with the huge quantities of gun sales well-documented throughout the media displayed the evil underbelly of the nation dedicated to everything Old South Confederacy including Battle Flags and intimidation of black citizens with open carry.  The Tea Party became a legitimized haven for all of the fascist elements within the nation allowed to express their hatred for Obama and all colors other than white.  Every gun publication and the NRA fed the old fears of mass revolution against white citizens led by Obama.  The Bundy crowd in Oregon and Nevada used armed threats to dare anyone to stop them.  Finally someone did.  The insane purchases of weapons and ammunition throughout the nation serves only the profiteers in the industry and puts all citizens at risk from these fascist pigs.
Why are there five black people torturing one skinny little pale person?   Were none of the other   white girls willing to lay hands on and listen to screams?  Agree the Asst. Coach is also culpable, and am wondering why the lawyer dude was also fingered.
I find your facile comparison and equating of the lives of black baby boys with those of your filthy friggin' cats insulting in the extreme.  All the 7.2 million feral cats in North America along with the 50 million free-roaming 'owned' cats aren't worth one skin cell off one of MY 'black baby boys'--either my son or grandson.  Scratch a ha'ole 'animal welfare' cretin and a white supremacist pops out like pus from a boil.  That's why all these mewling simpletons shrieked and flailed when that great white dentist drilled 'See-So dw WYYON' but shrugged their shoulders in indifference when cops gunned down 1,500 of their human neighbors last year--mostly unarmed, disproportionately NOT white and in several cases children as young as six or seven.  Too many in my family lived under Jim Crow and knew EXACTLY what it was like to be held in less regard than a friggin' animal!  Make that indefensible, arrogant argument to someone else!
.  Le Pen is a fascist and her National Front party is a vehicle for neo-nazis and white supremacists.  The FN has received financial support from Putin-loyalist Russian oligarchs.  The bulk of the French voters want no part of this.  .
Trump is a liar, a racist and a disaster. He will never be "President Trump;" respect is earned not ascribed. Where was your respect for the office of President when you were referring to Obama by various racial slurs and spouting crap about his birth certificate and religion? I guess respect only needs to be given if the president is white, huh Lars?  You and all of Trump's other white nationalist supporters have a lot to answer for, and make no mistake, sooner or later you will.
The Democrats could go out and hire the shrewdest, most competent political junkie in the world to come up with a strategy to deal with Trump and his brave new white America, but it wouldn't make any difference. How does anyone develop a strategy to counter someone who's primary M.O. seems to be total disruption of the status quo, cavalier disregard for any kind of long-standing convention, and who plays so loose with the facts that even his most ardent supporters have shed the pretense of caring anymore? Even political wunderkinds like James Carville on the left or Frank Luntz on the right would be hard-pressed to come up with an effective strategy to deal with that particular kind of crazy. Trump may be crazy, crazy like a fox, or both, but at this point I think reading Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland" and George Orwell's "1984" is probably about the best course of action now. We're way past the point where strategists can help Democrats figure out how to deal with Trump.
The problem with your argument, like those of this professor, is that they assume that all whites hold their positions only because of privilege, and that none of them actually earned or deserved anything that they have. Her comments like "by keeping your job and your other unearned privileges..." and "...you are the problem. Your very presence", are inherently racist and sexist, promoting the idea that white men are inherently undeserving simply by dint of their race and gender, and can never possibly deserve their positions, no matter their individual merit. It's clear from her rants that she favors only people exactly like her (she specifies giving up their positions in favor of minority women, not just minorities or women, because if you're a white woman or a black man, you still need to go to the back of the bus to give her your seat). As a non-white in academia, I simply don't see this as true. It's blatantly bigoted. If she's not getting ahead, she likely hasn't earned it.
Now suddenly you invoke crime data when you think it suits you. Cute. Blacks are 13% of the US population and commit over 50% of all murders per year, but you tell us we can't talk about it while you browbeat whites at the same time.
"Just before World War II, there was a similar fascination with medieval materials, and extremists today are drawn to the Middle Ages, "especially via ardent fantasies of racial purity and white origins," Cohen said."  The growing White supremacy movement has been emboldened by the Trump campaign's message of racial hatred.  It is the duty of every Christian to stand up to such nonsense.
The assumption that all so-called "white" people share a common experience of privilege is deeply offensive, ignorant and racist.
Lol. He's half white and raised by white people--a fact that escapes Barry and libs. Thank you Barrry & liberals for the 20 TRILLION deficit!
Right, Clinton is the worst, not the KKK, neo-natzis, white nationalist, right wing militias, hate groups and racists.  Nice to see Trump voters have their priorities straight.
By Steve Bannon referring to white supremacists as "clowns", I'm assuming that he would invite them to perform at his kids' birthday party. He loves these guys!
Well Said, I have so very often wondered why all the required tearful apologies to right a historical wrong are always required of the white people, but never, ever any other group of people in this world. Such hypocrites, not to mention reverse racism.
Your ignorance of black history in the south is amazing.   How many deaths and rapes of blacks would you need to  feel any degree of outrage for those preaching white supremacy.   Is 50 ok, but not 500?   And German Nazi are not uncommon nor the skinhead movement that they created.     I know you can read Out, surely you know this?  I'm happy to say that I hate racism.  I don't hate white people, I won't attack or kill a racist unless they presented an immediate danger to me or my family, (and that applies to any person, not just racist), like a car driving through a crowd for instance.  I never thought I'd see you as an apologist for racial bigotry.
Yes she mentioned white people as whites were the people who voted for him.  What other racial group voted for him?  I am not aware of any sizable minority that voted for him.  Maybe Russians?  The fact is the people who voted for him were not intelligent.  They were influenced by imaginary fears created by the Donald such as Mexicans are swarming over the border to take your job. or Muslims are going to rape your women.  Pathetic.
I'm Alt Left, I'm white and I'll do and support anything to get this crazy cracker president out of the white house so we can have an America for all Americans.
There aren't enough white, racist men in the country for the GOP to win a presidential election.
The actions of one idiot brings out the faithful racists ranting against all of the Native villagers who dare to actually exist in the state in violation of the White Supremacy creed where all animals are to be reserved for their own killing pleasure.
So you want an entire race of people to be relegated to the dust bin of history because of a rally by a small group of them that you hate.   Are you Himmler, reincarnated? Tell us how white people are our misfortune.
By a very large margin, the worst crimes, terror attacks in the US, domestic or otherwise, are committed by right-wing white people...
and the players have right to organize and reject any rule but I know you are white and probably racist so  vergessen sie
Trump is the perfect candidate for the poorly educated white folks that elected him. He makes fun of all the people they fear and hate. It will be interesting to see what he does with them. He enjoys abusing people that he thinks are beneath him. He already calls them "poorly educated", with a smile. He is their pimp now. BTW, pimping runs in his family. His grandfather ran a brothel during the Yukon gold rush. He ran back to NY when the Mounties showed up.
Driving a car into a crowd of innocent people? It didn't take long for these Alt Right white supremacists extremists to resort to terror tactics right out of the ISIS playbook.
I think Jane has a "White" problem.
Why Donald takes 2 days to gather all the facts first before endorsing the white supremacists.
How do you celebrate Canada Day without mentioning Canada? With a yellow rubber ducky. Any overt sign of patriotism  is now distasteful, like Trump. To actually say "Canada", and wave a flag  is just white supremacist, racist and red neck.  It would offend First Nations, LGBT, BLM, feminists and immigrants.. For Liberals, Canada has done nothing  to forgive 150 years of sins.  So let's all cheer the rubber ducky.
Yeah, how dare Kaepernick oppose "the pervasive evil of white cops killing black men"? He should be proud to be in a country where white cops kill unarmed black men (like him). He is wrong not to rejoice in a country where the president says that those who march with neo-Nazis and the KKK are "good people".
So Rich Wheeler, a contributor to FOX and Malia Zimmerman a reporter of FOX, got FOXED by FOX? FOX is like trumpf, full of old white men sexually harassing reporters then lying and firing them. FOX is FAKE.
"Trump has been giving serious speeches detailing his vision on the economy, foreign policy, crime, immigration and other central issues facing the country." "Detailing"? O.K....I'm still looking for that....... You may disagree with how progressives think things should run. But you certainly sound intelligent enough to know when the cons and 'neocons' are done. They chose the dark side and this is their reward. Angry ignorant white trash may have votes, but they happily do not run this country.
Who's doing all the killing in the inner cities? Not whites. That's your culture bro, not mine.
Ask the Korean neighborhood in LA during the 1992 riots... or ask the black men in Ferguson MO protecting their white bosses convenience store during their riots if they would have preferred double barrel shotguns against angry mobs... you shouldn’t be so quick to curb anyone’s liberties. Tomorrow it may be your turn.
Racism is racism.The Globe and Mail editorial board has demonstrated their position is to uphold white privilege.  The history of editorial pieces demonstrates this without question.  A bunch of white guys in a board room do not get to decide what redress for violence against black students should be.  All racism is a form of violence.  I speak from personal experience.  So go ahead and enjoy the board room circle jerk dear editorial board.  We already have your number.
The GOP is getting all it deserves for not accepting the best president America has ever had - Barack Obama. Everyone of them is saying the American presidency is for white men only. Preferably bigoted white men.
Funny how everyone wants to come to White nations though isn't it! I mean Mexico for Mexicans, India for Indians, China for Chinese, Japan for Japanese, ME for Arabs but White Nations for everyone?? Your anti white hatred shows? Why come here if you don't like music, pork, beer seeing women dressed normal, dogs? There is lots of room in the ME for you.  Oh I know why they come here, it's for the welfare!  I do miss the old days of European migrants who worked their butts off and made this country great! Built this country, defended this country against that dictator you seem to associate us with.  You are anti white, please leave you aren't good enough for Canadian values, why don't we let smart hardworking Latino's or Asians in ?
A white guy running food cart that sells "latin" chicken? What are latinos not good enough for WWeek to make latin chicken?
...and if it turns out to be a white guy who shot a black guy, then we will put it on the top of the DP for weeks, but if the shooter was a black guy then we will bury the story and you will never hear about it again.
The first paragraph had the words: Trump, blaming, condemnation, protest, white supremacist & killing. I looked to see if it was an Associated Press story, and sure enough it was.
H.L. Mencken saw this coming in 1920:  "All the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre — the man who can most adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum.  The Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron."
One more example of the White Supremacist ideology of Donald Trump.  A disgrace to the nation and humanity.  Leader of the new White Supremacists in all of their forms, KKK, Nazi,  White Nationalists, Old South slavery idolators.  The tepid statements only after the White Rioters started assaulting and killing those who opposed them.  Reminiscent of the Brown Shirts of Nazi Germany leading to Kritallnacht.  When will it be allowed to happen here?  It already is.  Time for a Revolution against the Republican White Supremacist Party led by the reincarnation of Hitler.
Actually it was the protests and the extreme over reaction of the Chicago police, under dem leadership so stupidity transcends party. The convention was fun! A real discussion of legitimate ideals for American democracy. Any of the candidates would have been superior to tricky dick  Nixon. Clean Gene, and of course the liberal from the north...too bad we screwed up and the media portrayal of the the protest and Nixon appeals to white southern racist worked like a charm...and they are back with the Donald.
White privilege. It's everywhere.
the Liberals mock Conservatives as old  white men  I give you  Stephane Dion John McCallum  hypocrisy and irony
Does no one actually read the fucking article??? "WHITE MALE" Caucasian.
The entire first paragraph consists of one word:  "Evil"  You may disagree with that, but I suspect you mean the 2nd paragraph which is also completely accurate.  There are no good racists.  End of story.  They are all hateful scum and there are no words that can defend them.  THAT cannot be denied.   trump ignored the murder of an innocent women while saying some of those white supremacists were nice people and attacking those who came to protest peacefully.
Sadly, we still have people that believe the Civil War was not about slavery. I have no doubt most of them voted for Trump. Being white is more important than being Americans for them.
When you have an organization which says "Black Lives Matter" whenever  police shootings are involved, how can the fact of the race of the dead person not be relevant enough to put in a headline?  Especially in a State where only 2.3% of the population is black and most of that population is in Portland?    Not mentioning the race of the alleged victim could be construed as white censorship.  As in: "We don't want people to know that white cops are killing black kids!"  Pick your headline and justify it.
More manufactured fake news. First, Trump is not the founding father of the white supremacists despite all the media's attempt to make it look like he is, and that's ignorance. Second, his two day delay to condemn that group has to do with waiting for the facts to come out, and not because he supports them. The leftist media jumped the gun on several occasions, and many people paid the price for it with their jobs gone, but the fools never learn. Trump is an outsider, the establishment hates him -most Democrats and some Republicans because they liked their comfy business as usual positions to ruin our country.
"of our own"  Wow!, how you sound like those southern racist white guys that are symbolized in three letters.
Whites kill whites and blacks kill blacks more often - a function of being in closer proximity to each other.  Meaningful discussions are so much more possible when one presents the complete facts.
Nope. White men are pretty scary. Especially Christian ones. They reeeeally hate women as well as POC.
It sounds like this woman may be a white lady. These were black men killed and a black woman that he had to pretend he gave a fuck about so I would like to know the race of this woman. He still gets no brownie points with me....
Let's face it, the R-G is operated by educated whites who rightfully find today's brand of conservatism both embarrassing and threatening. Kathleen Parker is not a liberal, she's a Republican but I assume even for an idiot like her it's becoming harder and harder to stomach the likes of a president who feels up his own daughter, jokes about having "sex" in common with her and claims he would be dating her if only she weren't his daughter.  Don't get me wrong, I think Trump is a good fit for the Republican party. It's good they've come out in the open with their values. I find it especially heartwarming that the Christian Right has overcome its aversion to activities such as adultery, fornication, possibly incest, grabbing private body parts, and other previously and supposedly shunned activities.  At the same time, most of this stuff is a big turn-off for most Americans, a majority actually, so don't hold your breath on the R-G becoming Breitbart or Infowars.
The confederate flag was not a white supremacist flag you morons. It was the division of the country.  There was a North and South with both black and white on both sides.  Stop crying racist every time you don't like something. Go back to school and learn REAL history.  Am so sick of the race card. And just how does a flag make you feel unsafe?  The kid has as much right to to the first admendment as you do. Oh that's right it don't fit your agenda. Instead of whining and boo hooing you are oppressed, you have just as many rights to make something of your lives as us so called white supremists. In reality you have more resources to use than we do. Get off your soap boxes.
Perhaps Trump is crazy, paranoid and prone to conspiracy theories.  But so are the multitude of his detractors who blame white supremacy for the countries problems and suppress free speech and due process.  People like the author seem to have forgotten the principal of democracy that voters can only vote for the most worthy candidate available.  I suggest to those who'd like to see Trump out of the office to produce a candidate who will protect Americans from the hysteria of identity politics.
This is absolutely delusional. Sounds like you think you are a victim, eh? Poor white males and their suffering at the hands of those aggressive women!
To be accurate he was half white and half black.
JP says:  "Trump is a product of many angry, mostly white Americans"  Racist stereotyping duly noted.
Why isn’t Justin Trudeau also being vilified as a KKK fascist neo Nazi because of his close friendship with Trump? How can Trudeau be so close to Trump and not also be party to the swastika celebration Trump is accused of championing?   During Pride Parade, BLM called Justin a white racist so it must be true. Will the Globe please turn its attention to our own fascist  in office.
This teacher is quite simply a racist, as are the union officials who support her acts.  A student has no right to express an opinion on the matter because he's male and white?  That tells us all we need to know about this teacher.
That's what I'm talking about too, Mensa. Read the data if you must. Blacks are killed by other blacks at a higher percentage than whites are killed by other whites. Let me repeat-Black on black homicide was about 90% in 2015, compared to 81% for whites.  Are you slow?
Don't bother.  Being a 'poor thing' is 100% better than being a willfully ignorant white supremacist
The entitled Whites in the NHL do not get what the fuss is about. The NHL and NHLPA should be making a stronger stand against Trump. Shame to both; also, Crosby and the Pens are an embarrassment to be going to the White House.
nothing trump would love more than to annihilate 26,000,000 innocent people whose skin isnt white.
Blacks and hispanics are more fat than white people? You can't say that. It's RACIST. You need to change the chart to show more diversity. Yeah yeah I know, it would show false information, but being diverse and accepting gravity challanged people as they are, is more important than the truth. Show some sensitivity!!!
and yet another stupid white man (as put by Bill Maher).  Why does the media have to point out (at least in the headline)  that the driver is Japanese?  Who the H cares?  Isn't he just a elite pro racing driver who happened to win the Indy 500?
Trump has zero experience in politics. He is an expert in Real Estate, bankruptcy, draft dodging, tax evasion, lying, abusing women, bulling, making fun of disabled people, accused rapist, and F moron, - you would think he would at least surround himself with experts in politics, instead, he settles with criminals, racist, mentally, deranged people. But then, can you blame him, the people he can relate to and comfortable with, he surround himself with them. His base are mostly KKK, neo-nazi, white supremacy, demented, low life racist people.
I believe your profoundly facile comment is an example of what anti-racists call 'white tears' or is it 'white frailty', or maybe just plain benighted??  And if you've only recently become familiar with the word 'racialised' it really does demonstrate that you live in a totally uninformed, unaware world - yet another case of so close and yet so freakishly far.
Oh, boo hoo.  Poor put upon white male.
And this kind of gross generalization doesn't help at all.   I can only guess that you watch only Fox News.   In my especially broad reading of the "institutional white media" I encountered quite a few black analysts and commentators, as well as rational, aware white authors.  -- Paul
Bigots huh,  tell me something,  by stating the obvious that most crime in Alaska or in fact the US in general is committed by blacks or other non whites,  by stating the obvious you liberals like to hand a name like bigots or racist on any one that disagrees with them,  shameful
>>Duke Charles Martel >>Are you a muslim Alceste? ... To that question, Alceste has a canned answer - "Are you a White Supremacist?".. or "At least I am not a White Supremacist?" Either way - it is pretty telling how he feels about himself. And what does he equates being Muslim with. .. Now, to the apprentice who would be given the task of "censoring" this post - read twice.. Just because there are some words in it that may scare you into censorship, there is nothing offensive, or false in it, it is based on actual posts ( go search your database).
"Arguably, to "make America great again" is a cri de coeur of an anxious, frustrated & angry older white American element ..." Oh brother. Back to the angry, older white rhetoric, again? I haven't heard that since pre-election days when they were tagged as being Trump's only support. How did that work out? I think you may want to come up with another tag line.
"and opposing the idiocy emanating from the White House." Please state Specifically the precise things that Trump has done so far that is "idiocy" ...Without ignoring Reason and Logic.
One big difference: Obama was an exemplary human being, and the white racist fringe and GOP old white establishment wanted him dead. He did nothing to deserve it, but was kind and inspirational and all inclusive. He tried to get everyone healthcare. A good man. Trump is a bigot, sexist, angry, childish, vindictive, unknowledgeable about the past, divisive, tweeting, insulting hack. He is not one for our children to look up to. he is trying to take away healthcare. A BAD MAN.
Obama is importing Islamic fundamentalists? What vintage are they? Are they still in the box?  Or maybe with a link you could show us where you get this news? I only ask because the idea that the President is personally importing terror is silly at best and seditious at worst.   Like they said during the Bush years when we protested the war. Don't like the country leave it.  P.S. Talking bout how bad Muslims are after OK City, the PP guy recently, the SC church shooting, Aurora, or any other national slaughter is simply you picking and choosing your boogeymen. You are far more likely to be shot by a mentally unstable white kid with access to far to many guns.
KKK leader David Duke and the other nazis recognize Trump as on their side. The protesters and the nazis have one thing they agree on: the knowledge Trump is at least a closet racist and white supremacist. Real Americans find Trump's nazi friends repugnant and evil.   The disgust with Trump is 100% earned. He should be called on it every time until he reforms or resigns.
As bad as this story is, and it is bad, I find something very interesting.  ADN has buried it, and I truly wonder why that is?  Actually, to be truthful, I know EXACTLY why that is.  The fact that the officer that shot the young man, and the young man himself belonged to the same demographic, and not only that, they knew each other.  So, ADN, obviously black lives do not matter UNLESS said lives are taken by a white individual, especially a Law Enforcement Officer of said race.  Why is this not upon your own front page within HUGE letters, as, as slaves of the Washington Post you seem, nay, actually do so often?  This young man was shot and killed by a police officer, and has sparked many a riot and destruction within the community.  Why is the story buried, ADN?  Have you no dignity?  Have you no independence?  Have you no respect?  Apparently not, because you, ADN, and so many of your own compatriots within the Liberal\Marxist ideology care only about one thing.  Votes.  Bastards.
Are these white supremacists some of the "many fine people on both sides" that the man in the adult daycare center was talking about?   Think about that. We have a moron in the WH, selected by the EC, who has enabled actual Nazis.     Sad!
The FN Chiefs already know the answers they are looking for but refuse to accept that Indigenous men are the culprits:  Exactly, they will not accept anything other than it is all the white man's fault.
.  Being a "toronto guy" - how many of the daily(now) shootings and stabbings in Toronto are perpetrated by white men?   Or you just see 'white'?
The extremists are the right wing who actively work to remove the rights of women.  Those re the people who need their "Canadian Values" vetted.  Time to drop the "Muslim Extremist" stupidity and realize that the safety of Canadians is endangered by white supremacist right wing nut jobs far more than Islamists.
Big shocker in Africa - an aspiring demagogue doesn't want to give up power, it's not like we haven't seen this script before. The people of Zimbabwe would be immeasurably better off under British rule compared to the murderous tyrant Mugabe. The average person is completely ignorant to the fact that Mugabe has single handedly destroyed a country that used to be referred to as the bread-basket of Africa. He is responsible for over 1 million deaths of a rival tribe and turned once lush and fertile land into dustbowls - Mugabe's goons took over farms from predominantly white farmers, sold the irrigation pipe for scrap metal, and ran goats over the land (pull out plants by the root) - turning millions of acres into unproductive dustbowls. South Africa won't be far behind.
The author of this article is spewing hatred and irresponsible leftist propaganda. Jeff Sessions is not a white nationalist for wanting Canadian style immigration policies that favour skills over family ties/ chain migration. 49% of current LEGAL immigrants to the USA are on at least one welfare program compared to 30% of the native born. That is stupid policy.     He is not anti-trade for wanting to reform anti working class trade practices. The real danger to the American people is not Jeff Sessions but the pro war, open borders, unlimited free trade donor class that funds both parties.
My feelings are not "astonishingly sensitive" and why should I or anyone else forget it?  Suppose a white entertainer got paid extremely well to come to college campuses to insult black Muslims.  Would you and your fellow progressive trolls be calling the feelings of black Muslims "astonishingly sensitive" and wonder why they just didn't "forget it?"  Gregory was a black racist who was paid handsomely for being a bigot;  you and the politically-correct progressives think that is wonderful.  You and your leftist pals are similar to racist, right-wing scum in your methods and extremism.    Radical, violent extremists from both the left and the right need to be purged from American society.
Pitts ,you are the pitts,dumbo..a negro will never be happy less whites give 'em every thing their wittle hearts desire
Right On!!!!     It is the utter hypocrisy that takes place in Canada that is disheartening.    All immigrants want full rights here (as they should) and state we should be multicultural (self interest of course).   Fine/ok, it is not race or culture that makes a person good or bad, as evil exists across the spectrum.    But the blatant hypocrisy that we are to be brow beaten for not being multi-cultural enough and not accommodating enough when all (most) Sikhs want a Sikh only homeland....all Jews (most) want a Jewish only state, etc. etc. ..    The only ones expected to be otherwise are western white countries and it is the height of hypocrisy....unless you can preach the same in your former country  you are a hypocrite.   No wonder our leaders are so out of touch in their political correctness and a nut like Trump gets elected.   Either it is global multiculturalism Mr. Singh or you are a hypocrite.  I say this as a former NDP'er  (long before you giving up on them).
Perhaps trump should quit hiring white supremecists.
What is  not to love about the Trump's wall on the Mexican border?   There is nothing that the U.S. needs more desperately than to keep out the taco carts, and in the far future, it will be a fabulous tourist attraction, similar to the Great Wall of China.   Plus, it is a job creator: only white Americans will be allowed to build it.  I say, go for it, 45, and shut down that government!  Stephen J. Remington
HA HA HA   Infamous Nazi White Supremacist Bounces $10,000 Checks  You may remember Spencer for being the primary target of the Punch a Nazi movement.
And what were you doing while George W Bush was blowing through the Clinton surplus and running up record deficits? Oh, thats right, you were cheerleading the Iraq war and screaming about John Kerry medals.   Conservatives don't give a rat's t*rd about deficits...except when a Democrat is in the White House. For more info see Reagan, Ronald & tripled deficit..
Yeah, let's whine about someone's socks in the NFL while having no problem and arguing for the right for one of its franchises to keep a Native America as their logo and to be called the Redskins (hypocrite much?).  So what if he wants to wear a Fidel Castro shirt, when you actually use your brain you can see there is no difference between that or wearing a George Washington or other founding father t- shirt as they oppressed blacks and others (the Constitution originally had blacks at 3/5ths a man), which I am sure you would have no problem with.   He is upset at police officers abuse of citizens, specifically blacks.  Google police excessive force and stop closing your eyes to the issue.  He has every right to protest on this issue.   He had a platform and chose to use it during the anthem, not the game.   The reason why he is having a problem finding a new job is that because of whiney white people like you like to ride the wave of fake patriotism.   Get off your imaginary high-hor
EXTERMINATE the NIGER RACE STOP KILLING WHITES
You think it was white voters who handed the DA all those metros last year ? That was from a massive growth in the black vote. You want to go back to a party who can ONLY win ONE city and ONE province - and even in THAT province they don't do it with the white vote, they do it because they have, for years, had the bulk of the coloured vote (as did the NNP before them). Nowhere else is there a demographic where they can remain in power, let alone grow, unless they can get black votes. Just 2 years ago - it seemed impossible for the DA to win anything in the north except (very white) Midvaal.   They're black support has grown a great deal since then - and they need to keep doing that. To be a viable opposition party requires having an actual chance at winning, to do that they need black votes - lots of black votes. And while they may lose some (perhaps many) racist white votes if they stop entertaining racists - they'll not only gain black votes - they will gain mine.
Black Lives Matter means just that... that black lives do, indeed, matter. Why is that even controversial to you? You think they don't matter?  The name was derived because 400 years of white supremacist anti-black behavior by a large swath of the majority white America has proven without a shadow of a doubt that many do NOT value black lives. 3/5ths clause for starters. Current neo-Nazi and klan rallies for current perspective. If you don't see racism, you have the luxury of not having to pay attention to it. Black Americans don't have that luxury.  How ironic that on a thread about Trump caping for the KKK and neo-Nazis, your take-away is how "racist" the simple, straightforward non-exclusionary phrase, "Black Lives Matter" is. It doesn't state that 'black lives matter MORE'. Or 'ONLY black lives matter'. Nope, just "black lives matter".   Eliminating the concept of race is a nice goal for the future, but not feasible when racism is so prevalent. I remind you we have a nazi problem.
Congratulations Klastri, 1 state down and only 49 to go for HitLIARy to make it in 2020! May Bill Clinton's and Anthony Weiner's mojo be with you! LOL   Hey check out this hilarious video of a whitey Democrat telling future Mexican Democrats to shut up. LMAO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmkbtWTJBew  Better yet, check out this hilarious video of a whitey Democrat telling the country she does not support gays like you... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVDzUWetslg
Why not use this quote instead, CM?  "In 1955, Mr. Buckley started National Review as voice for “the disciples of truth, who defend the organic moral order” with a $100,000 gift from his father and $290,000 from outside donors. The first issue, which came out in November, claimed the publication “stands athwart history yelling Stop.”  It proved it by lining up squarely behind Southern segregationists, saying Southern whites had the right to impose their ideas on blacks who were as yet culturally and politically inferior to them. After some conservatives objected, Mr. Buckley suggested instead that both uneducated whites and blacks should be denied the vote."   https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/business/media/27cnd-buckley.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share NYTimes: William F. Buckley Jr. Is Dead at 82
Is it really surprising that white men of that era were racist? Probably hard to find one that wasn't :(
Trump's opposition to hatred and racism has been tepid.  The majority expects him to denounce hatred and racism, but the KKK, white supremacists, skinheads,  and other hate groups are part of his remaining core supporters, so he has decided to issue weak statements.
Police in Winnipeg killed an aboriginal man who had a screwdriver and in Vancouver police killed a white man with a stapler.   Police have a bias against people holding weapons not their skin color.
Five police officers in Dallas were murdered by a (Black Lies Murder) supporter so it is true they are a radical racist terrorist group. In addition the Soros sponsored Antifai are just as disgusting as the White Nationalist, KKK and Neonazais  As for you statement regarding BLM it was all started and based on the "Hands Up Don't Shoot" lie that was promoted by the Micheal Brown shooting.
You mean they shouldn't be black and if they are, they should stay in their place, be humble and mumble, be servile and apologize for existing. How about that black guy killed in his car at the gas station in front of his girl friend for doing nothing?  What could he have done?  Maybe you think all blacks should wear white face and if they don't, it is their fault if they get racially profiled for DWB or wearing a hoodie and killed.  Is that it?
Donald Trump will condemn anyone, including his own staff and fellow republicans, but will never condemn white nationalists or Vladimir Putin. If you don't see the type of person Donald Trump is by now, then you are as ignorant, evil, and arrogant as Trump. He's a blatant racist, he has no clue how to run a country, and he strokes Vladimir Putin when ever he has the opportunity. We need to get America back on track, and that starts with the impeachment of Donald Trump. Nothing in our country is going to improve until Trump is out of office.
Look out for white supremacists.
Louise Linton, publicly providing proof you don't have to be poor to be white trash.
i doubt it. shes on smarm factor 9 and isnt about to get off her stool until the white boys are humiliated to tears.
Amela, you are almost as bad as the Missouri state senator for saying Trump endorsed the white supremacists.  Please cite me a credible source to show that he did that and I will apologize to you.
I think your analogy falls far short of the truth. The nazi aholes and white supremiscists are vile and digusting. However, antifa went there looking for a fight. The brain dead white supremacists were happy to oblige but make no mistake, antifa is no innocent girl who wore the wrong party dress.  The woman who was killed in no way deserved that fate and had this white supremacist group been in Denver, I might have been in the crowd peacefully protesting against them.    I can fully say that the white supremacists do not in any way represent me or my family. They don't speak for my political or social values and I wish they would wither and die. I hope you can say the same about the antifa.   That is an honest assessment, as devoid of partisan hackery as possible.
"... and both major candidates behaved like civil adults."   What? Where have you been Phyllis Zagano?   Did you not hear Donald trump say the system was rigged and that he might NOT accept the outcome of the election IF he did not win? Did you not hear him incite angry mobs at his rallies  to "lock up" his opponent? Did you not hear him call his opponent "a nasty woman" during a presidential debate? Did you not hear him brag on video that he enjoys sexually predator behavior toward woman, married woman...while he was a married man? Did you hear where he likes to grab them --and all because he could because he was a big shot??  Donald trump has lowered our civil discourse into the gutter- into his swamp --and now that he succeeded in dubbing angry white uneducated men with his racist, sexist and xenophobic fears, we are supposed to sit back and behave nicely -- because you wouldn't want to be inconvenienced by a traffic jam?
Who is claiming white men are Earth's alpha males? Evil and hatred just like love and compassion are qualities ANYONE can possess. Your comment seems a little irrelevant and off topic.
"They're just a bunch of selfish, whiny, angry white guys."  Just exactly like Donald Trump.
This will just force Canada to set up alternative trading arrangements. Angry white men often make terrible decisions.
This silly smiling halfwit needs to face some basic truth. First, her appearance suggests her ancestors probably were brought out of Africa as slaves. This has given her hug advantages. Sub saharan Africa had no written language, no buildings more than one story high, and the only real wealth was the number of slaves. Often everyone was 'owned' by whatever potentate held power. They welcomed Europeans with goods to exchange for slaves. Slaves were originally brought from Africa because religious leaders in the civilized world thought it morally wrong to 'enslave' primitive humans found in the 'new' world and on the Hawaiian islands. It was acceptable to purchase those already enslaved by their own people. If this professor's ancestors had not been brought out of Africa it is most unlikely that she would be a professor. It was white people who ended slavery, over the strong objections of black Africans. She has no gratitude.
By not mentioning the race of the cops in question using undue force on helpless black people  it is assumed all the bad cops are white.
then women should be prepared to returning to outhouse when white men stop being plumbers.
Why hasn't he condemned the actions of the violent Nazis, klansmen and white nationalist alt-right? Because he has been egging them on. david duke said as much; they believe he is on their side and he is doing nothing to change that belief. That makes him responsible. I will believe that it is his fault until he comes right out and condemns white supremacy, but I won't be holding my breath.
It was WHITE Catholics who voted for Trump in large numbers.  Catholics of color were smarter.
To anyone that would like to compare me to Hitler or call me a white supremacist, and are willing to do so to my face, I'll be at Mililani Jack in the Box every Tuesday at 8:30am. Ask for Clifford.
If the LV Gunman had been shouting Allahu Akbar  you would be telling us he had nothing to do with islam and that it was not terrorism, just as you did when Omar Mateen killed 50 LGBT person in Orlando. But he was white middle class American  so you do all you can to label him a terrorist.
You love the Nazis don't you?  You apparently don't  want ANY of them to get hurt I see.  And I NEVER said Antifa is passive.  Punching Nazis is not a passive activity.  It's a patriotic activity.  It must be out of your comfort zone to think that a Liberal might hit back.  Surprise surprise. You should find another source for your biases than the Gateway pundit.  You know what one brownshirt tactic was?  It was attributing Nazi behavior to their opponents.  Like:  "The Leftists burnt the Reichstag" or like today: "Obama is a racist!! " "Antifa are brownshirts!!"  See how that works?  Will we see YOU at the next White Nationalist rally?
calling someone a snowflake for standing up against white nationalism, Alt right, neo Nazis, inbred ignorant redneck pinhead moron Jeff Sessions wannabes is ahhhhh, a bit naïve
Spoken like a true resentful, angry, paranoid, mean, screw-everybody-else-but-me, patriotic white American, congratulations. How many times did you vote for Trump anyway?
These were screaming, raging, angry white men with torches, they surrounded a black Church and were going thru town rampaging against PoC. If brave, good people DIDN'T stand up to the terror these white supremacists were inciting, WHAT MORE VIOLENCE would the racists have inflicted!  Of course Trump defends his fellow white supremacists, is anyone surprised. He's a racist, bigoted hatemonger, plain & simple. He's a disgrace.
Trump is just an awful and petty little man that is out to erase all things Obama. He doesn't care what it does to Americans.    Surprise, surprise another fake xtian voted into office by other fake xtians.  I wonder if he will quote Two Corinthians while ruining the lives of "the least of these".    These days, far more atheists are better at living Christ-like lives than so many of today's so-called xtians that are white supremacists and/or Dominiinists.
Hilarious, lol. I doubt that football players in the NFL will soon forget their rightful place; In the millionaires club. I am absolutely positive that they also earned it. No problem with that at all. All the facts are against Leonard, if the main stream media were forced to present them. But they will not. Pitts will never stop the BS, either. Too much political capital lost if he cannot cry "racism", plus he would be out of a job. Same old same old. I don't even bother to read what he has to say anymore, because it never changes. I know what's in it. The big bad evil white man. Leonard, please name another country that has more millionaires of color. If millionaires of color are so discriminated against, how could they have possibly become millionaires?  Please explain, because you cannot. Next......
That seems like a pretty clear statement to reference. What exactly did Obama say when you were told "that because I am a white man I am a racist SOB"?
Your true agenda is that superiority attitude I see among "Christian" white males  What is that "Traditional value", was it whites live here and blacks live there.  Was it I'm a Christian and your a Muslim, and your religion isn't REALLY a religion.  Was it I'm not gay so I'm better than you, and if your gay your a sinner? Your superior attitude was tried by a country called Germany.  Didn't work.
So, I guess white-skinned  latinos descended from Spanish Europeans aren't allowed in your special fraternity?? That screams of hypocracy.
When did white men become such babies? Man up.
With the young white Milleneials being so useless why not let these kid's make something of themselves and make society as a whole better?
With regard to just his golf trips, the total cost of AF1 transportation, Secret Service hotel expenses and golf cart expenses (Trump charges the Secret Service for golf cart rentals while protecting him) Coast Guard costs and other security costs (local police overtime, etc) away from the White House is just over $86 million so far.  Trump is a worthless piece of garbage.  The sooner he is removed from office, the better.
OJ made history by being the 1st black man that was involved in the death of a white woman, that bought his way out of a death sentence by hiring a dream team of lawyers. That ability had only been a white privilege before him.
He isn’t good at anything a president has to do. From the simplest, like pretending to help out in flood relief, to the hardest: making the call when all alternatives are bad. He doesn’t know anything about the issues with which he must cope. Nor does this seem to bother him. He doesn’t care to learn. It’s not like he’s getting better at the job, or scrambling to fill gaps in his knowledge. He has no views about public policy. Just a few brute prejudices, like if Obama did it, it was dumb. I do not say he lacks beliefs — and his belief in white supremacy is one — but he has no positions. His political sky is blank. No stars to steer by. Nothing he says can be trusted. His “model” of leadership is the humiliation of others— and threat of same. No analyst unfamiliar with narcissistic personality types can hope to make sense of his actions in office.
What puzzles me is why anyone would expect the white, racist Trump, with his ultra-right, white, racist chief advisor Steve Bannon, to call out white racists.  Stephen J. Remington
Far less threatening than the Antifa crowd. Those white boys are scary because they really will beat you up and set fire to your car if you disagree with them.  But they are the good guys these days.
I've tried responding to Kathleen's "states rights" argument twice now, and been zapped into the dreaded 'UNCIVIL ZONE' both times.  Since I'm marking everyone else's posts as 'good'/'civil' no matter who they are or what they say (even Kathleen's!) because I refuse to be ADN's unpaid censor, I think that's a little unfair.  There may be no 'civil' way to present certain ugly truths, but I'll nonetheless keep trying.  Invoking “states’ rights” was the Ku Klux Klan's tactic for perpetuating Jim Crow laws.  And the only HONEST ‘anti-abortionist’ I ever heard speak was former Grand Dragon and current Aryan Resistance leader--and TRUMP SUPPORTER--Tom Metzger of Falbrook, CA. When once asked his position on abortion, he said: “We oppose abortion for white women. We are in favor of abortion for non-white women.”  That's the TRUE position of these overwhelmingly white "anti-abortionists." But unlike Metzger they don’t have the guts to admit it.  That includes 'Trumpy the Clown'.
Let's start with Jared's email admitting he was eager and more than willing to meet with the Russians  to get info on Hillary.  And what qualifies this silver spoon Jared to be in the White House to begin with?   Because he's the son in law?  He's a clown like you and. I don't sleep good at night knowing we have a complete idiot and his family at the helm of our great country and who  sides with white KKK nuts which maybe is where you belong.  Sessions is another white supremacy nut who lied about meeting with the Russians.  They should prosecute him for lying under oath.  Even Trump wanted to dump his dumb arse.    Trump is an idiot who is in love with hmself and stays up late at night viewing pictures and counting the crowd size from his inauguration that the majority of the voting American public didn't want to see.   And now you have this other but in Korea doing whatever he pleads while Trump talks a big game and then jumps on a helicopter to his country club.  Big Loser!!!!!!!!!!
Biggest racists are those non-whites who in England demand exclusion from colleges curricula study of famous philosophers (Kant, Hegel, etc) because they are whites, or Shakespeare in USA because he's white too. Or 1300 Muslims who attacked recently 30 people in Toronto demonstrating against Islamization.
the thing Mr Trump 'Donald Duck ' Trump is using the Muslim as a crock to keep the other parties at bay but he has now crossed the line and need to be put in his place fast or the United States will lose business from most other countries,  the thing is he is focusing on the wrong group and he and his party the republican will feel the backlash sooner then later if he keep on pushing the Muslim ban from 7 countries there are more broader group then than that involved in ISIS there are white kids from rich countries like Great Britain   United States and of course Russia and black and hispanic kids from spain and of course from India and China also from Australia and Africa and last but not least from New Zealand, Filipina too,  all kids are radicalized by imams in those region and countries to fight the evil Americans his ban is a little narrow in scope and is going to heart the United States over the long hall.
Rogue, I am so glad you asked.  You give unconditional support to the racist masquerading as commander-in-chief who wants to deport eleven million people to make this country white again.
Hey buddy  We already know that white supeemacists (haters) are Fine People and that there is hate on both sides. On both sides.
RangerMC, I suppose you think that terrorism is okay if it's made in the USA because Trump's racist pronouncements have ennobled white supremacists, the KKK, neo-Nazis, skinheads, and other racist groups.  Hate incidents are increasing, and Trump has no answer to increases in homegrown terrorism.  For example, when asked about anti-Semitism at a recent press conference, he disjointedly referred to the size of his Electoral College victory.   Law enforcement agencies in the United States consider anti-government violent extremists, not radicalized Muslims, to be the most severe threat of political violence.
"They talk about solidarity and the inclusion of people who are brown and black, Muslim, native, LGBTQIA (the I and A “visibilizes” intersex and asexual individuals), disabled and those of diverse faiths"  The above smacks of the exclusion of white women. Those are not 'cool'. What a horrible article!
We had murdered cops at some BLM rallies, now we have a murdered counter-protestor at a white nationalist rally.    Can't these unhinged groups tone down the violence?
Gary voted for Bill Clinton who had been raping women going back to when he was expelled from the Rhode's Scholarship program at Oxford after hist first semester and then voted to put him back into the white house as the first rapist and husband of the most corrupt politician in our country's history.
Trump is everything the left hates, a wealthy heterosexual white male, whose wealth was partly acquired through inheritance. To them he is the big bellied southern sheriff and they are the brave freedom riders. This is the romantic philosophy they have been taught and cling to and protest is part of this romance. If this writer wanted to protest something, maybe she could start a campaign to find out why there are so few writers of colour (I hope that is the right word) on the Globe staff. Maybe she could mentor a disabled African Canadian woman, help raise her up from nothing and as a culminating act of sanctimonious goodness offer her your job.
White males laugh at these narco fems.   Your narrative shows everyone who the bullies and predators are.   It ain't us man It's you.   It is truly sad how you can watch  muslim women treated like dogs and not mention anything.  Why not focus on the true enemy of women.  You would get our support by speaking clearly and honestly about midieval muslim laws....  c'mon suck it up
I think we are reading different stories. My reading is, white chick gets drunk, has consensual sex with black kids, feels shamed by that....days later (remember...she went to breakfast with them, stone cold sober, the next day), files complaints, and the Lilly white University of Oregon helps destroy the lives of these young men for being "colored". The black kids file suit for being destroyed and an Oregon alt lib judge seems to think that's not good enough grounds for a case.  If the Nineth Circuit doesn't overrule this decision, there is something seriously wrong.
Huh? I don't understand your sarcasm at all, but being white, maybe that makes me stupid? Bicycle thieves? Even today, more than a hundred years after the first bicycle was designed, they have always been imported! So....?
"This story is only about pointing fingers AT white people."  Ma'am, this story is about the Crown failing aboriginal people.  Only bigots who believe that white people and the crown are the same thing would think that this story is about blaming white people.  Last I've seen, settlers make up many races and creeds, so why are non-whites always excluded when it comes to being part and parcel of the Crown?
Ridiculous ...most of those claims can be debunked just from the top of my head ... The cell phone was invented by Martin Cooper, born in Chicago Illinois to Ukranian, NOT JEWISH parents. He was working for the US company Motorola.   Dennis Gabor (holography) was an agnostic lutheran    Most Israeli "inventions" are financed with American taxpayer money and are only possible because US corporations actually share their trade secrets with Israeli ones...  Here are some other notable Jewish inventions:  Holocausts (Jewish Bolsheviks ...60 million dead Christians and Russian Orthodox)  Hate Crime Laws Holocaust Revisionism Laws Usury Communism fractional-reserve banking  Federal Reserve system. anti-white racism and their worst contrivance ....Zionism because make no mistake, the issues of Israel are not "Jewish" issues, they are Zionist issues. No one should confuse Zionism and Judaism,  The issue is 100% with Zionism, an areligious cover for White supremacy .
I was living in house with 2 other people, one who was a black university student. One day the front of the house was painted with N......R, KKK, WHITE POWER, N....R GO HOME and swastikas. As it turned out, the graffiti was painted by a black friend of my roommate who was a Ryerson sociology student. My roommate forced him to apologize  for the damage and trauma he caused us all. However, he finished it with "You white folks have no a sense humour". Was that not a hate crime?  I think it was, but  I was not permitted to report it, which skews racist hate crime stats.
America is not the place of comfort for White Nationallsts and racists. That needs to become clear for all good citizens of this country. One group is not better than another because of race. Trump is no better than a bonafide member of the Ku Klux Klan. He is probably a full-fledged mebmer of the White Nationalists. Trump is a disgrace and an enemy of America. He needs to be impeached.
"rather than be subjected to the double piercing of oppression: on the one hand from the democratically elected government and on the other from farm owners (a discussion for another day)." How exactly do farm owners oppress the local people? These people do not live on their farms so the farmers have no control over them. This is pure race baiting and basically trying to encourage black people to kill white people as their "Oppressors"
How would vulnerability express itself in the real world? Would the most vulnerable not be the most common victims? If a poor black man is more vulnerable to murder then a rich white man, would we not expect more poor black men to be victims of murder?
Again, Trump was already a proven racist before he was elected. What would you call someone who refused to rent his properties to blacks? And now there can be no doubt that he is a white supremacist, since he is giving political cover to Nazis and KKK and being praised and thanked by them for doing so.  Anyone who supports Trump in light of the above, is also a racist. If you stand with Nazis, you are a Nazi sympathizer, pretty simple.  Name one time in history when ignoring racism stopped or diminished it's effects in society?   I haven't said anything about antifa, so I'm not going to address your pathetic attempt to deflect.
Trump voters are too ignorant to follow the money. They think poor black and brown people have the money. Trump loves "poorly educated" white folks. He can count on them voting against their interests as long as they think minorities will suffer more.
Sorry, registered independent.  I have no more use for the Demopignicans than I do the Repignicrats.  And I've gotten bored with your ongoing panic-attacks.  I'm not a "liberal", and my not being a white supremacist doesn't make me one, as you seem to think.  AND, you CLEARLY weren't prepared to address my challenge as to whether YOU served in the military.  My beloved grandfather was a Chief Motor-Mach in the Pacific Theater during WWII.  I'm co-authoring a book with another honorable gentleman who did the same.  I don't get credit for that.  Nether do YOU because daddy was a Corpsman during WWII.  Don't bother throwing another temper-tantrum.  I'll ignore it.  "When I debate a reasonable man, I win.  When I debate a fool, I lose." (Imam 'Ali ibn Abu Talib, alayhimus-Salaam)  Congratulations.  I hereby concede I have lost this debate.  Enjoy your 'victory', if your terrified, miserable, pathetic little existence allows you to enjoy anything.  Doubtful, but thankfully not my problem.
The black athletes (and tag-a-long whites) are deliberately insulting patriotic Americans by kneeing during the Anthem - aiming it at white people specifically. They know it. Its intentional... But what is the crux of their argument for the knee? Social justice? Police brutality? Equal in all things to white people?  If these rich, mega-millionaire black athletes really want to help blacks...they would move out of their million dollar mansions and build a mansion in the black community and spend  their $$$ there. None of them will do that - they all prefer the WHITE community. That make his whole thing FAKE.
Im not sure if people are being willfully ignorant or if their experiences differ vastly from my own and my spouses. I am a Black Woman and I have started a Family with a White Man and we are madly in Love and have always been. Yes we enrich each others lives in so many ways but there are challenges and they have the potential to negatively affect our union. As a White Man it can be extremely maddening that there are parts of my existence and Identity I simply can not discuss with him as he CAN NOT identify with, understand or feel my plight as a WOC. It is extremely frustrating that there are parts of who I am that simply don't resonate with him in any way at all. If you all want to trivialize that challenge that many IR couples face, as someone on this post commented on as well, then you are all clearly in denial. Talking about race relations, differences and challenges should not be taboo in any relationship as they are an intimate part of our identities in many capacities. Wake up
But these are the guys doing the heavy lifting in keeping sex offenders in check in prison. Surely, Republicans can see that they need white supremacists. I mean, the cops can't keep blacks down all on their own. No, they need to partner up with like-minded folks.
I'd go out on a limb guessing who the "white devil" voted for.
Pres. Trump on Charlottesville: "Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me, not all of those people were white supremacists.” 12:22 PM - Aug 15, 2017  95 95 Replies    165 165 Retweets    125 125 likes  He not only both-sides NAZIS, he equates removal of Confederate monuments to taking down statues of George Washington.  Good lord, what a staggeringly destructive racist buffoon.  And he's a traitor.
The Dims DO have a message: Free Stuff.  Power at any cost.  Whites are bad.  Men are bad.  War is good if it's a Democrat Party war.  Republicans put people in for drugs (even though it was Bill Clinton who signed and started the sadistic "three strikes" bullshit).  The Dims are every bit as bad as the Rethugs.  Real conservatives vote Libertarian.  Real "progressives" vote Green.
Boots says, "Also the sign wavers often tend to be all local or all white or something." Something? you mean like gay, rich, poor, retarded, bigot, or what exactly?  Your comments are sounding a bit bigoted in nature.
That, to me, is a a viciously racist statement, and why I consider BLM to be racist.  If, in recent times, American whites, in general, thought black lives don't matter, then whites in general would have tried killed blacks without remorse, and harm them whenever possible.
“Hurt” poor Mr. Trump?  Silly girl - he has no feelings except for himself, of course.  And hurt him with a “racial” remark?  Sorry, but white nationalists are immune to racial remarks because they’re too busy making their own.
Then BLM will pipe in with: "We have to take away all of the cops, because they killed a black person trying to kill white people with a car and a knife."
And guess what. I'm white. But I can recognize white trash when I see it.
Goldberg needs to take a look at what he believes. The current GOP is little more than a white identity death cult. His Jewish white privilege has always been conditional. He and the rest of Jews of all stripes can be thrown under the bus. Complaining about Democrats chasing their tails doesn't protect the Jews. The Trump voters have revenge in mind. Talk to Steve Bannon to get the details.
I don't know why he's so focused on the travel ban; we have the birthers, the neo-nazi's, the white supremacists, Russians, deplorables, evangelicals (the holy liars), the Real Americans, and other problem citizens he needs to be aware of......aoha and enjoy all the Fake News & Fake Facts......lol
Never said they liberals weren't white! Stop Hallucinating, will yah? Let me spell it out for you: The Liberal Democrats are always playing the Race Card, using Race to diss the "white" man! They do it to get the minorities Votes! Doesn't matter the color of the Racists Democrats as they all play the race card. It's always the White Man's fault It's the liberals democrats who play minorities, in actuality theDonald done more in 8 months in his presidency than Barry in his 8 year reign. Barry, Al, Jesse, Fredericka, etc. all used racism as to those high profile minority deaths, said it all before the facts came out in those instances. Barry divided America as to racial lines drawn. Barry wanted to be the Leader of THE WORLD dissing America while he was on foreign. Out of Michelle's own mouth, she was never proud to be an American! Thinking the WH was a Prison? Hell, why did you run for Office then? No wonder why Barry preached as the World Leader and HATED on America! God Bless America!
I always hated, a white man impersonating an Asian man, or a white man impersonating a black man, in the old B&W movies.  It was somewhat of an insult.  What is wrong, with a Hawaiian, acting as a Hawaiian King?  This is the 21st Century.  Or, has political correctness, taken on a new definition?  Should there be, a white man acting the part of Dr. Martin Luther King?
Garden troll Jeff sessions said he thought the KKK were good people until he found out some of them smoke pot. Sessions is a certified racist bigot who supports white supremacists but not the ones that use cannabis. It's absolutely clear that cannabis is far safer than alcoholic beverages or tobacco products which points to the fact that sessions is just another corrupt Nazi in the Trump Administration.
Thank you for showing the extent of white, christian, republican arrogance through brainwashing.  Later, when your son learns to think for himself, he will realize what an total asshole you are.  He will still love you, but he will no longer respect you are feel your opinions are worth his time.  Nice job, dad.
The KKK and neo-Nazis just rallied in Virginia under the banner of Unite the Right. The Republican president is in lockstep with neo-Nazis and the KKK on the issue of venerating generals and politicians from the traitorous, white supremacist, anti-black Confederacy.  Who would have guess a man named Donald Trump who was busted by two different Departments of Justice for repeatedly committing illegal anti-black housing discrimination would turn out to align and defend KKK and neo-Nazis and their ideals. The segregationist real estate mogul is the hero of the segregationist movement. What a surprise.
No, white privilege is an accusation made against a white commentator by someone who wants to summarily dismiss and discredit that commentators view without addressing it directly.  It is an accusation that attempt to devalue someone else's point of view based on their race.  Which, by definition, is racist.  It is a label thrown around by those who refuse (or are unable, or cant be bothered) to engage in intelligent debate.  That is white privilege.
"...feminists have said that they were racist in supporting white men over sisters "of color;" or opportunists in clinging to men who held power; or secret misogynists, haters of women, who had come to despise their own kind."  I hope the Democratic party clings to this message of identity politics.  The empty calories of: "it is not because I am unqualified or incompetent rather it is because they are racist, mysoginist, xenophobic, homophobes who hate transgenders, that you should NOT vote for them.  Look at me I am your only real alternative so hold you nose and vote for me because I belong to one of our glorious special interest groups." Even people that pass the Special Interest groups litmus test want leadership and a vision.  Nobody likes a negative messsssssage.
And I suppose Trump's dad, Fred Trump, wasn't a KKK member?   Trump is and always has been a racist. The fruit doesn't fall far from the tree.   You can protest all you want. Trump has made his white supremacist trendies and sympathies crystal clear.
I think racist white America has fresher scapegoats than the Japanese although being Japanese in the wrong place and the wrong time, unlike Mr. Read's family, could likely still get you killed. This is the United States afterall.  When white people get uncomfortable they just might build a camp, steal your property and tell you to move to the desert--if phenotypically you don't display features indicating European descent or if you immigrated from some place whose culture has now been demonized. The latest wave of xenophobia has mostly produced retail violence, not the wholesale variety. We have yet to see, however, what Mr. Bannon and the Idiot-elect have in store for not-white America.
The author is an "old white guy" with peroxide hair. He should feel right at home with Trump as president. Why is it acceptable to attack "white men" in the national media today?  Isn't that a hate crime?
Hispanic 10 points under a majority, whites sixteen points above a majority. How could the demographics be any more favorable for a sadistic bigoted creep like Sheriff Joe?. So racial profiling isn't a crime, and a lot of white people (very old ones from somewhere else, who live in restricted communities or otherwise segregated neighborhoods) like the idea of stopping dark-skinned people and hauling them in for investigation and holding on bogus charges as intimidation. I'm certain you can figure that one out.  So hey, you imply that the response to criminal activity is an injunction? Look, I know you are capable of, and immensely enjoy, inflating BS balloons all afternoon. Also, you love to denigrate people not like yourself. Just be aware, I'm not the only one who can see through your transparent brain.
She won't get the uneducated white male vote.   Trump LOVES the poorly educated.
Lets see...angry white men founded this country.  Certainly you have no problem with that.  If so, you are free to move to a Muslim country where I'm sure your voice will be tolerated.
Are you a clown Clancy? You're comment is a bit clownish.  Anyway, don't worry about (in Canada, we call these wonderful people, the First Nations) it, because be the time that happens, you'll be dead.  In the meantime, those educated young First Nations will be at the leaders of tomorrow. I've seen it time and time again. There is something which white people don't have, which the First Nations do have and that is a  spiritual dimension way beyond your Judaeo Christian understanding of spirituality.  That makes them great.
As someone who supports the president I find your comment about the KKK laughable as your ignorance on the subject.  It was the Democrats who supported the KKK, it was Democratic governors who would not allow blacks in the white schools.  Robert Byrd a Democrat Senator from West Virginia was a grand cleagle of the Klan. As far as Mr James another ignorant  democrat
Racist ? yes, you certainly are carpa.  No one brought racism into this argument until you brought it up . Why do rump and kelly keep LYING about offending a Gold Star widow? Absolutely disgusting the way kelly brought his deceased son into the argument to give bonafides to his Blatant LIES? Talk about politicizing the death of a soldier, kelly apparently has no bottom to his barrel or any moral turpitude. How blind do you have to be to defend a Lying draft dodger ? Do you think bringing racism into the argument will help people ignore the truth that rump doesn't care about soldiers black or white? ..≥.Can rump tell a LIE so big, that even you won't swallow it?
Only one killer, one too many - a "very white" Québécois, racist, misogynistic and intolerant, born in Quebec. The young Mohamed El Khadir has NOTHING to do with the killing of 6 innocent persons. Violence is simply inexcusable.  My best thoughts are with the grieving Muslim families.  Regards.
Yep.  Watch out for all that 'black crime', ladies and gentlemen.  That way you won't notice that 70% of serial killers, 80-90% of mass-shooters and child molesters are white.
I guess Sen. Maria Chappell-Nadal will have to get up there like Trump does every day and lie by fake-apologizing.  P.S. There's no way the left can ever catch up with Trump's disgusting actions words and actions, all by themselves, let alone those of the rest of the GOP and their supporters.  It must be hard seeing the real Donald Trump for the racist, White Supremacist he's always been, just like his daddy Fred Trump, who was a KKK member.
Of course he would say "he knew what he signed up for"...to the black family's dead solider...but not to the white families.
Theirs.  I'm quite willing to listen to opposing viewpoints.  I don't even mind white supremacists' holding their beliefs, ignorant as I believe them to be.  I vehemently oppose their trying to impose those beliefs on others.
Not white And get a brain?  Now why is this sicko even posting?
"...white monopoly capital, or established big business..."  You degrade the value of your entire argument when you reify the myth of  WMC -- a cynical fabrication of zero value unless both of the adjectives -- white and monopoly -- are distorted to meaninglessness.  "Established big business" is a far more accurate and a much less emotional term. To your credit, you append it, but only in addition to, the WMC bogeyman.    Not a single "established big business" has a monopoly. Even the biggest is up against equally big (or bigger) global competitors.  And all those who are public listed companies have shares for sale to buyers of all races. "WMC" is a destructive over-emotional pejorative serving as a proxy calculated to insult and abuse all white people, and especially wealthy white people. It's the sibling of "you stole our land".
Another example of a white male who cannot recognize his own entitlements but feels threatened when challenged. A person so deluded that he thinks men do all the dirty jobs, that women do not fight crime, and seems to be unaware of all the brave women in the military. Delusional and sad.
The reality is, who ran the black slave trade? The whites? Hardly.  Who owned all the boats? Who introduced abortion, crime, aids , drugs into black communities? Whites? Think again  Why did Israel deport 70K black Hebrews? Some say the real Hebrews are the black Americans.  Blacks aren't thugs, gangsters, criminals, and whites aren't against them.  In fact I would say we embrace black culture.  Blessed to have known great blacks, funny, great musicians and there is something magical about a Black Christian women, child, God's children.    But then who are the Devil's children?  Black brothers, the worst thing possible is a divide and conquer strategy.  I don't like Islam per se, but a know a lot of Muslims who are great as well and they have had their countries destroyed for the Greater Project for Zion.    9/11, the catalyst, whatever happened to the 5 dancing Israelis?  Who really hates America? USS Liberty? Who owns the Federal Reserve? The corrupt biased Media? The Devil is here
Trump is definitely a worthless stain on America. He's definitely a sick, fascist, white supremacist traitor.
the terrorists continue to be alienated white male citizens hon..not well-vetted immigrants or refugees.  Get a clue.
From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author. Bloom, a white woman, is a civil rights attorney and writer. You're citing hearsay, gossip, and malicious misinformation. Below are real indisputable facts.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
"Diversity" is just  a code-word for ANTI-WHITE, especially ANTI-WHITE MALE. Nobody ever says the NBA or NFL are not "diverse enough" or have too many blacks. Why does Canada take in an absurdly high 300,000 immigrants a year??!! That is a ridiculously high figure. We should be taking in a maximum of 50-60,000 tops.  And why so many from the third world? Easy votes for the Liberal party perhaps?
Also, think about our safety as a land composed mostly of minorities in a nation soon to be run by a racist and his white supremacist buddies.
You know racism occurs on both sides, don't forget BLM or black panthers, oh that's right, it's not PC at this time, just white shaming.
Charlottesville video surfaces showing white supremacist shooting pistol at protester
Slavery is a far outcry, nay, a far more serious tragedy in this country than merely not baking cakes for someone entering in a gay marriage. That was a preposterous statement/claim to even compare the to. White racist savage landlords ruthlessly challenging the lives of people's having come from or descended from persons from the Africa Continent is barbaric. Refusing to make cakes, is not.
Predator priests get sent Native American reservations!  Hasn't the white man done enough damage to Native Americans, (disease, genocide, alcohol,) without dumping pedophile priests  on them, too?  Any bishop who has done this needs to be removed faster than one can say George Armstrong Custer.
Heck with it. Just turn everything over to the government to run. With the government in charge everyone will be equal. Every one work the same hours, same pay same color house can't be white,black or red or yellow or any color that is offensive to someone somewhere. Except government management they because of the work required of them to make sure the rest of us follow their rules will be paid at a much higher rate. Intelligent people need to round up these fools and ship them to the say north korea they would fit right in.
What happened to "just say no? " Illegal immigration, NAFTA, greed, white privilege, deep, pervasive prevalence of intense self-absorption, selfies and electronic age w/less actual/genuine communication and real intimacy, increase in no personal relationship w/anything bigger than self and the SUV, political correctness in the Christian Churches (so they don't offend anyone) illegal immigration, vast corruption w/in U.S. government and rampant corruption w/in Federal government in bed w/cartels and drug companies-Big Pharma,illegal immigration.....
This also clearly adds to Trump's racist, white supremacist pedigree.    Some of the people marching under NAZI flags in Charlottesville (all white) were apparently "fine people".  A part black guy, and other black guys, making what are actually a completely legal protest, albeit portrayed and communicated during the ritual of the singing of the US national anthem, is a/are SOB(s).  Trump is co-opting as well as linking the concept of Patriotism to White Supremacy.  Lot's of people do acts that openly "disrespect", and sometimes defiile the flag (as others point out, a constitutionally protected act),  Like, for instance, the Nazis in Charlottesville (including the "fine people" amongst them) who waived swastika flags in lieu of American Flags.  Trump chose the SOB moniker for blacks.    He's a racist, White Supremacist.  No doubt about it.
Hey all you White Boys ... F)(K you and your electric light bulb.  Who needs your GD flush toilets ?
You are insane, no white woman would go near him.
Don't be so sure. If a terrorist attack that kills 23 in Atlanta occurs, or if Iran stupidly attacks a Navy ship...  I have a hunch that if the election were held tomorrow, he would win again. The essential questions that were presented by him to the electorate still  haven't been answered by the Democratic Party. Oh, I would never vote for him, but the South will still vote racial politics, and the rust belt still hasn't seen the Democratic Party stand up and agree to taking on American business. Poor whites with barely a high school education still watch the education elite run things from towers of snobbiness. Hugh Massengill, Eugene Oregon
No, they were traitors to the United States and founded their nation on white supremacy and slavery, and utterly rejected the principles of the DoI and the USC.
Here is the problem, Jeff Hunt.  I actually AM a veteran, and I don't agree with you that their protests "portray disrespect towards our country".  In fact, it is exactly the opposite.  It's a shame so many are so closed minded, and can't see that.  And again, this is coming from a veteran.  Would I stand for the national anthem?  Yes.  Do I expect them to?  Absolutely not, if they felt compelled not to.  What WE in my tank unit fought for was the right for each American to make those choices on their own.  That is freedom of speech.  That's what it means to be an American.  Anyone who can't get on board with that, and thinks they should decide how others peacefully protest, simply fails to understand what it means to be American.  And, for the record, I am white since I know some idiots will care about that.  ;)
Right. Because they bring all of their problems on themselves. Now white people are the REAL victims. Right? Must be rough being a victim of black people’s “perpetual victim hood.”
Sounds an awful lot like a threat, bro'. Fact is. you rednecks need green liberals to watch out for you. If it were up to Weyerhaeuser and Georgia Pacific the whole damn country would be clear cut to send chopsticks to China, and the mountains would all wash into the sea.   Likewise, if it weren't for liberal groups policing the divide between church and state, the US would be overrun by Christian taliban and ruled by Baptist sharia. History is not over. And the USA is not immune to it.   Face it Bill. You're on the wrong side of history. White supremacy is illegal. The destruction of the living planet in pursuit of profit is illegal. These things are true whether you like it or not. And if you keep talking about violence against these laws, you'll be the one who ends up in stir.
"Vee shall haf no toleranze for in-toleranze" local komizars of musik-crime have declared. The same promoters of all forms of degenerate art (ie Piss-Christ) see no irony in their own tendentiousness.  Anti-racist is just a code-word for anti-white.
Kathleen K. Kearon, your prattle about "states' rights" reminds me that the only HONEST ‘anti-abortionist’ I ever heard speak was Tom Metzger, former Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan. When asked his position on abortion, he said: “We oppose abortion for white women. We are in favor of abortion for non-white women.”  And that is the TRUE position of these white so-called ‘conservative Christians.’ But unlike Metzger they don’t have the guts to admit it. And that includes ‘Trumpy the Clown.’
The reaction by Lilly white Oregon, both alt left and alt white, is telling. These are black kids who's "crime" was they touched a white chick. They were ruthlessly destroy by the white bigots from the left and right, who apparently agree on putting uppity colored folk in their place. Michaels, seems to me to be the only decent white personal in this mess.
By her own logic one might surmise she's either here temporarily for the sole purpose of defending native Canadian rights and nothing else or she should dispose of everything she owns and leave the country so it can be reacquired by natives. Since neither is likely true she's just a common hypocrite with a racist streak. And she's always welcome to move somewhere more to her liking where there are less white people, except of course no one anywhere in the world is moving in that direction. More hypocrisy.
Wow that's total garbage, and your evidence of "structural white supremacy" is to engage in the group generalizations you accuse others of doing, but we know it's ok because they're white and stuff. It's also ok to blame them for high minority crime rates.  Neo-Marxist much?  Is a majority founding demographic of a country necessarily "structural supremacy" of that group, or do you just smear white folks that way? Grow up and let go of the Critical Race Theory shtick. Come back to us when you hit your 25th birthday.
They can relocate to the garbage dumpster for all I care, that's where I put free copies of the Globe if I see them in a Donut shop or McDonalds. Good luck making money with your white hating immigrant loving political correct garbage.
Great, an old white guy with his unstable hand and mind getting more nuclear weapons, wasn't this movie (Dr Strangelove) made 40 -50 yrs ago, or maybe longer.   Truth is stranger than fiction!
Since my last post was removed, I'll try again and this time NOT of offend some of the smaller left wing brains...  This piece was total trash.. I suggest Ms. Fox go out into the REAL world to discover what's really happening.  It's obvious from her rant that she is one of 'those' that choose to blame the FAILURE of those on the LEFT to adjust to the realities of the what is going on around her. She may THINK that 'old white men' will fade away but she conveniently forgets that people get older and as they mature they realize the mistakes of the 'young' thus their opinions change. Have NO fear, 'old guys' (and gals) will be around a long time and will have NO problem voicing their opinions and taking action when needed.
Since black people don't like anything Confederate, maybe they should erect a monument of the first slave holder in the U.S. His name was Anthony Johnson, who BTW was black. They could add a mural of the African tribesmen hunting them down and selling them to the white man.
the least racist people on earth are white people.   so why should white people allow their countries to be flooded by people who bring their racism with them...espicially people who come from inferior corrupt cultures...for example indians.
“This sick f--- of a so called president is ruining our country and that's the bottom line. It looks like this white guy was targeting white people. It has gotten this bad.”   Keaukaha, given the number and toxic intensity of your several posts on this subject, you present yourself as one afflicted with a virulent hatred of white people. Sad to say it looks like you are one of the walking wounded, another victim of the legacy of Obama’s hate-America divide and conquer “transformation”.  Do you have what it takes to gaze upon your image in a mirror for an uninterrupted sixty seconds?   Given the evidence you have presented thus far, one is tempted to doubt it.
You lefties crack me up. Left wing politicians don't care about two old white people. "They're probably 'white supremacists.'" The left wants massive immigration from the failed cultures, crackpot social schemes, and housing for people who don't work. The urban left thinks these two are getting what they deserve because they're suckers.
You will notice that the rise in VEGETARIANISM coincides with the rise in FEMINISM and male white knights. ` Men are the bad hunters who kill animals. Well that's evaluation! Humans have been consuming meat for hundreds of thousands of years on earth, so know we should change? Now we should feel bad? ` Notice how feminism has no respect for men? For their fathers, grand-fathers, great-great-great----- grandfathers? If man was part of it it must be bad. ` The men who protected women and provided for them for the last 100,000+ years are now scum! ` Let's listen to the Immutable Laws about men and women by Paul Elam, (this will explain a lot) ` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BJmIXG1jYw
This opinion piece is disgusting, out of touch and clueless. Why are these questions being asked of Mr. Singh? Would we ask Andrew Scheer to denounce Mark Lepine, the white male terrorist responsible for the Ecole Polytechnique massacre? No of course not, that's absurd. However the white centric media's push to associate Mr. Singh with terrorist activities is telling and concerning. I'm not surprised. I'v noticed some older white Canadians are losing it because we have a Sikh leading one of the three major political parties. Get used to it. I can't expect a very white, very male media to have some sence about how to cover Mr. Singh. It's going to be racist and stupid. However, decent Canadians, non racist Canadians, Canadians of colour will speak up and resist. Jagmeet Singh is the new, very handsome face of Canada people. Get used to it.
Born racist?  What about the recent viral reaction to the little white boy wanting to cut his hair short to match his buddy so their teacher would be confused as to who was who.......the white kid did not see the black skin of his buddy.......born racist? Give me a break.  Parents and others in society TEACH hatred for another person that is 'different'.
When someone is treated differently from the rest based on the colour of their skin, that's discrimination - by definition.  If, as I suspect, tax fraud is disproportionately committed by white Canadians, are you suggesting that tax officials should have the right to monitor the bank accounts of all white Canadians?
Maybe the dumb MAGAphants will think this is real news.    WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was rushed to the hospital late Monday night with what doctors diagnosed as a low white-vote count.“Mitch McConnell needs a white-vote count of at least fifty in order to function,” he said. “If it falls below fifty and stays there for an extended period of time, he cannot survive.” Efforts to boost the Senate Majority Leader’s white-vote count have so far proved fruitless, as doctors acknowledged that they have been unable to find additional white votes that are compatible with McConnell.
Next time the white nationalists, KKK, and Fascists in the GOP will be called out by name.  Don't worry about that, we have tons of photographs of them too.  So we can point them out personally.
He's having a mental collapse because a four star general keeps pointing out he is full of crap and doesn't know the truth about anything.  You can tell in his facial expressions that he can't accept reality and is starting to have a mental break.  It must be hard for people who believe this white supremacist garbage.  Their heads are jacked and they have a complete false narrative on history.
Tell that to the white supremacist neoNazi in the White House.
In essence, hockey is a sport played by white folks for white folks, and Canada's white folks mostly still deny there are racial prejudices in the country: they might think they see it, but they don't, and they certainly don't get it.  The Penguins, and the NHL, are simply willfully blind to the society around them.
No. White nationalists want an all white country, and that is obviously very racist. It's not the same as mere "nationalist", although they are certainly in the same bed with Trump's "movement". They refer to themselves as white nationalists (see Trump's pal Richard Spencer), it's not a label that others are putting on them.
Well, at least the Russians are white, for heaven's sakes.  I'd rather have to live next to a nice white drunk Russian than a black Muslim Kenyan whose children's names are Satanic anagrams.
Note that the elected Student Union voted in favour of the motion Ms Khan tabled to not celebrate Canada 150 in support of aboriginal Canadians.  Perhaps her use of expletives wasn't called for (or maybe, in context, it was) but I don't see what was racist about her post or hashtags.  She wasn't addressing white people, she was addressing people who disagreed with her motion.  The term "white fragility" isn't racist.  It just names a very real tendency of some people to take offense at any attempt to address the racism that aboriginals and people of colour have faced historically, and still do face.  Indeed, presumably some of the Student Union members who agreed with Ms Khan's motion would be considered white.  I think the University was stupid to involve themselves in the political debate.  They should have just asked her to apologize for swearing.
we need less pictures of the white, elderly, obese, narcissistic "leaders"
Why are these white power terrorist groups even allowed to operate in the US?  I thought they declared war on terrorists.  Take them down to Guantanamo and break them.
Comical that the supposed conservative patriotic right side with a draft dodging coward Trump.  And here I thought I knew that group...turns out I was dead wrong.  They just want their racist protector of anything other than a white, "Christian" society.  Oh those evil Mexican landscaping guys are gonna take my job...I'm so scared!  LOL
Busted! You didn't include all white people. You cherry picked the ones to try to prove a point.  "Hey guys, watch me cherry pick numbers to feel superior to black people".  IT's unfortunate you don't understand the information being provided.
#45 is always ready to blame someone else for his shortcomings. By his rhetoric, actually his simple words not with any complex thought,  he has made it OK to be violent when it gets you what you want!!! He does not believe in the American Constitution and protection of ALL of its people.  The quote below from the report of the incident makes it crystal clear as to the source of the ideas causing this violence --- it is not 'from many sides' it is only one --- the big ignorant mouth of #45!!!  "Duke (of KKK ilk)  told reporters that the white nationalists were working to "fulfil the promises of Donald Trump."  Trump's speech also drew praise from the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer, which wrote: "Trump comments were good. He didn't attack us. He just said the nation should come together. Nothing specific against us. ... No condemnation at all."  America you have unleashed the 'Genie from the bottle', it will be a very difficult  battle to correct this very sad time in your country.
how funny and stupid we have become. So.....if the corn was white....would it still be racists?
So what if muslims become the majority?  Anybody who knows any muslims knows they are little different from any other religion or culture.     How often have you heard the muslim community balk at usury?  Almost never, and its too bad.  Personally I think we ought to subscribe to that jewish and christian notion of forgiving debts every seven years.  But what can you do?      It practically goes without saying that in a century Canada won't be predominantly white.  So what?  I lived in Waterloo where some streets by the university are in chinese. So what?
Totally disagree with you Tamura.  The white supremacists were high fiving the massacre and wished they had the balls to pull one off.
Well, I am in the game-both Holder and Lynch were some of the worst racist AG our nation has ever known. Lynch is nothing but pet slave of Al Sharpton and his brood of black racists. How bad can Jeff Session truly be?  Funny thing about racism today compared to racism of 1960s and prior is that racism is not longer the monopoly of the white folks. I should know since I am not white guy myself. Racism now comes from every color of every ethnic groups. Blacks are just as racist as white, so are the Hispanics or even Asian Americans or natives. Nowadays, anyone can call anyone..."a racist" and due to that, it has become almost worthless descriptive word. If Mr. Putski called me a "racist", and I do the same and we will be down to a level of couple of children calling each other names and resolving nothing. I think there should be ban on the word "racist" because it really means NOTHING in this day and age. But I doubt if that will happen since its a favorite attack word of an misanthrope.
Please, tell me when white racism stopped effecting public policy. I would appreciate a year and date. It must have happened after 1965. I guess I missed it
The goal of the organization that put out this report is to raise more money for themselves, and they will of course overstate the problem in order to do so. One of the first figures in the pamphlet they put out is about funding for obesity, and how it deserves more money despite the trends. What are the qualifications of the people and organization that put out this report? Oh, right, it doesn't matter as the media loves sensationalism and negative commentary, and if it has to do with obesity lots of obese people will click the bait.   I love the racial inequities in obesity - apparently white folks are responsible for the fact that minorities tend to be more obese - it can't be genetics, because there is no genetic component to behavior, intelligence or health, and if you're obese it's someone else's fault and it's the government's job to make fat people stop eating so much. What a bunch of uncritical political nonsense.  The media at work; not informing or analyzing, just repeating.
1. American voted for jobs jobs jobs. that didn't happen.  2 American wanted a single payer play to which the white house and republicans can never offer. only to destroy current plan.  3. Single payer plan was a non starter for the republican under obama. mitt romney health care plan was rejected by democrats under w bush. it was Obama revised it into Obamacare to which it was passed. Republicans are all greedy corporatist. they are only interested in rich white millionaire and billionaire who owns the corporate power in America. they have no interest in the working class poor who's lives have been destory by outsourcing by the rich white billionaires. no. they just blame color folks as a scapegoat. but it is the rich white billionaires. the military industry complex or in this case the health insurance industries. just look at all the lobbyist. filthy white maggots one and all!
The critique of Shakespeare is based on the postmodern notion that Shakespeare is overrated  for having been a white male.  All other qualities he may possess as a  writer are debased by that singular sin.
Absolutely!  I agree completely. Canada needs to stop letting in all (non-white) people from around the world.  Enough is enough.  (non-white) People from the around the world should not be allowed to own property in Canada.  Only (white) Canadian people should be.    Enough is enough.
Bee ess. Cite where Obama called whites rapists, egged rallies into assaulting dissenters, told cops to brutalize suspects, etc.   Put up or shut up.
"Israel" is a state so utterly 'race'/identity-obsessed it murders its own CHILDREN for being the wrong "color", that treats Arab and Ethiopian JEWS as 2nd-class citizens (don't ask about Muslims and Christians), and that dumped blood donated by the Falashas because it wasn't considered 'pure' enough to be used to treat Ashkenaziim, and that openly and unapologetically practices housing and education discrimination--except when the TV cameras come around. In that last it does resemble its hypocritical white-supremacist 'patron', the United States. Further it is a non-theocratic yet self-proclaimed "Jewish" state in which full privileges are reserved exclusively for European--Ashkenazi--Jews; and concerning the Arabs it treads on, it is no more and no less than an APARTHEID state so oppressive and tyrannical that Bishop Desmond Tutu and the late Nelson Mandela both said it was worse than the apartheid they themselves endured. Khalas.
I wonder if I could apply to the U.S,surely living under Wynne and Trudeau qualifies as cruel and unusual hardship,and that is without mentioning being disenfranchised as a White,English Speaking,Hetero Sexual Male.
How do you know the criminal Greenlee is a 'wealthy white conservative'? All I gathered from the article is he is white (due to a mug shot).   Some would take the assumption that he is more progressive because he was involved in a grow operation. AS IF IT MATTERS!  I really wish people would stop labeling. The guy is a criminal, he has no wealth (anymore) and he killed someone in cold blood.  It doesn't matter whether you lean right, left, up or down. HE'S A CRIMINAL!  Both sides of the fence are disgusting me with the labeling someone based on their political views. We are a lot more than just what we think politically. Good frickin grief!!!
I believe Indian on Indian abuse sexual, physical  and mental abuse has been going on long before the white man showed up. The government knows this but are too cowardly to say it. The age of consent law was not changed by the Liberals because Indians were having sex with young girls. If Indians are given a pass on this all white abusers need to be released from jail because they have been abused also, it is a learned experience . A new way to deal with abuse has to happen or start arresting Indians.
BBC interviewed a Bernie Saunders' supporter who was prevented from speaking at the Boston Rally by Antifa - according to him, they were calling him White Trash and were indiscriminately throwing acid in peoples faces - he says they are every bit as bad as the alt right...
Rat meat and vermin are also eaten by white Americans living in the Appalachian region. Commissioner Stewart would never complain about the eating habits of white West Virginians who regularly consume rats, raccoons and other animals and characterize the entire white race as vermin eating like he did with Asians here.
Hi, I'm a straight white cisgender retired combat veteran who has a Gay Godfather, my son and daughter have "2" Gay Godfathers, my family waves the "FAMILY" flag in a neighborhood who doesn't agree and I have lost friends in the military due to my stance on gays in the military and then your A** goes and does this!! How the hell do you expect us "WHITE STRAIGHT MEN" to stand up with you when you are secretly shooting us down? I love my big gay family and it's "women" (yes I labeled you) that will make it harder for my "FAMILY" to be accepted.  I hope that you get all the non white non cisgender people for your department and get your ass hacked to the stone ages!  I'm sure you will go and find a safe place now and blog/tweet/skype/snap/facebook and your probably so hipster you still use myspace or BBS and say how this warpig hurt your feelings. Rome was not built in a day but you are damn set on seeing it burn in one to get your way! Have a Happy Thanksgiving and a MERRY Christmas!
As if being beholden to Wall Street were the real problem with the Republican party. If only the GOP (now the Good 'ol Putin party) were unbeholden to white nationalist ideologues like Stephen Bannon or racists like Jeff Beauregard Sessions. If only the party were unbeholden to a base of drooling cretins. If only the Republican party weren't a threat to democracy itself, the American people would not be duty bound to destroy it utterly in order to avoid humiliating itself not just to the world, but to its own conception of itself. This is what a party looks like that is beholden to the basest segments of society--racists, misogynists, the violently greedy, and the savagely ignorant--a party that is but the symptom of a hideous, disfiguring social disease.
The gop? White people won't do hard work? Fear and lies? It appears that you don't have a clue of what drives the forces around you.   The GOP are not trying to import Mexican's, they are trying to stem "illegal Immigration" from all nations.  Pretty much no one wants to pick crops in this country aside from immigrants, legal otherwise. Skin color is not a dominating factor. Entitlements are. What idiot would go pick crops when (s)he could sit at home on welfare/disability/ssi?   Fear and/or lies are not a driving factor behind the success of Trump. That's is a misleading talking point from progressives. It is intended to cloak the reality of the situation. That being, we are sick and tired of all the crap coming down from Washington, be it from Democrats or Republicans.
I suspect it is primarily white liberals that have been surprised by the level of racism and bigotry Trump has managed to harness. Since I'm black, I get reminded daily of the racism in my fellow Americans. One of the more subtle effects of racism is the constant concern minorities must have for the emotional fragility of most of the white people here. If you are black and ignore that, you will never have peace, a job, or you freedom. The truth is that as a nation we have not made peace with our racist heritage. Being polite became "political correctness" when us "others" demanded the same rights and freedoms that white males have. For example, the 2nd Amendment is a white privilege. Cops routinely kill black people on the suspension of being armed. White men can attend political rallies while armed. We have never had equal protection under the law. I would pity the white people that are losers in globalization, if they didn't think killing black people would solve their problems.
Once again a unarmed Black man is executed by rogue cops in Oklahoma. Hillary objected heart and soul. Trump and his white supremacists said absolutely nothing.
Because she was a just a woman, and a non-white one at that. Two strikes. Possible drug use was the third.
John Mac, Everyone has the right of free speech, but you talk like the white supremacists and the protestors are on the same moral plane.
No he was bright enough to pander to the uneducated white males which are numerous in the States, hence the ku klux klan support, and then he was betting on the stupidity of the Republicans who would rather vote for someone they despise rather than for a democrat.
Hay Dana.....Speaking of "political violence", I see Hillary fans are rioting, looting Wal Mart, lighting fires, assaulting police and hating white folks because a black police officer shot and killed and armed black man.  These anarchists are voting for Hillary right?    No mention of this story in the RG.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/21/protests-break-out-in-charlotte-after-police-fatally-shoot-man-they-say-wielded-firearm/
It is odd how the bad things about a person get so glossed over, and we look at them through rose-colored glasses after death.   Ali was a bigot.  He looked down on white people and Christians.  The radical Malcolm X himself converted him to follow the Nation of Islam, which is a well recognized hate group with strong antisemitism, and gave him his name of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.  And he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: "I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough"  And he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam "a white man's war", and said that "My enemy is the white people!"    Other quotes from Ali: "All Jews and gentiles are devils",  "The sins of drinking, smoking, prostitution, homosexuality, stealing, gambling: It all comes from white people."
Spreading a hodgepodge of racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny and xenophobia?  Who wrote this article?  He/she/it left out homophobia, transphobia, and white privilege.  How can you promote the progressive agenda and not have a complete list of accusations?
They were also all juveniles. And yes, there are other reasons for not publicizing who you're looking for. But if you're going to put the name of a person wanted for murder in the paper then it's pretty dumb to not put their picture in there too, and yeah that includes these current scumbags as well as the white scumbags from palmer.
Where's the perp's mugshot? Oh, that's it- must not be a despised American white heterosexual male. ADN; typical leftist, anti-white, rag...
I guess all white conservatives are now labeled "white supremacists" by the liberal pathetic lying media turds and turdettes. They are disgusting.
Basically, EVERYONE but white bigots denounce trump at this point.  He is a total joke and an embarrassment to America.
Simply because a black woman led an objectively justifiable counter-chant that contained the words "black lives matter" (in conjunction with several other repeated phrases of defiance) is not evidence that a national advocacy group bearing the same name sent a formal delegation to this white supremacist pig-circus; on the contrary, there was in fact no such formal presence. Conversely, however, the "highest profile" traditional national white supremacy organizations (eg. the American Nazi Party, the Ku Klux Klan) not only did send hate-mongering, cowardly, heavily-armed, addle-minded, yellow-stained representatives in riot gear to this rally, they organized and staged this reprehensible public display of racially-motivated hatred, simple-minded fear and colossal human ignorance!
Mostly, blacks kill other young black males.  Those statistics are consistent for decades.  "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homicide was indeed the No. 1 killer of black men between the ages of 15 and 34 in 2011, the most recent year with statistics available.    Compared to other ethnicities, the numbers really stand out. Forty percent of African-American males 15-34 who died were murdered, according to the CDC, compared to just 3.8 percent of white males who died.   Overall, 14 percent of all men 15-34 who died in 2011 were murdered."  In Portland, Oregon, reading the Oregonian, it seems that the two most likely places for a black person to die is outside of a strip bar or on their own front porch.
Trump said among the neo-nazis, white supremacists and KKK members demonstrating there were some very fine people. He's a racist, plain and simple.
What I remember about that 4th down and 2 play was Pete Carroll's arrogance / stupidity(much like we saw in the Super Bowl when he called for a pass instead of a run and we all know what happened) by having Reggie Bush on the sideline and  asking LenDale White to try to ge the first down with a run up the middle. Even if  you are not going to give the ball to the obvious(Bush) at least have him in motion / a distraction who needs attention. Carroll cost his team the championship, not White.  One of the dumbest calls in college football much like the call in the Super Bowl.
It is hard to have a conversation about race with white people that are proud in their ignorance. This country has been a giant affirmative action program for people that Europe didn't need or want. Equal rights are a demotion for white people. The folks that elected Trump know their most valuable asset is their white skin. I wonder if Trump will pardon Dylan Roof. I'm sure his voters won't mind. White people invented the race card when they decided being white was more important than being human.
But "All Lives Matter" would also be an obvious and therefore pointless slogan. None of the Black organizations named espouses one race over another. Black Lives Matter is a response to the American criminal justice system which is racist. I might add to my contention that Donald Trump cannot change the fact that the U.S. is a multi-racial, multi-ethnic society, an additional fact: not all racism is the same. I'm white and I discriminate against whites. I wouldn't hire a white person who I knew to be a Trump supporter. These are the whites that are stinking up the country with their idiocy. I'm embarrassed to be associated with such people merely by function of my skin color. And all the ooga booga tribalists grunt, "race traitor"!  Even lackadaisical vetting could have avoided this humiliation. LOL, Americans allowed Donald Trump to be their president!
You make a lot of assumptions, Steve, but can you point to any acts taken by this administration that were taken with any intent but to make the country better?  Trump tries to improve the country, and you want to divide it and attack it.  I don't know who organized what in Charlottesville, but what were there a couple hundred of them?  Wow, sounds like 1968 all over again.  Please.  Those liberal halcyon days of having something real to protest about are long gone, Steven.  Those evil, straight, White Christians vote for Black, homosexual and non-Christians  all the time.  You're protesting a myth.
You can afford to be in denial.  It's unlikely some drunk redneck with a grudge will come up and shoot you for looking "foreign" (as 'foreignness' is perceived by white supremacist Americans).  And that this was a case of 'mistaken identity' because--judging from the victims' names, national origins and relatives' modes of dress--they were south Asian Hindus rather than "middle eastern" Muslims doesn't really change anything for the guy this idiot murdered.  Some of us, however, can't afford the luxury of denial.  I damned sure won't turn my back on you, if I can help it...
@Micheal Morrow   "..Mormon minority membership remains miniscule" I think you mean minuscule. However the Mormon church is quite successful recruiting non-whites. They have hundreds of thousands of members in Mexico, Brazil, the Pacific in particular.  Ironically, while you might be slightly more open to a progressive form of Christianity, 91% of those types - mainline churches - are white. That's a problem, for them.
You might want to distinguish between the groups that comprise the poor because the poor who aren't white won't be voting for Trump.  U.K. voters were bamboozled. The current political situation here and abroad does not call for protest votes--they may feel sexy and rebellious but they're mainly stupid ways to use the vote. Obviously, the Trump people represent the worst sort of mentality so they'll do what ignorant white supremacists have always done. Anyway, today's smart voters hedge their bets and vote for stability. People are kidding themselves if they think they want the alternative. Watch Europe from here and feel lucky. Then laugh at Trump and his idiot followers on Nov. 8th.
Well excuse us for being confused.  The President won  an election despite  desparaging every minority group.  until recently he had a known white supremacist as a lead advisor (Bannon) and Stephen Miller is still writing his speeches. his response to Charlotettesville was to side with racist Nazis who were chanting dispicable racist slogans in a public space.  he pardoned Sherif Joe (a known racist).  and now attacks black athletes (calling them Sons of Bitches) for protesting racial injustice.  It's really hard to not see him, and all those who continue to support him, as bigots and racists.
I don't think that the point is that violence is wrong.  Who would not agree with that?  Giving credence to white supremes by allowing their vile hatred to go unchallenged or by mixing apples and oranges is simply not right.  These groups seek to undermine American values and do so openly and when they are given an out by the president by implicating those pushing back is wrong.  These white neo-nazis are full of hatred and must be challenged.  The white supremes perpetrate violence and keep in mind that words can be violent.  The statues have become symbols of these angry misguided people.
You, Sir have one short memory.  You bumped your head and forgot about the Tea Party movement, protesting W.  Bush -oh really- bunch of old  rich guys started that movement, which begot the Birthers movement, ala King Trump of said movement, which begot the Alt-right, which was very much apart of the Trump campaign.  You, Sir ain't got no clue to the truth!   Trump not a racist, rofl!  "Don't freak out" you tell me!  No I ain't black, but I'm a woke white boy!  Don't blame me for you being blind!   Jesus is a glorious God and he shows me the truth, and revels the darkshadows of the lies before me!  Get right with the glory and you will see the light!  We are brothers and sisters the dark and the light!  We must pray forgiveness for the sins the we do and the lies that we make! You defend Trump and say I read too much into it???  I'm trying to show you the truth!!! We all sit blind to the truth and we all spend too much time looking stupid!  Find that truth!
Oh no! I totally agree with you! There are white supremacist bogeymen under our beds!
60% of poor people are white, yet you say that Planned Parenthood clinics "are "conveniently" and "coincidentally" located near low income black and latino neighborhoods." I would imagine that 60% of those clinics would be located near low income white neighborhoods. You don't acknowledge any of this. Innuendo seems to be one of your trollish tricks, along with sucker-baiting and switching sides when you feel like it. Your false implication that PP clinics are exclusively black and Hispanic (come on, you only mention black and Hispanic) is innuendo, implying only black and Hispanic women get abortions, get them at PP, or that PP only serves black and Hispanic women. That isn't true, it is false, it is innuendo intended to slur black and Hispanic women, and it is slimy.  You seem to think that repeating your falsehood endlessly will make it true.  It will not.
(e.g., if she were a white person of privilege),? What exactly is a white person of privilege? Are white now part of Affirmative Action? When did whites become part of the protected classes? If she were white and stole an identity, she'd already be deported. How many entering the country illegally are white? Seem to me those should be the first to enter, if white privilege is so rampant, and no other races have a change.
The inquiry's only mandate is to absolve native men and to blame white people ( white men) for decades of  harm  done to indigenous women. If  the inquiry fails, it will be blamed on white people.  No matter what direction it goes,  natives themselves have already decided they have no responsibility for what they do to each other.
Is Paul Bernardo next? He had a rough childhood, didn't he? Must be some white guy's fault. Keep the money flowing, JT.
When Resident DUMP is REMOVED from office, I will once again actually fly my American flag. Until then, it's to remain down.  My decision has nothing to do with the outcome of an election. BLOTUS continues to threaten everything that is/was GOOD about America, and instead, is working daily to destroy this country with racism, hatred, inequality, white supremacy, taking away civil rights - and even taunting us into WWIII.  When we get that "son of a b—h" off the field, I will raise my flag. Until then, my flag is IMPEACH.
Yep the white supremacists must being going crazy knowing that without their guns they'll get their butts kicked.
Where did this insulting stereotype come from? The black-as-criminal image has been with us at least since the nineteenth century, when explicit racism portrayed African American slaves’ essential nature as ignorant and savage, in need of the “civilizing” influence of the white man.  At that time little black crime actually occurred, as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled, and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the slave owners, who acted as judge, jury, and executioner.   On average, an African American man, woman, or child was hanged, generally by a white mob, once a week, every week between 1882 and 1930, as police actively participated or stood by and condoned the murders.  Lynchings continued until the 1950s, as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like “disputing with a white man.”
Trump is an admitted white supremacist and eugenicist.  And he's a buffoon, …and a traitor.
Name me any group of so-called citizens that all act responsibility??  Problem is now, thanks to gutless, dishonest liberals "some" citizens are able to hide their hateful, criminal, etc, behavior behind color, race, religion or immigration status and it's a fact that it certainly isn't a majority of whites getting away with it.  Minority Repubs/Consv are treated both cowardly and despicably by liberal blacks and whites-FACT!!  Listen to CNN, MessNBC, etc, with their rhetoric about mediocre Negros cozening up to Trump.  Imagine anyone else saying that? A hateful bigoted liberal black did! And I don't have to expect better behavior from myself, I've more that carried my weight, taxpayer, etc.  And about you & yours being  all that good citizen stuff.  Shouldn't you be??  What need medals for being a good, decent, etc. American??  We give out to many pats on the head, and meaningless trophies for just being good! Showing up! Look at racism in your NAALCP, they don't except Consv blacks!!
Good plan!  We need to stop letting all those (non white) foreigners steal homes from (white) Canadians.  Only (white, 3rd generation or longer) Canadians should be able to buy homes.  We need to BAN the purchase of detached houses in Canada by all (non white) foreign slanty eyes.  It's not fair to (white, Christian, Anglo) Canadians!    I say go one further and have Ottawa immediate DEPORT any (non white) foreign slanty eye from Canada!  The (slanty eye) foreigners are destroying our (white, homogeneous, sloth ridden) country!
I'm pretty much a redneck, pretty much a "hang 'em high" conservative, but this controversy is stupid. We (white anglo-saxons) took the place from the then locals. You can't, (unless you're nuts), be  true friends to, and respect, people, and steal their country, destroy their culture, and pretty much relegate them to the human scrap heap. ""We'a culpa". But what the hey, We're not going to give it back, and you know it. The woman has the right to her opinion, and, let's face it, she's not wrong. Also, all this politically correct nonsense is really getting tiresome!
I see your logic -- because a white man killed people in Las Vegas, it means that Muslim terrorism should be ignored.    Brilliant.
Silence is complicity. Pointing out equivalence, when there is none, is offering a defense.   Trump didn't know the facts on the ground, even on Tuesday. If he had, he'd have known the entire congregation was composed on white supremacist groups. No nice people there, just violent fools.
Don't want to leave anyone out.    Sandy Hook Elementary School - children murdered by a heavily armed JEWISH white guy.  There fixed it for ya.
Elected by 60 million "white supremacists, eighth grade dropouts , and gun nuts", huh? We ARE in danger, you elite intellectual lightweight. What a dopey comment.
The comment by an unknown who calls itself skinnerAK, asks: "Alcohol fueled, as usual?" Nothing in the story mentioned booze. But this person did. Which leads me to my own racist question; Are all white men child molesters who kill their prey?
one is a lovely lady....the other a wookie, with a serious attitude problem and a hatred for ALL Americans...especially white ones....so where is any real comparison?
Let me guess, you're a white male, and although you are frequently accused of being racist, you deny this.  Just a guess.
I agree with the ACLU defending the rights of the Charlottesville White Supremacists to protest in the manner they have.  It is their mission to protect "free speech" as currenty defined by the law.  I think, however, that the hate speech of the White Supremacist movement, the KKK and Nazis and Neo Nazis should be made "unprotected speech" and legally banned to the extent they call for removal, harm or disenfranchisement based on race or national origin.  It is hate speech.  Just as "get rid of white people" is hate speech, so is "get rid of everyone who is not white".  This whole Charlottesville fueled situation will hopefully lead to dynamic, pragmatic, and common sense based changes to American law as permitted by the constitution.    Freedom and Liberty are simpy inconsistent with the espousal of the idea that others should be denied freedom and liberty based on the color of their skin, national origin, religion.  To ensure one, we, as a nation, must prevent the other. . . .
I am not a racist because I am white, pal.  I am just light skinned.  Your bigotry is well noted in here now.  Are you proud to be that way?  Try some white paint if you can't handle it.  Otherwise take your remarks to the dump. Hating on white people will get you nowhere.
Your analogy fails as does your argument.  Trump did not run on the basis that he is a white man, he ran on the basis that he represents everyone.  Obama ran on the basis that he is a black man and the time had come for a black man to be President.  Obama is the racist, not me, I could care less what race a person ascribes to be.
You see how trumpf people dissappear. Hmmm. No more Conway,now Spicer. Watch as he will get boot. It's the Shell game folks. A sides how in the Bizzare Carnival. So much coming and going thru the tent. Tillerson is off in the world? Does trumof know what he's doing? You know his staff is like 45% vacant right. FLynn was an example of disorder. Trumpo got slapped in the face by him. Then ryan suck er punch trumpo with the ACA thing. PUNCH THE CLOWN IN THE BIG TOP. STOCKS UP, GOOD SIGN, BILLIONAIRES MAKING BUCKS. THE 85% white uneducated males, well they got medicare,lol.
Just another insecure weak white guy, threatened by women and minorities. Yawn. You're a dinosaur, buddy.
I have to agree with local media here. Neither of those statements are racist whatsoever . But the fact he twisted it and played the racist card is pretty much expected. Minority’s have all the power . They can be racist by calling white peple racist and it’s okay. But muslims are the biggest racist around .  Just look around the world. Muslims are at war everywhere over race and religion. Everywhere. So for a Muslim to play the racist card. Would only work in Canada. Pathetic
The Charter also says it isn't wrong to discriminate against white people or men.  An official copy should be printed on truck stop toilet paper and displayed at the House of Commons to highlight the message that "it isn't good enough to wipe your &$$ with".
I agree, violence is not the answer. Violence plays into the hand of the neo-nazis and white supremacists. The best way to oppose these misguided individuals is to show up in greater numbers and laugh at them. Peacefully laugh them into the dust bin of history where they belong.
One guy shot up planned parenthood. One guy shot up a church. One side has been preaching the politics of if it white it ain't right.  Your feeble attempts to try and pin this on the jewish community cause Trump so idiotically did it, doesn't actually make any sense. This has been happening world wide for the past few months.  What is the motivation for the jewish communtiy, the idea that they are attacking themselves with absolutely no evidence is silly at best and neo-nazistic at worst.
OMG, unbelievable that white males like Scat here could possibly believe criticism against racism, sexism or even discussions about equality are equivalent to the hatreds meted against people of colour, Muslims, women, etc. (mostly by white males).  Pathetic #WhiteMaleTears.
misinformation - gimme a break.  he is just a pure racist, you not white your out.  for you to defend him is ridiculous,   he does not need to know what standing the Filipinos have, they are brown, that it.   by supporting him your contributing to his racism and those whites who want to make America white again and you will be cast aside like an animal.
What a lame commentary meant to attack conservatives by blaming them for Antifa attacking them. Berkeley protesters were conservatives and not racist white supremacists. And the headline is such BS. Antifa is not a gift to anyone. They are a threat to democracy period. The gift is people like Clarence Page trying to deflect the threat of anarchists onto people he disagrees with politically. It's the democrats who yell about white supremacists (rightfully so) and are silent about anarchists. The left is really getting sad in their hatred for Trump when they'll take advantage of extremists that attack their political enemies. I hate to tell you this, but middle America sees what the far left is doing and continues to do.  No matter how bad Trump is, the left is proving they're worse.
Ahhh..."lilly white" - an undeniably Racist term. I can only assume you are not only a Negro, but a Racist as well.
Well if John Elway is so miserable in his draft choices, what do you have to say about other teams that failed to draft Russell "The Shrimp" Wilson and Dak Prescott. For God's sake, the Dallas Cowboys selected Dak Prescott. If anything, the Cowboys are nothing but a disaster. Prescott has played well but it looks like Ezekiel Elliott is having his Achilles tendon pinched as the NFL dips Elliott in the waters of punishment. Of course, Jerrah Jones will squawk. After all, it's not okay for your star running back to beat a white woman unless you play for Dallas, "America's Team."
the demonization of white men has gone well beyond absurdity in western culture but I neither need nor want a white nationalist like Gavin McInnes speaking for me. If white men and their cultures were as evil as the snowflakes would have us believe, the peoples of the world wouldn't be risking their lives to come here.
What was there to "debate" internally at the White House to denounce in unambiguous terms the actual ONLY side at fault: the derplorables that are the white supremacists?   How much that might affect Donnie's approval numbers?   Sickening. Disgusting.    And Bannon, Gorka, Sessions and Miller must go. And there had better be no pardon for that awful human being Arpaio.
I am surprise she still in office after her tweet about trump should be assassinated she should have resigned or step down and the press should have gone after her, but they will not do that because she is black, remember the other lady who was in office, the one who said Michelle Obama looks like an ape in high heels they went after her and she resigned because she was white, that's how racist the news media and this black woman are.
History suggests it will be Muslims who will take the place of White Christians.  I need not tell you which sex.
All of you white folk #trump supporters have the audacity to make comments and judge and you don't have your facts straight. Let's keep it real....you're upset because a black woman #OBAMA is in charge and running things and you don't like it.....wait.....are any of you black.....thought so.....carry on.....    Take off your WHITE hoods, reveal yourselves, know the facts before spewing your ignorance and feces about the internet. Don't you have a rally to attend?  #trump #kkk or something????  Shall we meet for coffee and chit chat?  Let's go.......I'm in!!!!!
My niece wanted to go to Stanford. Like many young people, she was qualified. She also had several internships on her application courtesy of her step-mother's position as dean of biotechnology, so she got in while others didn't.   While attending, and bombing at her first major, she met the love of her life. This young man is bright and talented, like my niece, but he majored in something silly. After graduating, he attempted to get into graduate school in computer programming, but was found wanting on his merits. Thanks to his step-mother-in-law, he was able to do a biotechnology training program and land a job at Genentech. While working there, he made the most of his talents and interests and is now doing computer programming, with an offer to have graduate school paid for while he works with admission guaranteed.  And that, friends, is white privilege. There are no black or Hispanic people who have those family connections that can make careers from whole cloth.
Only white people?? B.S.  In Every Aspect of the law? Also B.S.. Even the constitutional revisionist left of the bench are not that reliable. Close but not in every aspect. Those on the right can be counted on to follow the constitution. That's what I want in a SCOTUS.  A traitor to his race??!! What a racist statement. He is supposed to ignore the law and give you a ruling you like based on his race? A race you two share perhaps?  B.S. That doesn’t make you a jurist but an activist.    4 to 3 the SCOTUS determined that its ok to be racist and treat someone based on their race.  So I guess Kennedy, Breyer, and Ginsberg were traitors to their race? No of course not. Perhaps misguided but not traitors.
Diversity scares white nationalists. Can you see the fear in some of these posts?
I was glad to read that I was not called an imbecile, ignorant, and the rest (but the day is young). To answer your question, I would guess because I cannot recall any city where there is a concentration of whites killing whites, proportional to black on black murder rate in places like South Chicago. The drug cartels and Mexican gangs also propagate senseless killing, but they do receive a lot of exposure as well.
Really, Ebes?  Trump has white supremacists on his staff.  Obama had zero Islamic terrorists on his.
Where are Obama's thoughtful comments about blacks killing white cops?
it's PATHETIC the white trash of this country actually voted for this Hitler wanna-be. ITMFA
I always wondered what it would be like to see the writing of a complete fool willing to demonstrate pathological lying at its most vile.  You have succeeded beyond any psychological interpretation.  The daily tactics of the Tory/Republican/Fascist/Nazi/White Supremacist horde willing to use any artifice to destroy all human rights under the U.S. Constitutional Republic.  Disgusting.
The new Nazis show their true ideological colors intended to force pure fascist dictatorship on the nation.  This racist, White Supremacist creep being paid by the federal government spews anti- constitutional, pure evil right out of the Nazi playbook.  Boot him and the rest of them out now.  Time for a massive recall and impeachment of these black-hearted purveyors of pure evil vomiting their daily doses of militant treason.
That is a ridiculous statement.  I am a white woman married to a full blooded Tlingit Indian.  How dare you insinuate that I am basically a whore for my children.  My husband and I have been married for over 20 years and have 4 children together.  We have both worked the entire time and support our family.  All of our children have jobs and work hard.  The reason that I married my husband is because I love him and we compliment each other.
Once again, and again and again, a whole raft of comments from the "smart, white men" someone with the moniker "3rd gen AK" referred to on these poor Civil Comments pages as "Earth's Alpha males"  making dumbass remarks about things they know absolutely nothing about. Laughable nonsense, all of it.
wow, where to start! first, my name is P.J. Griffin, obviously you can find me if you want, im not afraid of a message board. I didnt know that I needed to sign up under my name or else editors of the paper would call me a coward, I would assume you have better things to do, but ok. I guess im sorry for saying 'I' instead of 'my friend' but there is a character limit. I could give you an inventory of the violence and crime I've seen in E. PDX, but thats not really the point is it? (also, if you find me, you can probably find out why my mom would kill me if i was on 122 that night. I went home, he went to the bus stop. I still have a bit of survivors guilt about that night, all these years later) I got robbed in Eugene once, so does that make me ok now? I saw some americans of mexican descent beat up some white kids when i was 12 in Newberg, but somehow i dont assume that all 'mexicans' like to fight white people, imagine that!
whites need to be expunged
Attention stupid brain-dead retards: The standing argument is that cops kill blacks because cops racist. That means that your moronic "adjusting for population" claim is bogus because if cops were killing out of racism, they wouldn't be killing any whites--let alone twice as many. Pull your head out!
The only real racism anymore the what white students face to prevent them from getting a practical education. Successful white students are to be road blocked any way possible  because their own initiative to learn is considered hate crime.
It's a little late for Canadians to whine about foreign investment when we let the US rape us the last few decades... Or was that ok since it was white Americans doing the raping?
“Frustrated White Man”  There’s an ideology  The press has been using this ideology to justify how an idiot like Trump got voted into office.  At the end of the day, this is all Obama’s fault: after he was elected twice, Frustrated White Men everywhere could no longer count on the racist patriarchy to empower them. So they turned their frustration on other white people.  People please! This white(trash) on white(trash) crime needs to STOP. Or your country will be overtaken by women AND visible minorities, like in Canada.  To the Redoubt!
Trump has associated himself with right wing hate groups.  It's also a short walk from exploiting the resentment of white men to feeding it. Even beyond Trump how much does the GOP itself depend on the racist minority for electoral success?  The Republicans who waltzed into power with their dog whistles now are led by birther in chief who can't bring himself to criticize these racists.  There are too many well placed facts for you to cry nonsense.
Probably the same way a lot of people on these boards think the GOP reviles minorities, immigrants, women, poor people, gay people, really anyone who isn't an old white man.  Be pretty helpful if we all stopped asserting the caricatures we've drawn of others as unassailable fact.
Betcha ten bucks that many of these victimized white men also scoffed at the #MeToo protest that is going on to highlight sexual harassment. If you are the white prick who is some hateful mutation of Archie Bunker and you want the workforce to revolve around you, you deserve your feelings of discomfort.
Today white supremacists and the KKK lean Republican.
FEMA was still involved in helping Katrina victims almost 10 years after the hurricane. As usual, twittler has absolutely no idea what he's talking about, other than he's not very keen on helping non-white people. Because he's a racist. A huge, ugly, hate-filled racist. One of the worst in the history of the planet.
These 'fans', apparently, voted for a misogonistic, racist white supremacist fascist.  I don't have much sympothy for them and, frankly, they don't deserve a team that's as enlightened as our Bronco's are.
The threat isn't just terrorism.  There's plenty of racism where I work and it's not the white Christians - it's mainly the Muslims that don't respect womans views, or anyone they view as subordinate to them. It's also about what kind of society do you want to live in. Preferring free, open, fair & equal isn't unreasonable.
Thanks for seeing the light and denouncing Antifa as the thugs they are. Hopefully, it is sincere, not just a public dodge for purposes of throwing the FBI off of your scent. As for the KKK guy, all KKK are white supremacists, whom I have already denounced. Sorry if that was somehow not clear to you. Finally even WaPo reports the truth that has been available for everyone with eyes: Antifa is a violent and dangerous group, with willingness to use violence and intimidation at its core. We don't need anyone supporting their actions. I don't understand why police apparently have not arrested those involved when they broke up fights. We'll get rid of the neo-nazis and white supremacists (probably never all, but most) through public dialogue and reason. Or jail them if they get violent.
The sad truth is that the current GOP base cares much more about being white than being Americans. The Democrats might have done more for those "poorly educated" white folks if the Republicans in Congress had not decided to obstruct anything that might help Americans for fear that Obama would get the credit. They are willing to sacrifice their poor relations for political gain. There is nothing Christian about that. I would pity those "poorly educated" white folks if they didn't think killing black folks would solve their problems. They are so ignorant that they can't follow the money. They think minorities and poor folks get more free stuff from the government than the 1%. Trump loves the "poorly educated". They are easier to con than the educated.
Facebook Allowed Advertisers To Target ‘Jew Haters’.png   Today, ProPublica published a bombshell report showing how Facebook allowed advertisers to select anti-semitic categories to target certain users. Facebook apparently has ad categories such as:  *Jew Hater *How to burn Jews *History of why Jews ruin the world  Really.    Well, if you are trying to target groups of Nazis, White Nationalists or just super angry white guys who want to dress in matching polos and khakis while carrying tiki torches, you may want to select these categories. And Facebook is totally there for you!  At the end of the day, Facebook is a business and their product is YOU, the user. They will take any money they can from advertisers, because that is their business - selling access to you. So if you are a Nazi, they will market that. And to the right company/group/political candidate/hostile foreign government working on behalf of a political candidate, that is what they are looking for - Nazis.
Have far-right whites matched the hatred and carnage inflicted upon Muslims by other Muslims?   We all share cultural affinities with nutters.  Best course is to do our best to deal with our own, because external interference in that clean-up operation is a recipe for conflict escalation on a scale that is best not repeated.
how about the natives giving whites syphilis?
Whites don't have to do anything to get their white privilege. No one follows you through stores. No one questions your motives. You even questioned my  motives. The GOP has become a white identity party. Most white folks voted for the GOP in the last 2 elections. Obama only got 39% of the white vote in 2012. The GOP is doing everything they can to deny minorities the right to vote, even today. It seems to me that a lot of white folks think I should be grateful to them. Where would they get that idea? I've been told that I should be grateful for slavery because I'm an American. I suppose I should be grateful that they used rape as a profit center too. You don't want to know about how much rape, robbery, and murder is done to give you your white male privilege.
I know the white peoples.  We're all sitting out this weekend to protest the black players pissing on the USA
Go get them! Get the bastards! The only time you know you are doing something really right is when the subject of your investigation starts to come at you with everything they have. So get the bastards. Get them for all of us who read in shock about a so called president who rules by fear, about a young woman who died just because she did the right thing, about Malooty and his dirty deals, about how the previous guys from Treasury were set up and fired. Tell the world about these Guptas, who are rotten to the core, who call black people monkeys but no one says it's racist except the media. Talk about the double standards in this so called democracy, where they brought in mercenaries to operate under a PR Bell Pottinger. Talk about crime so out of control it will be blamed on "white monopoly capital" because people who are incompetent hold the highest positions. Tell us more about the wife  with the sour face who is being pushed on us as a Gupta drone. Well done guys. Well done.
I'll see if this gets past the Civil Comments and ADN editor. This is a special message for Wasilla State Rep. David Eastman. From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a longtime and regular Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author. She is white.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
What a rag of a "newspaper." Constantly promoting division and hatred against men and especially white men for some reason, I suppose for click bait and the almighty dollar, rather than true social justice. The way forward is not to make every other segment of society feel better about themselves by telling them that "if only the white man didn't.........." and that white people are scum and should now be treated as second class citizens, nudge, nudge, wink, wink, but for society to truly become colour blind, including white people and just be people without some kind of qualifying modifying verb (white, black, asian, indigenous) before the word people.
From West Virginia to Michigan and every other state, people are rising up against a Congress and a White House that wants to codify economic inequality and structural racism through the federal budget.   We are rising up against a government that wants to steal the dreams of Dreamers and the hopes of millions of other people who want the federal government to be at their side, not in the pockets of the 1 percent.   We will be mobilized against this budget, and mobilized for a budget that actually reflects the priorities of all of us, not just Trump and his gang of white nationalists and oligarchs.
Will we let non-whites dress up as whites?  How about non-whites as other versions of non-whites?  Or are we all slotted into ghettos now?  It’s amazing how not a week goes by without some educators proving that they are the stupidest people on the planet.
>>Duke Charles Martel >>Are you a muslim Alceste? .  To that question, Alceste has a canned answer - "Are you a White Supremacist?".. or "At least I am not a White Supremacist?"  Either way - it is pretty telling how he feels about himself. And what does he equates being Muslim with.  Now, to the apprentice who would be given the task of "censoring" this post -  read twice.. Just because there are some words in it that may scare you into censorship, there is nothing offensive, or false in it, it is based on actual posts ( go search your database).
Jim ... I'm a black woman and the thing I want to say to all white people is to STOP letting that word "racist" have so much power over you. And stop apologizing. Refuse to let those thugs and bullies diminish you and who you are as a person. You know who you are and need not constantly state that you are not a racist or a white supremacist. What everyone fails to realize is that true racism is as ancient as the days. As long as there is evil in this world such things will thrive with evil people to foment it. So is calling someone a racist going to suddenly make them not a racist? Of course not! My advise is to stand your ground.
You cannot compare different societies. You have no idea at all how terribly the community and local communities are being crushed by this. They mayor and his cronies pushed this through. The Natives in this area did not want a liquor store. It is always the whites.
Our local Antisemitic attacks have well-known white supremacists behind them. One of the leaders appears to be a person recently released from supervision after a prison sentence for similar terrorist actions (among other crimes).  It's pathetic that Trump's followers would put this ridiculous false-flag notion forward. Anyone who watched Trump's rallies during the campaign season saw what he was unleashing. To deny it now is ludicrous. Not all Trump supporters are white supremacists, but pretty much all white supremacists are Trump supporters, and they feel very much empowered these days.
It's always amusing when people expose themselves for who they really are by relating their view  of human beings born different from the vocal majority as "misfits."  Anyone who isn't white, male, heterosexual, and can usually belt out "Jesus Loves Me," is subjected to their laser-like judgement of human diversity.    Given the chance to govern with such an attitude of inclusiveness, the U.S. under their loving guidance would soon be as strong and pure as 1939 Germany.
This country was founded as a white racist nation. The proof is in the original Constitution. Violence has always been at its core. What do you think the 2nd Amendment was needed for? The nation was built on ethic cleansing of the locals and race based slavery. The country has been a giant affirmative action program for people that Europe didn't need or want. We have been working on becoming "a more perfect union" ever since. As we move ever so slowly toward a merit based society, white male privilege is losing power. It is now illegal to kill black people while they are praying in church. That use to be one of the many white privileges that white men had. Lynchings are no longer considered family entertainment. There are photos. White folks invented the "race card" when they decided that being white was more important than being human. The good news is that younger people are generally less racist than their elders. In another 200 years, all lives may actually matter in this country.
The majestic walls of Ontario’s legislature are hung with portraits of the province’s political grandees, and it’s hard not to notice a certain similarity among them, chiefly in skin tone (pinkish), hair colour (grey to white) and chromosomal composition (that would be XY). This similarity does not escape the attention of a group of young women passing through the halls.  ---  Don’t let the trolls win.  So the feminist troll author, is extolling the virtues of ignoring other trolls.  The irony is thick and rich and oh so hypocritical.
Anti-racists say there is a RACE problem that can only be solved when the third world pours into EVERY White country and "assimilates."  What if I said there was a RACE problem that could only be solved if hundreds of millions of non-Blacks were brought into EVERY Black country? How long before people realize I'm not talking about a RACE problem, but the conclusion to the BLACK problem?  They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-White.  Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.
She won't get the white male vote, after bashing them for 35 years.  We don't need a liberal feminazi in the white house
A black guy spray painted "N____R",  KKK and swastikas on my house because I had a black room-mate.  When confronted he said us white folks have no sense of humour. Nope, no racism there.
Middle age white males are his target audience, no joke. It's on the front page because it bashes Trump...of course.
True enough.  Alas, for many conservatives the world can only be black or white, and Mr. Trump is Dubya on steroids.  Not only are you "against me" if you're not "for me," you're a loser and stupid and (choose your Trump invective here).  Hyperbole should no longer be tempered:  Mr. Trump is a "leader" in the same vein as Hitler and Mussolini.  Consistently deprecating (and increasingly openly violent toward) to those who not only disagree with him, but are doing their jobs (or not) as journalists.  Not simply a cartoonish narcissistic blowhard, but a rallying point for the ignorant, angry and uninformed.  There will be violence, and worse, coming from the Trump camp, I fear.  The Republican party created this monster in 50 years since Nixon (both their racist, misogynist, homophobic "core" and the individual now leading them), and when you sleep with dogs, you get fleas.  They have no idea where to scratch, which is both gratifyingly hilarious and frightening.
Silly boy....it's only sexism if the comments are directed at a woman.....similarly, it's only racism if the comments are directed at a non-white person.
I wish I could meet those white bread all American little assholes and show them what the "ghetto" is about. Grow up in the middle of no where and want to be a gangster. You know nothing, you've experienced nothing. Real drug dealers aren't shooting people over a 8th idiot. You'll find out real soon though.....in your orange jumpsuit, life ruined, nice virgin ass getting gang raped in prison, who's gonna be a gangster then little boys. Can't wait.
The Dems. Also made racist, sexist, misogynist, white supremacists, etc. popular words too.
Actually I would challenge that claim about insufficient cause. But your indignation that white people are the true victims of racism, a commonplace among conservatives, has long been evident.
When are you Nazi sympathizers going to stop trotting out this pathetic attempt to provide cover for the current connections amongst the right with white supremacists by pointing out things were different in the past?  Yeah, things were different in the past. Why would you think your pathetic argument would work? It doesn't. All it does is reveal your support for justifying white supremacy. You sure you want to wear that robe?
A lot of you forget that the latino refugees are fleeing the CIA created mayhem, terror and slaughter going on in South America right now. Not everyone is from Mexico. Go ahead and type, What is the CIA's role in creating terrorism"? Or "What is the CIA's role in toppling South America's governments"? I see not too many mention a wall to protect America from Canada. Meaning Canada is another colonial country stolen from the Natives by Britain and France, several more terrorism creating countries who depends on invading and occupying other countries, so a chosen few could leech off other peoples resources and lands like parasites. No one mentions Canada because the a lot of the people entering America are white skinned not brown. Got news for you, most of the terrorist attackers look blonde and white skinned and would not have acted if not for America's politicians thinking its still okay to steal other countries resources by trickery and invasions.
We don't need M-103. We have a Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  BTW is it white males who are requiring some Muslim women to cover their face and relegate them to the back door and women seating area of mosques? Is it white men who are arranging marriages for some women. Insert mail order bride comment if you like.
So the nastiest most irrational drivel is exempt from criticism as long as you call it an opinion piece?  I guess that lets the white supremacists and misogynists who write opinion pieces off the hook too.  Columnists are trying to support a position and it's perfectly for to call them out for incoherence, poor sources,  or a misleading use of facts.
Let me guess...a white boy that failed to take advantage of the educational and other opportunities that Canada provided to get ahead, so he now screams 'white genocide' because a white girl chooses to be with someone that did take advantage of the opportunities but just also happens to have a slightly different skin colour. In other words...a loser.
Evan J. Singh it only works that way when you're white.
You don't get it: clowns like Jacobson believe "citizen" and "white" are synonyms.
" the party of angry, old, white folks"???   Doesn't sound or appear rational to myself, it appears and sounds very racist. IMO your bad  Black, Face, Jim Crow, Uncle Tom joke is in rather poor taste. And of course that doesn't address the women in the republican party. However, when considering the actual racial composition reflected with in the republican party of Hispanic, Asian and Black voters. Your statement can only be interpreted as racist! But not really that surprising that you admittedly admire Hillary who btw commemorated late Sen. Robert Byrd as "my friend and mentor". When it's well known Sen. Robert Byrd was himself a KKK member and chief recruiter for the KLAN.
My wife is a white, native Oregonian. Is that good enough for you? BTW, when do I get to ask for proof of the good will of white folks. You seem to get that privilege with birth.
You are a racist; 'entitled Whites'.  No such thing bud.
Three quarters of the players in the NFL are black males , 6 percent of the population are black males. 21 per cent of violent crime is done by black males. 51 per cent of murders is done by black males. Maybe all the white fans should take a knee to protest the race problem because it doesn't seem to me the police are to blame.
Many Americans, including many who claim to be "christian," worship false idols. The golden calves they worship, are wealth, celebrity, and guns. Even the mildest suggestion that limiting civilian access to guns whose purpose is to kill as many people as possible as fast as possible is seen as a violation of the 2nd amendment.  The gun lovers have been fed a false narrative about the "dangers" they face to justify the gun culture.  The reality is that the average American is in greater danger from angry white men with semi-automatic weapons than they are from immigrants (lower crime rates than native born Americans), or from terrorists. The US rate of gun deaths is many, many times greater than all other DEVELOPED nations, on a par with some central American, African and mid-east countries.   https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/upshot/compare-these-gun-death-rates-the-us-is-in-a-different-world.html http://www.businessinsider.com/death-risk-statistics-terrorism-disease-accidents-2017-1
Well, the biggest idiot was the one in the car that killed and hurt those people.  That guy is going straight to jail and I'm sure he'll get the crap beat out of him, if he even lasts that long.  he was a White Supremacist, so no love lost on that pile of waste.
I'm no fan of Trump, but if he kills the TPP, I'm converted. BTW, if there's such a huge white supremacism problem, who elected Obama for 2 terms?
Interesting.  And yet the gang rape of a white female and her white boyfriend prior to their murders by a group of blacks is not considered a racially motivated hate crime. It also seems like Baton Rouge Sgt. L’Jean McKneely made a prejudicial statement.
The police arrest black folks for living on the street. Being homeless in Eugene is a white privilege.
So the measuring stick on how much the "White Terrorists" care for the poor is whether or not "we" are willing to pay for health care for them ?
You just learn to dislike Trump and his goon squad, and 60 million people who showed who they really are under cover of a vote--  arrogant, world bully mentality, women in the kitchen bare foot and pregnant,  and white supremacist lean more and more every day.  Everything you have always disliked but knew it was still around.
Asian countries for Asians.  Black countries for Blacks.  but White countries for everybody?  That's genocide.  Anti-racist is a codeword for Anti-White
In God we trust. All others, bring facts. So just go ahead and show me those statistics, SpenAK. I bet more white Americans cause flight diversions for threats like being drunk or failing to follow crew member instructions then anything you can find linked to Arabs. Your statement is pure fiction.
The amount of garbage dumping, poaching, meth cooking, and other negative actions on our public lands are good reasons for closing roads.  The good news?  If you walk in, there are no bozos in big trucks with guns and it's just you and the natural world.  After having a few threatening interactions with stupid white guys in big trucks with guns, I ONLY go on the roads that are gated, it seems they are also lazy and afraid to get out of their vehicles.  I say let's give the wildlife some habitat; I'm really sick of the attitude that public lands are only for humans- we are in the midst of the sixth mass species extinction and it is human caused; the biggest reason?  Habitat loss.  Let's wake up to that reality.
It seems that if there weren’t so many darkies in the country now, this whole discussion about white privilege wouldn’t even be taking place.
Crime in those cities is high.  White people are targeted for violence.  They are ultra racist cities.
Yet Blacks, who are only about 18% of the population commit more violent crimes than whites, who are about 60% of the population... - FBI crime statistics 2015.
Geoff, you sound like a racist. Do you have something against Indians? Your comments usually has racial undertones and favor a white narrative. Whites are also implicated in Gupta corruption saga, not only individual from the Indian sub-continent. If you can't find any corrupt whites tight with the Guptas, just look at South African history.  You living in the past.
Why shouldn't a black man be able to open carry without getting shot? After all, white intoxicated guys do it all the time.
The Bundy clan spread throughout the nation thanks to white privilege and the NRA.  Anyone belonging to or supporting these homegrown terrorists is equally a traitor to the nation.
Many Blacks in America believe they can't be racist because they are black. It is being taught in schools across America and here in Canada too, that only white people can be racist, and that all white people are.
How is it embarrassing being correct? I mean, you even went so far as to prove my point for me - whites commit more murders than blacks. What's the issue with that fact? You should be proud! WHites win!
Odd how after Trump was fake-elected on a platform or hate, xonophobia and similar, with white supremacist neo Nazis celebrating, installed a racist as AG, chose the racist head of Bretbart News as his closest counselor and started vigorously promoting nationalism, that hate activities have skyrocketed.  And yes, I know he has a few token Jews in his family.  Means nothing as more than a few experts have noted.
There is a difference between a person stealing axes and hatchets, assaulting a loss control employee, and then throwing those axes and hatchets at police and then charging them and probably wanting to die by suicide by cop versus a black man dying because of a simple traffic stop, or selling CD's, or running from the police and being shot in the back, etc. etc. etc. You can't blame for black people for being tired of racist b.s. and murder by cop. Turn off Fox news, open your brain a bit and maybe you'll realize not everything is black and white (no pun intended.) as much as us white folk wish it was.
I think anybody who understands just how deep the rotten rabbit hole of corruption goes will tell you, white priveledge exists, but is definitely not our most pressing problem. In fact, anyone who goes on and on about Gupta-speak terms like white minority capital just hasn't grasped the concept of an Elite class, black,white, yellow or orange running our country exactly like the mafia. I mean exactly. It's all about kickbacks and if you're focusing your anger on white people then I say you are a racist.
Apparently so. I didn't hear him condemning the white supremacists, nazis and kkk just some generic cowardly bs.
Obviously Edward McClellan is defying the odds.   As far as Interracial Crime goes:   Of the nearly 770,000 violent interracial crimes committed every year involving blacks and whites, blacks commit 85 percent and whites commit 15 percent. Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks. Forty-five percent of their victims are white, 43 percent are black, and 10 percent are Hispanic. When whites commit violent crime, only three percent of their victims are black. Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a white than vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery. Blacks are 2.25 times more likely to commit officially-designated hate crimes against whites than vice versa. As far as criminal Gangs Only 10 percent of youth gang members are white. Hispanics are 19 times more likely than whites to be members of youth gangs. Blacks are 15 times more likely, and Asians are nine times more likely.  That's the data.
If you are in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, California and you are looking for illegals what you gonna do stop little old white ladies?  You HAVE TO profile when looking for illegals.
And yet today it's the white supremacists who like your president - the Republican president, the racist president who feeds them. That stink isn't on your relatives, it's on you. It's not the past, it's today, and you seem ok with it.
Trump is a racist, …and a petty con man, …and a traitor. But back to the racist part.   That's what attracted so many of his supporters.  There is no longer any doubt that Mueller's office is investigating Trump for collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice in the Russia investigation, …it's just a matter of time now. Being rid of the racists in the White House will go a long ways to making all the other racists scurry back under their rocks where they belong.
Maybe Lassner is afraid that he would be fired if he took action against Herron.  What a sad case of an idiotic society where one race can say racist remarks towards all other races while being protected by punishing those who say racist remarks towards that race...in this case Blacks.  I don't see many other races being represented in the math department!  It looks like only whites and blacks want to "lazy" jobs that only requires one to "teach" the same thing year in and year out.
To get to the heart of the matter:  abortion is the issue which galvanizes support among these hypocrites as their rallying cry and justification for electing Trump and the conservative agenda generally.      I have seen staff writers for the NCR opine on this subject in ways that would justify a Trump victory before the election results were in.     A majority (60% according to latest stats) of white Catholics voted for Trump.     I  stop short of saying it is a mortal sin to vote for Trump, but then I don't wish to revert to the enemy.     Personally I am shocked and dismayed by the gullibility, stupidity and general moral malfeasance and hypocrisy of this majority of Catholics and Evangelical right-wing Christians generally. I read the Bible and Catholic teaching differently and see a lot of card-carrying self-justifying Christians refused at the Pearly Gates. Perhaps an "examen" of conscience is in order. Self-justifying religious fraud is the issue, and ignorance is no excuse.
Picking on white people it seems--give them a break-they built Cape Town.
SJWs are the most fragile little snowflakes.  Ask them what they want and you will find 'justice' means money handed to them so they can live the high life.  She is free to move to Pakistan, lots of room to champion womens' rights there, just watch out for the non white guys throwing acid in your face, better yet why not move to a reserve and work with her beloved natives there, oh wait she's not allowed there because she isn't native and therefore excluded.  The stupidity of these social justice warrior communists is not surprising given they are usually gender studies or indigineous studies grads, totally useless degrees, which is why this crowd hates science and math.  When will Justine Trudeau be going there to take a selfie with her while he scolds everyone else for being a tax cheat and not doing their fair share?  This stupidity infects our government which is why the likes of khan feel so emboldened.  She should be expelled.
Commenter writes "Allen does not understand that there were no more slave owners after April 1865"   What an appalling statement.  Who gave white people the right to subjugate blacks to begin with?  During the ante bellum period white slave owners travelled with their slaves all the time.
What really bothers me is all these folks complaining that Blacks are excluded from high performing whit schools ..... why don't the Black Families create a high performing Black School that whites wish  to attend?
There is no Pride anymore, only Shame. She is a hate filled racist and homophobe. She hates the gay white men who created Pride in the first place and is determine to steal it for her own political ends. If the thousands of gay men of Toronto stop supporting Pride she will hate them even more. All she will do is destroy it  if she stays on this path of bigotry and division.
White man kills three Latinos   Killer described as nonchalant, or showing no concern.  Trump nonchalant too,  shows no concern, keeps silent.  That silence speaks volumes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTDvh5IiPPo So many of the protesters are not the stereotypical white Anglo Saxon racists, as is always the implication of such stories, but immigrants from eastern countries, Hindus, Buddhists and various brown skinned people who know first hand what living amongst Muslims is all about. Many are in Canada precisely because Muslim violent aggressions drove them out of their homelands.
Trump cont - Pulled strings/paid to have current wife jump to the head of the line over others who'd been legally waiting for years for citizenship - Sued multiple times for fraud, sexual harassment etc. - Believes it's ok to sexually assault women; enjoys "grabbing them by the pussy" - Believes it's his right to walk into teenage girls dressing rooms unannounced   - Used money donated to his "charity " to pay off legal settlements, buy self portraits and other personal items -LIED about Clinton being "fired" from Watergate (per Snopes.com) - Has consistently LIED about Clinton in order to further his goal of becoming a dictator.  - Proven Pathological liar - Has installed proven white supremacists and Xenophobes as Cabinet members and part of his inner circle - Refuses to disclose income tax returns showing ties to Russia - Using the Presidency for personal financial gain - Refuses to put assists in a blind trust -  Lied about Flynn -  Repeatedly breaks Constitutional Law Cont.
"...whites who kill black people are 10 times more likely to win a 'stand your ground' claim than blacks who kill whites..." Wait, so this GOP-NRA push isn't so everyone can defend himself or herself, it's so whites can kill blacks with impunity? What a shock!
Somebody needs to do something about these crazy white folk.
Actually the article says it was a sophisticated call made to look like it came from within the building, similar to the 13 other calls to Jewish centers on Monday....in other words it was a form of terrorism against Jews across our Nation on Monday....could be white anti-Semites or just as likely, Muslim terrorists.
This kind of adults forcing kids goes on a lot.  This time it made news because it was a sympathetic little white girl.  I taught for over thirty years and have seen coaches (football primarily)extol pain and inflict it in practices to prepare young boys for the pain they will feel in games. Talking heads even extol 'playing through the pain' and fans boo when a player will decide for himself when to sit out rather than go back in.  This is one of the few cases when being a white male in america can be a disadvantage. It's very similar to sexual abuse with adolescents.  We snicker and give light sentences to adult females having sex with underage males, but are horrified if an older man who diddles little girls and give him decades in prison.  Sexism at its most hypocritical.
The sad part, most of the "white" people they take aim at, were never involved in any of those sins. They arrived in the USA in the early part of the 20th century, to their own pains and racism. The difference? They decided to defeat those against them, by succeeding on their own merit, and it worked. Now their grandchildren are paying a bill that they never created anyway.   There is no end to the stupidity of the left.
I have to laugh at you. So you believe that Planned Parenthood ignores serving 60% of poor people, and serves only poor blacks and Hispanics. Really? Our nation's largest women's reproductive health organization is ignoring 60% of women in need of health care and affordable contraception? You really believe that? Fine, but here you are trying to convince others of what you believe is the truth, without an ounce of proof. Without proof that Planned Parenthood is ignoring all the poor white mothers and serving only black and Hispanic women, you won't convince me or anyone else with a functioning brain and a dose of common sense that you know what you're talking about.  Here's AT:  "They are preying on poor people, the largest portion who are minorities." Two lies in one short sentence. PP is SERVING women with services they WANT and NEED; and the largest portion, a 60% majority, of poor people are white. You just can't get it right - your bigotry stands in the way.
There is plenty of pent up white pride.
You obviously know absolutely nothing about salesmanship.  Trump is a salesman.  Would you ever buy something from the cartoon character you have created in your mind and call Donnie Moscow?  How did this guy become a billionaire if he was your fiction?     No one would make multimillion dollar deals with your fantasy man.  Your fixation with "white dudes" borders on racist homosexuality.  Keep it in check.
This is idiotic.  White guys organize to pursue their interests just like Jews organize to pursue their interests...and blacks, etc. etc.  None of these biologically determined groups are better than others, they are all for themselves and against others.  This is what is "self-evident".  Why didn't these people care about the marchers in Tel Aviv chanting "Death to Arabs!"?  Or complain about AIPAC supporting a racist like Netanyahu?  The weird thing is to see, for example, Jewish or Black groups complaining about white supremacist groups.  On what basis?  They are just like these other groups which espouse anti racism but are racist by virtue of their mere existence.  Hate knows no race, it is present in any of these ethnically defined groups.  Guess who monitors hate?  The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish organization that finds anti-semitism everywhere.  Guess who holds white groups liable?  The Southern Poverty Law Center, another Zionist (racist) organization.  All hypocrites.
It doesn't fit the Post's race baiting and incitement agenda. The paper is thinking to changing their banner to "white people are evil."
white, angry, low education, fat, heavily armed yet terrified trump voter in chugiak, please go away.
White male, and your assumption is incorrect and rather insulting as well, as it should be obvious that what I wrote is intended to help as many as possible, and not perpetuate the cycle of death and rape inherent in the present situation.  As for the white privilege nonsense, spare me.  I'm not going to be unpacking invisible knapsacks any time soon.
Alaska has had a 'gang problem' since feral Europeans first showed up here.  Don't believe me, research Jack London for a fair description of the kinds of gangsters, murderers, smugglers and inebriates which "sanitized" history now reveres as "pioneers on the last frontier."  Richard Rhyner, O'bobo and their ilk's objection with the new wave of "pioneers" is that they're not "white".  Get over it.
Well said James, it might wake  up some naive folks as to the direction the country is drifting with the racist extremists latching on to the Trump campaign.    For more on this, see Jonah Goldberg's solid column today, a Conservative who is not afraid to credit  Hilary Clinton for doing what Conservatives should be doing--  soundly calling out the "alt-right" for its racism.   "But the one unifying sentiment (of the alt-right) is racism--or what they like to call 'racialism' or 'race realism".....  It's about "white nationalism" and "white supremacists", something  all decent Liberals and  Conservatives can unite against.
because this protest is based on the lie" hands up don't shoot". I don't believe the players are protesting cops killing white people, are they?
You mean the privileged white people?   I think Ms. Khan is simply one of those people that crave attention and get it by stirring up controversy where there isn't any. The fact that she chose to wear a head covering despite being brought up in a Canadian society is telling in itself. I know lots of observant muslims who fulfill their religious obligations (?) in a less in-your-face type of way. Also, why is she taking up the cause of the First Nations people? I sense it's because of the publicity of the residential schools and the 60's scoop. Taking a controversial stand on the banning of Canada Day celebrations in support of First Nations was likely to garner more attention than any suffering Canadian born muslims have undergone at the hands of privileged white people.
Duke Kahanamoku played parts that Hollywood mandated.  It is not likely he was given any option about the people he played.  Look at Hollywood in the 1920s to the 1950s and African-Americans were casted as native Hawaiians.  No one in their right mind would want to return to those days.  Back to days segregation, white only public facilities, Outrigger Canoe Club banning Olympians like Keo Nakama, the Pacific Club barring Asian membership, and so on.   Even the great world wide web produces so much historically inaccurate crap, that any idiot having a computer can put their own personal spin on history.  Just look at the Daily Kos article on the Niihau incident and you want to throw up.  If the producers of this movie ever do a movie on the Alamo, look out for Mexicans to lose in their version.
Agreed, when I was younger we were taught to try to look past skin colour, to look to the person inside, that was the goal.  Now the progressives and university teachers are obsessed with it, they scream about black this or white that 24/7 - we're going backwards.
"Am I black, white, brown, yellow or green?" Puh-LEEZ. Only complacent, in-denial white folks come up with such weasely, evasive nonsense to avoid admitting what they already know but are too ashamed to acknowledge, because this would in turn require them to admit they LIKE those white privileges and have NO intention of giving them up. You're no mystery to me, sonny.
Are you a White Guy pretending to be an Indian?
Never. You know it's only whites that can be racist....
When humans build cities on the moon, Caplan and socialistic parasites like him will complain white folks took all the good craters for themselves, leaving the lousy craters for black folks.
As much as you loons just wet dream about this being Antifa, it was a white guy with guns. Period. LV has more camera's than people, don't you think that one of those thousands of camera's would have caught something like that? Common sense man. It seems lacking from a majority of the gun totting coward crowd. And furthormore, as a CSU grad, I found this article important and touching, and the DenverPost has been reporting on the massacre. Now, maybe it's not the youtube video stories that you are looking at, but that's the biggest difference between professional journalism and someone sitting in their basement making a youtube video... and suckers like you eating it up.
Make no mistake----I and many others [eating breakfast at the university's cafeteria watching TV with about 45 others] WE SAW and HEARD President Trump call it, "Muslim ban".  Right from his mouth!!!! Kamala Harris REPEATED what he said.  I don't go on the Democratic talking points---don't have the time.  But I'd like to include here what one gentleman wrote who posted his ideas in our local city's newspaper Public Opinion page.  He stated "With the current mix of power and paranoia in the White House, patriotic Americans cannot simply sit and watch a "bloviating ignoramus," as conservative columnist George Will called Trump, make our democratic republic the laughingstock of the world."
“If Blacks would act Human there would not be a problem” (paraphrase)."--Just what are you saying here  Steven Hunnicutt 466? I think I know. Since you cannot possibly be so naive as to believe that the Civil Rights Act magically cured the virulent racism of many white Americans, I call you out as a low-life racist for what your post implies.
The thing that idiots like Milo fail to grasp is that Donald Trump won the election and he has inspired scared white guys to think that they are "Making America Great Again" by attacking non-whites. Bernie didn't win the election.
point taken. white trash is a racial slur.....and an attitude slur. if i wanted to dis a person just for being white it  -well i wouldn't cause i don't have a problem with it - i'm white. but most likely something like cracker..?  my concept of "white trash" represents a type of white person that exhibit certain beliefs that are , in a larger population, are widely to be racist and sexist.  i will divulge i do have a unfounded, immediate gut response to a certain dialect - first awareness of "that accent!"  a tape loop of biased slurs starts in my head. it is not related to color, education, age, gender, wealth.....it is just the accent and i can't pin it down.  it comes up in southern accents, but only one of the various sounding southern accents - all others are fine. being aware of myself, i can shut it down fast. i've had to check myself,  and work with people with that accent and i KNOW they are fine. it's me. and i don't know why. white or black doesn't matter - it's that accent.
If a white community had a problem with white meth heads killing, stealing and intimidating the residents, guess what, they would get the attention of the police.  If Asians were doing the same, they would get it.  You're complaining that police are tackling the problem of blacks and hispanics committing crime in organized street gangs?  You condone this behavior?  Unarmed black men are killed by police officers in .001 of all encounters, so your theory of them hunting down unarmed black men is null and void.  Paid leave is paid for an investigation, if that officer is found culpable, he is fired.  Why punish an officer in a righteous encounter and response?  Show me a video that hasn't resulted in exoneration or firing?  There - I answered.
White privilege! Critical race theory! It's all white people's fault!
TRUMP Trump Trump!!! Returning America to it's right full owners!  Honey, you are a defacto racist that is for brown privilege and brown supremacy and most likely are white.
Nazis and white supremacists enthusiastically supported Trump's candidacy, are emboldened by his election, were given high-ranking positions in the White House, a woman gets murdered by a white supremacist at a white supremacy rally (for which the president bewailed the violence "on both sides"), and for some reason NCR devotes column space to racism. Go figure!  RD thinks the tail end of Jim Crow were glory years for the African American community and that racism is a "manufactured crisis." He's just clumsier than most conservatives about revealing the ignorance and racism cultivated by the GOP ever since Nixon and the Southern Strategy. I said "Southern Strategy." Time for the crickets to do their thing.
I think this whole thing is ridiculous. For crying out loud, it's a name, not a lifestyle. The things people are offended by these days has gotten out of hand. I no longer wish to be called white, cracker, caucasian, or racist. I am a light skinned, person of the female persuasion. How STUPID does that sound?  I am a human being. Why can't that be enough? The name of the restaurant signifies nothing more than a seasoning, and food from a specific era, but it is a catchy title. Should we all boycott McDonald's because the name sounds Scottish but they don't serve Scottish food? How about Subway, their food has nothing to do with underground transportation. Does the name Texas Roadhouse offend Texans? See where I'm going with this. It is just too much! If the name bugs you that much, don't eat there, and stay out of it. The owner doesn't want to force their beliefs on you or erase your culture. They just want to feed you. How about we find something important to get upset over?
copied, pasted: The dubious Kalergi plan takes another hit. Personally I LIKE the differences between people & places. When I see a black girl I think is sexy for example, it's often the very darkness of her skin I find all the more sexy, and I am as white as Trudeau's face when he looks at the latest approval ratings. Thanks a lot so called open-borders-globalists, but I would prefer that we DIDN'T all mix together in some human stew that leaves everybody looking the same in 100 years; I like my sexy coffee black and would prefer it not all be served cappuccinos & lattes.
That's not why I called you a racist.  I myself support ant-racism.  I have said I support removal of Confederate statues, and that I think Lee should have been hanged.  I called you racist, not because  you support anti-racism, as I do, because you support the anti-white racism that is prominent in BLM.  So you lie.  Proven leftist bS/
Why are you suddenly making this about race? White Supremacist much?
White thugs conveniently hiding behind KPMG's shattered credibility. No one should be spared.
Ah yes, re-education! That's what us nasty white folks need.
I think that Lincoln would suffice as a hero and I was around when all of this rebranding was going on so I think I know a little about what I am speaking about. If you want to hang your hat on Nixon bringing in Southern racists into the republican party.  Think again Nixon brought in the voters that were disgusted that the Democrats brought to the table like the KKK, Jim Crow in the south. Yes, they were religious and yes they were conservative as far as racist or anti-Constitution you are wrong.  A hallmark of the Conservative agenda is preserving the Constitution, something the Democrats have tried to dismantle ever since it was written.   Regarding identity politics, clearly you are either unwilling to see what is going on around you or are ignorant. By dividing the country up into special interests Poor Whites, Blacks, Asians, Gays, Straights, Rich, Poor only serves to weaken us.
What you conveniently fail to mention is that fighting for "states and individual rights" meant fighting for white men's right to treat blacks as property, not persons, with the rights to abuse, maim, torture, rape, and kill the blacks as they pleased. This is the side Lee enthusiastically defended. There's no honor in that.
So you'd say whites are supreme, would you?
Last year, when BLM accused the entire white gay population of Toronto of disgusting racist bigotry against the black LGBT community,  nobody, not Tory, not Wynne, not Trudeau came forward to defend our long history of openness and acceptance of ALL people. That was tacit agreement with BLM that we as individuals and as a community are despicable. Even the CBC, CITY TV Globe and Star,  once our media allies , sided with BLM. As usual, we gays were tossed under the bus for somebody else's convenience. Who defends our rights to not be slandered and defamed?  NOBODY !
"Old white people"  Ageist and racist, but nobody will report you to to OHRC for it because it's acceptable. Only whites are racist, eh ?
So brown racism,  black racism are better?  Ever see another race or ethnicity working on a farm,  other than Hispanic?  Ever manage a farm in white racist Oregon? Where did the fruit tramps,  the Okies and Arkies go?  What became of them?   Ever  have to physically separate the Mexicans from the Laos people,   who the Mexicans call "Chinitos" ,  their slang for any Asian.   Dare you practice free speech in Dearborne,  Michigan,  and set up a curbside Christian soap box?  You tough enough to keep the muslims from beating you senseless in Dearborne,  you infidel!   Washington DC's city council is passing a regulation to make sure that African Americans own most of the weed outlets,  because right now,  whites have put  up the money,  made the investment,  to sell weed to  Americans in Washington DC. and only one outlet is African American owned.    That's racism by government in our Nation's Capitol.   "Diversity" is the code word, dog whistle,   for reverse racism,  sexism by the left.
"Working man"? How about working people? Maybe if all these companies from the lower 48 stopped bringing most if not all of their people from TX and LA up to AK instead of hiring Alaskans...(the white/black/asian/etc. people who actually work that is) then maybe our economy would be better. Am I racist? No I am not... it is not secret that native corps take and take whatever they are handed by the fed and state governments...AND THEY CONTINUE TO PAY NOTHING FOR ALL THE SERVICES THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF... ever been to a native corp office?...they do nothing, but get paid for "working"...been their twice...both times a joke! Seems like they are all in a fog... always have their hands out though! Isn't that Native Land Deal already paid for dearly? Seems like we are still paying for that... am I wrong? Nope! Do some research... how many grants from the feds does one actually need when making millions in profits! How pathetic! Pay for your own shit!
If white males are so sexist, how did Margret Thatcher, PM of England get elected?  If I recall, she got elected because she had a history of doing what she said she would do, not because she carried a ladies purse.
I think his father, also a white supremacist by the way, may have beaten him? Maybe that's why he's so horrible?
For decades, the Republican ideology has been blatant racism and self-aggrandizement  and the breitbart/bannon/koch school of white supremacism born from a lack of any human feelings and qualities....... .............. and it will remain so, because Americans are "poorly educated"
There is nothing to heal as I see it. A disgusting filthy P I G has been elected president and there are plenty of uneducated whites that are proud they voted for this P I G. I personally don't have time for disgusting P I G S or uneducated whites who vote for P I G S.
These people surely know how to con gullible white Canadians
Apparently your read well, but understanding is certainly not one of your strong points!!  Never challenge you or your family the way you have mine, with your continued "little man" hateful rhetoric!! Tried to point out there's plenty of bad, worthless citizens to go around, but your clueless butt is always blaming the other side, while giving your side of anarchists, environ terrorists, Islamist, black thugs, etc, a complete pass and still going after ole whitey.  Well here's a FACT hateful:  White supremacist, skin heads, etc, aren't attacking innocent citizens, burning, looting, attacking police, but racist blacks, snowflake college liberals, radical Muslims, paid agitators are; while the so-called leaders of the racist Dems/DNaziC stand silently by, cheering them on.  With citizens like you still running your hateful mouths about whites! Don't accuse my party of the KKK, Jim Crow laws, lynching, the problems in cities like Chicago, DC, etc, that lies with liberals. Your kind!
You brought up the KKK, not me. Yikes! If White Christians killed 53 people I denounce that. Can you come to yourself and denounce the Liberal/Democrats Hate rhetoric? The Scalise shootings, Kate's murder, etc. Can you denounce the black on black crime in Chicago which is probably 10x's more than the 53 every year. Democrats runs Chicago, years upon years innocent people live with gang bang Wars! Barry did squat for them for 8 years. The Democrats did squat for Chicago!
Indeed.  Hating everyone who is NOT a white, american, hetero, male who happened to be born in the US isn't hateful at all.  Rather, it is when you are not filled with such hatred that is the true racism and hatred.  Always a fan of the "I couldn't possibly be a racist, I totally know minorities..." paradigm.  Well done.
Neo-CONservatism resurrecting and revealing the true nature of the Republican Terrorist Party in all of its forms, nationally and locally.  The Republican national nominating system offered a group of white men competing to represent the values of Old South christian fundamentalism in all of its racist, bigoted, misogynist evils.  Each trying to cater to the White Supremacists and religious patriarchy idolators still infecting the nation since the Civil War and Segregation eras.  The Trump "winning" despite the worst female hatred ever seen in a candidate released the hounds of racist bigotry, coupled with Corporate Media slavering, salacious broadcasting, to make it all acceptable not only in private, but throughout the public discourse.  Every insane White Supremacist idiocy joined with religious anti-human dogma became acceptable.  Now, the ultimate Alaskan purveyor of it all is elected and allowed to fill the media and government with traitorous actions and language.  Disgusting.
Hillary Clinton: not a terrorist but the #1 choice OF terrorists, Libyan rebels, Iranian Mullahs, ISIS, Big Finance, Big Pharma, Big government and the Political Class, BLM (proven racists), illegal immigrants, and of course the anti-white/male ambiguously guilty self-loathing liberals.
White racism leaks out through the seams of an establishment race bigot.
And there it is. Our president is a white supremacist.
'The post cannot be racist because I dont see any racism in it, end of story'   How about the WW writes a story about how Oregonians of color are tired of having white people explain to them just how good they have it here, and how we should be so thankful, and how white people aren't racist.
If the shooter was a Muslim man, then Donald Trump would call him a terrorist and a ban on Muslim immigration. If the shooter was a Hispanic man, then Trump would call him a terrorist thug and a crackdown on illegal immigration. If the shooter was Asian, then he would be a criminal terrorist and a crackdown on Triads. If the shooter was black, then there would be a crackdown on gang members. If the shooter voted for Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, then he would be a political terrorist and a member of the Antifa.  Since the shooter was a white Christian male who taught bible school and an ex-member of the Air Force, he is a mentally ill man who needed help. No need for gun control.
So that mean that women better just get back to their natural purpose, makin' babies and cleaning the house?      What is helping our nation is the immigration of talented young people, many from Asia, comming to our nation attracted by the 'open' culture that doesn't demand for them to dance is wooden clogs, or wear shawls that cover their heads.        We're going to screw that up and sink with an aging population that is holding back nations such as Japan.     People who don't see immigrants as a potential positive to the nation are foolish.    *I support 'controled' immigration, not bigoted and racist banning of people who want to live in a growing and peaceful society.  The author is right, this is all about being a white America to people like King.  And if not King, just ask yourself if your happy standing next to cheering KKK members who clearly see him as 'one of ours'.
This article shows how most older, uneducated, white men in Merica ARE the problem!!! WHAT A LOSER  By the way everybody should read the third line in the real national anthem not the one that said in school and you will see that it's all about slavery you racist, loser,  old white man! Merica land of the stupid!
"...diversity is wrecking Anchorage"?  What's your solution?  Declare Anchorage a 'whites only' town?  And please tell you you were kidding about climate being a 'natural barrier to the dark-skinned folks that's only overcome by the promise of free PFD money'.  That's idiotic even by your standards.  For one thing, makes it difficult for you to explain all those dark-skinned folks how have lived here tens of centuries before there was a PFD.  Speaking of that, if anyone has the right to complain about newcomers' shortcomings, it's those dark-skinned folks who were here FIRST.  And they don't look like YOU, Richard.
now we have it......he's white, he's guilty.
"You are basing your opinion on a small pool of evidence and then extending it out to all law enforcement." Nope, never said all law enforcement in fact I said, " I have met far more professional and respectful LOE's than the playground bully type, then again I am a white male so I have that in my favor. Statistically it is true as well, that most cops aren't the "bad apples".. which is the exact opposite of what you asserted.  "And yes, I was LEO and then went to law school. What training would you suggest I am lacking?" That's my point, if you are a LEO and your training and the way in which you read the law makes you believe that police shootings are always justified, then your training fails you as well the people you serve.   Police must be held to a higher standard. LEOs former or current who deny there is a systemic problem are just as responsible for the mistrust of law enforcement as are the "bad apples" that keep getting away with murder.
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI!
BREAKING NEWS: NBC news is reporting that  Four black Chicago youths are being charged with the kidnapping and torture of a mentally disabled white teen in a Facebook Video in which they use anti Trump racial slurs during the beating/ torture process.
You're damn right. It's feckless to be willfully impervious to a dangerous ideology like ethnic nationalism, especially in a country with a violent, vicious history of white supremacy. The preponderance of the evidence strongly suggests not only that Bannon is personally inclined toward white nationalism but as editor at Breitbart bragged, "We're the platform for the alt-right."  http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/08/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-alt-right-breitbart-news  I did address the issue, and like so many of your fellow travelers, you stick your fingers in your ears and go la la la la la. You "remnant" helped elect an ignorant degenerate to the presidency, and I'll never let you forget it.
How so?   Are all Canadians white? Are all whites fragile? Whitefragility=all Canadians?  That said, there's a lot of white fragility I'm seeing around these parts. Seriously, why do so many people here care about this so much? Do you not see that you making her point for her when it comes to white fragility?
True. But MAGAMedia has been working on making white racism here acceptable, even commendable. We need to find ways to make racists uncomfortable again.   Having this fool in the WH playing footsies with them - even hiring the atrocious Gorka, Sessions, Bannon and Miller - is not helping.
Right.  When a black drug dealer shoots people, it's 'gang violence'.  When a Da'esh fanatic does so, it's a 'terrorist attack'.  But when a white supremacist murders nine black folks in a church, or seven Sikh worshipers in their temple, he's a 'crazy man.'  Explain to me how that works, James...
It's fun to joke about but don't kid yourself.  We are in the middle of a culture war and the left have shown their true colors,  Bernie red, and have stolen the minds of our youth.  AntiFa sealed the deal in the left's conversion from Marxist to Communist beliefs and violent tactics.  It will only get worse from here on out.  They will not be happy until the "white man" is punished for what they feel are crimes committed by our ancestors towards their own.  The victim culture created by our race-baiting former POTUS was done on purpose.  The red seed has been watered with hate and the tree of liberty is now wilting.
'Those white men'  'should be humiliated'. Who's the racist now?   Sounds like you want revenge?  You my friend or no better than they are.
Heaven help us, Mike.  Steve Bannon is the most unsavory looking character that I have ever seen.  White supremacy?  If he's an example, we certainly are doomed.
By the way, your map doesn't show any white neighborhoods, only black and Hispanic. You don't suppose that would reduce its credibility? It's on an anti-Planned Parenthood site aimed at black and Hispanic people. Dollars to doughnuts the site is run by white anti-abortion people.
Californians flying in to demonstrate "white pride." How very selfish and dumb. Being born a color should not invoke "pride." Your individual accomplishments should be your pride. White pride/black pride - it's just a desire to put race before humanity and divisiveness before love.
So, when a white supremacist label can't be conveniently pinned to a white shooter, motives suddenly don't matter because "terror is terror"?  If Paddock had had a facebook page full of links to neo-Nazi sites, I doubt very much Saunders would be arguing it doesn't matter if he was politically motivated or not.
To  - Stupidity-the_final_frontier  the population of USA is predominantly white so of course there will be more crimes buy White American Male  than  males from Middle east for example
No, republicans are far more likely to cheat, lie and persecute others who aren't white Christian heterosexuals.  Republicans through years of lies are turning this country into a fascist theocracy.
look at all those white racists fans in the picture ..... wow
Trump was right again. White power types are 5 guys in a clown car, and Antifa and its associated movements - including its alliance with BLM - are radical leftist, violent, international Marxist movements.
I know what the pundits all think about HRC losing 'working class whites'.  I don't think people have in their minds what that might actually describe.  I sure don't.  All races whose median income was under 50K voted strongly for HRC.  So these working class whites aren't exactly poor working class whites.    The polling was accurate for all we know until Comey came out with announcement of reopening the email investigation.  There were never enough national polls done after that to get a good feel for the impact of that announcement, and far less the weekend before the election when he came out again and said 'nothing to see here, move along'.  This was probably an even bigger trigger for the Clinton haters, as they would naturally think she got away with it again.  Trump's support had a significant portion of whites who voted for him because they couldn't stand HRC.  That is not an endorsement of Trump.  Unfortunately we will all pay the price for that kind of stupid voting.
What a bitter racist. Do you ever make a comment that does not have "White Men" in it. Sorry you were not born a White Man but you will just have to live with being Part White Man. Change your name to The Mighty Racist.
An intelligence community assessment firmly states that the Russians interfered, through both propaganda means like the theft and release of emails and breaching some election systems.   We have barely had a chance to assimilate this because of Donald Trump’s constant uproar.   It’s hard to concentrate when the President is threatening nuclear war and aiding and abetting Nazis and white supremacists.
Well, Rivers, let's take a looks at the connections here.  The horrors of Auschwitz were perpetrated by a powerful nation (Germany) against a minority people (Jews). The proper echo of that basic pattern (tyranny of the majority against a minority) in modern US politics is the Trump administration determination to remove/prevent entrance to specified ethnic/religious minorities.   But this moron appears to want to associate his group (white America?) with the persecuted minority, implying that the powerful nations perpetrating the atrocity is Islam? Mexico?   It's not just offensive to use images of sacred memories for political purposes, the message itself if inverted, perverted, profoundly anti-intellectual.   How do men like this get elected to the US congress...should the world tremble?
"Diversity" = White Genocide
If we are going to include "Honour" killings, why not other deaths by spouses? I'll bet more self-identified Canadian (white) rednecks have killed their spouses (to redeem their honour?) than Muslim honour killings in Canada.  Doesn't make either one right and domestic abuse of any type needs to be exposed and dealt.  However purposely trying to pin every sin on the "other" helps no one in the long run especially when it seems to be done to try and hide any culpability from "our" side.
I've read at least four articles this week about police lying about why someone was shot. Luckily there was video to show their lies. Maybe if you read more less racist sites you would know this. How about those teenagers in Texas that ran a black man over with their truck while shouting racial smears? BLM is not a terrorist group. They do not advocate violence unlike the people commenting here. And Richard? More white people kill white people. Where's your anger on that?
I'd rather have resources spent ridding our United States of home grown , executive office encouraged white supremacist terrorists
Ridiculous article.  As if the Conservatives have to pander to visible minorities who make up 20% of the population.  White voters make up 80% of the population.  That is who the Conservatives need to target.  Trump did and he was elected.
The war on people's choices and constraints continues. For decades men have been bashed, and paraded around as patriarchal totalitarian sexist fascist pigs, (and otherwise ignored in terms of failures that need addressing) but now we're "needed" to play White Knight in order to get their agenda, based on deceptive stats at best, realized?  I think the kind answer would be "eat my shorts".
With that said, Fall Kabib, here's more: From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
He does have a beautiful white robe with a pointy cap, accessorized with a beautiful armband with a swastika on it. And let's not forget that manifesto in his hand signed by Hitler lauding the killing of Jews, Blacks, and all other non-whites who do not support the supremacy of the Aryan race.
White Privilege has been earned.  Black Men represent 3% of the population yet commit 52% of the homicides,  Black men are FORTY TIMES more likely to commit a violent crime than white men. Those are FACTS not fluffed up heartfelt opinions. And I can't wait to see how many of you snowflakes get your panties in a bunch and accuse me of racism.
Are you on the Nuggets payroll? You keep using the Warrior game as a gauge! This guy will not amount to 1 game difference in wins The Nuggets will  CONTINUE to SUCK until You and those like you STOP LYING TO the NUGGETS FANS.We draft bums while leaving players on the board. we sign STUPID free agents that only want the MONEY.We seem to want any WHITE PLAYERS we can get! is it due to our FAN BASE being 98% White? I don't mind WHITE PLAYERS OR EURO players but  draft the one's that CAN PLAY! UNTIL YOU CAN BE HONEST LIKE KIZLA, this team is and will be a FAILURE!
You're wrong.    You have MORE of a chance of being killed by a mentally ill or angry white guy with a gun.  Exponentially more.
More honestly stated; in a post-election survey conducted by a racist, left-wing hate group, still parading itself as a legitimate human rights organization, a well-orchestrated survey of 10,000 of its life-term members, 90 percent were told to say that the climate within their brainwashing facility had somehow, someway, been negatively affected by the Trump campaign.  Not surprisingly, only 80 percent of the life-term members of the hate group SLPC were instructed to imagine some non-existent anxiety and fear among every student with the exception of all the white, cracker-ass students.  Despite the fact that less than 1% of these students could even tell you who the current President is if their life depended upon it.  The preceding information was quoted, verbatim from the George Soro's blockbuster, non-selling Book titled "Let's Destroy Whitey,” funded and to be distributed solely by the SLPC
Renzetti, you do realize that you are part of the "white trash" problem do you not?
That's not what white supremacists do; they want to overthrow our government, and discriminate against, or worse actions against people of color, gays, Muslims, and Jews. Sound familiar? Hint: Heil Trump (chanted by the white supremacists during Virginia rally).
Brooks and his band of so called "principled conservatives" created the electorate that elected Trump. Trump is their Frankenstein monster. They spent the last 50 years recruiting white racists into the GOP. Now those white racists control the party. They voted for and love Trump. The good news is they hate conservatives like Brooks, as much as they hate none white people. The GOP is just a white identity party today. Principled conservatives need to find a new party or get use to having fleas when they sleep with dogs.
As an elder your surely have to understand that the fight against "colonialism" is lost. You have a big family with members of all races? You would not have that if not for the very things you rail against. Do you also reject them because of that? Surely not. To say that a person cannot understand native culture because they are not native is racist, arrogant, bigoted and ignorant. Sadly, your own young people know less about their culture then they should and they have largely rejected it in favor of alcohol and iPhones. I am assuming you will blame the westerners and the whites for this as well. If you point the finger at others and call them bigots you should make sure that you are not that very thing first. I get why your people don't like Trump but all you will find in Hillary is another lying white politician not a friend. Perhaps AFN should rethink it's position in supporting the losing candidate?
This is far from being a "gratuitous smear". Trump's angry, racist remarks about Mexicans and Muslims have emboldened the alt-right and other white supremacist groups who now feel it's acceptable to attack anyone who doesn't meet their white, Christian American standards.
I picked up a few likes on my original comment. The majority were from women. Since there are now more women exercising their right to vote than men I'd say the gun rights folks have their work cut out for them. It is the newly enfranchised women voters (1920 for white women,1965 for all women) who will decide what we do about our gun problem. Maybe women can see the senselessly killed people more clearly than the pictures of the latest handgun at Cosco. Many probably know the mother of someone shot dead. And those that know their history remember how Mothers Against Drunk Driving took on the booze lobby, won and transformed America's previous dumb behavior permanently. I think women, like your mother, sister, aunt, daughter and wife, are the ones you need to convince that the status quo with American guns is just fine. Good luck.....
"And who are you - an old white guy, I'm absolutely sure -"  Apparently you're a racist, misandrist, and all-round bigot.  Good for you.
So in other words a friendly, peace-oriented gay organization got taken out by a terror group  This is how hate groups,, Marxists, Communists, Globalists, etc infiltrate simple good-spirited organizations and turn them into hate spewing, evil, and  mean-spirited gangs.  Expect more of the same in Canada  I walked in pride parades even though I am not gay. I appreciate the spirit of gay community and the general goodwill they have. This is a tragedy.  BLM is all about hate and terror. They hate whites of all walks - period. Their actions the last 5 years have proven that. What happened??? Evil happened Next up Sharia gangs in our neighborhoods.  This Black and Brown Muslim Terror thing is really the greatest threat to our society I think You can bet the announcements will be ONLY BLACK MUSLIM GAY PEOPLE CAN WALK! (If there are any left) Yup its all about inclusion isn't it?
Reichstag, fascism; you just can't help yourself. Anyone who cast a ballot or Mrs. Clinton is either a fool or a leftist; and I don't presume you as the former {though they are most certainly not mutually exclusive}. I'm not quite sure what you intend by linking Sanger's beliefs with the collection plate. It is Hillary who praises her, not Trump. Has anyone ever questioned her as to whether she believes it to be fine and dandy that black pre-borns are aborted at higher rates than whites or non-blacks?
52 percent of registered white Catholics are voting for Donald Trump? That is a disgrace.
"... the growing problems of white privilege..."  So, white people are responsible for this shooting? Brilliant analysis, nothing like blaming the bogeyman "white privilege" when you have no real insight to offer.
Child,  please. That crap has been thoroughly debunked,  you white nationalist little snowflake.
I find this civil comment thing to be the most ridiculous muzzle, put on the users of this site by an industry that wholly believes in incivility in the interest of ratings. A black officer killed a white man last week but we won't heart about that. Flip the script and it will literally be the only thing we will see.  This forum muzzles any true form of free speech. Yes, I know there are troglodytes that will abuse it. So, a few bad apples and then you take away the chance for any true freeform conversation. Because of this new forum, several of my comments, which weren't horrible, get banned due to the thin skinned sensibility of some of the people that use this.  No conversation can be pure when people are disallowed from speaking freely, regardless of how unfounded or vitriolic.   But in regards to the news today; whether Muslim or white bread American, young men in this country are extremely susceptible to this type of behavior. Frustration with no clue how to deal with it.
What if he looked white and was still one half black would that have made any difference? What's with this white/black stuff that you preach? Why don't you grow up and start using your head?
Another lie, or at the least, a misquote - "solely because of white privilege." As I recall Charles has never used "solely", he has merely pointed out that white people have a head start on others, and he calls it "white privilege", which I think any observant person would agree exists. I am mostly white and I know I have a head start on others; but my whole family left Norway because we were part Saami, a scorned race that definitely isn't white. Now we Norstogs pass for white in America. No white Norwegians to kick us down in America.
>>Tom Z  May be read up a little bit (civilization and modern) history? Could eventually help you deal with the the black-vs-white simpleton occupying your noggin.
