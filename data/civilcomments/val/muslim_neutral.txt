There is no room in publicly-funded schools for religious propaganda, be it Muslim, Christian or anything else.  No prayers.  No special rooms.  No separate school boards teaching their own particular brand of superstitious nonsense.  Nor should any tax or other accommodation or exemption be given to religious organizations.  They should either support themselves from funding provided by their adherents, or fall by the wayside.
Do the 17 predominately Muslim countries allow Israeli Jews?   Regardless of who has mentioned it?  I haven't heard any comments from people here, however.....  And it is not a ban on Muslims.  I don't recall reading in the order that Muslims and Muslims only are temporarily banned from entering.  Also please don't forget - it is temporary....and only until comprehensive vetting is completed.  That is not a "ban" - although it is a great word to whip up controversy with.
Donald Trump certainly wasn't wrong when he stated that the mainstream media is the enemy of the people. They don't always report on the facts, and in many cases they are only giving us half the story, half truths.    The woman Trump recently berated, Mika Brzezinski, once said that the "job of the media is to CONTROL exactly what people think," and that's exactly what much of the media is doing, and has been doing for decades.   It's like everything they report on is designed to elicit certain emotions and reactions from the general public. For example, instead of reporting on the many factually correct cases of Muslim refugees attacking people in their host countries and in some instances rioting, they purposely suppress that information and instead choose to show us photos of a little Syrian boy drowned on the beach and other photos of children who are covered in dirt and blood because of a bomb blast so that we will feel guilty about not opening our doors to save them.
Unfortunately, I don't believe it is entirely "unthinking". Rash, to be sure, but not without thought.   I'm afraid Trump wants to create chaos and confusion and to lower the bar for empathy that Americans feel towards Muslims.   Does the ban make America safer? No.   Does it correct an existing problem with dangerous people entering the US? No.   Does it give radical Islamists more leverage and motivation for recruiting? Yes.   Does it inflame anger and hatred? Yes.   Does it set the pre-conditions for American military action? Yes.   Hitler didn't start with box cars and death camps. He started by labelling and isolating Jews and turning Germans against them.   He also claimed he needed to return the German military to its former glory for "self-defence".   He also made an alliance with Russia.   If the American people don't stop Trump soon we're all in very deep trouble.   (In my Nazi German analogy, we are Austria).
or provided a platform for her views, an insititution for her education, and protection from sharia law, polygamy, genital mutilation, and the ability to drive, walk alone in public, not be forced to marry at 14 etc. a week in a muslim country would change her methinks.
When it's a radical Islamic terrorist, the standard political response to to make vague condemnations of hatred and violence.
f you check the numbers, dad, there are more acts of terrorism done in the name of Christianity than there is in the name of Islam.’ And factually, that’s the truth.”  _________________________  That's not true. They kill and maim people everyday in Countries that use Islam as law and the slavery of women in burkas is fascism at its highest level. Add further, the word Islam in Arabic means "submission"
I haven't seen any Christians beheading and burning people alive simply for not being Christians. I suppose you can go back in history and find examples but I would doubt that Muslims of old were sitting around singing  kumbaya with their neighbors either. In the modern world, there is no comparison. Islam is having problems all over the world, with all different cultures. If you are talking about the third world being under attack by western countries, then you are talking secular societies that may or may not be majority Christian and geopolitical motivations.
Muslim scholars agree: Saying Merry Christmas is the Worst Sin.  https://creepingsharia.wordpress.com/2014/12/25/muslim-scholars-agree-saying-merry-christmas-is-the-worst-sin-ever-video/  But our naive, young idealistic PM praises diversity http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/feminist-pm-defends-attendance-at-gender-segregated-event ..."and with the sisters upstairs'......  This country is lost....
What a waste of time and money.  This temporary ban is to allow the Feds to be able to set up the appropriate criteria and vetting of  muslim travelers to our country.  It is a common sense approach to the likelihood that Islamic fundamentalists wanting to  engage in jihad have and will continue to come here posing as travelers/immigrants.  All our intelligence service heads and the FBI have all said that the Jihadis  plan to come here in this manner.  This was in fact freely stated by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, also known as KSM to his interrogators.  He said that the jihadis would infiltrate the US in this manner and would hide behind our country's constitutional rights and bide their time until the time to strike was at hand.  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is one of the 911 conspirators and is the alleged mastermind of the 911 attacks and has been tied to every Al Qaeda attack that occurred between 1993 and 2003.  He was subject to many enhanced interrogations (water boarded) by the CIA.
Is there a country that bans Muslim immigrants and their religion? Might be interesting to see how they are doing. Better?
If the Arabs didn’t want to be ‘occupied’ and ‘humiliated’, then they should not have attempted to annihilate the Jews, and they certainly shouldn’t have launched their genocidal forces from our ancient heartland. If you are concerned about world peace and human rights, the pressure should be on the fascists and kings surrounding Israel committed to endless war. 11 million Muslims have been killed since 1948. Less than one percent of those unfortunate souls have been killed in conflict with Israel.
diverdave, During the campaign, Trump called for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States...."  That doesn't sound welcoming.  The executive order was supposed to be the first step toward attaining that deplorable goal.
BRILLIANT tactic G&M - Censor my comment with "Did not meet..." But YOU have Barred me in reality: This seems to be a case of zealous psychic projection employed as a defense mechanism: I MEAN -- You expelled some acrid flatus but are afraid to be accused of it, so you accuse everyone around you of it preemptively. It's an amazingly effective strategy for better or worse.... Now, I claim these Liberals and even many Muslims themselves, are in fact themselves the most virulently Islamophobic among us... Consider the possibility that the Liberal government is soooooo afraid of Islam in all its incarnations, that they enable these measures to protect themselves? The many Muslims I refer to are soooo afraid of Islam because adherents to that ideology are killing each other big-league. Muslims kill each other at a FRIGHTENING rate. Read:Shia VS. Sunni. But you know what's easier than honest debate on this? Blaming President Trump and every Liberal's favorite word: Racism.  <--- Let's see...
Neil, alt-right groups didn't pick Trump's name out of a hat and decide to support him.  They support him because he advocated for their views: He repeatedly described Muslims and Latinos in negative, sub-human terms and he's fiercely opposed to international trade and immigration.  Now, while Trump's stance on these points tends to be somewhat softer than neo-Nazis, it doesn't change the fact that they're largely on the same page.  As to whether white supremacists are harmless, look up the names Dylan Roof and Jeremy Joseph Christian.  Just because you may not be paying attention doesn't mean alt-right activists aren't murdering people.
For 500 years the Muslim Ottoman Empire protected Jews, fellow people of the book, from the murderous Christians of Europe.
As far as I am concerned, if Muslims are allowed to wear burqas and niqabs that prevent identification, all other clothing should be allowed. Leggings are not a safety threat.
Unfortunately for Trump, Giuliani exposed the intent when he bragged that Trump asked him to take a Muslim ban and dress it up is legalese so that it might pass as something other than unconstitutional religious discrimination.
Much appreciated article. Living in a slightly rural part of Ontario it is sometimes difficult to know how to address the gay muslim delemia particulary as it relates to orientation and the standard muslin doctrine. I found this article remarkably articulate and covered the many sensitive manners in a clear and positive way. Particulary as a gay white male it encompassed many aspects I had wondered about.  Most informative and encouraging.
Walk down any busy street  in any Canadian city with a population of Muslim  immigrants and count the number of women in Hijabs and burkas who are pregnant and / or pushing a baby carriage.  50% ? 60% ?
you conveniently ignore that the carding request the other night in milan was done at 3:00am in the morning at a train station where he came to the attention of a couple of patrolling police officers who 'grew suspicious because he was a North African man, alone outside a deserted train station in the dead of night'.   very fair reason to card but not the daily discriminate carding practiced by some police forces today.  italians were all once to their dismay painted with the same 'mafia' brush.  muslims to their horror since 911 have now been painted with same 'terrorist' brush.  and now we wish to paint all canadians of colour with the same 'criminal' brush?
They (U.S. 5th Generation Stealth) can be detected by the current Russian Federation Integrated Air Defense Systems.   December 2011 (over 5 years ago), the newly purchase by the Muslim Nation of Iran Russian Federation Integrated Air Defense System detected a U.S. 5th Generation Stealth RQ-170.    This aircraft (F-35A) is a 2006 Model.  The F-22 is not considered a 5th Generation Stealth and is a 4th Generation Stealth aircraft. Everybody cheaped out on making the F-35 the Best that there is.   The original intent was as a Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL), Very Short Take Off and Landing (VSTOL) Aircraft, primarily to replace the U.S.M.C.s AV-8, aka Hawker Harrier, the U.S. Airforce cheaped out and did not get the VTOL capability.   The U.S.A.F. did not want the Close Air Support Mission (C.A.S.) and only the Air Superiority Mission (Air to Air Combat), so the U.S. did not buy the Israelis Air to Ground Attack Package (Module mounted on left side below cockpit, avionics inside).
The Palestinian people have lived there for so many centuries - Palestinian Jews, Palestinian Christians, and Palestinian Muslims. I wonder if the Globe and Mail could research and provide a story about the carrying capacity of the land, and how much ground water is being removed by the people who build and move into these settlements. What is the rate of removal compared to the traditional and, presumably, sustainable rate before the Zionist movements began. If they are not careful, it won't be that many decades before we are hearing stories about their "God-given right" to water from Egypt, Jordan, etc.  Scripture, alone, makes for a poor sense of place.
The world's largest Muslim country (Indonesia), by population, has Muslim, Hindu, Christian and Buddhist festivals as public holidays. ------- because of demographics large populations of  Hindu, Christian and Buddhist  Bali is mostly Hindu Chinese (Buddhists and Christians) control the economy
It would be a good place, but not for the reason you suggest. It shows what a failed strategy looks like. Guantanamo Bay has provided little intelligence, been an inspiration for radical Islam, and an embarrassment for the US. It has also weakened the US Constitution.
That is fair but I think it's also fair to say that the majority of terroristic acts in today's world is in the name of Islam.
Neither liberal nor tolerant.  I know which faction of society represents the greatest danger to me and mine.  Based on observation and experience, not what politicians and TV tell me.  And the good ole redneck might help you--if you're the "right" color.  But here's a question for you--had I made same, identical statement about "Muslim culture", what would have been your reaction?  Would you have castigated me for being judgmental then?  Falsely accused me of "liberalism"?  Let's see if you've got the guts to answer...
It's a political rally, not a wedding anniversary. But I agree the profanities were uncalled for. Rallies should only have people who agree with the political position of the host.  Any dissension is an affront. Like this woman: http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/08/politics/donald-trump-muslim-woman-protesting-ejected/
It doesn't occur to you that people realize the man was mentally disturbed? It's more likely that this is a media conspiracy?  No. I think most people know the man was mentally disturbed. But when you have the POTUS saying things like "muslim ban" this is the kind of behavior you can expect to see. It's a result bigoted ignorant policy. When the national narrative at the highest level is "all muslims are potential terrorists" you get events like this, a shooting at a mosque, the Indian man who was shot in a bar, or someone with a knife threatening your life when you're leaving a prayer service in Eugene.   Imagine now if you were a Muslim, even "one of the good ones". Now, because the POTUS has run on a policy of painting your religion as a threat you have to be worried about psychopaths lurking around every corner seeing you as a trigger to go on some violent rampage. That is why it's not ok, and why these people were heros. They tried to change the narrative and it cost them.
>>Duke Charles Martel >>Are you a muslim  . Alceste? .....  To that question, Alceste has a canned answer - "Are you a White Supremacist?".. or "At least I am not a White Supremacist?" Either way - it is pretty telling how he feels about himself. And what does he equates being Muslim with. .. Now, to the apprentice who would be given the task of "censoring" this post - read twice.. Just because there are some words in it that may scare you into censorship, there is nothing offensive, or false in it, it is based on actual posts ( go search your database).
Re:  The RNS commentary "The evangelical courtiers who kneel before the president's feet"  Rather snarky article.  Not that I don't agree, but it is an article written to inflame.  Legitimate as commentary but wow!  The article mentions the evangelical "leaders" who have cozied up to Trump, but does not mention any Catholic bishops/cardinals.  The picture accompanying the commentary has one pictured, smiling nicely.  I imagined he hoped for more, wrong though he is to want to inshrine in law the right to discriminate against a minority.  But, at least he wasn't named.  It bothers me when the bishops cozy up to someone as amoral as Trump, smiling in hopes this person who has made it a point to show distain for Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans, will give them the freedom to discriminate against another minority, this time one they don't like.    "When will they ever learn?  When will they ever learn?"  Another song answers:  "The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind."
The laptop ban that requires laptops be in checked luggage does not interfere with anyone's US constitutional rights against religous discrimination. Just as vetting people who have travelled to Libya or other nations on Obama's list of 7 nations where terrorists are trained and indoctrinated into ISIS does not inferere with constitutional rights vs a ban on all who are citizens of certain Muslim dominated countries does, where there is evidence that the intent was to ban Muslims from entering the US. The ban applies to all who fly on certain airlines from certain countries on flights to the US regardless of religon or where they came from and involves merely checking your laptop.
It's not what we know about our fellow man that inspires our greatest fear and hatred. It's what we DON'T know that provokes our greatest anxiety.  Most of us can live with some uncertainty, but less so when it comes to our children. Nevertheless...  Despite the heated circumstances, I encourage the Peel school board, Muslim students and their parents to reach out to their community. You have nothing to hide, because freedom of belief is integral to what it means to be a Canadian.
"Christian allegedly stabbed two men to death and seriously injured a third amid what witnesses called an anti-Muslim tirade on a commuter train. Christian had given Nazi salutes and screamed racial slurs at a right-wing rally in the city in April."  Sounds like a Trump supporter to me.
What the quotes should have said was something like "We are sending them over so we can get quotes in the newspaper pretending we are doing something on behalf of women and girls, so we can get the women and girls vote in a couple of years".  That would be a better assessment of why they are sending TWENTY officers, over the next two years. I love it. To show Iraqis the value of women police officers.  I'm sure that will make Muslim men appreciate women more.
"Refugees from the middle east that follow Islam will never integrate into our Judeo/Christian society and therefor would be happier with their own kind ."  That's news to me. Through my career, I know dozens of Canadian Muslims, and all of them seem to have adapted well and integrated into Canadian society. They haven't converted to Christianity, of course, but that certainly doesn't mean that they can't integrate into a secular society like ours, anymore than a Christian can't integrate into a secular society. I'm not sure why the Muslims you know seem to be unable to integrate. Perhaps you should ask them and offer to help.
"most people are behaving very reasonably"  Yes they are portia, but they can discern the the difference between ordinary Muslims and the jihadi fundamentalists.  They aren't the ones posting ridiculous anti-Muslim comments here or using terms like "Taqqiya and propaganda" in an attempt to discredit reasonable arguments that challenge their prejudices. They aren't making gross generalizations about Islam based on the actions of terrorists. Labelling the article as "Taqqiya and propaganda" does nothing at all to promote the "further dialogue with muslim women" that you say you're interested in.   So which is it? Are you interested in a dialogue or in vilifying Islam as a whole based on the actions of a small percentage of fundamentalists and jihadis? Have you ever actually made the effort to engage with a Muslim woman or is it just too easy to post simplistic, dismissive comments while hiding behind your computer screen?
Look, at the risk of my sounding like a leftard, that was a completely uncalled for comment, and boneheaded at that.  I don't agree that she should be used as an inclusivity and diversity poster child by being accepted into Oxford, because I am skeptical she has the intelligence to attend there on her own merits.  But the fact remains she took a bullet to the head for standing up to the Taliban, and her courage and conviction should be respected. Only people like her will lift the Islamic culture above the Hobbesian state of nature that defines their existence.
That the Muslims overran Judea in 639 AD and kept it wasn't "Imperialist theft"? Really?
Of course he is filling his cabinet with the very people he promised to evict from DC and the halls of power.  Trump is a malignant narcissist with all the gifts and shortcomings of his ilk.  The people who elected him have zero idea of what they have done. Trump cares no more for the people who elected him than he does for the contractors whose payment he stiffs after the work is done. He has no more compassion for his supporters than he does for the Muslim parents of a fallen US soldier, for a disabled reporter, or the women he preys upon and then lies about.  Narcissists like Trump smell weakness in people like a bear smells food, and they have the gift of forming themselves into whatever their targets want to believe they are, and doing so with the skill of an academy award-winning actor.  For a while. This honeymoon will not last long at all.
Over the last 1200 years until this very day,  millions and millions of Muslims have been killed by members of other Muslim sects and groups. This has been going on even before the "west" , US and UK existed.
I don't agree a "more assertive political Islam" is "taking root" and I think your objection to the freedom of Muslims to observe their practice of barring menstruating women from participating in prayer is a little precious to say the least. There are practicing Jews who require women to do some sort of "cleanse" when menstruating and it's not as though the wider Canadian culture is entirely even-keeled on the subject. How many offensive terms are there for menstruation after all?  As for how to balance the competing interests of the freedom of a group to practice its religious beliefs and the rights of women to equal treatment, I think we apply the test that should be applied to all situations involving competing rights: a right extends until it infringes another. If we think Muslim women are being harmed by being barred from prayers (not sure that's the case) then we protect women's right to pray.  BTW I think your use of words suggests just a little Islamophobia. Just sayin'.
You apparently didn't read the whole article.  Yes, it starts talking about local perceptions about muslims, but it expands from there to more broad conclusions about people around the world.  The observations made by this author are actually correct.....this is evidenced nearly every day around this country, about a whole host of issues (aka not just immigration of people from predominantly muslim countries)./
Trump can change-- old Trump scolded Michelle Obama for not wearing head cover. New Trump allows Ivanka and Melania to go without cover. He is changing his approach to Saudi Arabia and the Muslim world. He is no longer referring to "Radical Islamic Terrorists"-- following his advisors (especially his military advisors and Generals Mattis and McMaster).
Last year some gay guys put on Buraqs for Hallowe'en and were met with a vicious backlash accusing them of Islamophobia and racism. . But if they had been dressed horny Catholic nuns it would considered all in good fun
Place the blame where it deservedly lies -- Islam.
Trump, addressing religious leaders in a signing ceremony at the White House, said: “We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced any more”.  I assume this includes Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Daoists, Catholics and any other religious belief system as it rightly should although it is more likely that he is pandering to the Christian right and his idea of targeting, bullying or silencing is likely far from the ideal that all faiths should be free to practice their beliefs without persecution.    The line between church and state should be clearly drawn to ensure that religionists of any stripe cannot impose their personal beliefs on others and it is certainly troubling that he intends to allow them to participate in political activity.
First they came for the Muslims, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Muslim. Then they came for the appointed Gov't officials, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Gov't official. Then they came for the Journalists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Journalist. Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
Just to put the seniority in context.... The Jews first settled Jerusalem about 7,000 years ago - The Christian's sacred sites, 2,000 years - The Muslims, when Mohammad dreamt he rode Pegasus, the winged horse to Jerusalem and God spoke to him, about 1,300 hundred years ago......
It does not surprise me that the same names criticizing the report and the same names offering support to those criticizing the report are those most fervent in their adoration of minority-elect "President" Trump and his anti-Muslim crusade.
That eight per cent of the population reads and believes this stuff is significant. People do seem to have a hunger for "news' that suits their prejudices and often reflexively reject that which does not. I think there as well words , that when used, end critical thought. Fracking, Islam, refugees and amnesty come immediately to mind though there are many others.
"Anyone who wanted him to scold the President for his executive order restricting Muslim immigrants and refugees was doubtlessly disappointed."  It seems that every article having to do with Trudeau's trip makes this same point. Trudeau criticizing Trump over his Muslim immigration policies  at a press conference in Washington is not an option but it's presented as if it was a wise decision.
Don't be too hasty. Jews and Muslims don't eat pork.
One Belt One Road is China's wet dream of becoming a world leader. Most countries who sign on only want money from China. Many of them are former Soviet states, and Muslim is their main stream religion. Some of the countries are still in dispute with China regarding the South Sea Islands. I don't see how it will work.
Answer my question Alceste - Should Muslims who didn't live there and had no right to vote in the referendum be allowed to go door-to-door to get people to vote yes?
""“The proposal to restrict the rights of certain classes of ,   citizens had a side effect of stigmatization""  To add to this,  the Muslim religion restricts the rights of certain classes of its citizens ie women in that they HAVE to wear certain clothes (coverup girls) even in the hottest days (men and children are dressed like you and me),  have to be seen by women doctors,  in some countries cannot drive,  and on and on.      That you need to see their face to vote, work in government,  ...   is not a affront to their religion.  Common sense.
What is your definition of "right-wing extremism"?  What is your definition of Islamic extremists?
Nazism and fascism are just political philosophies and faiths like any other: some evil has been done in its name but also much good. Freeland is correct to ask for people to view this in a wider context and with the passage of time.   Just as we are able to view Islam in the round, so we should also review our formed opinions about the Nazi period and understand they were no worse than other totalitarian belief systems of the time (Communism etc.). In fact, Germany enjoyed record good health and social advances while its science and technology flourished during that time: something that was imported into the US and contributed to its epic boom from the late 1940s until the 1970s.
We MUST embrace an honest and open discourse on Islam and the Canadian society. This article is good, but there is still that tone of Islam is above discussion, as open minded Canadians, that just won't do.
Of course there have been pockets of violence by adherents of Catholicism (e.g., the I.R.A.), Buddhism (radicals in Sri Lanka) and most other religions. You might point out that these examples aren't about religious precepts but politics, and you'd be correct. The same is true of violence by groups professing Islam. The issue isn't religion. It's power-seeking under the guise of religion.  Every religion that's been around awhile has literature with passages that incite violence. Rational people understand they represent the sensitivities of a certain time and place. They also recognize the tempering influence of societal evolution.  Sure, there are Muslim extremists who use passages in the Quran to justify killing people. There are also nuts claiming to be Christian who play with poisonous snakes. But both are exceptions. Most Muslims do not kill, nor do they believe God wants them to kill. To claim otherwise is to view Islam through a lens of sheer bigotry.
It appears you need look up the job description of the Attorney General.  At least this woman was competent and courageous when faced with the presently uninformed man in the executive office. You are aware he does not have any law degree and actually consulted Giuliani who claimed he would write the order to achieve a Muslim ban. Too bad he made the intent so obvious. When you surround yourself with incompetence you get it as your work product.
"partial travel ban of nationals from six mostly Muslim countries." There they go again, with the Muslim obsession.  It was a list of terrorist hotspots, first created in 1979 with three countries. Currently Cuba and NK are off the list. It would not be surprising if NK were to be put back . What will AP use then?  Maybe "partial travel ban of nationals from six mostly-shades-of-brown-with-maybe-a-little-yellow countries"
Cry me a river.  For every one anti-Christian comment there are ten anti-Muslim ones.
If more of this is happening, why is it not being covered by more traditional media?  If it is not happening, why not?  Much of the hatred/bias/distrust of Muslims is based on what is published about them and radical Islamists in main stream media.    Beheadings,  throwing people off buildings, burning them alive are all facts in mainstream media.   Who are the moderate Islamists decrying these acts?  Where are their statements being published....if they do in fact exist?  If they don't exist, conclusions can be drawn.  If they do exist and the mainstream media choose not to publish that fact, other conclusions can be drawn.
All the rich ME Muslim countries can pitch in first. The Saudis, Qataris, Kuwaitis etc. Why is it always the West? These oil rich countries can certainly share their largess.
@Allan Ross "Billionbibles.org? Seriously?Here's a hint. If you want to be taken credibly you should choose sources that are unbiased and neutral or have at least some credibility of their own." ~ ` ~ Got a problem with 'Billionbibles.org, Al? Well, how about that.. & of course, you would know how one should present reference material, wouldn't you.. given that obvious 'superior' & 'in-control, biased' perspective.  Here's a hint for you, Al... before kicking up snarky-snide straw-man fallacy in order to minimize the current religious realities engulfing the Planet in flames in this 21st Century... perhaps you could, at the very least, speak to the issues presented by the G&W article at hand. Here's an icebreaker -- do your kids go to Public schools in Peel, Al?  If you believe dissing a 4-year web-discussion outlining basic comparative issues between the religions of Christianity & Islam is wrong -- then perhaps you could provide a point by point correction of same.  Secular is best.
That gets right to the heart of it, Mike5: you believe islamist terrorism justifies hate and violence against innocent Canadian muslims.  It does not,  and you (and the ones who agree, Petrows and 9401doug) do yourself no credit by saying it does.
Muslims did it, in case nobody else  dares to mention it.
Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Immigration has already stated categorically that he will not open Canada's doors to Christians. That would be religion faith based immigration policy and against our secular moral standards. He said just a couple of weeks ago that Christians don't face the same dangers as other legitimate refugees. He will however welcome all Muslims fleeing Trump's persecution in the US.
Before the previous attacks in England, Muslim citizens went to the authorities and reported the future killers. Muslims took responsibility and called out the extremists. I don't "blame" the police for not apprehending the attackers, I have no idea what happened and it isn't my place to judge those officers. But those men were reported. By the same types of people who got attacked today. Innocent people.
I think it's unfair to have an article about immigrants, mention Donald Trump, and not mention Muslim extremists and Sharia law (as it is in Saudi Arabia, from which the Clinton Foundation received millions of dollars). At billionbibles.org, according to Sharia law: -criticizing or denying any part of the Quran is punishable by death -a man can beat his wife for insubordination -testimonies of four male witnesses are required to prove rape against a woman -a woman who has been raped cannot testify in court against her rapist -a woman cannot drive a car ....see billionbibles.org for more..... This is why Hillary Clinton's dream of an open hemisphere (see WIKILEAKS regarding her speech to Brazilian bankers, and see what's been happening in Europe) is so dangerous, and why Donald Trump's plan to protect our borders is desirable.
Trump wants to make Islamic extremists even angrier and more aggressive while softening up American empathy for Muslims. Trump wants to give himself an excuse to invade/bomb the countries on the list. He's waiting til all the paperwork is signed with Russia in his own Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. He and Putin divvy up the world.   Odd and chilling that all of that sounds both paranoid and plausible all at once.
As soon as Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum signed on, the Judge knew it had become a bogus lawsuit!  " U.S. federal court on Friday refused to put an emergency halt to Republican President Donald Trump's revised travel ban, saying lawyers from states opposed to the measure needed to file more extensive court papers. States led by Washington and Minnesota challenged Trump's original executive order, issued in January, which sought to restrict travel from seven Muslim-majority countries and stop refugees from entering the U.S. Seattle U.S. District Court Judge James Robart issued a temporary restraining order against the first policy last month, and when Trump issued a narrower version of the ban on Monday, listing only six countries, opponents sought to halt its implementation as well. Robart on Friday declined to apply his first order to the new ban"
Interesting, you say that a good Lutheran boy like me cannot possibly attend a church since I don't think like you do? Perhaps that's one of the reasons we (Lutherans) split off from the Catholic Church. People can have differing views and still be Christian. Also interesting how you say violent passages in the bible are taken out of context, or are parables, but violent passages in the Koran are to be taken literally. That seems to be somewhat misguided thinking, or at least, presumptuous. As far as your OT vs. NT point of view, I've often directed people to this essay:  http://www.loonwatch.com/2011/05/the-but-thats-just-the-old-testament-cop-out/
This affects perhaps 10s or at most 100s in travel status and individual cases can be reviewed.  The larger ban of 4 months from certain muslim countries is also rather minor,while the US reviews the filters on its immigration models.  People forget that recently Germany banned all immigration from Nigeria and thousands of illegal immigrants.......illegal because europe did not have adequate immigration filters......in Europe have been deported back to their countries.  Further, the UK is  building a wall in Calais to stop illegals from entering Britain.  In all cases, these are 99% muslims.  But, no outcry from the MSM..  Why ?
Maybe non-Muslims? Your speculation is as good as mine.
But you believe a few deranged Muslims represent the remaining 1.7 billion?
There are around 50 women a month killed by husbands/boyfriends/exes in the USA. While America gets all worked up over an attempted Muslim ban we should ask ourselves if recent action by a Republican Congress to remove those claiming mental disability benefits from a gun ban makes us safer. If you're going to go nuts over our 2nd Amendment rights please don't forget to read the fist part of that passage.
Alceste,  I read her column.  It is designed to get everyone's back up so she can subsequently point out to her leftie friends how much of a problem there is with Islamophobia.  Don't care whether the author is wearing a hijab or a bikini, the column is still garbage and not worth reading.
The Globe knows the fate of Charlie Hebdo is going to happen at the Globe's own offices if criticism of Islam is allowed to go too far. Next, there may be images of Mohammad. We can't have that. @;(>
I would be curious for an academic to perform a correlation analysis between terrorism and likely factors. I expect the conclusions would be along the lines of: 1. Large muslim immigration to Western countries => barrel of powder 2. Western countries intervening in Middle Eastern messes => spark 3. Hate crimes rising against muslims => oil on fire 4. Vicious circle ensues  It's probably not a linear relationship, but an exponential one. We like to name cities "New" something in North America. How about "New Baghdad", "New Kabul", etc. etc.
Nonsense. Canada apparently has money to burn on all kinds of useless and fashionable liberal pet projects like importing Muslims or giving air plane manufactures money for record executive payouts.  If we just deleted the liberal propaganda arm known as the CBC we could increase our military budget by about 10%. I'd rather have an army then some paid speaker telling me how great Canada is and how much peace Muslims bring to the world with religion.
This is in response to Fuad Khayer - Fuad, most people do not have negative feelings toward muslims & i'm sorry that you're experiencing such nastiness at this moment in time. However, I must say that you should realize that you have come to what was once (& some would say still is) a Christian country. For the last few hundred years, our calenders have been built around this concept, hence the holidays you mention Nowadays, many people are totally secular & do not follow any religion. Some still do. The point is - our public schools are secular. Religion plays no part unless it's a study of various religions for the sake of increasing knowledge. To accomodate, our schools have bent over backwards to make life easy for those wishing to follow their religions.  Most people are happy to allow students to take time off for personal worship, but draw the line at praying on school property. Why does your community not provide a place for student Friday prayers? That would solve the problem.
The MSM is not telling the whole story.  Khizr Khan is a Muslim Brotherhood activist that wants to infiltrate the US with Muslims that support Sharia Law.  Trump is right on in criticizing this man.  Furthermore, the Koran supports violence and advocates violence in numerous passages.  The Koran tells followers to maim and kill infidels if they do not convert to Islam.  These are not passages in historical context like the Bible's old testament but current and active rules that Muslims must follow.
I know that you're being facetious, but your suggestion is close to what must happen. Great Britain brought on this problem through their immigration policy and the policy of allowing Muslims to isolate themselves under Sharia law. Can you imagine there are parts of the cities in GB where the police are not allowed to enter? We are making a similar mistake by allowing the Imams in certain cities to spew hate and support the expansion of Sharia Law. This may sound harsh, but if they do not want to assimilate, then send them back to where they came from. After living on dirt and rocks for a while they may conclude that the U.S. wasn't that bad after all.
According to statistical data, the 7 countries targeted by Trump's ban, represent a 15% of the muslim population. Most non-muslims don't even know which country has the greatest number of muslims.
Just think of what kind of fervor and sentiment Trump's fiery and passionate rhetoric is doing for terrorist recruitment if Mexican anti-US sentiment is any gauge to go by.  Then compound that with proverbial back-handed slaps to Muslims with the travel ban.  And just for garnish, add on a sprinkle fear and hate for the proposed and expected revised version. I suspect Trump either believes the US is an island rather than a central cog in the global international machine or doesn't care and expects the sword he's been hoisting up to fall on the heads of later presidents.
Stunning rebuttal, treefruit.  You think I can't be friends with Goldman Sachs, and radical Islam at the same time? How about neither of the above? Does that work for you? Although what one has to do with the other is a complete mystery. I look forward to your explanation.
Except for, you know, the fact that other Muslim countries are imposing their own travel bans against other Muslim countries....and that Obama did the same thing.  "Fear-based?" LOL except for the part where if you eat two strips of bacon a day, your chances of being a terrorist suicide bomber go down by 100% . What would you say the chances would be of a 15-year-old Trump supporter getting press coverage by the Alaska Dispatch? This is such a cliché it's embarrassing.
Progressives want more abortions of Americans and more invaders, or unscreened immigrants just pouring in with no health or criminal checks...why do you think Obama flooded America with Muslims who have, on average, 11 children while we have aborted 60 million Americans and our hedonist culture reproduces (allows to live) about 2 per woman? Starting to get the picture everyone? It's the 7th century all over again...
Hate crimes in Canada are virtually non-existent. Check Stats Can - for 2013, the average number of hate crimes was 3.3 per 100,000 people in major metropolitan ares. This means that the odds of anyone having a hate crime committed against them are extremely rare. We don't need a government motion (with attached government spending - wasteful!) to condemn Islamophobia (a vague and politically malleable term.)  We deserve the right to criticize Islam. Islam is not only a religion, its a political movement. And all Canadians should strive against the political arm of Islam. We don't want another Rotherham here in Canada due to hate speech laws.  When Imams constantly preach death for those who leave Islam, and the pratice of Taqqiya (lying to non-Muslims) is encouraged, and women get stoned to death for getting raped, and gay people get executed just for being gay, then Islamophobia makes sense.  NO on M103. No on C16. Vote out Trudeau in 2019!
it is called politics  Justin knows he can build a larger muslim base by bringing in more Syrians, there are not enough Mexicain refugees to provide for a base that can affect the outcome of elections
a book worth reading - In The House Of Ishmael: A history Of The Jews In Muslim Land,  By Martin Gilbert
If Bernstein had written something even half this vitriolic about Obama, the affirmative action Muslim parasite criminal,  I would have more than the  zero respect for his opinion I have now. Trump is rude, he's a boor,  and he is doing exactly what he promised during his campaign and without subterfuge.  He is not shilling a bill that would wreck the health insurance industry and lying about every single component.  He is not saying deficits are immoral, promising to halve it and then doubling it. Maybe for Bernstein lying cheating and stealing is OK if it's done  politely,  but not for the country.
I don't follow  Do you really think the families care if he killed them because of Islam or because of some other political belief?  Their dead either way!  Why would it be easier to accept if say Islam instead of say hatred of white people or something else?    I don't follow at all.
they want a blanket condemnation of criticism of Islam  They will hardly agree to a version that states that Islam has any bigotry,  the whole point is to keep anybody from criticizing Islam.
Obama was and is a Muslim sympathizer, because is Dad is Muslim. Besides ISIS only came to the for front after Obama got us out of Iraq. Before that Al-Qaeda was the terrorist group of note. Is Al-Qaeda Islamic?
How can the government be a champion of de-radicalization as long as they/we support oppressive regimes like Saudi Arabia and others in the Middle east?  Saudi Arabia actively promotes and supports an extremist version of islam. Saudi Arabia executes gays, publicly beheads people, removes hands as a form of punishment, crucifies people, bans non-muslims from some cities, has a complete ban on non-muslim religions and oppresses women.  Yet our government supports Saudi Arabia. Look at Qatar and other "moderate" muslim countries like Kuwait and the UAE ....... how do they treat gays, women, and religious minorities? They all support fundamentalist islam. Yet they all escape criticism from the government. Freeland is comfortable criticizing Russia for its many abuses, but compared to our pretend allies in the Middle East, Russia is a liberal paradise.  Why the double standard?
Justin has to make a choice:  help a Canadian mother regain her children, or allow a Muslim farther to keep his children. No contest.
To paint Aisha as a victim is completely at odds with her persona. She was certainly no wallflower. During a controversial battle in Muslim history, she emerged riding a camel to lead the troops. She was known for her assertive temperament and mischievous sense of humour – with Muhammad sometimes bearing the brunt of the jokes. During his lifetime, he established her authority by telling Muslims to consult her in his absence; after his death, she went to be become one of the most prolific and distinguished scholars of her time. A stateswoman, scholar, mufti, and judge, Aisha combined spirituality, activism and knowledge and remains a role model for many Muslim women today. The gulf between her true legacy and her depiction in Islamophobic materials is not merely historically inaccurate, it is an insult to the memory of a pioneering woman.
Much like Vegas was the responsibility of the NRA, radical Islam is responsible for this attack, not some lone loser.  What must we do to control radical Islam?  Should there be laws against terrorism and extremism?
"It began as a palpable effort to limit the rights of Canadians, including Canadian Muslims, to criticise a specific religion."  Actually no, if you read the motion it doesn't say anything of the sort. But you have put a good effort into refuting something that doesn't exist.
The civil war was over for 100 years before we were able to pass civil rights in 1965. Now you expect one man who some think is a Muslim from Kenyan to solve your issues...hmmm.
In the 1940's with the division of Pakistan and India, how many millions of Muslims were victims of Indians and Hindus?
To blame only one side of this s wrong, both the apologists for Islam & those that espouse murder are both wrong. Harsh criticism of religious dogma is essential to civilization. There is no turning back. Islamophobia is a lie created by those with Kuffirphobia, fear of those who do not believe and thus do not behave as if they are believers in Islam. Let us be what we are, I personally a hater of all Abrahamic nonsense and desire a severe curtailment of immigration, however, I also strongly say whoever is here, is here, they're one of us, we don't deport them anywhere but yes menial work, 1st gen ok. The civilized way This incident cannot be used by government authorities to control speech in any way shape nor form. That would be a far worse crime than the murder of these poor people in the mosque, affecting far more people negatively. Politicians, etc also have to start calling Islamic terror, Islamic terror if they want to start calling out only a few of the page-likes FB account.
Yeah, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, Jimbo5.  Could be.  But I see no real effort  made by Muslims to get to know me.  (And preachy columns by the Council's communications rep don't change my opinion much.) When I see what Muslim wives wear and see how their husbands dress--forgive me, I know this is petty--I wonder about "bending to western culture."    Not a lot of bending going on in some Ontario schools right now, while schools and boards twist themselves into pretzels.  Muslim: "Oh, these Christian folks don't seem to want to pray in schools ... well, OK, when in Rome, etc., so I'll just go along with it. Canada's good for us. My kids can pray at home and the Mosque."    Sure.
Today's Canada has zero resemblance to the Canada of 500 years ago.  Things change, one day, maybe not so far away, Canada may be based on Islamic principles.  Our PM vacations as a guest of one of Islam's "popes", that would have been unheard of 30 years ago and nobody blinks an eye today.
Serious question, Stonewall: Isn't everything you're using to post your comment -- the computer, the internet, the service provider -- all yours to use because of capitalism?  Also, don't you see anything at all wrong with the generic label of "white"? I'm beginning to. Some folks, myself included, our bloodlines are very recent to this country and yet we are considered white because of our skin tone; but the "real" white people gave us just as much grief when we came here because we weren't the "right kind" of white.  So just like we're taught not to jump everyone in together -- all Muslims are not terrorists, all this are not that -- why does that rule fly out the window when it's light-skinned people?
Bravo! People can be so ignorant.  I knew Sikhs believe in a single god. Thank you for the other information. No, Sikhs are not Abrahamic, but they are monotheistic, and as far as I'm concerned, and if I may apply a little logic: If A = E, and B = E, and C = E, and D = E, then A = B = C = D. That is, if Sikhs, Jews, Muslims, and Christians all believe in a single god who created the Universe and may share other attributes, then, regardless of the name people of those various faiths call that god and regardless of difference between them, it must be the same god. By definition, there can only be ONE "one universal god".  "Sikhs dislike the very IDEA of eternal damnation" Good for them. I find the idea horrid and repulsive. It's against any concept of a just or merciful god, but it gives the people who believe that idea (who always seem to think they will never end up in that status) license to be condescending and worse towards people they don't like.  Again, thank you for your comment
Surprised the PC Brigade hasn't imposed mandatory niqabs on the ladies  to make the victimized Muslims feel more at home. Where is Justin on this injustice? Surely he will need to set aside a day in the House of Commons to apologize for this affront. And maybe even a visit to the Mosque.
Exactly what "old stock" Canadian tradition is being disparaged by letting some students use an empty classroom? You do know that there have been Muslims in Canada for close to 150 years I hope? I think that gives them the right to be considered "old stock" as well. And since you brought up traditions, you do realize that religious accommodation IS a Canadian tradition, right? After all Section 93 of the Constitution, which goes back to the BNA act and the formation of Canada allows for religious accommodation. That's what there are Catholic school boards.
It's time someone shook up this infiltration of Muslim mania.   If they can't solve their problems in their own country, it's not  going to happen on the soils of Canada and USA either, yet they're coming in droves.   The numbers are building.   People really need to sit back and look at it from a distance.  They are worming their way into our free societies, demanding THEIR rights be acknowledged.    I just don't understand why North America doesn't get it.   Praise Jesus in the Middle East and be slaughtered.    Muslims, come to this land and demand  rights for their religion.  Really?  You learn really fast!!!    We'll all be wearing turbans in the not too distant future and I suggest you rush out to get a prayer mat as well.  Get the right one or you'll lose your head in the downward position.
I for one am thankful that "Islam is peace" - Imagine how chaotic the world would be if Islam was hatred , or if Islam were intolerance, or if Islam was misogyny , or if Islam was violence.. - - - thank goodness that "Islam is peace"
But the man was a British citizen.  There was no way the Brits could have denied his re-entry into the country.  Likewise many of the people committing terrorist acts are actually European citizens they would largely not be affected by the ban. Furthermore the band does not include predominantly Muslim countries whose citizens have previously attacked us includingcitizens from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.  The travel restrictions abscess gaping holes it really does not make us safer and only serves to alienate other countries and communities
I think it is time for Sajjan to intervene and stop the conflict in Saudi Arabia and solve the schism between Sunni and Shiia plaguing Islam for the last 1500 years. He is 'faster than a speeding bullet, more power than a locomotive, and can leap tall buildings in a single bound'. Sajjan 'has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Sajjan, who can change the course of mighty rivers and bend steel in his bare hands'.
The amount of hate mail received by the minister is proof that many of those who claim to defend freedom of speech really want freedom to insult, express hatred and threaten. But we already knew that.  Why don't people be honest and state that they do not like Muslims, rather that twist themselves like pretzels to pretend that they are really reasonable friendly people who will defend freedom of speech against all enemies.
Will there be any Christian refugees or will they be only Moslem?
Since 800 AD Muslim armies have eyed Europe. .  Islam means "submission" and Europe is in the process of submitting to Islam a bit more every year. But today its called "multiculturalism".   Taqiyya always proceeds conquest.
So it has been islamic terroists for 12 yrs and now it's N Korean Nuclear War?  What? Where is the NWO trying to lead us?  I'm confused, What about Islam cutting white peoples heads off an blowing up kiddy concerts?
Yes, it means nothing in the context of his entire lifetime.  That was the belief of the black American Muslims at the time and in many ways, who can blame them?  White people treated blacks abominably.  But he did a lot of good things too and touched a lot of people's lives a positive manner.
More condescending sanctimony from Canadians about the affairs of another country. Canada needs to clean up its own mess such as mass shootings of vulnerable Muslims in Quebec.  Unlike Canadians, Americans and their Government officials have been victims and are targeted worldwide and at home by Islamic fundamentalists on a daily basis .  The attacks at home in the US have not been by 'regular Americans' but those responsible have been influenced by radical Islamists and their hate cult. Radical Islam is not indigenous to the US but has been introduced by militant superstitious fundamentalists from Muslim majority countries and which have training camps in the 7 countries. The proper verification of identities and intentions of people from the 7 failed states that have known terror training camps is prudent. These threats come from Canada also. Remember Ressam the Canadian passport holder from Montreal in 1999 caught at the BC border with a car of explosives going to bomb LAX?
Yes, I've been to what you probably call "the Muslim quarters in Paris", and they're great.  Have you?
And Trump disavow white supremacist and the Neo Nazi, THREE TIMES. Something your side has yet to do with Radical Islamic Terrorists. Where did Trump said he needed support from white supremacist? You've ask me for specifics in the past, now I'm asking you. If it's the NY Times they have had to retract five stories, for out and out lying about what Trump has said.  I saw the Charlie Hebdo cartoon depicting Neo Nazi's drowning in Texas, and  it make me think that this is what the world thinks of America, thanks to the left and the media. Which maybe what the left and the media wants the world to believe about America. If that the case, how sad, especially for those in the media that have that vision, I can also include teachers, and the Democrat party as well. By the way the KKK was started as a Democrat militia. And if we examine all these groups, they have more in common with Democrats and liberals, then with conservatives, and Republicans.
Comments along the lines of "far right fringe (including some neo-fascist) " indicate some tendency on the part of the left to call anything it dislikes "fascist" and to make clear it has no clue as to what fascism was or is.  Angela Merkel's traction in Europe is slipping fast not because she is "a 'real' christian", but because the influx of Muslims into Europe she advocated has led to a sharp increase in terrorism and conflict in Europe.  People generally do not support high-minded programs that do not work.
Aw gee, Michael.  It all depends on whose ox is being gored when religion and politics attempt to  ride in the same cart.   As I said yesterday in response to another article on this subject,  if the judicial candidate was perhaps Muslim and that person had made public statements, verbally and in writing, that implied their religious beliefs and teachings were above the Constitution and rule of law,  you had better bet the GOPers and their bishop BFFs would be all over that person with even more questions...  and not very friendly accusations too.   There is nothing anti-Catholic about holding folks accountable when they seek a position of power that has real consequences in the lives of ordinary citizens.   Actually,  we need more accountability in the secular government AND in the Church,  not less.   No one, regardless of religion,  should get a free pass.
What world do you live in? . I find it hard to believe that you could be so naive. I rather believe that you have an agenda, above and beyond what an average persons' affiliations on the subject could be. . It is indeed sad that not a single open discussion, or a debate about Islam (and it's agenda) has taken place in Canada. Ever. Muslim community has grown by how much in the last 10-20 years? How many Muslim MPs? And yet Canada is now officially 'Islamophobic' - courtesy of the Liberal sell-outs. +1
This kind of episode will become commonplace all over the West in 21st century.  The 20th century was consumed by the fight between the Right and the Left. This century will be a struggle between the Right and the Wrong - between Believers and non-Believers.  “Le XXIe siècle sera religieux ou ne sera pas”: prophesied Andre Malraux (d 1975) a Minister in de Gaulle’s Cabinet and the darling of the godless Left. (The 21st century will be a religious one, or it shall not be).  Indeed. The world has become increasing “religious” since Malraux departed. Even the Democrats in the US and Liberals in Canada have started talking about god.  With Islam resurgent after a few centuries of torpor it will challenge Corporate Capitalist Democracies militarily, financially, morally, spiritually, and intellectually, with an alternative socio-economics, attracting the disaffected youth of the West just as Communism did for last 100 years. Expect this century to be bloodier than the last. Are you ready?
And yet, Miss Parker had no problem with our previous president getting cozy with the Muslim brotherhood, you know, the folks who approved of the 9/11 attack on our country. Likewise with Cuban dictators, Iranian dictators, arming ISIS and Al Qaeda as well (discovered through Wikileaks via the Benghazi disaster but unreported by her newspaper). Yah, a true valued opinion, there. Real non-partisan.
This is funny. We spend years stripping religion out of public schools and then a small group of people want it, so the mass should cave? There is a whole religious school system that parallels the public school system. Send the Muslim kids to catholic schools. Problem solved.
Many people in the US just died because of increasingly intense hurricanes battering the coasts - as predicted - and our usual suspects here spend their time foaming at the mouth about "Islamic terrorists". If they spent even a smidgen of the same energy pressing governments to act on global warming it would be far more productive.
Not quite. You are seriously dumbing down everything.  It HIGHLY depends what kind of decisions a person is making, something that I think would be quite obvious.  I 'feel' like it will be a nice sunny day today to match my mood, think I'll go outside in a t shirt.  Turns out I'm NOT going to go with that decision and will first check the weather, AND the reality!   And I'm not sure where you get the idea that rational thinking only happens in your sleep, you'll have to provide some evidence of THAT claim. It certainly throws the scientific method out the window.      As for 'emotions', muslims aren't causing the emotion any more than seeing amish, mennonite, or seeing minimum wage workers who live in poverty does. If you emotions are 'triggered' (sorry), then its up to YOU to figure out what triggered them and why.  And muslims in canada have done NOTHING that should cause ANY 'emotion'.
It's important to distinguish between the large majority of peaceful muslims who live here and the articles of faith within Islam itself.  Couillard is walking a very fine line when he criticizes Islam as a faith.  Islam should be criticized in the same way all religions should.  There are articles of faith in Christianity and Judaism that deserve criticism. too.    One view of jihad, for example, may be found here: http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/violence.aspx.    Western muslims may subscribe to another view:  http://islamicsupremecouncil.org/understanding-islam/legal-rulings/5-jihad-a-misunderstood-concept-from-islam.html?start=9  Clearly, these views come from a reading of the same texts.  That they can be interpreted so differently shows that in the Quran itself lies the problem of Islam.  That the attacker mentioned in the article was surprised (and possibly disappointed) that he wasn't killed is a clue as to what version of Islam he believes.
Now how about the studies on muslim immigrants? Do they overwhelmingly adapt over their prev culture?
Kag, once Hobson comments, since I muted him (since I won't waste any of my time) I can't comment to you.  McMaster may not be a Dem, but he believes in a big int'l gov't body to solve the viper's den of the whole Middle East/Islamic world. Too many have died and too much has been thrown down that rathole. It is an irredeemable vast area that does not wish to live peaceably with their neighbors, Muslim or otherwise. The world must go on without them importing hate to every corner. Until they wish to solve their own problems, let's contain it.  McMaster thinks otherwise.
I agree. I remember being attacked on Facebook for saying Orlando was an ISIS-inspired, Islamist terrorist attack. Too many people wanted it to be a hate crime against LGBT people rather than face the fact it was an Islamic terrorist attack. If you said it was ISIS you were condemned as a bigot and an Islamophobe. However the terrorist wrote on his Facebook, texted from his phone, and did his best to let everyone know he was carrying out a terrorist attack in support of ISIS. He never mentioned gays once. The reason (I'm sure) he chose to attack the nightclub was a) he knew the place inside out, b) knew where the doors, exits, windows, toilets, etc were, and c) he knew there would be a lot of people there.
You say that many Canadians believe some Islamic countries violate women's rights. But then you say they are entitled to their opinion.  It's not an opinion; it's a fact.  I can't think of any state in the Islamic world that respects women's rights.
Christian have been creating war in America since the 60's. A war against men, a war against drugs, against freedom, against sexuality, against the internet, against language, against islam (with jews in the middle.)  All we want is peace but as long is there religion in Canada and the USA i won't happen.Canada is particularly bad off because it is written in the Constitution, special rights for religion which we have to keep paying for.
If you've written this specifically for the G&M then you need to take better care in who your audience is. Hate crimes, Islamophobia, racial discord and all the rest for the most part is only reported here if it happens in the U.S. Crimes of this nature that occur in Canada itself are not often covered. Western Europe much, much less. Yesterday a Muslim girl was killed by an American in the U.S. and that was covered here with the implication that it was a case of Islamophobia in the  U.S. while the American media was already calling it the result of  road rage. It would be relatively rare to report racist-type activity occurring in Western Europe here. The news that is covered seems to very much fit a particular G&M narrative. This is not the right context for your article on Islamophobia, white supremacy and far-right terrorism. As presented to Canadians, that behavior only exists in the U.S. for all practical purposes.
"Rabbi Reuven Firestone, Amir Hussain and Pim Valkenberg only briefly spoke about the election results itself. An especially poignant moment came when Firestone, overcome with emotion, said, "If it turns out that Muslims are registered … I don't think it will ever work. It reminds people like me about what happened to my parents.""  We hear you, Rabbi Firestone!  We must all work together to stop Trump from turning our nation into the Fourth Reich.
Wow, you are deluded.  How was Christianity kicked out of school when you have dedicated Catholic schools that are publicly funded?  You have no objection to that, but object to Muslim students who just want to pray in a regular school?  You should be ashamed of yourself.
Mainstream Media reporters are ignorant of Christianity, and Judaism, because their Master strives to remove Christianity and Judaism from American life.  Accordingly, the religions are seldom mentioned in the media, except in reports of lawsuits by atheists, claiming denial of rights.   However, their Master takes an entirely different approach to reporting of Islam.  Islam is glorified, although its doctrines are never discussed.   It is considered "Islamophobic" to even mention the doctrine of "death to infidels", and accordingly, there is no mention, even if the Ayatollah shouts it.   The Muslim World, however, takes the doctrine very seriously.  The two major branches of Islam, the Sunnis and the Shia, each consider the other to be "infidels", and they have been killing each other for centuries, for that reason.  They still are, today, and of course, they are killing non-Muslim "infidels', as well.
Under the circumstances, a native land claim on Brampton is entirely possible.  Just imagine  natives telling Chinese, South Asians or Muslim immigrants to get off their land.   White man won't be here forever to protect natives from reality and it won't be pretty.
Canadians should support the Muslims. They will bring law and order back to society. The new proposed pot laws is against their religious and cultural beliefs. All this stuff about LGBTQQS2 rights and 65 different pronouns nonsense will be simplified.  We need to elect their MPs into government. Bring in the sanity of Sharia law against the lawlessness of Canadian gutter society.  Go Mo Go!
How can the government be a champion of de-radicalization as long as they/we support oppressive regimes like Saudi Arabia and others in the Middle east?  Saudi Arabia actively promotes and supports an extremist version of islam. Saudi Arabia executes gays, publicly beheads people, removes hands as a form of punishment, crucifies people, bans non-muslims from some cities, has a complete ban on non-muslim religions and oppresses women.    Yet our government supports Saudi Arabia and pretends they are an ally. Look at Qatar and other "moderate" muslim countries like Kuwait and the UAE ....... how do they treat gays, women, and religious minorities? They all support fundamentalist islam. Yet they all escape criticism from the government. Freeland is comfortable criticizing Russia for its many abuses, but compared to our pretend allies in the Middle East, Russia is a liberal paradise.   Why the double standard?
Killary was first to cry that maybe Obama was not born in US, since he was raised by his porn star mother in Muslim countries.  Donald Trump's favorite son in law is jewish. His daughter just gave birth to  his grandson who is  also therefore jewish. As for Stephen Bannon, is he racist because he doesn't approve of millions of illegal migrants coming to this country & committing crimes, breeding indiscriminately , and giving the legal taxpaying citizens of this country the bill for it all?  Osamabama should be sending ICE & DEA agents & buses to these riots  , Surround them & only let them out after ID's are checked & searched for drugs. What would the probable cause be you say ? How about rioting, arson, assault , etc. Those are all felonies in most states. In fact you can be sentenced to death for far less in all Muslim countries. I know liberals, nothing anyone says will resonate with you if it's not what you want to hear. Just like a 2 year old who screams & cries to get their way.
Wilders - like Trump and the Brexit gang - rely on the reactionary, naive, and uneducated to get votes.  Mr. Wilders wants to ban the Quran, but how? Sure, bookshops could be banned from selling it, but how will they go about getting every single one in the Netherlands? A Quran police force?  What about university departments that study the Quran as an historical document the same way they do the Bible or the Torah? Are they banned as well?  The Quran is widely available online in many different formats, so is putting a nationwide internet filter the way to go now?  When dissecting his campaign, the policy sounds more fascistic than one of freedom. Banning books, filtering the internet and controlling thought is the way to keep the campaign promises. It starts with Islam, but where does it end? You'd have to be naive to think that you're never going to be in the firing line...
So tell me again about how loving, peaceful and tolerant Islamists are.
Do you think a 99.9% (D) state (based on representation in state and nat'l gov) with an AG that's challenging his Muslim ban (and making headlines at it) is going to be considered for anything at all at the trough???  Regardless of what kind of infrastructure project???
Lots of muslims do that, even though they are in no way responsible.    On the other hand, this article - about muslim high school students so threatened that they need police protection at school - was met with mostly scorn and contempt, or silence, about their situation.
"Why is it the Globe for example has two hijabis writing columns about Muslims, and none of them ever come out clearly about their actual beliefs and behaviors in society,"  And now we're right back to a few months ago when you were demanding that Muslims essentially prove their loyalty so that you would feel safe.
Current live coverage says sources indicate that there was no consultation with Departments of Justice or State before the E. O. was issued. Apparently it's the product of the White House acting again on what Trump believes rather than the facts and existing law. This is will place U. S. citizens and forces abroad at risk and contribute to potential radicalization of Muslims already here.  The lack of analysis and forethought is staggering. The failure to consult knowledgeable experts is inexcusable.The effort to have the American public "be afraid, very afraid " as started by Bush/Cheney has resumed and is being given voice and reinforced by official action.
Actually DB-TA I'm not presuming anything. I'm using the actually comments of the opponents to the Muslim cemetery or Muslim prayer space in schools as the basis for my opinion. It isn't a question of peepholes, it's a question of rational thought versus ignorance and prejudice.  Tell me, do you think comments such as the following are examples of rational, logical thought?  “This cemetery is just the embryo of other projects,” one person wrote in an e-mail to the town’s mayor. “These people are here to grab religious and political power.”   "We just lost half the value of our homes!”  One speaker complained of giving Muslims “VIP” treatment by allowing them their own cemetery.  a petition complaining that “unsolicited exposure to religion” could “create subconscious bias in the minds of impressionable children for or against a faith.”  If those opposed to a Muslim cemetery and to Muslim prayer space in schools have a cogent, rational argument then I'd really like to hear it.
After seeing undercover camera footage of Mosques in Britain, I'm not too sure if I'd consider this anti-Muslim, or being vigilant. If these prayer meetings have nothing to hide, then what's the problem?
" ...With their escape route to the United States endangered by the orders of President Donald Trump, the people of Somalia now face a new threat: a looming famine that could bring starvation to millions..."  So millions of Somalis are going to starve because their "escape route" has been blocked by Trump ?! And then the media ( the G&M included ) wonder why their audience fades and they have to ask for government help.  The broader context is that Somalia suffers from grotesque overpopulation considering the marginal environment, never mind the Muslim induced civil war ... the whole sad scenario largely self inflicted. No amount of aid will ultimately solve this problem but merely perpetuate it.  Emigration of a few thousand refugees will most certainly make no difference whatever. Life is cheap - the quality of life not ......
Telling the muslims to keep their religion private is islamophobia? I can tell while you are rich enough to travel around the world on your CPP benenfit, you are not well informed.
Can you explain why you postulate, in your term : " God loves us ".   According to UNICEF - About 29,000 children under the age of five –  21 each minute – die every day. During the Black Plague in the Middle Age, some 75,000,000 to 200,000.000 infants - toddlers - teenagers - adult men, women, pregnant women, deacons, nuns, priests, RCC hierarchy, as well as Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus as well as all other Religions were killed. The Spanish Flu of 1918 killed from 50,000,000 to 100,000,000 of the above. According to HHS, in 2012 some 21,000,000 fetuses worldwide suffered miscarriage and died.   Why does your God so torture and prolong the death of so many who are suffering so horribly - especially the children ?  Could it be He isn't the loving God Christians believe Him to be ?
If you oppose ALL 'religious discrimination" including discrimination against Muslims will you please state for the record that you specifically oppose discrimination against Muslims. There are so many comments saying that the motion should only be made in a general sense but I never seem to see a single one of them specifically acknowledge that Islamophobia or anti-Muslim hate is to be opposed. That really calls into question the motives of those who only want the motion to be completely non-specific.
Dana, you asked whether or not these women at the SF airport would have made similar comments about veiled Muslim women. I think they would. Bigotry and prejudice knows no boundaries when it involves any person described as "other" than one's self.
No you couldn't say the same about Israel, because Israel is about 18%  Muslim.
Canadian non-Muslims need to show solidarity for the existing Constitution and Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  And equating "Islamophobia" to anti-Semitism is deeply troubling.  The Jews faced a horrendous holocaust of astronomically diabolical proportions.
Are you a muslim Alceste?
You're only allowed to admire islamic traditions when commenting on the G&M. Admiration for any other traditions is verboten
It becomes increasingly clear that none of the people around Trump have much real knowledge about the world, or history.  This gang pushed the Muslim ban through without sufficient discussion or thought, and now they are twisting like pretzels to justify.  KelleyAnne probably read a few words somewhere about Bowling Green without understanding it, and decided it would help her boss.  I know Trump doesn't like to read, but honestly doesn't anyone else read fluently either?
And I suppose all of the Democrat  "interference" with, oh....let's say President Bush...was not interference?....Just politics in action?  Perhaps let us look at Pelosi's visit to Assad as an example.  THAT was interference.....  PE Trump called on Obama to resign for refusing to use the phrase "radical Islam."  Perhaps a strong reaction - but tell me.  Did you have a problem with Democrats when they called on Pres. Bush to resign?  You can't have it both ways, Steven.
If you check the numbers, dad, there are more acts of terrorism done in the name of Christianity than there is in the name of Islam.’ And factually, that’s the truth.”  _________________________  That's not true. They kill  and maim people everyday in Countries that use Islam as law and the slavery of women in burkas is fascism at its highest level. Add further, the word Islam in Arabic means "submission"
It is obvious it  was always Trudeau's intention to ENRICH  Khadr,  not merely compensate him. $1 million would still have been sufficient compensation but wouldn't have been sufficient for Trudeau's desire to curry favour with Canada's Muslims.  Trudeau has a personal connection to Khadr that is verges on collusion.
In every country where the niqab is common, are women treated as equals? Are homosexual rights protected? Is there a free press? Is religious satire and criticism protected under free expression? Why does the Globe support the appeasement and accommodation of a symbol representing a belief system that is fundamentally incompatible with Canadian values. Instead they defend a symbol of repression under the guise of diversity? The Globe goes out of its away to ignore reformers such as Tarek Fatah or Ayaan Hirsi Ali under a misguided duty to political correctness. Turkey, a majority Muslim country, experienced over 90 years of secular progress - this included strict rules of secularism that restricted any head coverings in public due to the constant threat of assertive religious conservatives who felt society should be governed by religious law. It has taken one Islamist government under 10 years to roll back 90 years of secular progress. Yet the Globe is incapable of discussing Islamism.
So the ISIS threat just happened to ramp up in time for Trump's debacle of a first ten days, when admid all the hullabaloo Trump ordered Sean Spicer to tell ridiculous lies at his first "press conference," silenced and sidelined career civil servants, appointed a bunch of ideologues and hacks to the cabinet, threatened the media, installed the odious Steve Bannon on the NSC, and started hustling in Russia's national interest by alienating Europe.  Meanwile Orwell's 1984 shot up to first place on amazon's bestseller list.  <<Well, if you understand ISIS threat to American citizens, then you have your answer as to why presidents sometimes impose travel bans.>>  Trump can't even be bothered to sit through intelligence briefings, how would he know the first thing about the level of threat. Steve Bannon and Mike Flynn want a holy war against Islam and that's what this is about.  I used to think your naif act was just that, but now I'm beginning to wonder.
a muslim doing muslim stuff
There was a stand-alone motion about anti-semitism just two years ago. This one is about islamophobia - sadly the fastest-rising form of group hate in Canada AND "and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination."  Tragically, this motion became even more timely after the motion was introduced and before it was debated with the killing of 6 muslim men in Quebec City.
If it wasn't a "Muslim ban" than please inform the President who called it a "Muslim ban".  We saw and heard him say it.  The problem is that the Donald shoots his mouth off first, then has his public spokespersons, some cabinet membes and the V.P. running after him to clean up his mess.  He's like a raging bull in the China-shop of International Relations.
Trump did not call it a "Muslim ban" but Sen Kamala Harris , a Democrat from California did say "Make no mistake -- this is a Muslim ban."   It has been repeated by media outlets and Democratic talking points.
We already have a prison camp for (radical) Muslims.  It's called Gitmo, and progressive hero Obama didn't close it down, despite promising to, despite 8 years, and despite keeping wars going and killing numerous Muslim civilians with drones.  You put up with that, didn't you?
Life imprisonment might be also appropriate. As far as useful information that was obtained his his debriefing, it is good to know at least some good has come out of this situation.  In terms of the prisoner exchange of Taliban/Al Queda for Bergdahl, the positive is that our side gets a chance to kill them. Personally, I am of the opinion that most of these Islamic fundamentalists should be executed on the spot or soon after they are interrogated.  What is the point of keeping them in a place like Guantanamo or a Federal prison somewhere. They are always going to pose a danger due to their religious beliefs and desire to convert the entire world to Islam by force and death.
I'm trying to imagine an article like this if Senator Kelly were a Muslim. Can't see it happening.
“While Israelis are “overwhelmingly well-intentioned, well-informed, and non-hateful,” the Palestinians “teach their children to hate and”  Someone with so much experience with the fanatical settlers certainly knows better.  The excellent Canadian documentary, "Lessons In Fear" shows that, while Palestinian animosity stems from what they experience under Israel's brutal,  illegal military occupation, Israeli schoolchildren are fed a revisionist version of their own history in state-supported schools, and this breeds hatred and misunderstanding.   New legislation makes it illegal for Arab-Israeli schools to teach about or commemorate the 'Naqba', where over 800 thousand Palestinians were driven from their homes by Zionist gangs and the fledgling Israeli military when Israel was founded.  It ends on a hopeful note, profiling an interfaith Muslim-Jewish school operated by a Christian group, which shows that through dialogue and education, this animosity can be overcome fairly quickly.
Being personally offended by high gubmut officials is nothing new in U.S. politics. How about Bill Clinton's disgraceful personal performances before, during & after his presidency? That offends many of us.   Hilary's arrogant abuse of power re:emails, server,etc. pose a critical security threat to all of us. Her acceptance of the Iran Nuclear deal is beyond tolerable. Her entire political life has been marked by lawless behavior & abject lies.   Trump's egocentric personalization of slights & his buffoonery, disgusting as they are, pale by comparison to the dire threats to the rule of Constitutional law (including possible appointment of B.O. to the US Supreme Court, her compromising of our internal safety by allowing a huge increase in un-vetted muslim immigrants into our neighborhoods, her disdain for our military leaders. She promises to be a magnified version of Obama.    Our choice is far from ideal, but Trump is the lesser of the 2 evils.
History is written by the winner. It is only half of the truth. Yes I know, there have been history written by the losers as well but it isn't until many many years later when those that lived it are long gone. So even the rebuttal to the original history is skewed.  You put way to much faith in schoolbooks.  All you have to do is look at the curriculum of today's educational institutions to know they teach the agenda they want your children to adopt.  As a muslim, I have no doubt that you agree with that statement as well.  Also, every statement I make is an honest statement.  You may not agree with them but you don't the  power to make my statement dishonest.  Only I can do that.  You may have been taught book knowledge. However, you are obviously lacking in the common sense area.
Eugene, I dislike disagreeing with you and so many people who agreed with your comment, but I must do it because it is wrong regarding Muslims not being allowed in Japan.  That simply is not true.  There are more than 100,000 Muslims in Japan.   About 10 percent are local converts, the rest are foreign nationals.   Kobe Mosque, built in 1935, is Japan’s oldest Islamic place of worship, but the Tokyo Camii is the country’s largest. Today, there are more than 80 mosques in Japan, most in major cities with big expat populations such as Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and Yokohama.
Or maybe the Russians are playing games. Nah, that couldn't be it. Yes, Qatar is aligned with Iran. But Saudi Arabia does plenty of funding of nefarious Muslim terrorist groups and actively tries to spread Wahabbi Islam, an extreme fundamentalist form of Islam. You have a feud between Saudi Arabia and Iran and everyone is lining up and playing games. However, Trump says Saudis are cool, so it's the MSM's fault.
I think there are many politicians who set aside their more restrictive beliefs (things that are legal but which they wouldn't do themselves) out of respect for the rights and beliefs of others. In fact I would expect no less from our responsible representatives. Pence puts literal scripture above science, and thus considers the world under God's direct control. This is unacceptable since logic tells us that human waste is changing the climate in dangerous ways. Agnostics, Muslims, Jews and Christians ought to pursue policy that would restore balance to the planet. A belief that "End Times" are near should not sway our representatives to pursue the expediting of the end of the world as a habitable planet for the human species
Are you paying attention to sufferings of Muslim women in the Muslim countries since today is International Women’s Day?
I think in Egypt religious leaders got stricter with women - I don't see what political statement they might be making there (decades ago in Kabul and Tehran, women were dressing like Western women too).  When I was in Cairo some years ago, you barely saw any women on the streets, covered or not.  Here in the West it's different, and I've also heard and read that these coverings are a way of maintaining identity as Muslims (instead of the far better alternative, for the immigrants and our society. which means assimilating).  So definitely political and not in a good way for the nation to which these people immigrated.
I answered your question, Martel, you still didn't answer mine:  Did you chose his name for yourself because you're calling for another war against muslims?
MSW is omitting a salient fact. Professor Barrett had a paper she co-authored in 1998 with John Garvey, who is now president of Catholic University of America. Senator Feinstein suggested that the position Barrett took in her 1998 paper is tantamount to proposing that, for someone sitting on a court bench, religious faith should trump law when the two appear to be in conflict.  This attitude should certainly be questioned, since I would say that a judge's first allegiance should be to the law. His or her religious beliefs should certainly inform the judge's thinking, but the law should take precedence.  I would ask the conservatives who are likely to huff and puff about my belief a question. Suppose a Muslim became a judge. How would you feel if this judge applied Sharia to his or her rulings? What is the difference?
Not even close what?  That it's Christians and Muslims at it, or that they worship the same god?
Is the islamic state going to start funding the NRA? I wouldn't be surprised.
If it is uncommon, it is precisely because it is an extreme that mainstream Muslims themselves abhor. But it is becoming more and more common as extremist islamic fundamentalism spreads as a reaction against "westernization".
We Canadians routinely single out minority groups for special treatment around human rights. Look at the protection offered Jews after WW2, or the LGTBQX community.  Sure we have existing laws in place to protect Canadians of all types from human rights abuses. So technically it is not necessary to cater to special interest groups. However what is wrong with a symbolic gesture like this?  It certainly will not do any harm, and will go a long way to bolster Muslim immigrants to Canada.  I fully support it.
"If we see smallest misstep from the enemies, our roaring missiles will fall on their heads", says the Islamic State of Iran.  Anyone who doesn't understand that what that really means is that Islam is a religion of peace and goodwill towards all peoples is an Islamophobe.
Considering that Justin has never come out and outright denounced radical islamic extremism and refers to those opposed to radical Islam as racists, like Trump, we know exactly where Justins loyalties are.
True enough and you could add Putin and Duterte who both have over 80% approval ratings and they are strongman like Erdogan in non-Muslim countries, nonetheless Erdogan does seem to want to bring religion into politics, whereas the founder of Turkey Ataturk favoured strong secularism.  Is not about Islam, its rather religion and politics being mixed.  Mixing any religion with politics is like oil and water, they do not belong together.  I have no problem with one practicing any religion, but keep it out of politics.  Turkey worked well as a secular country much like most developed countries do.
I have lived in four different Muslim countries for 14  years. Multiple wives were as common as multiple mistresses in Canada. And as legal. Technically in Islam, as I understand, the first wife has to give permission to the husband.  As for jihadis, do you know who they hate most? Secular leaders like Saddam, Assad, Gaddafi, Najibullah, Ataturk, etc. The West encouraged the Mujahideen/Taliban to brutally murder Najibullah, because he was in the Soviet camp. And 9/11 happened as a result.  And let's not forget that tolerance for gays is a recent phenomena. When I travelled in the Canadian Bible Belt in the 1990s, opinion columnists wrote stuff that could have ended their careers if they were living in Toronto or Vancouver. Calgary didn't dare to have a gay pride parade till a few years ago (rottweilers were brought to the parade in earlier years).  "Let he has not sinned, cast the first stone.....
Obama's legacy is -- 7 years of recession, 7 countries bombed (Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya & Syria), destabilized countries (Egypt, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, Yemen), emboldening and possibly funding terrorists (Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, ISIS and Al Qaeda), killing American citizens without benefit of trial (Awlaki), dividing the nation along race & income lines, $10+ trillion in national debt, the highest annual deficits of any president for 6 years in a row, executive actions that have suspended the constitutional rights of Americans, Obamacare bankrupting the middle class. Did you see the jobs report last week?  Great legacy! Not saying Bush did any better ... just pointing out that Obama has been terrible but has largely escaped criticism for his war mongering because liberals are loath to criticize the first black president. If John McCain had won that election and done exactly what Obama has done, his approval ratings would be comparable to Congress.
Both the political parties of the right and left have to deal with their ideological extremists.  Those on the extreme right will allied themselves to the conservative party while those on the extreme left will ally themselves with the NDP even though the mainstreams of both parties do not reflect these views.  I found the attacks on Harper for the "niqab" rather ironic. The articles of clothing worn by middle eastern women was perceived until now as an example of the oppression of those women. BTW the niqab is NOT religious as it has been worn by women long before Islam., its cultural.  The left attacked Kelly Leitch for championing "Canadian values", like I guess "women's rights" and "gay rights".  Do members of the left realize they are supporting the same religious conservatives they have been attacking for years?
Somehow when good things happen because of religion, I do not hear politicians saying: "do not credit that on Islam, it is only a minority who are doing good".  The fact is that revolutionary things, whether very good or very bad, are always done by a fanatical minority inspired by a doctrine. When bad things are done in the name of Islam and are condoned by a sizeable part of the Muslims in the world, we have a serious problem.  Politicians, as usual, are cowards who would rather stick their heads in the sand, live in their gated communities, and enjoy their nice salary and their future pension.  We can't afford Canada to turn into Europe.
Larry. Seriously. What exactly was their motivation? Their beliefs. If they'd been islamic anything or just a little too brown we'd happily call it terrorism. Keep the boogymen alive. Why we avoid talking about domestic terrorism as anything but mentally ill is a sad and misleading ploy to avoid that we have more american bred nutjobs than we'd like to talk about. But hey, if you've got your own predetermined beliefs (mainly to confirm a stereotype) then the conversation is pretty pointless.
What is your definition of fee speech then Ross. Like all Liberal Communist types you define free speech as a speech that agrees with your twisted view  It is your view that is twisted,  We are trying to ensure our country isn't taken over by sharia law.  You come to Canada you become Canadian first, not Muslim first. You do not bring your hate of Christians with you  That is not racist.   To educate yourself instead of yapping form your couch, go to Britain and go onto the 100's of no=go zones where white Christians are beaten by Muslim gangs. That will change you...  It changed me when I was beaten
Yes, any law school that required students to take a religious oath as a condition of attending the school -- whether Christian or Muslim or whatever -- would not be accredited in Ontario.    That is the point that the Ontario government is making in their intervention:  that Ontario hasn't allowed religious oaths to be required of those practicing law in Ontario for over 100 years so that everybody has the same opportunity to go to law school and practice law regardless of what religious beliefs they may have.  The position Ontario has taken is to protect the religious freedom of everybody.
The Taliban Muslim followers of Islam used to govern Afghanistan and the U.S.A. and its allies used to deal with the Taliban government.  If Islam is so good, why don't the U.S.A. and its allies pull out of Afghanistan and let the Taliban followers of Islam take over again?
All through the middle east Muslims have forced Christians and Jews and other minorities from their homes, burned their Churches and Synagogues and the UN and their 'human rights' bodies do nothing and say nothing.  Burma who is under attack from muslim rebels and terrorists say no.  They will not be subjected to the terrorism and violence that has followed wherever muslims go.  And they are pillared by the so called 'civilized' world.  We should be thanking and supporting them.
Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Immigration has already stated categorically that he will not open Canada's doors to Christians. That would be religion faith based immigration policy and against our secular moral standards. He said just a couple of weeks ago that Christians don't face the same dangers as other legitimate refugees. He will however welcome all Muslims fleeing Trump's persecution in the US.
ZERO religion in schools....it is as simple as that.....I don't give a flying fig how much the Muslim community engages with school boards, and the courts are so very wrong in allowing, nay, accommodating this.
What nonsense.  Yours is the type of comment used by "progressives," to dismiss without thought the types of discussions that Mark Milke lays out in his article.   You just label any admission that we have Canadian values and that we should rely on them in deciding who to invite into our country as, "xenophobia, Islamophobia, homophobia, bigotry and hate" and the discussion will presumably end.    However, it won't.  Because the discussion is none of those things.  It is all the things Mark Milke sets out in his article.  You can misrepresent the things that Canadian Values are, and what they embrace, but it doesn't change the fact that we as Canadians have such defining values and that we should cherish and support them.
The common thread in both examples is tolerance and acceptance of difference. I would call those Canadian values.  Viewed through that lens, supporting Muslim prayer for 15 minutes per week and supporting LGBT rights in Catholic schools are perfectly consistent stances.
This should be shut down before what happened in Europe happens here. Islam should not be allowed to spread in our schools.
If by islamophobia you mean fear of the disgusting wahhabi/salafist strain of Islam that considers non-believers as less than human, condemns women to chattel slavery, prescribes death for blasphemy, and is an insult to basically all fundamental principles of liberal democracy, then call me an islamophobe.   If Muslim Canadians want to reduce the distrust and contempt directed towards them by parts of the country, they have to start being more vocal in their opposition to the extremist elements among them who tar the reputation of that whole religion. But as long as they sit by and apologize for the salafists, things will keep getting worse. Condemning the oppressive niqab would be a good start. I'm not holding my breath, though.
Google "Kaepernick's girlfriend" and you'll understand his Muslim-inspired antipathy toward his White parents and the country that made him rich -- for now.
My granddaughter attended a march in Orlando. Not one hate chant told hold. All was peaceful. They were there to say this man does not represent my values, along with their gay, trans, Mexican, black, Muslim, Jewish friends.
French President Macron  said basically the same thing to the French Council of the Muslim Faith.
Most world leaders don't use term Islamic extremism because they don't want to tar an entire religion- along with its 1.4 billion followers- over the acts of a few. On the other hand, bigots LOVE the term Islamic extremism for the same reason.
You're right, of course, that it's not rational to blame an entire group of people for the actions of a few.  But bear this in mind: when their prophet Mohammed was made fun of in a Danish cartoon a number of years ago, Muslims from around the world - including those in secular states - called for the death of the cartoonist and the economic crippling of Denmark. People were murdered, an embassy was attacked in contravention of international law.  And yet, when an act of Muslim terrorism takes place, what do we hear from the Muslim world? Do they decry the violence carried out in their name?  Their silence is deafening.
“The challenge we’re all talking about is that, we can only query against that (data) which we have collected,” FBI Director Comey said. “And so if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but there would be nothing show up because we have no record on it.  Here's how it works:  If you have a big bowl of M&M peanuts and one of them contains enough arsenic to kill you, would you risk eating any of them or allow your family to eat any of them?  Surely you can understand that analogy, Yes?  FYI, Many Muslims in America believe Sharia Law supercedes the US constitution.  https://youtu.be/NGaO3NKJa-8
If someone wanted to change the zoning regulations to put a cemetery next to my property I'd probably vote "No" too. No matter which religion requested it. Looking out my back window at people digging graves would not be my favourite pastime.  The columnist claims to take the high road by not calling the residents anti-Islamic bigots, but of course does exactly that by putting the words clearly down on paper. It is certainly possible that some residents may have anti-Muslim feelings, but tarring the whole community with an anti-Muslim brush is as ridiculous as labelling all Muslims as terrorists.  The community voted down the changing of a zoning bylaw as they are entitled to do.  Get over it. To suggest that there is a "ban" on Muslim cemeteries is disingenuous at best and the fomenting of religious hatred at worst.
Every single one of the problems these refugees from Syria are having integrating to Canadian life was entirely foreseeable.  And why were they foreseeable ?  Because almost all of the Syrian refugees hold islamic political beliefs, which are incompatible with western norms which cherish individual freedoms and defend equality of men and women before the law. Christian Syrian refugees would no doubt also struggle to integrate, but at least they would be trying to.
Darn good scribbling Mr. Tampon. I like your (banishment) comparison to Bedouin Societies. The mirroring Inuit with Arab-Muslim culture/DNA stings a bit, but true. Similarly, our Siberian marked A-4 allele cursed our lineage with an intolerance to alcohol and blood glucose spiking starches, carbs, sugar loaded soda pop and candy. Albeit, us Eskimos consume way to much of them. On KBRW's Alaska Public Radio I listened in rapt attention to the debate allowing us to spend our Quest (welfare/food stamps) on pop and candy. God bless Ted Stevens for inserting that exemption into our obviously unneeded SNAP programs. SNAP implies Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, but no way guarantees it.  Our local Alaska Commercial/UIC partnered grocery store sells $20,000 worth of cigarettes, pop and candy everyday. That's a whole lot of missing teeth and Type II obesity related insulin resistant Diabetes.  "Ever since my father lost one of his lungs, he cut his smoking in half" (Cheech & Chong).
The Mexican Drug Cartel Families do not like Armalite AR-15s, M-4s and M-16s due to jamming and a lack of stopping power and range, and prefer the reliable AK-47.   That's correct AR means Armalite not Assault Rifle, ignorant Demonrat anti gun nuts.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation stumbled on the Alliance with the Mexican Drug Cartels and the Muslim Terrorist Organizations, as FBI Agents posing as Mexican Drug Cartel Members at Mexico were approached by a Member of Iran's Qods (Quds).  Iran's Qods was going to Assassinate the Saudi Arabian Envoy to the U.S. at Washington D.C., the FBI had everything under Surveillance, starting with the smuggling of Iran's Qods Agents into the U.S. from Mexico, the Mexican Illegal Aliens transporting Iran's Qods to Washington D.C., the Mexican Illegal Alien Gangs at the U.S. providing Iran's Qods with Weapons, Explosives, Safe Houses and Intelligence.  The FBI raided Homes of Mexican Drug Cartel Family Members that were Illegally at the U.S..
"Montreal company Mode-ste blends Islamic values with high fashion"  Isn't that an oxymoron, I thought modesty was imperative in Islamic values.. Fashion (in its true sense) doesn't come to mind when modesty is involved.
Indeed, 9/11 was 16 long years ago.   Intelligence agencies don't necessarily work what happened in the past; they tend to look at the location of current threats.     Not being invited to classified intelligence briefings, you don't know what Intelligence knows.  In any case, it's the stuff of conspiracy theories to say that since only certain Muslim countries are singled out, is somehow evidence that the entire project must have just been a global  demonstration of racism.
So why vote Republican? Only 6 R's voted against going into Iraq. 126 Democrats voted against it and our Bernie as an Independent also voted against it. I believe Mr. and Mrs. Khan talked at the DNC because they are Muslim.  Trump's hateful position on Muslims is what brought them there. They've listened to trump and find him morally bankrupt. Get it?
"Trump is trying..."   I don't think anybody knows what Trump is trying to do.  It's possible--having read a letter from Wisconsin--that he really does believe Canada is a villain.  Yesterday.  Today?  Maybe not so much.  Who knows?  Meanwhile, there is a naval Commander standing on the bridge of an aircraft carrier Just off the North Korean coastline, surrounded by missile cruisers and destroyers , and he's asking, "Your orders, sir?" And we really don't know what Trump is trying to do.  And neither does he.    Big, big meeting of the uniforms and suits yesterday to "plot the course" out there.  The best one guy at the table can say after the meeting was, "It was OK."  Trump: "Can we do diplomacy or something?"  Ans: "Difficult, sir, because we seem to have a shortage of diplomats at the moment..."  Where or where did that 100 days go?  Oh, right: banning Muslims.  Firing Foreign Affairs people.  Tweeting at 3 am. Golfing in Florida.  Holding rallies.  Stuff like that.
God Blessed Fathers and MOTHERS with their beloved Children. God gave his ONLY Son to save ANYONE accepting his Son's Sacrifice. That Sacrifice is available to Jew, Gentile, Muslim or any other! I am unworthy but fully accepted God's Son's Sacrifice to provide my path to Heaven.  Happy Father's Day!!
How should we judge the 9/11 pilots, and the scores of murderous bombers, stabbers, shooters and drivers who've followed their actions in countries that span the world?  One isolated nut case does not make much of a case for widespread 'anti-Muslim hatred.'
How is a Muslim cemetery different from a non-denominational or pan-religious cemetery? Are the available cemeteries Catholic-only? Or are Muslims not allowed to be buried in the same area as non-Muslims?  As a sign of diversity, I would like to see those of various religious faiths (and the faithless) be intermingled in their burials.
I really appreciate this column Ms. Wente. I'm helping a Syrian family: they are Suni Moslems and they are incredibly generous and loving people. I have never known a family more loving in their conduct toward each other, and more patient in the face of misfortune caused by others - such as when key items of of their furniture were swiped by someone. These are really wonderful people. And if you want to dig into statistics, the performance of second generation immigrants exceeds just about any other group. I'm a 7th generation Canadian raised as Tory and a Christian. So the folks who are seeing things so negatively need to open up to better possibilities and help make that happen.
hey ed op  i think you mean islamicists not islamics   no such thing - as islamics  there are muslims though  - perhaps its easier for you  to call them that
McVeigh was a Muslim, righr?
Who's being naive?  The president has every right to ban entry from the several countries that have been a problem with terrorism. Frankly, I'm all for it. It's about time that America had a leader with a backbone, instead of a shameless apologist for the Islamists, and a backstabber to Israel.
Merkal is to blame. She did this. Invited Islam crazies into Germany.
This 'culture' created a game out of men raping women.  Taharrush.    This is now documented and spreading in Europe following the Muslim refugees/migrants.  In my opinion, there is something endemically wrong with this ideology if it somehow produces a society that believes this is acceptable.   Actions, not words are where the truth hides.
I would say the hundreds of thousands of Muslim soldiers that fought in World War One and Two on the side of the Allies, protected Christians (France, UK, Poland, Belgium, etc).  The Kurdish militia in Iraq that protected Iraqi Christians from ISIS also qualifies.
There's nothing to worry about when it comes to Sufis.  They're mystics and dreamers.  Real Sunni jihadis, like the Taliban in Pakistan, slaughter Sufis, blow up their shrines, curse them as unbelievers.  The range of sects in Islam is almost as wide as in Christianity, where you have everything from Ozarkian snake-handlers to stuffy high-church Anglicans.  If we're going to deal with this situation, we need to understand who is who.
Good point. That is why Canada will be a Sharia state within 20 years. Thanks for offering up the Liberal socialist agenda and truth. I have a question. Why do socialists love  Sharia Islam so much? Dictatorship envy?
I am aware Cynthia Coffman supports Trump's Muslim ban.  I stand by my statement.
What if a group of extremist Muslims carrying assault rifles had wanted to exercise their free speech rights and requested a permit to hold a rally in VA ? Would Trump have said that there were good people on both sides ? Would a permit have actually been issued ?
If we are to proceed on our mass-media’s already heavily propositioned narrative that the motive is based at least largely on a foundation of hate against Muslims, then we might reasonably conclude that the shooter would have harbored a higher degree of tolerance for any Muslim immigrants around him, had he been imbued with the understanding that those immigrants had already been “extremely vetted…” Who knows how many would be mass-murderers are in our society, walking a tightrope without perhaps even their own knowledge, who might be spontaneously pushed over the edge due to some unpredicted new straw in society that broke his camel’s back? Then there would reside a possibility, however remote, that our shooter would NOT have undertaken the massacre, if his own ‘straw’ came down to a matter of extreme vs. non-extreme vetting, no? Here’s a fact: Law degrees do not confer psychic ability, whether your roots are in Egypt, Greece, Persia or Sumeria.
Shame on all of you. FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. Amy has just as much right to bring this to our attention as he does to be an activist. These activist radical muslims have figured out our system. They side with the democrat party, get power and seek Shariah law. Look at Dearborn Michigan, or Minneapolis or Bradford England, you name it. We do not need this infiltration in our society.  Ignore it at your peril.
"I never thought these Friday rituals would become a trigger for self-proclaimed secularists and I certainly never expected that Jummah would become a reason to manipulate and terrorize children I was wrong" ~~ That's quite a statement .. one wonders where the term 'terrorize' figures into this Islamic speech.  Public Schools are just that Public & Secular; if a religious prayer complete with *ritualistic* process segregates, presenting the Public School as a quasi-religious institution complete with sermonizing, then homeschooling or a private education is best for those who prefer to put religion as a priority over an inclusive secular education.  Modern Humans evolved over 200,00yrs & if a 'collective such as religion' can not be  'criticized' then intellectual evolution for some Humans ceases.. obviously.  Only those whose Gender & Age & *Gender* give them *power* over other Humans will slyly manipulate reality to suit their agenda.  Secularism is a choice.  Islam is just a choice.
Sacrifice for the country last happened in WWII.  Dying in Iraq simply means you gave your life to the military industrial complex of the US that exists to make lobbyists and CEOs rich, by the blood of the unquestioning masses.  The war was pointless.and a huge waste and veterans should be ashamed they were duped into thinking there was honor in Iraq.  Trump is right that this Muslim woman doesn't talk enough.  She should have talked her son out of going to die in a war of stupidity.
Google "map of Islamic terroism" here's what comes up...  https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1i_O_lT5CPsJ0orP_jp5A9ZnrtWY&hl=en_US  Then google "map of Christian terrorism"  https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1VuDe0s4k_7dcWp6_qEIsx6LJ2rU&hl=en&ll=12.132512400346576%2C-6.606374899999992&z=1  See a difference? Lol
Sorry, the Faith of the biblical Prophets was likewise Islam.  The name "Judaism" occurs nowhere in the Hebrew Scriptures.  Not ONCE.  The only name given for their Faith is "Shlema".  That's how you say ISLAM in Hebrew.  As in "The prophet which prophesieth of SHLEMA, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that YHWH hath truly sent him."  (Jeremiah 28:9).  Of course King James mistranslated it as 'peace'--shalom.  But that's not the word in the original (Hebrew) manuscript.  The 70% figure was from a Time magazine poll taken in, IIRC, 1989. Pollsters in Israel don't really ask that question the same way in current polls, but rather in terms of 'religious' vs. 'secularist' (I suspect out of embarrassment).  But even Rabbis like Levi Brackman admit that 80% of Israelis are "secularists", with 50% of Israelis self-identifying as atheists.
Always, I remember those days too, and though they are long gone, there seem to be those who wish to bring them back.   The need for more Catholic Christian births to counter an increasing number of Muslims seemed to me to be a subtext of Archbishop Chaput's "Strangers in a Strange Land."
This is not Trumps fault. This holy war was set in motion a long time ago and they are not going to stop. They will use a gun, knife, car if they don't have these they will throw rocks because now the only path to heaven is to die in battle. People need to educate themselves on this Jahed. Not all Muslims are doing this but a good number are. King Kong can blame Trump, You can blame the media but you need to look deeper. Don't be distracted by the liberal media and don't think they are not here. The war is here the only question is when will everyone finally admit it. There is no appeasement. No amount of safe spaces will protect you. We have fought and won wars before but we didn't win by not admitting we were at war. This one will be on our turf, don't drop the ball. You can not win a war by going in halfway. Viet Nam and Korea showed us that. They are willing to die for their beliefs, are you?
I am sure Margaret was told to do a pro muslim piece. The G&M seems to have some significant players who are from the religion that cannot be named.
Did we all forget the former Chris Jackson?  Abdul-Rauf is perhaps best known for the controversy created when he refused to stand for "The Star-Spangled Banner" before games,[40] stating that the flag was a symbol of oppression and that the United States had a long history of tyranny.[41] He said that standing to the national anthem would, therefore, conflict with his Islamic beliefs. On March 12, 1996, the NBA suspended Abdul-Rauf for his refusal to stand, costing Abdul-Rauf $31,707 per missed game.[42] Two days later, he worked out a compromise with the league, whereby he would stand during the playing of the national anthem but could close his eyes and look downward. He usually silently recited Islamic prayer during this time for those who are suffering from all walks of life and ethnic backgrounds.[43]  Seems a compromise can be worked out just as the NBA did over 20 years ago.  The Little Guy
The Canadain government supports Islamic terrorism, their leadership is not a reliable ally.
to add on further, I'm quite amazed the Liberated America Women have not chimed in at all about the Muslim/Islam Religion as it's against what the American Women has fought for, voting rights, doing away with men's only establishments, equal pay, equal respect, etc.. These Liberal women are headed back to the ways of Jesus's times, it's going to be sad seeing this liberated women go back into the ice age times being drag by their hair like an animal buy a male, no say and just do as your ordered to do. I think the LDS religion is Male 1st in Family but the thing is that Religion does not preach to America how it should be run as far as the pecking order in the family.
Top national security aide Michael Flynn, caught in a lie, forced to resign.  · Federal courts block Trumps Executive order banning travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries.  · Trump's plan to immediately "repeal and replace" Obamacare is frozen by the reality that he never had  actually had a health care plan to substitute.  · Mexico's president, insulted by Trump, cancels his state visit. · A contentious call with the Prime Minister of Australia (an American ally) concludes when Trump abruptly ends the call.  · A tail-between-the-legs acceptance of America's longstanding "one China" policy, which he'd threatened to upend.   · An embarrassing display in which he discusses a surprise missile launch by North Korea in the public setting of his Mar-a-Lago club.  · Lies about voter fraud and a "massacre" that never happened have made the administration a laughingstock.
Reports need to include the fact the the Mayor of St. Laurent did not approve mosques bylaw changes - THAT IS WHY TRUDEAU REJECTED HIM! Trudeau put a lot of bad muslim brotherhood types, islamofascists around him and we are now reaping the whirlwind of these tyrannical people. Trudeau needs the noose after a fair trial. He has totally betrayed Canada and Western Civilization.
What makes it improbable to you, Layla4? People do things for reasons. But even road rage is not a reason, itself. Something makes a person angry enough to kill someone who did nothing to deserve that fate. Often as not it is something that makes a guy feel small and weak. Personally, I doubt that El Salvador is anywhere near as anti-Muslim as the U.S.
Muslims are being attacked daily.
"People are killing babies, that's bad isn't it?"  ..."Yeah that's bad!"  "Terrorists are pouring in over our borders and killing us!"  ..."That's awful!"  "I'm the only one who wants to stop this."  ..."You got my vote!"  "Good Christian. Keep thinking the world is that simple."  NOBODY is pro killing babies and nobody is pro terror, pro crime, or pro illegal immigration. If you think an entire group of people are you're delusional. You think it's a coincidence liberal ideas exist in universities? What's so scary about being educated - that you might find out gut reaction ideas are wrong and there are complex issues that might have non-obvious solutions? I used to think these things, but it's because I was isolated and closed-minded. I didn't flip a switch, it was a long process of "Oh...I didn't know that" and learning to have a higher standard for what I accepted as truth and what I required to know before I made an opinion.  And Obama, yeah he got it easy. Muslim non-American.
I lost interest when i read the word, "Muslim".
Well, Egypt wouldn't be on the list as it is the largest recipient of money from the U.S., followed by Israel.   Saudi Arabia, a nest of Wahabi extremism ruled by force and intimidation, is a very good customer of buying goods from the U.S., especially their military equipment.  Egypt's Muslims are increasing their attacks against Egypt's Coptic Christians, yet no ban here.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/in-post-arab-spring-egypt-muslim-attacks-on-christians-are-rising/2016/11/13/f50a18e2-84fc-11e6-b57d-dd49277af02f_story.html?utm_term=.ac3c7c158ab3  Jared Kushner, son-in-law and top advisor to the President, along with the newly appointed US ambassador to Israel (who is pro-settlements) are both financial supporters in Beit El , a hardline settlements project. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/25/trumps-unquestioning-support-could-lead-israel-to-disaster/?utm_term=.10304847ab40  Wake up, folks.  Trump will destroy the world.
I disagree, they labeled  an undefined term in that motion specifically for Islam so it would receive special attention when it wasn't necessary.   The generic motion would have also accomplished the objective.  The anti-Islamophobic motion M-103 in the House of Commons would not pass if regular Canadians, as opposed to MPs, voted on the issue and only one in ten believe the motion would be effective, according to a Angus Reid Institute poll.  Parliament violated their mandate, betrayed the peoples trust and succumbed to pressure from an outside religious source.   All in all the Liberals should resign as protectors of the nation.
"“There is no hiding from climate change. It is real, and it is everywhere,” he said."  And for the most part it is unstoppable until such time as population growth in is brought under control. There's no point in Canadians getting too excited when any reductions they might made are gobbled up in weeks by runaway population growth in Asian and South Asian along with certain Muslim countries.
Gerald Butts' and Minister Hussein's comments are representative of Trudeau's phony two-bit feminism which intentionally deceives Canadians when it surreptitiously kowtows to Sharia Law. Lieberals sure wouldn't want to risk offending Islam when the penalty is death. The sooner we purge Trudeau and his Liberals from government, the better off Canada will be in so many ways.
You got the Muslim community responsible for this State taking action against President Donald Trump.  No surprise for the local liberal Democrats to go against out President and majority of Americans in the United States  and siding with the Muslims.  Take a look at the photo on this article.  You got top Democrats and a lot more Muslims going against the Majority who favors President Trump's immigration executive orders.
Were the radical elements of Christianity (e.g. US Army) that slaughtered indigenous people fundamentalist nut-cases?  No, they were just the extreme end of the curve of the entire religion of the European settlers, 99% of which were peaceful, church-going folks.  It's not ISIS, it's Islam that is coming on strong.
I am not so sure 'Islamophobia' is behind the 'populism' rising in Europe. Many migrants & refugees from theocratic nations grew up in societies where ONLY the Islamic religion is practised while all other forms of religion are considered to be apostasy, punishable by prison, even death. Such beliefs can create an indelible influence. After migrating or fleeing their homelands, many organize to insist host nations change to reflect the beliefs of their homeland. If migrants promote their values & beliefs, why shouldn't citizens in host nations assert their own? If you allow someone to enter your home, you don't expect them to rearrange the furniture, etc, throwing out what they don't like.  There is a slippery slope to such cultural relativism, especially where politicians see potential votes. President Erdogan eliminated evolutionary theory in schools to favour Islam. We do not use old religious texts to design machinery or medical procedures; old ideas cannot design a modern society.
"Trump first tweeted that "Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our 'leaders' to eradicate it!"" This statement is exactly right. The Democrats USED Mr. and Mrs. Kahn to try to badmouth Trump and get votes for  Hilary.Won't work. One thing I've noticed about the terrorists in this country who were Muslim. They are very good about putting on an act and fitting in.
So, criticizing things like Sharia Law, hanging gays in Iran, the mass sexual assaults in Cologne, Germany by Muslim migrants and the ISIS genocides against Christians and other minorities is considered "Islamophobic" and everybody mentioning those things should be silenced???
I read about that, and disagree on that interpretation.  From what I saw, they were teaching kids ABOUT Islam, at a level kids could understand. It was badly handled and some christian evangelical parents panicked.  http://www.snopes.com/islam-tennessee-school/  There's plenty of real events to be worried about, we don't need to make any up.
The scimtar of islam is the seat of anti-christ [1 john 2:22] which has co-opted the nations in the west, and, now even the vatican.  These are flooding into Ireland strategically; logistically utilizing a surgical military precision.  Even as muslim countries continue to dictate political demands; threatening to activate terror cells within the west.  Erdogan  for example declares it will not be safe to walk the streets in Europe, the very same day Ireland was  ringing Church bells celebrating the terror in London.  [visualize a Ireland in a few years with cascading terror events; and, torture dungeons established for online horror]
Sheikh Muhammad bin Musa Al Nasr in the Dar Al-Arqam Mosque in Montreal in March of this year delivered a sermon in which he asks for Jews to be killed. The CBC obtained a tape of it and had two translators verify what he said. No charges have been laid. Now, do you think if I said about muslims what he said about Jews I wouldn't be charged with a "hate" crime? I'll wait for your response as to why he hasn't been charged yet I would.
He was condemned, but for being insane not Christian, no Christian Doctrine nor practicer ever supported him. And the  ruckus in Norway was something else too. What Americans mostly, were furious about, was he only got 21 years.  The other difference for this new murderer is he didn't yell "Allah akbar" nor "In the name of JC"  All these horrendous murders of late  are doing it for Jihad. (Muslim)
I think Obama's legacy will NOT be his refusal to call Muslim Extremist Terrorism what it is; NOT his refusal to take responsibility for his Sec State bungling Benghazi and the death of his Ambassador; NOT his meddling in and exacerbating racially sensitive issues; NOT his loaning millions to failed alternative energy companies owned by his buddies; NOT his poor choice of Fast and Furious Attorney Generals; NOT his etc etc ad nauseam.....  Obama's legacy is going to be rioting in the streets when enough people get fed up with his ACA; When their family, friends and acquaintance's start dying in greater numbers due this to UN - Affordable Care Act; And burgeoning personal bankruptcies when UN-Affordable Health Care premiums have to be scraped together to be paid in lieu of house payments and car payments and childcare and explode the number of homeless and working poor; When the economy tanks because nobody read the ACA..... THAT is going to be Obama's everlasting legacy. Mark my words.
I didn't admit it's wasn't real religion.  Please point out where I did that.  And what makes Islam or any other religion any more "real" than Pastafarianism?
Mr Peanut Butter, https://www.sexyjobs.com/jobs/search?keyword=Washington&searchtype=jobs-location . Here are jobs in Washington State looking for porn stars. I guess you can include Washington in your definition, "One Big Sex Abuse" or there are Soooo many deviants with the worst kind of filth. . If you are looking for someplace to live free of this sexual deviancy, the majority of Muslim countries porn is illegal.   . Your WRONG again Harry, Hillary won the POPULAR vote, that's a fact and it will go down in HISTORY.  Trounced him by over 3 million votes.  . She also trounced him in Washington State Hillary 54% Trump 38% it must of been the deviants that swung the vote!
"Regardless of your faith"??? - Justin Trudeau HAHA!! Then why did it take so long for him to accept Yarzidi people as refugees? The Conservatives had to twist his arm to let them in. Trudeau clearly favored Muslims over other refugees. Also a Liberal MP is trying to make criticizing Islam illegal in Canada (a blasphemy law). Look up m103 .
Anyone who wants to understand the relationship between Islam and violent extremism simply needs to gain a passable understanding of the doctrine of Islam.   Its very clear and not at all ambiguous.  Try "Islam and the Future of Tolerance: A Dialogue" by Sam Harris and Maajid Nawaz.   Kindle edition is $7.53 on Amazon and it probably takes a few hours to read. Consider it an investment in trying to understand what will (imho) become one of the key issues of our time.
The African slave trade is still an on going reality in Muslim nations across Africa and the Middle East. It is in the Koran that black Africans are only slaves. In Arabic the words African and slave are the same. The west ended slavery 200 years ago for all the thanks we get.
Just who have the Assads persecuted? What segment of the Syrian populace? Is it those who want to retain a secular state with Western values that treats religious minorities equally, or are these people who want to overthrow the state and establish an Islamic theocracy? I suspect that those who have been persecuted are members of the latter,  the Sunni majority that believe that Shia and Christians are infidels who should undergo mass extermination. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Syria
Hello Dement-ed,  I didn't see Chuck criticize Catholicism in any of his posts. If you have, please do point them out to me.  Tell me something - have you ever lived in an Islamic country? I have lived in four, and know what I am talking about while discussing Islam or Islamism. I don't mouth off cliches while pretending to be an expert on something that I know nothing substantial about. You, on the other hand, do a fine job of that.
The vermin who lead the Bataclan massacre listened to French rap. One was an aspiring rapper. The islamic terrorists who shot up Charlie Hebdo, what was their music of choice? You guessed it. In fact, another aspiring rapper in that one too.  Rap is the music of the permanent victim. It is the music of the self-oppressed. It isme music of blame. And when these rappers lift themselves out of poverty, they do NOTHING for the communities they leave behind except incite more and more violence in their so called music.
High-profile people who speak out publicly against Islamic killers probably make their way on to the killers' lists, don't need an article to figure that out.  In Europe there have been a number of public figures who spoke out against Islamic expansionism being attacked or even killed.
Travis and Another Commenter your right, but it doesn’t matter at the end of the day now. The new America we live in makes it ok for a foreign government, much less a commie government to influence our election as long as “their side” won and/or Trump was elected.   Conservatives love to wave the flag and complain about the moral decay of America, especially in “Liberal” states and places like California and New York. The new moral decay in America is the ignorant sob pissed off at his life because even though he’s never seen a Muslim that’s never bothered him, rarely sees Blacks who could care less about him, and his job was outsourced to China or Mexico and will never come back unless he’s ok with $5.00 an hour.
Inaccurate polling aside, maybe the real answer in all Islamic countries is for the locals to fight for their own country. There would be no need for the west to get involved if this happened and refugees would be a thing of the past.
As racial tensions under the tutelage and advocacy of President Donald Trump heat up, I offer to Alaska readers the following as a warning. At least two people on these pages may represent a clear and present danger to immigrants, Muslims, other minorities, especially Alaska Natives. There are more.  The latest is someone who goes by the pseudonym Fishkiller who responded to a comment I made about the new North Dakota law that allows the murder by hit-and-run of tribal members from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and anyone else on public highways and roadways.  Fishkillerwas asked when they last killed or maimed an Alaska Natives by hit-and-run lately. Fishkiller said “Not yet but I still have time.”  On Mexicans, James Mason 771 said killing Mexicans and being paid “a hundred bucks per head” sounded reasonable. These are potential terrorists, and there are more on these pages.
I have lived in 4 Muslim countries, and can provide comments that are a lot more intelligent than the semi-Nazi rants that you litter this forum with. To be fair, Hitler ranted in the beer halls of Munich, and no one took him seriously in the 1920s.
Rochy doesn't know the difference between Iran and Iraq. Just that they are both Muslim so probably look the same and speak the same languages.   Ignorance is bliss. Rochy must be a happy person!
Ugh, witch hunt.  Registries are ineffective, punitive, costly and unconstitutional.  Otherwise we'd have a Muslim one by now.   If you wonder why your water is impure, roads and bridges are crumbling and teachers losing health insurance, it is because we are spending $600,000,000 a year on this boondoggle.
@Aziz (3) (In Switzerland, in June, 2016, after a huge debate of Muslin boy students "refusing to shake the hand of their female teacher")  The Chairperson of the Forum for a progressive Islam, Saida Keller-Messahli:  "...the refusal to shake the hand of a woman is one of the symptoms of political Islam who wants the separation of the sexes in all areas of public life, who wants headscarves for girls, who wants to veiling women and assign them a secondary place in the mosques and in the public space."  The parents or guardians of students who refuse to comply with the new directive may be subject to a fine of up to 6500$.  (4)prohibition of Women together with Men at prayer time + (5)prohibition of laughter with bursts + (6)prohibition of the gaze of the other (for Women) + (7)the hate of desire and pleasure + (8)the condemnation of the flesh + (9)the contempt for the body + (10)fitting the male absolute, misogyny + (11)refusing to shake the hand of female +
rbfromcalgary writes:  "Go ahead and tap dance around THE issue, which is immigration."  The word "immigration" is alt.right code for "Muslims".   rbfromcalgary writes:  "Gender equality - gone. Separation of church and state - gone. Freedom of expression and freedom of the press - gone. A thousand years of hard-won progress - gone."  Waves of immigrants in the past brought their less-than-ideal beliefs with them, including misogyny, religion in government, and a quiescent press, and these immigrants didn't change us, we changed them.  Recognize this hatred of immigrants for what it is, what it has always been in the past - xenophobia - and for what it will be in the future - a historical footnote.  .
Well, if the man does the bidding of his voters, then I guess they deserve what they're going to get, which is shafted.  In 2020, the red states will be poorer still while the blue states simply ignore Trump's antics and press ahead toward the future along with the rest of the world.  The failed industrial Midwest--let's call it what it is, a loser, couldn't stand foreign competition, forget all that rightwing BS about how great free markets are, just block our competitors and subsidize us up to the nostrils and we'll show you what we can do!--will continue to howl for the ignorance to continue: "We don't need no stinkin Muslims!  We don't need no stinkin Meskins!  We don't need no stinkin Darwin! We don't need no stinkin scientiss at all!  All they do is hoax us! We don't need no stinkin health insurance!  Just give us more coal mines, more heavy metals in our water, and more creationist theme parks!  God's country, I tell ya!  God's country, once Trump drains that swamp!"
Atheists already seem to do that Kristi.  And the Muslims in Syria, Libya, Iraq and Iran already put all the blame for their problems on Christians and Jews. That is why we see so many of them beheaded by ISIS types.
"You haven't met too many people from other cultures I take it.... they didn't come here to colonize and take over Canada, they came here to be free."  That's wishful thinking. It is true of most, yes, but just look at these boards, some are telling us our society isn't as good as Muslim ones, our culture deserves to be destroyed, women in Islam are better off than in western society, etc.  " It's a numbers game now and with right wingers becoming a decreasing minority, no wonder you're against immigration."  Exactly, it's a numbers game, and if getting masses of people here who think women are better off in a Muslim society makes people nervous, how is that being "right-wing"?
In a post-truth environment, false perceptions can hurt us all ?   Muslims have been practicing taqiyya for centuries.
Another personal attack. Haven't heard you point out one crime perpetrated by "your" faith yet. Islam the religion (as oppsed to Islamic states) substantially has nothing to do with western culture other than its trying to invade it throughout the years. I am prepared to acknowledge my culture's failings, but it is in a defensive posture after decades of leftist attack. I make no apologies for defending it and I applaude others who do the same. I do not have a problem with Islam or muslims in general. I have been to many muslims countries and have been treated fairly and hospitably. My problem is with multi-culturalism and transplanted muslims in the west. Even Westerners with an inferiority complex who join Islam as a rejection of their own culture, do not bother me. It is when the mosques show up, the taxi drivers refuse to carry alcohol, shariah law pops up and infidels start getting shot in nightclubs and other places that we need a serious conversation about it.
"the irrational fear of Islam and/or Muslims that leads to discrimination" should be re-phrased as  'the irrational fear of belief systems that leads to perceptible discrimination' if one has to go through with it. No community or a religion should be inscribed in the law books.    Normally, a given phobia will dissipate once some inward attention is paid. One has to give and take in a new society.
.  "Legal experts say the Islamic centre would have a solid case for a Charter challenge of Sunday’s referendum results."  --  Love the Charter!  .
"The Obama administration hoped its support for Syria’s moderate opposition"  There are no "moderates" in this battlefield! They are called terrorists, Islamic extremist, mercenaries and Al-Qaeda affiliates. The United States should be embarrassed that they supplied arms, money, logistics and intelligence to these fanatics.  I do not like Assad. But he is allowed to defend himself from this Islamic attack. (sponsored by USA, Saudi Arabia, Gulf States and others)
The article,  Muslim groups,  and most German politicians correctly point out that the vast majority of asylum seekers are ordinary, non-violent people who sought refugee from being bombed or beheaded by the likes of ISIS.  But of course the right-wingers will use the politics of fear to motivate their cowardly followers to believe that all Muslims are potential terrorists. They're not.  Personally, I pity the people who have too little life experience or intelligence to understand that simple fact.
Yes, but it suits the G&M narrative of BLM support by muslims.  Therefore, it is national news.  This allows them to collect another merit badge from the multicultural scout league.  As a gay man, I am sick and tired of seeing these stories about Pride, particularly when it comes to a hate group like BLM trying to take it over.
‘Finally, I don't want to be rude, but I do know a lot more than you about the Middle East or Islam. I have lived in that region for 14 years, can speak some Arabic and have spent time reading books like History of the Arabs by Phillip Hitti, A History of the Arab People by Albert Hourani, and the Ottoman Centuries by Lord Kinross.’  Clearly the books were poorly digested.  I don’t want to pull rank with you but I was born, raised and educated in the Middle East and I speak Arabic.
[Continued from above] Finally the piece that I originally included on this topic [about the 'woman priest' in a Zurich deanary] is a part of Chapter 8 "The Hidden Women Priests" by Marco Politi in his book POPE FRANCIS AMONG THE WOLVES [New York: Columbia University Press, 2014] pp. 90-93.  This chapter is partially the story of Monika Schmid, of Effretikon, Switzerland, who is the Gemeindebeauftragte [individual placed in charge of the parish].  She studied religious pedagogy, theology at Luzern [Switz.] and Salzburg [Austria].  She was currently studying interreligious spiritual theology, based on points of contact between Christianity, Jewish mysticism, and Islam.  It's the case, also, historically, that in Switzerland the parish community engages [and pays] its curate.  No Church taxes---they hire, they pay and they can fire. As Politi states, at Monika's parish they only have Mass on Christmas, Easter and twice a month.  For the other 250 days a year, Monika's the PRIEST.
The article’s author’s states: “Many of the recent terror attacks inspired by the Islamic State were carried out by homegrown Americans, not refugees fleeing war-torn countries.”  This only concludes that it’s difficult to combat homegrown terrorism.  That's undoubtedly true.   But how do you go from this to arguing that we should let in people from the parts of the world that some homegrown terrorists are inspired by?  The opposite would seem true to me – you don’t let in people from the parts of the world that some of these homegrown terrorists are inspired by.
How heart warming. I come to the Muslim Daily News just to read stories like this.....................
Muslims are not getting "preferential treatment", any religion can request accommodation. Sikh students can wear their kirpan despite a ban on weapons in schools for example. I'm not "infatuated with Islam" I'm speaking out against ignorance and intolerance just as your fellow Catholics in St Catharines did when they opened a Muslim prayer room in a Catholic high school.  The TDCSB was just one example that proves my point, go to other Catholic boards and check their eligibility requirements yourself. Do your own homework before you suggest I do more reading or provide some evidence to support your position. It's great that your children  - I assume they are in high school - have Muslim classmates but so what? How is that relevant to the issue? I'm not fighting Catholics or Christians. I'm pointing out that those who rail against reasonable accommodation ignore the extent to which we have historically gone to support minority religions in education. Muslims are no different. Get a grip
Nazi Germany under the leadership of Hitler became a dictatorship, like Hamas, Hezbollah, the Palestinian Authority, and most of the Arab and Muslim world.
In the USA, 15,000 people are murdered every year by other Americans. An average of 3 Americans are killed by terrorists. In Canada, more Muslims were killed this year by right wing terrorists than the other way around.  So the priority for a politician in the US is to reduce the murder rate, and in Canada is to dial down the anti-Muslim rhetoric.
More Liberal Bait 'N Switch... ▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰ More Cynical Liberal identity-politics... ▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰.    Muslims are being used by the Liberals, a party of corrupt incompetents whose bizarre moral values are offensive to most serious people.   Only 25% of the Canadian electorate voted for the Liberals, and of these,-- half were NDP lured into voting "strategically", people with traditional Canadian working-class values. Now when the Liberals speak, only about 10-15% of the Canadian electorate listens.  Many Canadians are disgusted by the permissiveness of the Liberals. More and more, they look back to the days when they felt safe and protected under Conservative Prime Minister Stephen J. Harper. They hope for a new Conservative government that will stand firmly for every Canadian.  People came to Canada as a land of promise, not a land of moral permissiveness and economic decline caused by incompetent poseurs.
Oh no!!! The Islamic terrorists did not win.    - A new Islamic Republic shall not be born in Syria. - Sharia law shall not be installed in Syria. - Woman will still be free to live their lives they way they wish. - Christian minorities shall not be murdered by Islamic fanatics.   And you dare call this a "meltdown for humanity"!
I think many believe we are way past these forms of pacifism to fix what is clearly a social war with the fundamentals of Islam and continue to find a way to let it live in our society. I think the average person is sick and tired and had it all with the enabling and appeasement of this religion of hate that at the very least has rank intolerance for others outside its sick self and has little interest in assimilating into our society. I feel a crusade coming on…. It won’t be islamophobia….. it will be a call to arms to protect our western civilization….  No words will stop this… only action.
I was watching the coverage as the event unfolded and some in conservative media were already guessing it was a terrorist attack from Muslims and ISIS. No point in attacking those for their actions when you are doing the same thing.
I saw the same thing in Stockholm when I was there a month ago.  The country is taking a hard right turn in politics caused by the sudden substantial increase in rapes, bombings and the Islamic attack with the truck.
Quite simply they are anachronistic and symbols of thinking an individual should survive in some form in perpetuity.   That is dated and not giving proper thought to the fact that the human population is growing by over 80 million souls a year.  And to put it bluntly too many Muslims are not responsible in this regard (high birth rates).   Like that clown Erdogen says to have as many babies as possible to drown out the west to allow for Islam to take over.....that I could care less about but a leader stating to have 5-6 children is grossly irresponsible.
No,  because as we all know, Christians aren't running around stabbing people or blowing themselves up to prove a point.  The idea behind our immigration policy is to first make sure the immigrants aren't a threat to American citizens.   And there is no doubt that on average, people from radical Muslim nations pose a higher risk to American's safety than do immigrants from Denmark, Ireland or Spain.
"Displaying pornography or any other content found to be harassing, disturbing, or offensive to others is not allowed."  While I definitely understand the justification for the policy, it does create a bit of a slippery slope, doesn't it?  What if I found the image of Muslims in traditional garb offensive or disturbing? Or maybe someone is visiting a pro-gun site? Or watching violent MMA video clips?  Or hunting videos. You get the picture.     The irony of librarians, of all people, restricting what information can be consumed. It's a dilemma.
He lived under islamic.  Under sharia law - you become an adult as soon as you grow hair around your genitalia. There is no such thing as a teenager under sharia law - you are a child or an adult.  He lived as a man, he fought as a man and he suffered the consequences as a man under sharia law - the law he accepted..  Then he used our laws against us to turn himself into a millionaire. Aided and abetted by people who have never experienced sharia law in a combat zone.  Many, many soldiers have discovered this in the desert countries. This convicted terrorist was not unique - he was one of thousands - perhaps tens of thousands.  And Canadian apologists love him.
What the counter-protesters/Antifa don't realize is that they did exactly what the White Nationalists wanted. One of the people that organized the rally said afterwards that the entire point of the rally was to get the left to come out and protest, proving their point that "white men are being marginalized in the United States". It was a planned recruitment tool for their party/organization and the lefties took the bait. Had the lefties remembered that while they disagree with this particular group, the group has every right to say what they want under the First Amendment. It wouldn't be any different if Muslim men held a rally saying America should follow Sharia law (which makes women second class citizens and allows/encourages the killing of LGBTQ people). You can disagree with them, but they have every right to say it as long as their not acting on it at the rally. Once again, the counter-protesters/Antifa reminded us that they are the real fascists.
We are not changing our curriculims and we are not creating a national day. If however, a Muslim appreciates the support, I see no reason why a national day should not be created within the coalition of Mosques. If they find it within themselves they could also make it a day of remeberance for those who have died in the name of Allah in addition.
I am reading Heretic now . Its a great book and it exposes the danger of the Islamist ideology and its sharia law. This backlash against the anti-Islamophobia bill  is not an anti-Muslim  issue at all it is anger at the very notion that free speech is under attack.
I have read nothing to suggest that he went to Afghanistan as a missionary.  On the contrary, most evidence suggests that he is Muslim.
Chuck  Do you know why Turkey regressed? A lot of the reforms were carried out to get EU membership. Then Europe decided that a Muslim country couldn't be part of the EU. So Turkey bent backwards to become more Islamic.  As for no go zones, there are plenty in the US too. Where members of one race or the other can't enter. And these zones are backed up by military style weapons, unlike in Europe.
Boyle wrote in an email: “Honestly we’ve always planned to have a family of 5, 10, 12 children … We’re Irish, haha.”  It is not so funny, Boyle.  You want 10, 12 children because you are a Muslim.
In Canada you are not allowed to kill people who don't do what you want them to do - whether that's a child not marrying someone you want them to or a stranger who won't offer up his wallet in a back alley.  I can see no benefit in making murder a different category for certain immigrant groups like Muslims - other than playing the dirtiest of identity politics.  But generally - yes, some cultures are more easily able to adopt a progressive stance than others.
Ann-Louise maybe Trudeau should take a Canadian values test first. He is the one that visits mosques that give women no rights. All to solicit votes from Muslims. His Drama teaching has served him well as he is a phony actor lacking in moral integrity. Look at the way Quebecers have treated every religious minority through their history but yet no criticism from anyone for fear of losing votes. How many years have our pathetic Liberal leaders allowed Quebec to treat English speaking Quebecers like second class citizens?? Trudeau had the nerve to go to Africa to preach to them about women's rights and give them our hard earned tax dollars when he should have focussed on women's rights in his own backyard. No need to look at Trump's policies, Trudeau just needs to look in the mirror, so he doesn't have to sicken us with another selfie.
Any legislation stemming from M103 will include  power for the RCMP or OPP  to arrest anybody insulting the Prophet Mohammad  or Islam. Whether on FaceBook or in the Globe comments, speaking out against acquiescence to Islam is destined to be a criminalized. Blasphemy laws are coming if the Liberals are re-elected.
Sigh, head shake....good gravy!  It is futile to even continue this discussion.  Just curious: when are you going to share your observations about sexism, etc, with our Muslim brothers and sisters, especially those who live in the Middle East?   Just a suggestion: if you compare what Muslim's believe, especially in Muslim countries with Catholic teaching and how we view women, I think you will find that we are worlds apart.  I think you will find when you accuse the Church of sexism you have no clue what you are talking about.  If you and your feminist cohorts really cared about women and sexism it seems to me you would care much more about what Muslims believe and teach than Catholics.
It's a Muslim ban.  Obviously.  He campaigned on a Muslim ban, and asked others to craft a Muslim ban that would not look like a Muslim ban.  It's a Muslim ban.
"How are either of these scenarios different?"  You don't know how they're different? Seriously? It's obvious.  Do Jewish or Muslim "food places" normally sell pork products? No. You can't force a business to sell a product they don't offer. It's nothing at all like a business refusing to sell their normal product that they sell to everyone else.  Designers aren't in a business of public accommodation. If you don't know what that is and why it matters, then that's probably why you don't understand this issue.
Governor Cuomo needs to get his head out of his hind side for calling it a “lone wolf” attack and saying there was no evidence to suggest it was part of a wider plot. This Muslim Islamic terrorist may have been alone in the vehicle, but there should be no doubt that he is not simply a “lone wolf” who came up with the idea all by himself. It was the kind of terrorist attack that ISIS has been urging its members and supporters to use against innocent people everywhere. It was part of ISIS world-wide strategy. Wake up Cuomo.  Support Trump's immigration ban.
I very much doubt that there will BE places "where we can work with Trump"...   Surely you are not suggesting supporting the removal of over 20 million folks on health care for our support, or the deportation of immigrants who have contributed to our society or the registering of Muslims....or the erosion of ecological protections or an infinite number of other very likely possibilities...  Perhaps you could suggest areas where this hypothetical support might occur?
He was also a Donald Trump supporter. Christian attended Trump rallys. He posted on Facebook:   "Bernie Sanders was the President I wanted," wrote Christian in December. "He voiced my heart and mind. The one who spoke about the way America should gone. Away from the Military and Prison Industrial Complexes. The Trump is who America needs now that Bernie got ripped off."  and:  "If Donald Trump is the Next Hitler then I am joining his SS to put an end to Monotheist Question. All Zionist Jews, All Christians who do not follow Christ's teaching of Love, Charity, and Forgiveness And All Jihadi Muslims are going to Madagascar or the Ovens/FEMA Camps!!! Does this make me a fascist!!!"
Why are Middle Easterners flocking to the USA, Canada & Australia ?  Justin Trudeau ? Trudeau & his government of rabid socialists ? Could it be the 'pretty boy' in charge of Canada & it's people has seen it come to pass what his equally , if not more socialistic father -Pierre failed to bring about before his death 10 years back, "For better or worse, he's responsible in large measure for the charter, official bilingualism and official multiculturalism," wrote Bruce Cheadle in the Globe and Mail. "Mr. Trudeau legalized contraception, abortion, homosexual acts between consenting adults and lotteries ... The Canada Health Act was enacted, restricting provinces from experimenting with health care."   Both Trudeau's determined to 'update' Canada , removing much of  it's tradition & adhering to what is commonly accepted "an orthodox view of the world".    Justin is determined to turn Canada into Europe allowing Middle Eastern Muslims into Canadian 'citizens' . This is causing huge problems
Muslim Imam talks about Islam on Australian TV.  Must see.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISEk2ALt3c8
She is realising how serious this is.  Germany has been changed for a long time by allowing in 1,000,000 refugees, many of whom are Muslim/Islamic. This is a culture that produces babies at a very high rate.  What will Germany be like in 10 years after this massive infusion from the Muslim middle east? In 20 years? After countless Muslim/Islamic babies are born and raised?  Will Germany become a Muslim country?  The Middle East used to be Christian. Through wars it was overcome and became Muslim.  History repeats itself.
The "right wing" is not xenophobic. It just has a healthy fear of Europe becoming overrun by Muslims. That's not xenophobia; it's just common sense.
But we can't use statistics, remember?  Even though rifles and firearms account for statistically minuscule amount of death compared to the other causes, we must make it a #1 priority. Even though Muslims statistically account for 100% of plane bombings, TSA needs to target white senior citizens. Even though statistically 0% of mass shooters have been NRA members, we still to blame the NRA for gun violence.  You're 100% correct: we SHOULD look at statistics, shouldn't we.
Personally, if I owned a business I would serve anyone who asked me for business.  However, how is this hate if this man finds that it is against his beliefs?  He doesn't agree with their lifestyle.  A Muslim might refuse to something for a patron because of the fact that alcohol is served, is that hate?  It's his religious belief and the Muslim faith does not condone alcohol.  You do realize that if people must do business with anyone who requests it, then what about if you owned a bakery and a white supremacist was holding a gathering for other white supremacists and ordered a cake for the gathering, you would be required to fulfill his request.  How would you feel about that?
"Islamophobia is anti-Moslem bigotry, and anti-Moslem bigotry is Islamophobia."  Then why are the Liberals refusing to clarify this in the motion?
I cannot believe the civil gestapo deleted THIS:  The POTUS was incorrect in his statement that ISIS was contained.  He rebounded by giving Iran $150,000,000,000 to develop nukes and his plan to restrict firearms in the U.S. while bringing as many muslim refugees into the country as possible shows he's on the right track now.
"Still no evidence of terrorism to Muslims by U.S. citizens, beyond the reported odd remark."  Not so fast, utilitas.  In case you haven't noticed the United States has spent billions of $ dropping bombs and torturing Muslims in recent years.
As an Evangelical Christian, I can answer that question. Why would I want to spend my money in a shop that doesn't want my business?  - Let's say I walk into a Jewish Bakery, a Gay Bakery, a Muslim Bakery, and a Buddhist Bakery because I didn't know they were Jewish, Gay, Muslim, or Buddhist.....and I ask them to decorate a Christian Wedding Cake with "crosses" and "May Jesus Bless Our Marriage" written on it......and they decline because doing so goes against their religious beliefs or same-sex values. - Sure, I might be sad. But wouldn't I just find another bakery that (1) wants my business (2) will gladly create the "edible art work" I want? Of course I would.  - "Turn the other cheek," "do unto others as you want them to do unto you," and "pray for others" does not suing others in court and mean making a federal case out of someone else's beliefs.  - The simplest thing to do is to.....go elsewhere. No big deal.
"Cumbaya" will never rid the human race of hate no matter how loud and how long you sing it.  Nor will "Imagine".  My plan is to avoid crowds at all costs, and pack heat at all times.  P.S.  Do you have an example of conservatives killing Muslims in mass shooting incidents?  It's usually the opposite.
the march of islam in europe continues without opposition
"Islam, Judaism and Christianity are same religions".? Try keeping up with the news. Jews and Christians aren't  murdering innocent people  in the name of their faith or their God.
We just spoke with Senator Merkley's office, the attorney on staff confirmed that they can not any guidance from ICE or INS on the rules for Iranian American's with dual citizenship (Iran still considers American immigrants as Iranians).  Dual citizens were not recognized on Friday... and it has been hit and miss through today.  If you are a dual citizen, like Iranians are, you may not be able to re-enter the USA.  Greencard holders from Iran are still hit & miss on entry today as Trump Admin did not provide, and will not provide guidelines... border agents are left to their own judgement.  This MuslimBan is punishing American citizens and residents that fled Islamic extremism and persecution.  Ironically they could be sent back to despots that will imprision or execute them.  If you think this shortsighted and unconstitutional Muslim Ban is illegal please contact your senator - they need to hear you feedback.
One thing you said was correct.  The victims are indeed overlooked.  Such as the murders of five Muslims while praying in their Masjid in Montreal.  And overlooking that by all indications this is the work of white supremacist and/or neo-Nazi types (several of whom comment on these pages).  Similarly, the Muslims who who have come forward in solidarity, and raised funds to help restore the damage to Jewish grave sites are overlooked by those--also posting in here--who have falsely accused us of this despicable campaign.  Destruction of synagogues is expressly prohibited in Qur'an.
Muslims are "a persecuted minority?" Are you on the board of CAIR?
I'd say Muslims take the cake, but that's not what I commented on. I said compare the DOCTRINES, not do a shallow head count of people based on perceived religious affiliation. Perhaps you should do a study of comparative doctrines rather than ask an irrelevant question in its stead?
"Anti-Muslim hatred has no place in my Canada"  and yet it exists to the point where the largest mass murder of Muslims in north America happened recently in your Canada.  Your Canada took in 30000 Syrian refugees in a purely political grandstand move during the 'Canada is Back' promotion.  Did the majority of Canadians demand it or buy into it? Your Canada has taken immigration and refugees and publicized them as an act of openness, inclusion, kind hardheartedness and all things holy and marketed the whole package as what separates Canada from the rest of the world. However, as has written here many times, you need these people because of your low birth rate, aging population, skill sets and all reasons practical.   In short, immigration and refugees as Canada sells them are just another Canadian myth. But unlike many of the myths, this is in your face and can't be ignored or denied.  Bigotry towards Americans is socially expected. That doesn't exist in isolation.
Why Allan, the one word I changed in my post was "Christian". And it kept getting censored, yet when I changed it to Muslim or Islam, the post wasn't censored. Isn't that amazing? This post censored once already....why is "christian" a dirty word to the progressive left?
Kaffirphobia--hatred of non-Muslims--is a growing problem in the country but no one talks about it, while Islamaphobia is whatever anyone says it is.
Libs(Pat Gee) driving the stake of Racial divide into society.  Comparing the Muslims and the Japanese internment camp are like comparing Sashimi to  Beheadings!  Unlike Muslims who ,you rarely hear denouncing "Radical Muslim Terrorist" it was a complete Opposite for the American Japanese. American Japanese were extremely Loyal to this great country ,the U.S. of A. One example comes to mind..... Daniel K. Inouye. Many like Dan Inouye steped-up to the plate and served in the U.S armed forces to prove their loyalty.  Though ,there were in fact many Japanese spy networks, working in the midst, still loyal to the Emperor of Japan, living here in Hawaii and California. Is what led to these Japanese Internment Camps. It was all about Security!  Lastly,if you  do your history,you will find ,Japan was forced into this unpopular War by U.S. policies particularly (Oil) Ship embargo. Ultimately the U.S. had Japan in a......Box!IMUA!
I know from your previous comments that "accommodate" is a pejorative for you, but that's how civilized western countries handle significant differences.  We don't call it 'kow-towing' to provide reasonable accommodations for jewish, mennonite, hindu, sikh or muslim Canadians.  It's part of what makes us civilized.  It's part of what makes us different from Saudi Arabia, for instance.  And continuing to lie about the existence of 'no-go zones' doesn't help your argument.
Most of the criticisms of Trump (racist!!  Muslim "ban"! sexist!! etc. etc.) are simply catnip for low voltage journalists and others obsessed with group identity politics. This is the core of the real threat to Trump: If it is proven that the Trump campaign offered, if elected, to relax sanctions on Russia in exchange for dumping HIllary's dirty laundry thru Wikileaks and others we are into the realm of treason and Mike Pence would be headed to the oval office.  Evidence for his would likely come from intercepts of conversations by U.S. intelligence agencies.  The same people Trump publicly derides. For now, nothing is proven.
The Supreme Court decided it has none, other than that provided by the mother, but again you already knew this. Pregnancy isn't a democratic process, never has been nor will it ever be. While I find abortion unfortunate, at the least,  it isn't my decision, nor is it yours. I know people who would like to return to the days before women had the right to vote, should we go there as well?    Many that practice the Muslim faith would prefer to see women looked at as simple property, would you be comfortable with that?  The laws that brought woman's rights to the level it is today is not something that would be so easy to reverse, and rightly so, but as a citizen of these United States you have an option, petition the courts, write an argument that makes it to the Supreme Court, and get the law reversed, good luck with that by the way.
don't worry folks - JT will keep us safe. Just ask Omar Khadr and the poor tax payer. Canada just committed $6 million dollars to Bangledesh muslims.  Ahhhh poor tax payer.....
No, Layla4, the same groups that used to hate jews, switched to hating muslims.  Best example, the Front Nationale in France - from Le Pen father to daughter.  The important thing for them is to have an 'other' to focus hatred.
This is why we no longer have Islamic Terrorists, and we are so much safer.
And what did you cancel when Obama dropped tons of bombs on innocent Muslim civilians.....or when he invoked, by presidential order the termination of Iraqi civilian immigration?!
I am proud our state is taking a strong stand against an executive order obviously discriminatory. Multi-cultural Hawaii in particular needs to take a stand on behalf of religious freedom.  Remember--today it is the Muslims; if one doesn't stand up for what is right then in the future it might well  be the Buddhists, the Hindus, the Hawaiian, or any other religion of Hawaii's people.
It is the State's Right to set a number on possible spouses in a civil marriage. Since civil marriage comes with certain benefits provided by the State, the State has an interest in setting limits.  This does not affect religious freedom as it doesn't deny the right to marry, but only limits the number of spouses. Polygamy is not required in the Muslim faith. Nor is it in the LDS church.  From a rights perspective, polygamy creates many legal problems for a society where equality exists between the spouses. How can spouses be equal in a marriage between one man and twentyfour women? What's the relationship between the women? Does the man represent half the relationship and each wife but 2%? If the man dies, is the marriage dissolved or do the 24 women carry on?
The only troll is Azira herself,   trolling for Islam and for western civilization's submission to the Koran.  Her hijab is the sign she  handed her fate to Allah. Giving up free will is just one thing Muslims ar expected to sacrifice for their religion.
I truly believe that there are more good people in the world than bad - of any faith (or lack of). Thank you to the Muslim community for bringing some comfort to the homeless community.
I can't believe that there is no article about Trump's ban on Muslims, aside from the piece by MSW.
That's some list. If I may add. The King David Hotel Bombing in Jerusalem. Israeli operatives disguise themselves as Arabs to frame Muslims. The Lavon Affair- Israeli Operatives plant bombs in civilian areas of Egypt to frame Muslims, but bombs go off early & they're caught. USS Liberty- Israel intentionally & brutally attacks Americans for 90 minutes straight in an attempt to frame Egypt. The La Belle Disco bombing- Israeli operatives kill 3 & injure 230, just to frame Muslims. The USS Cole - Somewhat successful attack on Americans compared to others.  Can't forget 9/11- most successful framing of Muslims yet, even after 9 alleged hijackers came forward asking why their photos were pasted on the news as terrorists. To disguise one's self as Starving Artists to gain 24 hr access into WTC. Brilliant! Calling yourself the E-Team, not so brilliant. Filming the whole ordeal, opposite of brilliant. Having 5 of your operatives caught cheering and dancing while filming, Bummer!
Portugal. Pakistan. Muslim. What has it all to do with Sanskrit?  Varna is the word in Sanskrit for Caste. It means skin colour. To my knowledge Muslims do not believe in varna. In fact they have the widest gene pool on earth (as determined by a Dutch survey 20 years ago). And a lot of Portuguese married Africans - just look at Brazil or Angola. Show me one Indian-African couple? When I think of India where I was born but mercifully never lived there I think of filth and rape and inhumanity of man to man. 100 Million elite ruling over 1200 Million destitute. Gini Index is waaaaay higher than neighbouring China or Pakistan or Portugal lol.
How about Nazis declaring themselves a religion. This shows how insane religious freedom is. Anybody who reads the Koran can find parallels to Mein Kampf in it. claims Islamic law is incompatible with Western democracy are justified, only the dumbgood-doers deny the obvious..
Gay bar gunman is Identified As OMAR MIR SEDDIQUE MATEEN; Born To Afghan Parents...ISIS hits the USA. ISIS said they would hit Florida 3 days ago. Islamic proselytization is forbidden in Japan, it is very difficult to import Qur'ans into the country, and there are very few mosques. In Japan, Muslim men are expected to pray at home, not in mosques or in the middle of the street as they do in France. Islamic organizations are not allowed, so the Japanese do not have to deal with the incessant stream of propaganda coming from pro-jihadi groups like CAIR. There is only one imam in Tokyo, a city of over 13 million people.  Virtually the only Muslims who are in Japan come as employees of foreign companies. And even that is the exception rather than the rule. "The official policy of the Japanese authorities is to make every effort not to allow entry to Muslims, even if they are physicians, engineers and managers sent by foreign companies that are active in the region."
As a christian, I am among the religious minority in my community (about 1/3 of my town is christian). Most  are Jewish, but also a significant number of Muslims, Hindus. and others in our multi-cultural, multi-religious community.  Yet every store, even the gas station, is decorated in red and green, with wreaths and other secular symbols of christmas.  Given the make-up of my community, one also sees Chanukah symbols, although fewer than for Christmas.  Most stores display menorahs, sometimes also  garlands of silver and blue. The churches have large, lighted outdoor creches. Everywhere I go, kind people wish me, a religious minority in our town, Happy Holidays.    Those of all religions in the community jointly fund a Santa firetruck to go through the neighborhoods to give candy to children, and collect  for the local food pantry.  There is no war on Christmas, just recognition that our country is (is supposed to be)  a safe home for those of all religions.  Happy Holidays to all!
My involvements with the Kurdistanis aka Kurds, during the Iran Iraq Wars the Kurdistanis at living at Iraq had turned Traitor and fought on the side of the Muslim Nation of Iran, the Millions of Iranians that fled Iran 1979 to U.S. Ally Iraq as the Shia of Iraq turned traitor and fought against U.S. Ally Iraq.  The Kurdistanis let Divisions of Iranians into Northern Iraq to attack Baghdad Iraq, 4 Teams of U.S. Army Special Forces led 4 Iraqis Combat Brigades to Defend Baghdad against 2 Iranian Divisions and Millions of Traitor Kurdistanis.  Our Iraqis Combat Brigades held regardless of 40 to 60 percent Killed In Action.  To the South other U.S. Army Special Forces Teams were leading other U.S. Ally Iraqis Combat Divisions and Brigades fighting the Iranian Divisions and the Millions of Shia of Iraq Traitors.  After the Iran Iraq Wars U.S. Ally President Saddam Hussein chased the Traitor Kurdistanis out of U.S. Ally Iraq into U.S.S.R. Ally Syria and U.S. Ally Turkey.
Islamic movement invading? You're joking right?
"Explain these Muslim only zones they want to introduce into Canada"  Source?
The main feature of American leadership in the world has been aggression. Since WW2 it financed the takeover of land in Palestine, failed to subdue Vietnam, attacked Panama and Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Syria. And to Canada's shame we have followed the leader.   The shape of our military is a tough one. One threat whch probably can be controlled without military participation except in a negative way is the attack of so-called extremists. Just probably pulling our troops out of any association with the US would decrease if not eliminate extremist  attacks on Canada. We would not be attacking Muslims.  Overall, losing the US as the leader is a good thing. No doubt a much more peaceful life..
If the government of Quebec really cares about Quebec's reputation, it should scrap its plans to bring in a law that bans religious clothing. It is an obvious attempt to attack Muslims and it is such a blatantly discriminatory law that it will almost certainly be struck down by the Supreme Court. In Canada, we have given ethnic politics in Quebec a free pass for far too long. Now, it has given rise to a home-grown intolerance that is deeply embedded into the entire Quebec political system and society.
I'm with you John, I commented on this article already below, pointing out the apparent hypocrisy in this author's predilection for facts. She, like so much of the MSM, would have us persuaded that the Montreal mosque shooting is without a doubt motivated by the shooter's petulant hatred of muslims, and we are to swallow this bitter pill as FACT. Well, we can all speculate: it seems 4 out of the 6 victims had government jobs; what if our white male 2nd or 3rd or whatever generation Canadian shooter, apparently also gunning for a undergraduate degree in some accredited program or another, was thoroughly upset with his perceived prospects for decent employment after graduation, while his municipal, provincial, and federal government was in his view doling out cushy jobs to the new immigrants and foreigners around him because, by his conclusion, the Canadian government gives all kinds of unfair advantages to those who are not white, male, and multiple-generation Canadian?
Yes seriously, are you condoning a religious practice that excludes girls from participating based on their natural cycles and forces girls to pray at the back so men aren't aroused? Assertive political Islam is fundamentally incompatible with advanced liberal societies, why should Canada accommodate cultural practices that are only common in countries where women are forced to submit to male authority under the guise of religious piety? It's not a secret that liberal secular Muslims are ostracized from their communities if they choose to embrace their faith without submitting to strict rules of prayer and modesty. The issue is not a one off, it is part of a wider discussion about accommodating a culture that supports segregation - the laissez-faire approach pushed by smug "progressives" has failed conclusively in Europe so why should Canada toe the same line? Islamists never stop, which is why Ataturk implemented strict secular protections when he founded modern Turkey - go figure...
Nunes is an eager beaver type, and not overburdened with smarts. Spicer, at the boss's behest, was back to justifying Trump's bugging claims yesterday. For his part, Trump steadfastly refuses to say a single critical thing about Putin, despite the growing evidence of Russian involvement in swaying the election and the growing mound of dead Russian bodies that could point fingers. California is becoming ground zero for resisting Trump's environment destroying executive orders, the courts are stymieing Trump's Muslim bans and Republicans have outed him as in ineffectual negotiator and called his bluff on empty threats to hold a vote on Trumpcare. Trump golfs more than Obama did, after criticizing Obama for it. He still refuses to release his taxes, after mocking Romney for delaying release of his during the 2012 race. He is wildly behind in staffing many critical administration positions and his existing skeleton staff largely lack experience. This so called administration is a joke.
I've traveled to places where people's primary identification is with their religion. Where cities are divided into "The Muslim quarter", "the Jewish Quarter", "the Christian Quarter", etc. Where villages are identified as "a Christian village" or "a Muslim village" or "a Jewish village". That's people'S primary social identity.  Canada and most of the modern, western world have managed to avoid that kind of sectarian social division, people live in religiously mixed neighborhoods and don't even know what religion their neighbours are for the most part, it isn't relevant in everyday life.  So sad to see that might be ending and we are going the way of primary identification by religion. Is this really what anyone thinks was intended by "official multiculturalism"?
only 7 Muslin countries of the 57 countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference were affected by Trump's ban . so how can it be called a "Muslim ban" . use common sense and fair play
When you can show me how something you drop falls up rather than down, I will be happy to have a conversation about the reality of natural law.  Until then ....  That most other Americans - Christian, Jewish, and Muslim - believe homosexual behavior is immoral behavior is a demonstrable fact. The majority of Americans say to you and those who share opinion on "it makes it difficult to raise children who are morally straight" and "it weakens the family as the cornerstone of society", "So what?"  At the end of the day every law, including the Constitution, is a matter for a majority decision.  Sufficient arrogance can lead to a practical demonstration of that reality, as the last election did.
This case is a GIANT slippery slope.  If the Supreme Court sides with the bakery, they are opening the door for any business to refuse to serve any person, and cite "religious reasons".  I mean, if you can refuse to make a cake for a gay couple, then whats to stop a Muslim florist from refusing to sell flowers to a Jewish couple?  Or an Athiest from refusing to sell to.....anyone?  And to be clear, this isnt a "Well you would never ask a Kosher Deli to sell bacon would you?" situation.  This guy makes (or made) cakes, and specifically wedding cakes for a living.  There is literally 0 difference between a "straight" wedding cake and a "gay" wedding cake.  They are both cakes.   This guy wants to be able to refuse service to a PERSON who he does not agree with.  This has nothing to do with art and what rights artists have regarding their work.  Unless this guy signs his name on each of his cakes, or any person could ID his cakes by design alone, he has no right to refuse service.
Exactly, just look at Turkey's experience with their first Islamist government after 90 years of secular progress. There is a reason Ataturk banned head coverings in public and all it takes is one look at Erdogan's government to find out why. Islamists do not stop until they have absolute submission - they don't believe in separation of religion and government, the believe government is bound by religion.  The author fails to look at Europe's experience in terms of the cultural segregation and social division wherever the niqab is common. The niqab is not independent of a regressive belief system, it is a symbol of a belief system that is fundamentally incompatible with western values, without exception. LGBT rights, gender equality, religious satire and comedy - it's not a coincidence that every single one of these values is absent in countries where the niqab is common. The NCCM is the same group that tried to restrict criticism of the Islamic politics at TDSB, big surprise...
DRAFT Letter, please share...   Dear Minister:  I am deeply troubled by United States President Donald Trump’s recent executive order regarding refugee claimants from Syria and visitors from certain predominantly Muslim countries. I believe that our country has a moral duty to protect those in need regardless of their ethnicity or religious beliefs. The Government of Canada should accept all refugee claimants from Syria that have already been cleared to enter the United States. These claimants are now indefinitely barred entry into the United States by President Trump's executive order. My understanding is that these people have already been vetted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, FBI, and National Counterterrorism Center. Therefore, accepting these refugees into our Canadian family poses no threat to our security; not accepting them is a threat to our values.
Not to mention the virtue-signalling of M-103 that the overwhelming majority of Canadians rejected but they are all bigots because phobia means "irrational hate" like fear of spiders, confined spaces, heights... of course M-103 had nothing to do with political motives of Islamist groups trying to promote a regressive belief system under the guise of fighting religious discrimination - that's never happened before, especially at the UN and it wasn't named Cairo... After all, every country governed by Islamic law is a beacon of gender equality, freedom of expression (blasphemy laws), and freedom of association (apostasy laws). It's not like Monty Python, Family Guy, and South Park etc. have ever engaged in religious satire making fun of Christianity and Judaism but then again, Islam is beyond reproach, anyone who engages in critical analysis, satire, or comedy towards Islam is a bigot - because it's 2017.
Who are you to decide another's religious convictions, and/or decide that only a Christian has religious freedom? Would you deny a muslim the right to refuse to "honor" a homosexual "marriage" with a wedding cake? It is his right to refuse to be ordered to express another's convictions, instead of his own. It is everyone's right to refuse to associate with anyone for any reason (freedom of association).
The term "Palestinian" in the 30s and 40s usually referred to Jews who had made Aliyah to the Holy Land. It is inconsistent to compare the results of war and population displacement of Arab Palestinians and Middle Eastern Jews with the death camps of the Nazis. During the creation of the State of Israel the surrounding Arab countries, the "neighbors", invaded the territory and tried to eliminate the Jewish population. THERE'S your genocide. Jews throughout North Africa and the Middle East were dispossessed of their homes and property. THERE'S your ethnic cleansing. They made their homes in the State of Israel, which has substantial Muslim and Christian inhabitants as well, alone among Middle Eastern countries. The State of Israel has made peace offers, most notably during the Camp David Summit in 2000. The Palestinians under Yasir Arafat would not even recognize the State of Israel. So why do they deserve recognition? The Israelis evacuated their settlers from Gaza. They got rockets!
LOL he gave $57 million to his first wife upon divorce,,the second wants $ 80 million after discovering his multiple adulteries  spiritual Muslim ideals.indeed
Another great victory, but for whom?  The Islamic extremists were found to have set-up cells all over France to recruit new members.  In fact, the French authorities had to shut down a number of mosques (see "the Atlantic" article: "France's Disappearing Mosques" ). What better smoke screen could the extremists ask for, than to have "politically correct" politicians deny that there could be any possible problem within their Muslim communities and dismiss any criticism as being merely "anti-Islamophobia" ?   Is there a word for "willful blindness"?
"Mayor Sadiq Khan called it a “horrific terrorist attack.”  Thank you Mayor...for your murder cult! Liberals had better figure out soon that islamists are not their friends.....
After January 20th, Muslims will become (to use your favourite term) untouchables in the US. Not allowed to use schools, airports, hotels, restaurants along with their white counterparts.   Kind of like African Americans had to go through segregation. Bet you support that too!
46% of American voters are total suckers : Trump's cabinet straight out of the Washington swamp. Trump's emergency plan to ban Muslims has been laughed out of every court. Trump's secret plan to defeat ISIS is to use Obama`s plan. Trump's secret plan to replace Obama Care with something much better, is to replace it with something much worse. Plus, best of all ................ Mexico told Trump where to shove his wall.
"The notable difference between now and those days, with their far more numerous terror incidents, was the lack of hysteria over the bombings and the absence of hatred directed at Catholics and Irish people."  The real notable difference is that the IRA attacks were directed solely against the British and not randomly against the world at large, including their own ethnic/cultural/religious counterparts,  as are the current Muslim attacks.
Does this mean organic food stores have to tell their customers about the pros and cons of eating GMO's? Does this mean a Catholic church has to tell its congregation about the Muslim alternative? etc.
So every Ontario political party has decided that the 7.7% of Toronto that is Muslim represents a voting bloc that must be courted.    The politicians are looking at Muslim birth rates that are 50% higher than non-Muslims, and have determined that future chances of being (re)-elected without Muslim support are slim.  For our existing politicians, it is always about being (re)-elected. The development of polarized anti-immigration political movements in Europe and America followed the same pattern of conduct from establishment politicians. Many domestic voters are looking for vision, not voting bloc pandering, and it is very sad where that search ends up taking them.  And in today's world, especially here in the Globe comments section, some highly relevant forms of vision are branded as Islamophobia.  Will we someday we be asking - is this is how our civil society was lost?
There has never been a more important time in history for people to fact-check the news they read and watch. It's not just the Russians who put out fake news. Trump, for example, is still using the Bowling Green massacre to justify his latest Muslim ban. He lies over seventy percent of the time, yet his supporters take his word as gospel.  There is no excuse other than stupidity and "my-side bias"  for people not to be able to find out what are facts and what are lies. The latter must be fought against by all sides.
Duh. Is that the best you've got, DW? Are you referring to Altarnative Facts? Who would get offended by a hijab, considering there is something like 1.6 billion Muslims in the world?
No they don't.  Everything goes to intimidate those who dare to object hate speech in Canadian mosques, local funding of the Jihadi terror overseas, and etc.  We are supposed not to be concerned with the Islamic terror and cheer for Hezbollah, El Qaeda, Isis, ad Hamas.
The Catholic Church should be speaking out against the overt racism of Trump but they don't want to alienate the majority of white Catholics that voted for him.   Instead they remain   silent as he  denigrates  Hispanics who are overwhelmingly Catholic and the future of the church.    "His incoherent and contradictory utterances have one thing in common: They provoke and play on feelings of resentment and disdain, intermingled with bits of fear, hatred and anger. His public discourse consists of attacking or ridiculing a wide range of “others” — Muslims, Hispanics, women, Chinese, Mexicans, Europeans, Arabs, immigrants, refugees — whom he depicts either as threats or as objects of derision. His program, such as it is, consists chiefly of promises to get tough with foreigners and people of nonwhite complexion. He will deport them, bar them, get them to knuckle under, make them pay up or make them shut up."................Robert Kagan
JP:   Actually the ownership of firearms and Gun Shops and dealerships had already been brought up. I simply connected the two. And I in no way question your assertion that the vast number of the Muslim faith are peaceful, I simply do not like to see either too narrow a lens or too broad a brush stroke used, in the definition of anyone, or group.
Actually despite talking about rendering onto Ceasar , Jesus was radical in his view of faith and behaviour . My Neighbour as thy self does spring to mind. It requires people to understand what is meant by turning the other cheek, it does not mean to be neutral where there is injustice but to fight it with all means without being violent. We need more bishops like McElroy preaching the gospel of the Christ as his early church if you read about it was essentially socialist even communist. I remember in a Christian Brothers school in Belfast a primary one being told the only real difference between real Catholicism and Marxism was that Marx denied God . By the way I do object as I am Irish to you using the mofit "Erin go Brath" especially if you were to understand when your forefathers were the Mexicans and Muslims in the mid 19th Century not to far from where the current US Furher thinks from...
I really wish we could abandon this Obama/Hillary/McCain cluster and just WALK AWAY.   We need to stop arming Islamic Jihadists and let Russia clean up the mess.   Stop playing world police. Walk away.
Not to worry, help is on the way. The great Obama orator and his islamic affinity, is on his way out, irrelevant as we speak. Sanity and decency will be the norm of the day .
It was an incredibly heartless thing for Trump to implement this very selective ban on some Muslim countries. No Pakistan, no Saudi Arabia why, because Trump has business there. How self serving.  But fear not, Trump's no game is to get countries so mad at the United States that they'll want the retaliate.  Want to have your country proper? The old Bush trick, go to war. That's Trump's end game. Make no mistake.
Some say cucumbers taste better pickled. Buckshot? Don't be rude. Where do Muslim bakers discriminate? In Colorado they are subject to the same law as the cake baker. Why do you want to use one wrong to excuse another? Where can I read about Muslim bakers breaking discrimination laws? You realize there are 30 states where you can discriminate based on sexual orientation. You are not allowed to do it in our fair state.  There is no gray area unless you do not understand the law. It is very clear and you seem to support breaking the law. Why do you support lawlessness?  The baker refusing to bake the cake for gays is the same as a store refusing to serve you based on your race. I am confused as to why you do not think this is very  clear.
Don't bother I found your video of the Dearborn Michigan bakery.   By the way, I did not support the suit against the Oregon bakery and I would not do so.    Not everything rises to a level of criminal charges, which mostly just makes the conflict worse.    It could have been a teaching opportunity and a chance to build relationships.  I am not a litigious person and have never sued anyone nor did my parents.  Not when another child cost me my eye, not when another person destroyed my knee, not when my brother was hit by a car, not when my wife's cancer was misdiagnosed, her cancer went untreated for a year and she died.   There is the law, there is right and wrong, there is compassion and forgiveness,   They are not the same thing.  I've written about Muslim religious bigotry many times, including the faith based values on the role of women and the despicable treatment of gays.   We don't throw out Christians for those reason, we shouldn't bar immigration for it either.
Does that justify radical islam???
Well how is it America if we can't discriminate against people that are different, right? These are the same people that support segregation and a Muslim registry. Freedom for others ain't their thing.
Fraudulent foreign affairs expert and Nazi fascist Sebastian Gorka was purged from the White House yesterday, but his wife is still an official with the Department of Homeland Security.  Like her husband, Katharine Gorka is steeped in the world of Frank Gaffney and professional Islamophobia.   "Our pillow talk is the Islamic State and Al Qaeda," Sebastian once quipped before David Horowitz's hate group.   They have promoted anti-Muslim conspiracy theories together for years.   Their collaborative efforts helped shape Donald Trump's policy approach to Islam, including his emphatic use of the words "radical Islamic terrorism."  Mrs. Gorka met with DHS officials during the transition to argue against the Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) program funding for organizations that oppose right wing domestic terror groups.  Mrs. Gorka is protecting Nazis and supremacists from within the government thanks to Trump.
There are Radical Muslims.   Now there are Radical Democrats Radical Democrats so full of hatred for Trump and so forgetful that this is the United States of America, land of the Free and the Brave,   as to even think that Democrats, the US military and the people of this United States of America would allow anyone much less Trump to destroy the US Constitution and convert this country into Nazi America. Hate Trump as much as you will or as much as you can.  But let us not forget this is the United States of America.
Fanatics are created at home   around the dinner table, listening to the elders speak of world events and religion.  Just as young Jews and Christians listen to their parents talk of  charity work and helping the sick and poor people of the world,  Muslims learn to wish death  on Jews and Christians over generous servings of mom's good home cooking.
I am wondering how exactly you "see" Muslim women at a feminist march? And this so called Intersectional Third Wave feminist doesn't see the irony in her comment. Ah well, SJWs can't be questioned.
Why was he unwilling to call the deadly attack "domestic terrorism" because that is exactly what it was. He certainly bashed Obama plenty of times for not saying "radical Islam."
Right now they are too small of a minority to fight amongst themselves.  At 25%   the Sunni, Wahhabi  and the Shiite start to fight each other for control of Mosques and the religious orthodoxy of Islam just as they do back in the home lands. Even in London, some of the various "no go zones" of Islamic enclaves,  where even the police fear to tread, are divided by sectarian faiths.
Oh sure. It's amazing how the 5.8% of Germans who are Muslims are able to fill every urban center at night.
The "post-truth" society is yet another canard. Of course there is such a thing as truth, and thanks to the Web, truth is easier than ever before to find, if you take the time and trouble.  The truth is that most Canadians are tolerant and accepting almost to a fault. What they do not accept is an aggressive religion which is anti-semitic, opposed to gender equality, opposed to homosexuality, views non-believers as second class citizens and advocates violence against anyone who "disrespects" said religion.  This is not "post-truth" -- the validity  of this description is easily verified by anyone who takes the time to read the Koran and the Hadiths.  Is Muslims want to be accepted they have only to integrate into Canadian society, and accept its secular values. Essays like this do not begin to address the true problem, they seek to obscure  and deflect attention from it.
And the Holocaust was to do with ethnicity, and not religion?  And the country was Yugoslavia, not Yogoslavia. And the West (mainly Germany) first instigated the Croatians to secede, thus igniting the civil war. The Orthodox Serbs fought the Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosnians. I would call it a religious war, unless you think the three are the same religion.  I am not Muslim, and therefore can't be a jihadist. I guess that is too heavy a concept for you to understand. Are all your enemies jihadists, in the alternate universe that you live in?
re: But in the 2015 election campaign, Mr. Harper and his party attacked the niqab worn by some Muslim women, and assailed “barbaric cultural practices.”   Assailing "barbaric cultural practices" in Canada is bad?--Who knew?  Probably so in Trudeau's new Canada where we should all turn the other way to hideous practices among foreign incomers.
I refuse to vote for any political party with an overtly religious leader. I don't care if it's Sikhism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever, I will not vote for the NDP until they elect a leader who will put the signs of his religious beliefs aside; religion should always be a quiet personal thing and not on public display.
Like I said do your research. The radical Islamics are forcing people to either convert or die. And also like enslaving women and children. Do you really want that in our country?
Says the guy who regularly defends Islam, eh?
You have to realize that cultures and religions are not "value free". If you love and apply  Sharia, you are perfectly "social" in Saudi-Arabia but anti-social in Canada. Unfortunately too many Muslims agree with the anti-Western part of their holy books. And that is a significant problem.  Therefore while full of good intentions, failure to discriminate and choose immigrants, plants the seeds of intolerance and anti-social behaviour.
I take comfort in the fact that many in Quebec are offended by the outcome of this plebiscite and are raising their voices in public and acting to see that Moslems in Quebec are afforded equal treatment to other Quebec faith communities.   Truth be told, such an unfortunate plebiscite outcome could have arisen in many parts of Canada outside Quebec (especially in rural and small town areas) and one can only hope that should such an outcome occur, Canadians in those Provinces would speak out and act to reverse such an outcome.
There are 4 lies in that headline: 1: it is not a ban, it was simply turned down. 2: It was not a universal rejection of all Muslim cemeteries.  It was a singular matter. 3: It was not an attack.  It was a simple vote to be left alone.  4: Who is "us".   Don't include me in your  jihad.
Muslims can marry 9 year olds and have many wives which Canada accepts so what is the difference
What Canadian Muslims need most protection from is radical elements within their midst, not a handful of nutjobs outside of their own community.
Your First citation refers to refugees, not "young Syrian males".  Rating by me, "Not True"  Your second link is to HRC saying what her immigration policy would be, in general, if she can get it and it is "within the law".  She made no mention whatsoever of Syrians.  Rating by me, "Liar liar pants on fire".  Also, Rush Limbaugh and the Center for American Immigration, whose next story on the spool is "Islamic Invasion, A Hillary Clinton Vision Of America".  If you're OK with that, I think you have made the wrong choice.
Muslims are welcome but only peaceful ones.   Oddly Muslims themselves don't see the distinction.
Ok, we can talk about "islamophobia", white supremacy and far-right terrorism...right after we talk about why followers of islam are seemingly predisposed to terrorism.  Fat chance this comment will get approved....but we'll see.
There was a net gain of 40 (yes 40, from 429 to 469) religiously motivated hate crimes in 2015 over 2014 according to the infographic.  Now we don't know what type of crimes were committed and this stat could be entirely misleading.  If I break into a church for example and steal the donation plate, is that recorded as a hate crime?   For example, if a firearm is present during the commissioning of a crime, the police will record it as a firearms related offence.  Even if the weapon wasn't actually used, it could be sitting in the basement closet for example.  Total hate against the religious hasn't seen a significant increase in Canada, just a shift onto another religion.  Good to see Muslim groups all of a sudden concerned about hate, now that it's not only the Jewish being attacked.
I wonder if Quebec or any province in the country have  laws governing the preparation of the body.  Does it have to be completed by a licensed funeral home?  Doesn't muslim tradition say the body should be prepared for burial by a family member?  Muslims have some very unique rules for preparation, dare I say superstitious? e.g washing the body three times and if more washing  is necessary it always has to be an odd number of times.  Too bad the story doesn't mention what the land is currently zoned as, I think the writer should have included that fact.
This is just another in the series of articles that has "TEKIYAH" as its core objective.  A fundamental Muslim concept, “TEKIYAH” in Persian means a kind of “righteous deception.” It is similar to the Arab belief, espoused in the Koran, that it is acceptable to lie and deceive those around you in order to bring the Infidels down. Anything which would bring the reign of Mohammed was deemed acceptable according to text.  This author is relentlessly at it, and we in the West, are lapping it up!
The past never had been altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia.  Oh, wait.  Assad is actually an Alawite and ISIS are mostly Sunni.  Which branch of Islam are we supposed to be cheering for today ?
The backdrop to Chin's statements appears to be the President-Elect's earlier proposal for a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration. From what I have read, first-class scholars like Dershowitz, claim this is not something that can be legally considered in evaluating the actual ban that was later proposed.  Additionally Dershowitz states the ban is legal. I think the Supreme Court arguments are going to be fascinating, assuming that they choose to take it up.
David G. Lewis, you need the actual OED, not the online "oxford living dictionary."  There's only one OED and here's the full entry, minus the examples:  "Islamophobia, n. Pronunciation:   Brit. /ɪzˌlamə(ʊ)ˈfəʊbɪə/ ,  U.S. /ɪˌslɑməˈfoʊbiə/ ; see also Islamo- comb. form. Forms:  see Islamo- comb. form   and -phobia comb. form. Frequency (in current use):  Origin: Formed within English, by compounding. Etymons: Islamo- comb. form, -phobia comb. form. Etymology: < Islamo- comb. form + -phobia comb. form.     Intense dislike or fear of Islam, esp. as a political force; hostility or prejudice towards Muslims."  In any case, the definition from the more basic dictionary you've used includes "dislike of ... Muslims..." which was the point of my reply to from the heart_out.
Let me work with the one clear thought that I can discern.  Both Christianity and Islam are religions.  As far as what Germany did, the progressive agenda fits pre WWII Germany better than anything I'm talking about.
Indeed.  Turn on Fox News for an hour and count the number of times they say the word 'terrorist' or 'terrorism' or 'Islam'.  Then count the number of times they say 'cancer' or 'heart disease'.  Trump's budget cuts funding for cancer research.  Your odds of being killed by bee stings are double the odds of being killed by a terrorist.
Muslims need to be fearfull while living at the U.S., since they are required by Islamic Laws to Support the Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam (especially the Imams at the Mosques), and to join the Jihad against the Christians, Jews, Unbelievers (Kafir) to prove that they are Muslims.  example If an Imam demands that a Muslim do a Fatawa, a death penalty sentence, of a U.S. Citizen, the Muslim Must, or he or she and all their Families Relatives Friends are added to that Death Penalty Sentence to be accomplished by anybody.  2006 President Bush Ordered the U.S. Department of State to coordinate activities to cut off the Mandatory Islamic Tithes given by All Muslims from reaching the Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam ("Muslim Terrorists").  2009 President Obama's U.S. Law, "Material Support to Terrorist Organizations", ended up convicting many U.S. Muslims, yet President Obama gave Iran's Hamas Terrorists $900 Million and Clinton gave $400 Million of U.S. Citizens Money.
Anti-immigrant sentiment was at the top of the list with 206 reported attacks, while anti-woman and anti-Trump attacks remained at the bottom with 36 and 27 reported attacks respectively. A total of 151 incidents targeted black people, 80 targeted LGBT-people, 51 targeted Muslims and 60 involved swastikas.  Defacing property is a crime and I trust the SPLC to identify hate attacks appropriately....I have no idea except for the 60 swastikas whatever property defacement was done with respect to gay's, blacks etc but suspect a fair amount was done...typically the SPLC hands over these things to law enforcement for suitable attention.....
Really which side in WW1 was killing Christians or Muslims because they were Christian or Muslim?  Oh yeah that didn't happen.  So this 'point' is completely worthless to your argument.
Originally, I did not agree with her action not defending the government's position, no matter how bad it was. However, she made a good point that it was not legal points, but the facts that were suggested to her which she knew to be untrue. She was having to argue the FACT that the law was not an anti-Muslim law when she knew it was an antimuslim law she would be acting dishonestly, fraudulently, and could be suborning surgery. She could not argue defense of the law against the religious bias argument at the heart of the challenge without lying.
Most Muslims are peace loving people, just as most Americans are peace loving people. If only the rest would get along with folks who aren't exactly like themselves. Here in America, neither whites nor blacks nor Hispanics feel completely safe in going to a different neighborhood, and a few of folks get beat up or even shot for going into the wrong neighborhood.  I don't like any of that stuff, but when you put that behavior on only one religious group, when everyone else is pretty much the same, that's where I disagree. The US is better than a lot of nations where people kill each other more, but we still have the prejudice here.
(...CONTINUED FROM ABOVE)  You said: "...we do know that the Jewish nation has been there far longer then a Islamic state.....actually that part of the world never been a state of any kind once the Jewish kingdom was destroyed by the Roman Empire....until 1948."  May I suggest you predicate your claims on the history of THIS planet?  Muslim states ruled Palestine from 636 CE until the end of the 19th century, with the exception of about one century of rule by the Christian Crusaders.  Were wars fought in which governments changed hands?  Yep.  That happens to countries where folks have other (or no) religions as well.  But until defeat of the Ottomans in WWI Palestine was ruled, for better or worse, by MUSLIMS.   The biblical Kingdom of Israel (including its Judean client-state) arose in the 10th century BCE and fell about four centuries later.  NEXT!  (CONTINUED BELOW...)
Again, ignorance based on a lack of understanding and a sheer unwillingness to even look at the facts.   Islam doesn't teach that society should be so organized as you characterize. In all Muslim societies past and the majority of them in the present, men and women interact with each other as any other society. Muslim women run their own businesses, they can fight in wars alongside men, they can teach and be political leaders, they can speak in public if they so want.   I went to Peel highschools over 20 years ago. I sat with my female, non-Muslim friends and classmates to laugh and joke or study and learn, without any hesitation or problems. My sisters (who wear hijab and are moderately practicing) did the same, running for and winning seats on the student council, participating in Terry Fox runs, speaking at school rallies, etc etc.   The problem here is that many people have their own preconceived notions about what Muslims are or aren't, based on sensationalist media stories.
Actually, the homicide rate in Christian countries (mainly in USA, Latin America and Africa) is much higher than in Muslim countries.  murder in the name of religion is NOT higher in Christian countries--and we don't "behead" Muslims the way ISIS does to Christians for practicing their religion--and tell me how may Catholic churches there are in Mecca is you want to use the Vatican as your example---Italy surrounds the Vatican and there are mosques there--there are NO Catholic churches in Saudi Arabia that surrounds Mecca
The Trump administration has not singled out those groups for special harassment.  They have singled out Muslims despite Muslims being the largest group negatively affected by terrorism.  And despite the fact that the far right and gun owners cause more death to Americans than any of the groups you mentioned combined - they`re not singled out for disfavour, either.
Countries exist because people are forced to assimilate to a certain degree. Most modern countries were constructed by using violence to homogenize the population. It is not accidental that England is protestant and France Catholic but due to violent conversion or expulsion. I can also understand the discomfort with dual citizenship even if it has benefits for individuals and countries, maybe it would help if there was a passport tax and holders paid a yearly tax for each citizenship they had. The Americans are doing something like this with their tax rules. Turkey is traveling a scary road and they have a lot of problems including wars in Iraq and Syria that America had a big hand in starting. It is in everyone's interest to have a democratic and economically healthy Turkey and Muslims who are integrated into the places where they live.
I would say that Mr. Mulcair is correct in his view of Mr. Trump.  I would also disagree with Mr. Clement when he states that no one will listen to Mr. Mulcair because he's in 3rd place.  Most Canadians I talk to would agree with Mr. Mulcair's view of Mr. Trump.  What Trump is proposing vis a vis American Muslims is analogous to what Hitler started in Germany with  the anti-Jewish Nuremburg Laws, i.e, discrimination on the basis of religion.  How can anyone not see the similarities?
correction this war has been going on since islam pushed its way into the region
"You’re describing some interpersonal issues with relationships and a narrow definition of relationships and love. That’s a problem for a different sort of professional than a priest." I think my experience is very common among single people.  Married people have their own families.  They don't have time to deal with their friends' problems.  Moreover, people don't care about strangers.  There was recently a situation in NYC where a Muslim woman was harassed on a subway by Trumpkins and all the other riders did nothing.  This is very common.    Oh and I really don't appreciate the continued personal attacks by you.  "People can receive Communion, have their kids baptized, and participate in parish life." Priests should try this thing called MYOB.  The happy marriages of adult people are not their business.  They should butt out and provide the Sacraments and services requested.
Australia also has implemented a hard line stance against Muslim immigration.  They see the danger and consequences of Islam pouring into their country.  No difference to the policy that Trump has just signed.
I think it more likely Justin and wife were there for Islamic spiritual  enlightenment, something he knows the general public would have a hard time accepting. hence NO CAMERAS, no pictures of  him in his  fine white linens and she in her  hijab.
Just try to abolish the "Establishment Clause" of the first amendment (separation of church and state): Oh wait... they've  already started the process.... Donald Trump, Betsy Devoss and VOUCHERS are just around the corner!  Can't wait for the first Muslim (Sharia Law) Madrassa in the Matsu School District.  Yee Ha! It happens, people.
Nigel,  If you look at the countries with the highest murder rates, the first 27 are Christian. Turkmenistan is the first Muslim country at number 28.   So that is my position of knowledge. Could you show me yours?
The logic shown in this article is so like Donald Trump's it's uncanny. Trump wants to ban and restrict Muslims in the US because a tiny minority of them are committing acts of terrorism against US citizens. This article is arguing that men should be banned and restricted from certain venues because of a small minority of them who are committing violent crimes against women.  The only difference between these two positions is of scale and severity but the logic is irrefutably the same. So if you think Trump's stance against Muslims is deplorable how can you possibly support the identical argument when it is used, albeit at a far smaller scale, against men? You'll note that the reaction in the UK to the Manchester bombing of a rock concert was not to ban Muslims from future concerts so perhaps we can all agree that tarring a group with the same brush because of the actions of a minority is deplorable and we should all stop doing it?
Why should the pay anything?  She says she has a life threatening allergy so the airline had no choice but to remover her.  She was offended by the dogs and overstated her allergies to make a case. It backfired.  Southwest likely flies hundreds if not thousands of Muslim women every day.  It certainly flies thousands of people of color every single day.  She should be ashamed of herself.
This sounds like a Trump initiative. Canada should reject any idea of banning certain electronic devices from the cabins of planes. And it is only targeting mid-east countries - highly discriminatory towards Muslims......besides, Canada has no terrorist threats.....
The FBI did not say she was wrong. They just replied "no," the question of whether they believe there is an Islamic compound stockpiling weapons in Alaska. Big difference. And Jones even says, although he has not been able to swing it yet, it is a dream to purchase some land and start a Muslim enclave. That's really what we need, eh? Muslim enclaves. Has everyone really forgotten about 9/11 already. Hey, if you go online you can now see pictures of what the people jumping out of the World Trade Center looked like after they hit the ground. Go take a look, refresh your memory of that horrible day and who did that to us.
Show me anywhere in the incidents listed where the people used their religion to justify their actions? They may have been Christians, I do not argue that point, just that none of them used their religion to justify their crimes. In the case of the radical Islamic terrorists, in almost every single case they yell "Allahu Akbar" is an Islamic phrase, called Takbir in Arabic, meaning "God is greater" or "God is [the] greatest". I do not think they are referring to the national anthem of Libya, a 1977 Indian Malayalam film or the song written by Lounes' Matoub. So please show me where any of the people you list said anything about "In the name of Christ" or In God's name"?
"Why would any woman, black or LGBT vote for a Democrat?" Because they want to.  Rethuglican's don't give a rip about them. They haven't for decades and they're not about to start now. You know 4:20, this is what extreme Christians want - "...treat women like dogs, believe homosexuality is punishable by death, and that all “infidels” must convert..." So what do you get when you cross a Christian radical with a Muslim extremist? A radical extremist.
How bad is this bill?  Cassidy argues his bill protects people with pre-existing conditions,    …why?, ...because Trump tweeted it did.  (…and we all know Trump would never lie on Twitter?  …..hahahhah.)     Trump is regularly manipulated by Twitter bots.   Since the beginning of last month, he’s used Twitter to endorse a hoax story about an American general who purportedly mass-murdered Muslims, and in one instance managed to cram four false statements into a single tweet about nuclear weapons.   If Trump says one thing, you can bet it's the opposite.
So is the statement put forward by far left liberals that there are no problem areas where radical Muslims refuse to assimilate and that they aren't trying to enforce Sharia.
Extreme views? Do you see the potential for future integration issues with an all boys soccer team that threatens to forfeit a match for religious reasons because the opposing team has two female players? I wonder how they plan to work in a society that treats men and women as equals? It's not Islamaphobic to point out that political Islamists are incompatible with liberal secular democracies: freedom of expression (including satire), gender equality, and freedom of sexual orientation - all foreign concepts among the 57 members of the OIC but in Canada they are embraced by Islamists or there are no Islamists? Which one? Progressives are shamelessly naive to the misogyny paraded as religious piety and defended in terms of cultural relativism - gender segregated mosques - the pressure to wear headscarves out of religious piety, and the double standard that demands sensitivity compared to other religions . Canada is a liberal secular democracy - societies governed by Islamic law are not.
Trudeau so has to go in 2019.  So, in saying that, am I an online troll?  You didn't define it very clearly, just as M103 fails to clearly define Islamophobia.  This is a dangerous game.
When I visited Germany in the 1970s, things were fairly peaceful and one didn't see police all over the place.  Millions of Muslims have now swarmed into Europe and European countries have given them asylum. But there have been numerous incidents where followers of Islam have attacked, maimed and killed innocent, civilian non believers in France, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, etc.  Consequently, European countries have had to increase security. Police are everywhere and it's almost as if people in Europe are living in police states with police on every corner.  And in New York, U.S.A., the police have increased security and in Toronto, Canada police have increased security just in case followers of Islam try to attack Christmas shoppers.  My, how things have changed.   I guess people in Europe, Canada, the U.S.A. and other western countries will be nervous and will have to be more vigilant. Is that going to be the new norm?  Is that the way we want to live?
George Clooney and his Muslim wife are leaving Britain and Europe, selling property and moving to LA where they believe their children will be safer from terrorism. After all he said against Trump and in defence of open border immigration by Muslims from Syria you have to wonder why he now seeks the safety of Trump's America.
Kuroiwaj - You are fooling yourself.  There is no law that specifically says a person can't be prejudiced.  There is no law that specifically says a person has to treat everyone else equally.   Even if there are, there would be no way to prove/enforce them.   Do you really believe that blacks, asians, foreigners, handicapped, poor, ugly, muslims, buddhists, etc. were/are treated equally?  Wake up or open your eyes.
Ad hominem. Is this better: I am a non-Muslim Canadian man and  I would vastly prefer a Muslim woman in a headscarf than a proud feminist who gets triggered by things. Not that I would ever end up with a proud feminist Canadian trigger-woman when she could always get together with another woman and thoroughly enjoy Ontario's new gender neutral parental wording in the `All Families Are Equal Act'  Or as I call it: `another nail in the coffin act'
"Canada’s record prior to the war was to deny refuge to Jews fleeing oppression in Germany, Russia and other unwelcoming countries. We’ve already lived through a “none is too many” immigration policy; we must avoid unintentionally reinventing that shameful past.   "Yet, many have reasonably argued that when it comes to Muslim refugees today, especially from war-torn Syria, the anti-Muslim rhetoric falls dangerously close to what Canadians heard in prewar times."  ~ Amira Elghawaby and Bernie Farber, Globe and Mail, September 5, 2015.
Perhaps Fran could explain why the University of Alaska Fairbanks is building a foot-washing station for Muslims - paid for by the people of Alaska.
In the area of sciences, there have only been one Muslim Nobel Prize winner this century--for Chemistry in 2015 and he was from Turkey. Last century, there were two Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences: 1979, a Pakistani Scientist in Physics whose tomb is guarded since he is the wrong kind of Muslim. The other is an Egyptian Chemist in 1999.  The Fields Medal winner breakdown is even more stark.
Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Immigration has already stated categorically that he will not open Canada's doors to Christians. That would be religion faith based immigration policy and against our secular moral standards. He said just a couple of weeks ago that Christians don't face the same dangers as other legitimate refugees. He will however welcome all Muslims fleeing Trump's persecution in the US.
Any moderate Muslim in a majority Muslim country would risk death if he or she spoke out against terrorism and Sharia'h. They are too afraid.  Many good Muslims need to disavow despicable acts in the name of Allah. Only then will peace come to their world.
The historic Mohammad is not pertinent to a discussion of modern Islam for the same reason its pointless to debate about the historic Jesus. People will believe what they want to believe regardless of what happened centuries ago.  Religion is a two-edged sword. It can be used for personal growth and enlightenment, or it can be used to try to coerce others into conforming to a certain pattern of behavior. Every major religion has been abused at one time or another by those seeking to use it to gain power over others.   The bottom line is, focusing on Islam is a distraction from the main problem, which is the volatile situation in the Middle East. Most suicide bombers are desperate young people who've been manipulated into radicalization by those, like ISIS, who seek to exploit their hopelessness. Young people with hope, be they Muslims, Christians or whatever, don't engage in terrorism and they certainly don't buy into suicide.
No, Grizzly. Because there's no reason to keep pretending that the mass murderers by sick individuals who decide to yell "Allah" is any different from sick individuals who say "for the babies" or "I want to start a race war" or any other reason.  I'm going to pay attention to the US, because I live here- not in one of the stricter Muslim nations. I'd prefer that all the nutjobs who picked up guns or bombs weren't doing it. I was working in Oklahoma City the year of the bombing, so I'm not as picky as folks who prefer focusing on one category of terror here.  I also happen to live in a neighborhood with a lot of Muslim immigrants.  You know what they do?  They push kids in strollers. They shop. They hang out in the park. They go to work and send their kids to school. They've never murdered me, or me them.  So no, if people want to label all Muslims because of what a few twisted ones do, it's no different from warning you about all Whites - based on a few twisted ones. Same difference.
HRC  definition of hate crime does NOT include hate crimes done to white people.  The OHRC will not hear a  complaint of hate crime allegedly done  by a  people of color or Muslims. THe HRC is not there for you if you are fit, white, male, heterosxual, because its mandate states such people cause racism and therefore cannot be victims of it.
Canada's Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Ahmed Hussen has said he will not open the door to emergency immigration by Christians facing persecution in Muslim countries.  Apparently Canada has a rigid  secular  immigration policy. No matter how bad it gets for Christianias and Jews in Muslim countries he will not let them come to Canada.  To him, that is fair. However, Muslims crossing the borders  will never be turned away. Christians can be burned alive by ISIS for all he cares.
The Muslim woman might get in trouble at home if a stranger like you smiles at her.
Why not ban Saudis and Pakistanis? Those countries have the highest number of religious extremists in the Muslim world. Hell, Saudi Arabia is the home of religious extremism, and every Muslim terrorist group takes Saudi Arabia's extreme Wahabi version of Islam as their version.
Until religious, ethnic, cultural, societies accept there is a problem within and speak out about it, there can be no acceptance.  When we accept as fact Muslims, Natives and Blacks are victims, then we excuse bad behaviour of the few.  Society as a whole become responsible for those few.  The segment of society that acknowledges there is a problem, should ask for and receive help from society as a whole to solve the problem of the few.    White supremacists are also a problem, but this motion doesn't address that issue.
First let me make clear that what happened to this family is unacceptable.   You wrote: " There's nothing in this article that suggests that Tayyab Rashid and Afroze Anjum are those rigid people"  ---- There is nothing to suggest they aren't.  From the article " Islam forms the core part of our identity"  The attitude towards gay, role of women, apostates in Islamic faith is well known. Unless Tayyab or Afroze are part of a "reformed" liberal Islamic faith zoeygirl's question are valid.
Where have you been hiding.  Europe is being savaged and ravaged by masses of uncontrollable mobs who have defied the police, ransacked homes, gang-raped young girls, beaten and robbed defenseless elderly citizens and taken over whole districts, not allowing any non-muslims entry.  We are living in different times.   This is not "travel."  This is escaping with their lives to a safer place and then reverting back to barbaric behavior that is the only behavior they know.  Yes, the radicals in this mob do scare me.  I fear for my kids and grandkids.  No rocks to hide under...that's their weapon of choice, to maim and destroy.  Wise up.
Understanding Muslims. Listen to Brigitte Gabriel who was born in Lebanon to a Maronite Christian family.  Copy the websites below and listen to what she says about Muslims.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guXBTgAxhIw http://www.israelvideonetwork.com/brigitte-gabriel-reveals-the-muslim-brotherhood-plan-for-america/ https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidnoriega/meet-the-charming-terrifying-face-of-the-anti-islam-lobby?utm_term=.xg3dOljA3#.cdpdGnQYW
Absolutely, citizens rights are recognized in a liberal democracy. A question to consider is do people who do not have a tradition of self-criticism—a procedure until recently rarely practiced and little understood in the Middle East—function well within such a system . This lack of self-criticism  may explain why there are no true liberal democracies in the Muslim world. It could also explain why criticism is labelled as Islamophobia and racism.
It started with the Christians, then the Natives, then the French, then in 1960's the Jews came, now we have the feminists, gays, lesbians and even Muslims.  It is a caste system, the rest of us have to obey them and even pay for them. All have special privileges, financial benefits and even laws that prevent anyone from criticism them.
A very good piece and three good proposals.  It is a shame that long pieces written well above a grade seven level do not resonate with most Canadians and indeed those in the West.    The problems and complexities of our world cannot be regressed to sound bites or photo ops.  Some will take umbrage with the notion of refugee support and education, but building strong Muslim women is central to the new peace dividend.  Corporate taxes are a tricky one, needing concerted work internationally to work.  Look no further than Ireland as an example of a country trying to build comparative advantage through tax savings.  While I am neither a Liberal or Conservative, I fear the work described above is too much for either Trudeau or any of the current Conservative leadership candidates. Perhaps a fourth initiative is to find a way to bring better people with more capacity into government.
@The G&M monitor= why “censured” this comment ? - Le Devoir/ Montréal 18 juillet 2017 ; ...( )....The President of the Association of the Muslim burial, Hadjira Belkacem, felt that the Centre Culturel Islamique (in Québec) could show more flexibility on this issue.  "The Center culturel Islamique is only the Islamic cultural center. Remember that the Muslim community is NOT represented by a mosque. Has approached them to collaborate and work together, but they refused, and that is deplorable. The problem was the inadequate approach to the Centre Islamique, who wanted to have his cemetery without the consent of the population. I assure you that the inhabitants of Saint-Apollinaire are not against a Muslim cemetery, them. They wanted to share the ground, because they also need this field” Got it guys ?..."WITHOUT the consent of the population"...yes ?
Two points:  1. I was specifically replying to the atheist-op-ed writer, who, while writing cogently about Jesus Christ's commandment about loving others, didn't mention what HE (the writer) did during the Christmas season as to helping the disadvantaged.  The core message of atheism is that of denial of  God through Christ, without actually doing anything substantive to help the poor.  2. Yes, of course there are SECULAR-based charities that do good work. But atheists have not really organized themselves into ""churches", until recently -- something that would give atheism the potential to do good work as atheists.  The three monotheistic religions  (Christianity, Judaism, Islam) all emphasize helping the poor. On this point, where are the atheists? I mean, really?  Back to the op-ed piece, the writer makes good points, as ideas. But for me Christmas is a time of giving and the sharing of Christian love. -- David Murrell, Economics, UNB at Fredericton
Let Muslim refugees go to Muslim countries where they share common cultural traits. We can take those who are persecuted by Muslims ....Christian...Baha'i , Buddhists etc.  we don't owe anyone anything. We need to be masters of our own collective destiny as a country..not slaves to irresponsible pandering to left wing nut bars masquerading as concerned Canadians.
i didn't vote for trump or hillary.  maybe it's time for a 'no' box on ballots. its possible that the kids in this videos parents, are mostly trump supporters and are are being taught that 85% of the people on earth, even infants, are going to burn in hell for eternity and that's just not right. jesus first and second commandments have been forgotten. evangelicals fever over abortion, lgbtq rights, civil and individual rights, education, health care, muslims and etc., is dividing our country. but, they vote, get their representatives to pass laws that hurt and even kill people, in the name of 'their' god. when 'my' vice president tells me, someone that doesn't care if god exists or not, that he is a christian first, a conservative second and a republican third, and in that order, where does that leave me and the 3/4ths of all other americans that aren't any of those? i want my leaders to listen to me, not to 'god'.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LACyLTsH4ac
Perhaps “anti semitic” should be included as well, it is likely Jews face as much discrimination as Muslims. Perhaps “Islamophobia” should just be left out of the bill which would then apply to all religions.
Welcome to Canada, scavenger truth.  You have a lot of support from Canadians, muslims and non muslims alike.
I'm pointing out that you can't be coy about your beliefs and behaviors, then accuse people of being ignorant of what "real Muslims" are like, of of being "prejudiced", and of assuming they are extreme conservatives., when you do absolutely nothing to combat those assumptions.  If you constantly present yourself as an ultra-conservative Muslim when supposedly representing Muslims in mainstream media, don't be surprised that is what people assume "Muslims" are like.
No One mentions the fact of how many times Islamic terrorist appear to come to the United States "innocently" and turns out to be suicide bombers or mass murders. This is a great move on the presidents part. We obviously don't have a good filter on immigrants if we are constantly being attacked by these immigrants. So until we get  better system to filter who comes in, then no one should come in! Also, for those of you who have an issue with the president prioritizing religious minorities, you certainly wouldn't have an issue if that was you over seas. Do some research. Look at what ISIS is doing to those religious minorities. It will change your perspective
There are many verses in the Qur'an, the holy book of the religion of Islam, that call for jihad (struggle) and many verses in the Qur'an that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers.  Are people saying Muslims are extreme and  radical when they follow those verses and directions in the Qur'an?
The media has been clear in their criticism of Trump:  In his initial statement, he failed to single out racist groups even though it was a member of those groups who committed murder. Two days later, he issued a statement in which he singled out Nazis and the KKK as evil, but then the very next day he went back to his original statement, saying everyone was at fault.  You are, of course, free to interpret Trump's words for yourself, but when an Islamic terrorist commits an act of violence on US soil, Trump is quick to criticize the terrorist and Muslims in general.  Why, then, does he fail - not once, but twice - to call out white supremacists when they commit an act of domestic terrorism?  Why would he blame BOTH sides?  Only one guy was driving that car.  You can hurl whatever insults you want, but a lot of people are perfectly capable of noticing Trump's inconsistent behaviour and asking why racists get it easier than Muslims when they commit murder.
This would be an appropriate time for Trump to admit that he lied about seeing thousands of Muslims celebrating in the streets on 9/11.
Here's a short history lesson:  When President Obama was elected he faced eight years of attacks from the far-right, including Donald Trump.  He was branded a Muslim and a "foreigner" who wasn't even an American citizen.  There were millions (yes, millions) of racist attacks posted across the internet.  You say "he was given a chance"....balderdash.  The GOP leaders openly announced they were dedicated to making President Obama's term a failure.  Now you have the audicity of accusing those who are unhappy with Mr. Trump's election of "spreading poison."  President Obama accomplished a great deal......in spite of the poison spread to stop him....  Working for the "sake of the common good."  Now that's a great idea..who can argue with that.  However, as I see Donald Trump choose his cabinet, I see no signs he's choosing anyone who is the least bit dedicated to the "common good."  That's unfortunate and it will be reflected in the policies and actions of the Trump administration.
Why is it acceptable for Muslim Imams to preach hatred against other religions?
Maybe some of the self proclaimed authorities on terrorism here in Alaska should try a Google search using the terms "terrorism training camps USA", before judging her too harshly. Mr. Jones might be clean, but the same cannot be said for Muslims Of America, which has strong ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, as Wells as other terrorist groups. Another Google search using the terms "sponsors of Islamic terrorism USA" will also add some clarity to this matter..
In the last 6,000 years of human history no one has succeeded by being the "me first".  All successful ideologies, moral codes, religions stress putting others' interests before your own. America's present failings are precisely because since its last do-gooder President Woodrow Wilson, beginning with 1920s corrupt administrations of Coolidge, Harding, and Hoover USA has thought of its own interests first.   WWI, WWII, Cold War, Korea, Viet-Nam, Chile, Iran, Iraq, Af-Pak all are examples where America put itself first, even under Obama.   Greed and selfishness made American century last only a quarter - 1950-72 when gold was delinked from $. Nixon, Reagan, Bushes, did the damage to American prosperity and world prestige, and now Trump will simply speed up the rate of decline. No Jews then, no Mexicans and Muslims now.  We in Canada will be hurt even more as we have converted ourselves into a one-customer factory. All that investment will simply go waste.
The Globe knows the fate of Charlie  Hebdo is going to happen at the Globe's own offices if  criticism of Islam is allowed to go too far.  Next, there may be images of Mohammad.  We can't have that. @;(>
THIS  COMMENT SHOULDN'T  NOT BEEN DELETED, IT MEETS ALL CIVIL  REQUIREMENTS, SORRY IF YOU DON'T AGREE !! == Secular should mean secular period..Our values should be made clear so we don't find ourselves in these situation. People need to stop being to politically correct and clearly state the expectations when moving to Canada, the pandering must end !!!  My greatest fear is we are going to find ourselves fighting off SHARI, it has become prevalent in Muslim held community's in Europe and has NO place in secular Canada. http://acdemocracy.org/sharia-and-the-european-union/
Finland - about 5 and a half million population, about 1% Muslim. Canada - about 35 million and about 3.5%. It would be nice to have what the RCMP was asking for recently for 'High Value' targets - which is basically a bunch of bullet proof stuff for 'High Value' people's houses. Ironically the people most affected by these attacks are not 'High Value.' Whatever the opposite of 'High Value' is - that probably better describes the victims.
I would also like to know, John. But by today's standards, the Vatican Bank is quite poor (for its constituency of 1.2 billion self-identified members), considering the amounts that other religious groups handle -- the hundreds of billions the Moslem Saudis handle for Islamic causes, the building of new mosques, etc.; likewise the tens of billions the Mormons in Utah manage (for its 12 million members); or even universities like Notre Dame, whose endowment -- for educational purposes -- is well over 10 billion, or Harvard, whose endowment is more than three times that. But genuine accountability exists where there is open and honest financial reckoning. We -- Catholics on the globe -- should expect that from the Vatican. But I've a question for you: why don't German Catholics or UK Catholics or French or Canadian Catholics complain? Why always American Catholics, NCR readers like us, who want accountability? German Catholics I know call Francis a "guest worker." They don't expect much!
When you can show me how something you drop falls up rather than down, I will be happy to have a conversation about the reality of natural law.   That most other Americans - Christian, Jewish, and Muslim - believe homosexual behavior is immoral is a demonstrable fact. To you and those who share your contempt for their beliefs that  "it makes it difficult to raise children who are morally straight" and "it weakens the family as the cornerstone of society", they give chorus of "So what?"  Every law, including the Constitution, is a matter for a majority decision.  As the last election demonstrated, sufficient arrogance leads to a practical demonstration of that reality.
Not sure what you're talking about Jay. I was trying to respond to the OP who was complaining about "being lectured to by Liberal supporters." My point being that if one can respond rationally to the problems of literal interpretations of Islam, for example, then one shouldn't be accused of hate. However when that response is couched in uncivil, gross generalizations about all Muslims and ignores facts such as how Muslims are not only immigrants but have actually been in Canada since Confederation, then being accused of bigotry, prejudice, or hate may be appropriate.   It's also possible that expressions of hate can appear to be made civilly but inspire of that they are not inherently reasonable or rational.
"What are young Canadian Muslims supposed to do, other than have faith?"  Perhaps they could free themselves from the chains of dogma, and try using reason rather than faith.
I understand this is very Leitch-esque (and thus problematic) but on the other hand, and as a practical matter why is it a problem to ask them questions that provide insight into who they are, especially given they are breaking Canadian laws, that this is Canadians' first impression of them?  Maybe they need to reframe the issue more broadly, ask different questions that get at all kinds of fundamentalism- political, religious- that are potential security threats. rather than just the supposed muslim/religious kind, and ask them of everyone.  The social aspects of what immigrants bring is as important as important as any other, no? Besides, one can get the info one seeks without asking direct, perceived discriminatory questions like these; and ask them of everyone.  BTW, I've seen that border guard show once or twice and some of these questions they ask are pretty invasive, including if they use drugs, when was the last time they used it, etc.
ok Rich Mole, next time maybe Prsident Trump can call you and ask what word he should use. are you kidding me. I heard Obama after muslims raped 12 girls in England say there is no place for that in society. Why didn't he use the word abhor the muslims. Trumps words and I will repeat exactly his words. Trump said the KKK, white supremacist, neo nazis are repugnant and have no place in America. A 3 year old could understand that. whats the confusion, would you rather he say the KKK are wonderful? Only Hilary Clinton who's mentor was a KKK leader (Robert Byrd) would talk like that.
Now you're not making sense, what's golf got to do with this? When I talked about the murders of gays in Syria, which ISIS does there buckshot, I was saying that it is a bit far for his message that he was trying to convey but resteered the topic back to the fact that Muslim bakers do discriminate and you guys don't get all hurt over it. So why the double standard? The law is a grey area man, it  is not black and white as to who is wrong and who is right.
Johnny Mabry. Now I'm confused. I thought President Obama was guilty of implementing the new world order. Now you say he's guilty of isolationism. Can you please make your mind up.  You can't have it both ways. Just like he's a communist Muslim. You do know those are radically opposite things. They don't mix.
What are Muslims afraid might be found out?
As far as I've read of the immigrants in the UK, the most recent Muslim incomers are forming their own 'enclaves', to such an extent that many people growing up in these areas think that Britain is an Islamic country! Coming from the UK 40 years ago, immigrants were accepted, because they became part of the community while remaining 'themselves'. The Bangladeshi grocer, the Jamaican bus- or train-driver, the Polish plumber, etc. were all part of the UK community and accepted as such. It appears that the most recent Muslim immigrants want the 'goodies' of Western countries, but are totally unwilling to become part of them. The melting pot is no longer, and may be more of a layered 'pousse-cafe', where each layer does not mix.
Forgive my foolishness, but I fear the misogyny, violence, and intolerance that exist in EVERY muslim state in the world.  I fear the societal breakdown, segregation, and increase in terrorism that has occurred in the last couple of decades in EVERY country with large intake of muslim migrants.    I fear that my daughters will not be able to walk safely, unless covered in a sac,  in public in the future, because that's the case  in most islamic countries in the world, and it becomes the same in muslim-dominated neighbourhoods in the non-islamic world.   A phobia is an irrational fear.   A perusal of what's going on in the world tells me that my fear is not irrational.   Canada has had a generally positive experience with muslims - bear in mind that historically we had a large population of Ismaili muslims, who are by far the most progressive sect. Past performance is not an indicator of future results, as they say, especially when circumstances and ingredients differ.
This is getting ridiculous.  Comments are being gassed immediately.  I just posted a quote from the Quran and presto it was gone.  What's wrong with quoting the Quran?
Yes, you are correct there Thomas Dye about "complete and total". --- However, No your 2015 quote expired and was superseded in 2016.   For all of the quotes on Muslim ban in 2015 became moot when in 2016 Trump change "all Muslims" to only Muslims from certain terror regions.
Your false perception is the Christian rulers of Canada are secular. They prefer Muslim and Jews to agnostic or atheist immigrants.
"No One": please at least have the courage to show who you really are.  I think your questioning of the legitimacy of the equivalence avoids the actual problem.  It is well known that Rose and his publication refused to publish cartoons that criticized Christian ideals and ideas because they knew it would offend their Christian readers. Why was the same courtesy not extended to readers and practitioners of the Islamic faith?
the political, racial, religious zeitgeist are the Muslims.
Let me be very clear: I detest all religions equally. I find most of them to be violent, intolerant stories invented by men who had a very poor understanding of science. Religion is a personal matter, and it has no place in politics or education (unless being studied for historical purposes).  My government coming out and calling me an "islamophobe" for my personal opinions and thoughts about religion is absolutely disgusting, and I will not stand for it. Using the word "islamophobia" is making matters worse. Why? Because we aren't stupid. Everyone knows what it really means: Dislike of muslims, OR ISLAM.  Muslims are people - People should be treated with respect, regardless of identity Islam is an ideology - I find the the ideology of islam nothing short of abhorrent  Are you able to tell the difference? Apparently not. This is a serious problem.  Liberals: Do you really think you can force me to change my opinions on religion?  Best of luck with that.
Isn't the "Jewish" State of Israel, itself an unwanted "Monument" to the WWII-era German "Holocaust"? It is built mostly on lands stolen from Middle Eastern Arab Christian and Muslim Palestinians. To my knowledge, Hitler's atrocities were committed mostly in Europe.
I suspect part of what may be it at play here is an understandable confusion over the mixed messages we receive over religion.    For the past 20 years or so Christianity, or at least overt or public Christianity, has been strongly discouraged as civic Canada has further and further refined its secular governance.  I don't think it was Christianity per se which was the target in as much as it was the idea that religious beliefs should not be a factor in public policy - and that's fine.    Islam comparatively young religion is therefore still very fundamental in its practice and, at a time where we have accepted a post-Christian state,  it seems to have become a badge for progressive accommodation of the 'other' and people are no doubt confused  as to why must be discouraged and the other encouraged.
When Marine Le Pen temporarily stepped down as President of the FN during the second round (and think about that for a second) the party appointed Jean-François Jalkh as interim leader.  A man so close to Jean-Marie Le Pen, he was on record as a holocaust denier.  He lasted 3 days before the public found out and he was forced to resign.  Today's FN is still very much yesterday's FN.  Marine's biggest change was to try to substitute muslims for jews as the 'other', in which she has only been partly successful.  You can believe that the LE Pen minority are all highly principled and the 90% of Parisians who voted against Le Pen were confused and bamboozled, just don't expect a lot of people to share your view.
The mass of the Republican party has been anti-Obamacare for many years and not because of Trump.  The concern about Muslims is actually fairly broadly-based in America.  Except for vocal liberals many see a real concern about fostering immigration of a potentially divisive population within which women are treated as slaves.  Since this screed is so obviously incorrect in targeting Trump for movements that have existed prior even to his campaign, I conclude that this book is written for the personal advantage it has attracted.  I would not be a bit surprised if Flake has presidential ambitions and his book just one step along the path to achieving fulfillment thereof.  Sadly, Brooks twists it for his partisan advantage.
They still aren't discussing his conversion to Islam in 2007 - adopting an Islamic name, his vocalized support of ISIS, or that he told the FBI he was having terroristic thoughts in the main stream media.  This was a terrorist attack on US soil under Obama's watch -- not a simple mental illness issue.  Of course, all jihadis are mentally ill...
"No-go zones"?  Fox News [!] made the following apology in January, 2015:  "A correction now: Over the course of this last week we have made some regrettable errors on air regarding the Muslim population in Europe, particularly with regard to England and France. Now, this applies especially to discussions of so-called ‘no-go zones,’ areas where non-Muslims allegedly aren’t allowed in and police supposedly won’t go.  "To be clear, there is no formal designation of these zones in either country and no credible information to support the assertion there are specific areas in these countries that exclude individuals based solely on their religion. There are certainly areas of high crime in Europe as there are in the United States and other countries — where police and visitors enter with caution.  "We deeply regret the errors and apologize to any and all who may have taken offense, including the people of France and England."
Ms Tesa Ann, so how do you feel about the rash of attacks across the country on Muslim people, gay people, non-white people, female people -- by people who are using Trump's "victory" as an excuse to bring their hate out into the open? I am assuming, of course, that you haven't cloistered yourself and are aware (by accessing non-right wing media) that this is taking place. Do you think that Trump supporters like you are okay with painting swastikas on cars and churches, chanting "build the wall" in a mixed-race middle school cafeteria, yelling at women "we own your pussy now", ripping the hijab off of Muslim womens' heads, screaming at Hispanic people to "get back to your own country" is okay? This is what you have unleashed. Deal with it, honey.
And anyone who does claim that would probably also choose an online name to commemorate a bloody battle to defeat muslims over 1200 years ago.  You know, an impartial legal commentator.
My biggest question in this delicate debate is : what do feminists think of the niqab?  Why are some, who we assume are feminists, defending the right to wear the niqab, a symbol of submission? What do the women, who fought and continue to fight for equality in all aspects of life in Canada, think of this face covering from the Middle Ages? For me, the niqab is the negation of one’s identity. It is like telling people ‘I don’t deserve to show my face. I don’t deserve to exist.’ Practice all the religion you want. But I think Quebec is right to take action. There has been a lot of Quebec bashing on this file, but many other countries are taking action. Heck, even some Muslim countries are banning the niqab.
There are many arenas in which Trump's innate fascism is evident, but one of the more conspicuous is in his relationship with the press.  There is a long tradition of antagonism between the press and the people they are covering.  That's as it should be.  The relationship is necessarily adversarial, at least at times.  However, a line is crossed when a public official uses the power of her or his office to impede the press or to punish reporters. As Trump assumes the presidency, he is clearly hovering at that line.  It will be important to notice when he crosses it. When he does, he will have graduated from "semi-fascist" (if that's what he is now) to the real deal (which I think he already is, in most respects.) I think the Muslim registry is dead in the water, but should that re-emerge, that would be another indicator.
First country to do a modern genocide was Turkey (muslim nation) in 1915 against Christian Armenians. Over 1.5 million murdered. Turkey refuses to admit this terrible crime against humanity.  Just think if modern Germany refused to admit its guilt in the holocaust what would nations do? OldBanister is the first to scream it never happened, Moslems or Turks could never do this crime!
'Thought and word alone' or 'never likely to have offended' no doubt exist.    This attempted murderer is not one of those.  He was an engineering  student at OSU.  " When offered five ways to be a good Muslim—(1) pray five times a day; (2) go to school to learn something that would help the brothers overseas, such as engineering or medicine; (3) raise money for the brothers; (4) become operational; or (5) become a martyr—Mohamud almost immediately picked “become operational.”  Mohamud explained “operational” meant “doing like the other brothers do when they get a car, fill it with explosives, park it near a target location, and detonate the vehicle.”    "Despite being provided numerous opportunities to deviate from or terminate the plan, Mohamud never displayed any reluctance in going through with a horrific attack that would have killed and maimed countless people, including young children.  Indeed, he expressed great enthusiasm in seeing it through."  That is the Court's conclusion.
"I pointed out that two I checked were both American born" - Thomas Dye -  December 2015: Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, a married Pakistani couple, stormed a San Bernardino County government building with combat gear and rifles and opened fire on about 80 employees enjoying an office Christmas party. They killed 14 after pledging loyalty to ISIS. April 2013: Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Muslim brothers from Chechnya, exploded a pair of pressure-cooker bombs at the Boston Marathon, killing three and wounding more than 260. At least 17 people lost limbs from the shrapnel. -
The idea that even all Muslims in Canada support this ill-conceived motion is patently false, never mind the majority of thoughtful Canadians alarmed at this latest assault, even if symbolic, on our freedom of speech. The opposition to M-103 stems from the obscurantist language, tendentious neologism ("Islamophobia"), and special-interest privileging that make up the core of the motion. It is disingenuous to pretend otherwise and downright dangerous to label its opponents as bigots or racists.   The motion is Orwellian. It is at its core an insidious form of thought policing.
One could likely charge Quebec for systematic discrimination against minorties in the forms of Bill 62 and Bill 101 which are both in direct violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, however.  One could also likely make a charge against the overly zealous, xenophobic media who seemed ready and willing to pin Quebec's recent shootings on a Muslim in the first few hours for hate speech and libel.
And did it work for Sweden...all hell is breaking loose over there because of accommodating,  and promoting Muslims.  Once started,  they will not stop!
Riigghttt.......this coming from the party that cannot bring themselves to say the word terrorist, think that these poor little people are just misunderstood and it is society's fault, and that Islamophobia needs to have a bill to stop people from being able to express their thoughts on Islam........sure Freeland we ALL believe you.......roll eyes.......do the Liberals think no one notices what they do?  Seriously?
Do you ask the same question about "white supremacists", "male supremacists", etc? Probably not.   Because the Left has no problem deeming some values as having no acceptable place in our society, and condemns them without a concern for the "deep causes" of the alienation that provokes in some people.  But if people feel alienated because western society doesn't accept islamic values of women's modesty, centering one's life around praying five times a day, etc., it is western society's fault?
Agree. Actually we must be copying Australia's efforts to deny passports to their pedophiles which is a good thing because a lo of this dirty business occurs in poverty-ridden countries like the Philippines and poor SEA countries right across their pond. Muslim countries should deny their passports to radical Islamists. Funny how this recently new law against practicing pedophilia in foreign countries was signed by our own President BJ. Cayetano did not want to sign that Hawaii law for mandatory jail terms for pedophiles for obvious reasons.
I agree with the media, terrorist attacks in the west, except for some well known exceptions, are not caused by Muslim immigrants. They are home grown and caused by the children of Muslim immigrants.
The muslim guy Kahn was a donor to the Clinton Foundation.
Hang on, Trump changed his position during his campaign to ban Muslims from entering the country if they are from countries that have been compromised by terrorism.. saying that he still favors banning all Muslims is inaccurate. Part of the reason for the ban is that the head of the FBI indicated that they cannot properly vet a mass amount of immigrants if we accept a bunch of refugees from foreign countries. ADN, at least be fair and let the poll takers know about the troubles that Germany and Sweden are having from an open border. And if you are reading this, google "Germany refugee rape New Years 2016". That's just the tip of the iceberg.. And keep in mind that the majority of refugees from those countries weren't poor innocent women and children but mostly middle aged men.
First of all, why is there a motion at all when our laws already cover the issue? Why did the MP want to "quell" dissent rather than encourage honest discourse? Why, at the same time, wasn't there a motion to study how to make gender (not a choice) equality more important than religion (choice) when it comes to discrimination? For example, if a Muslim male refuses to be in a class with women based on his religion, then the rights are hers (gender) over his (religion). Our current system says that he has the right to discriminate against others based on his religion and has to be accommodated that is wrong as it is spreading religious based bigotry against women and sending us backwards.  1. The motion is to study a way to quell free speech. It doesn't matter what comes after if we accept this abuse of taxpayer money.   2. For something to get the Supreme Court takes forever and meanwhile the society is damaged - look at how divisive the topic is now.
There is no necessary injustice in registering Muslims, notwithstanding the constitutional issues that arise. Discussing this matter is a quaint past time until the number of dead and injured that a country suffers from terrorism reaches a certain point. Its a matter of the point at which one draws the line. When do you draw the line? When one of your children is murdered and another rape? Look at the horrific problems Europe is now facing. Will you object to registering Muslims at this point. What about the fact that the state has a Moral obligation to protect its people.Apparently you don't give a damn the dangers that white people, and other Americans face.   A democracy sometimes has to use extra-constitutional means to preserve itself. Lincoln suspended Habius Corpus and did many other things that were offensive to our democratic principles. It was justified!
‘Masculinity is toxic. Men don’t have to be.’ I wonder what kind of reception this thought would get in the Muslim world?
Turkey has effectively regressed into a dictatorship under Erdogan and his Islamist AKP. No free press, no free speech, and no gender equality.  Erdogan has catered to like-minded Islamists who hold a contempt for Ataturk's secular protections. Secular liberal Turks risk professional ruin or jail if they speak out against Erdogan as he has already bullied and imprisoned his opposition into submission and tomorrow's vote is just a rubber stamp. The Globe doesn't like to talk about the religious aspect of Erdogan's power consolidation but there is a reason why Ataturk established strict rules of secularism at the founding of modern Turkey - because Islamists never stop until they have absolute control over all levels of the State. It's not that complicated - Erdogan is an unapologetic Islamist and Turkey's regression over the last 8 years is simply the natural course of political Islam - it is fundamentally incompatible with free speech, freedom of association, and gender equality.
MULCAIR was toast the second he was FOR veiled faces. Nearly nobody in Quebec wants hidden faces. This is CANADA and we live with OPEN faces. ALL immigrants except muslims honor our way. This law is only the beginning, all over the country taxpayers are sick and tired to BOW to closed faces.
François Jourdan, French islamologue et théologien eudiste; “...Islam is very frozen for many centuries and basically lack of freedom - today, it must be said clearly that we cannot build a society of one religion, Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist... or atheist.  This phase of human history is now overtaken by religious freedom and human rights. Secularism requires not the ban but the discretion of all religions in the public space as other citizens have the right to have another way of life. This isn't the Koranic trend where Islam does not consider itself  as other religions and must...DOMINATE !...”
‘Do Sunni and Shia Muslims pray together in the Muslim prayer rooms in our Ontario public schools?’ I often wondered that myself. Doesn’t one sect call the other heretics?
Will prime minister selfie condemn this latest mass murder of Christians. I bet we won't hear a peep out of him. Also, will the Muslim writers featured so frequently in the G&M condemn this hateful act. They are always implying that Canadians are so intolerant. They need to be just as vocal about denouncing their own intolerance.
The Hand Maids Tale  A story written by a liberal about a fictional Christian America that doesn't exist, but describes real life in Islamic countries.
Wait...I thought the president was anti-Muslim?  Why is he there? Say it isn't so.  Please don't tell me that the alt-left media got it wrong...again?
Maybe the Globe could support one of the more aggressive Arab countries, actually I can not think of any others. The rest are either in the Sunni bucket with Saudi or the Shia bucket with Iran. Some are split like Jordon which used to be 80% Christian, no more.. Sure Qatar shuns Shia, shuns immigration, makes a home for terrorist as long as they do not act out, exploits slave labor from everywhere, but they do seem to be trying to make the Arab citizens take some responsibility. Really who funded the ISIS of course it is Saudi Araba and friends, even Qatar. Qatar is not a big oil producer, they are the number one exporter of natural gas at 5 times the amount we get for the natural gas we ship to the US. Canada is the number two exporter of Natural Gas in the world, but our market is locked up in the US, so they get it for basically nothing. To me this is a crack in Saudi control and must be amplified.
>>Duke Charles Martel >>Are you a muslim Alceste? ... To that question, Alceste has a canned answer - "Are you a White Supremacist?".. or "At least I am not a White Supremacist?" Either way - it is pretty telling how he feels about himself. And what does he equates being Muslim with. .
It's just business, not personal. Out of all the Muslim majority countries that he could have banned entry to, the ones he chose not only did not participate in 911 but also have no Trump holdings. That not only looks like he's keeping his campaign promises but is also good for the Trump brand. A double win.
Clear Thinker,  Canadian values include freedom of religion and the duty to accommodate it where its reasonable and no great hardship to do so.  That's not only a Canadian value, it's our Constitution.  So many anti-muslim posters here would rather adopt the tolerance levels of Saudi Arabia.  A harsh thing to say, perhaps, but true.  Making this simple accommodation keeps muslim students in the public school system - probably the best place to introduce new Canadians to Canadian values.  By the way, I appreciate your humour in writing "IF Conservatives came out for Gay marriage..."
Germany gave refuge to tens of thousands of Muslims from Syria. German Liberals and progressives supposed that this would "inoculate" them from extremist actions. It didn't.
Since I don't believe in any singular or plural existant god(s),  it's "god" for me, never "God" (unless I'm quoting).  Your blinkered viewpoint doesn't allow for that perfectly logical position, obviously.  They( for your edification) are the twin strains of Islam( there are sub-strains of course) unleashed on a "holy" war primarily due to the West's ill-concieved forced removal of generally secular dictators.  I can connect the dot's just fine, your the one still in need of a primer on how to do so.  Maybe you should stick to golf then, personally I found it extremely frustrating and not conducive to a living a good life( my own). Golf is all about touch(the short game, chipping and putting), a focus on 'killing the ball' is for duffers. Unless of course you have "divine" assistance which in that case it doesn't matter, stand on your head if you like.
It seems that all bombers are sane whether they are moslems and whether they are white Americans .  Its' just what we do to one another, retaliate sanefully.
Are you saying that because thousands of Muslim women get an education we should ignore the hundreds of thousands that are denied one.
it is impossible to overstate the risk of radical islam terrorism...and people wonder why there is a backlash to the denials of the left???
"Of course the vast majority of Muslims aren't terrorists!" Okay.  But the voices of those that aren't haven't been too loud in proclaiming this, have they?  Why not? Especially as they are a "vast majority"?  This is a FREE country.  But then, many are fairly recent arrivals from countries in which you did NOT express your opinions about anything more than the weather, so maybe they just...can't...quite...believe you can do so without serious repercussions.  Old habits; hard to break. Maybe there's something ELSE at work, too.   When most of your social and biz interactions are with fellow Muslims, hey, who's gonna rock THAT boat?  This is nothing new.  I'm sure there were many, many "moderate" Germans who chose to remain mute in 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939...
Where does the Lord's prayer mention Christianity?  Don't Muslim's, Jews, and Christians actually share the one and same supreme being?
This is all a mere coincidence or what.  After a luxurious vacation with a rich Islamic prince, Trudeau decides no to attend Trumps inauguration, instead he'll visit certain Tymmys  along some areas. I wonder if some of the Timmy's   are owned by a certain Islamic prince or his relatives, wouldn't that be another awesome coincidence , all the staged emotion, from the heart out, selfies.  Interesting.
Simpering virtue signalling vomit.  Have you ever lived near a cemetery or a church, mosque or synagogue?  They don't make for great neighbours.  I would vote no in a referendum too.  And I would want to lever municipal bylaws to prevent them, just as I would for a strip club or a nightclub.  Our media and politicians are falling all over themselves to make this issue an "anti Muslim" one.  What utter nonsense.  They should be ashamed of themselves.  And the sponsors of the cemetery should look for another location.   They might follow the example of the Jewish community in Toronto - look for open fields with good roads and no near neighbours.
An alt-left nutbar shoots at Republican senators, there are a few stories and it is quickly forgotten. An alt-right nutbar drives a truck at some Muslims and the story goes on and on for days with thousands of articles and the vilification of conservatives endlessly and ghasp,   oh my god, he was white!
So how does this "hate speech" thing work?  If we look at the news headlines, 95 percent of the terrorist attacks are in the Middle East, and it's one group of Muslims blowing up another group of Muslims.  So should we expect that 95 percent of the "hate speeches" are from one group of Muslims speaking against another group of Muslims?
You base you comments on the assumption, that a) fear exists and b) it's irrational. I agree with "a", I disagree with "b". Your remarks suggest an ignorance of Islamic culture. You have a lot of catching up to do. Numerous books to read, videos to watch. 100's of hours to catch up to the rest of us. You can start by reading; The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam, God is Not Great, Delectable Lie and Because they Hate. Let me know when you've finished those, and I'll give you the rest of your homework.
How about the hundreds of Hindu Nationalists who are regular Gabbard donors, some of whom have contributed tens of thousands? Could these donations be the reason she spends so much energy supporting those in conflict with Muslims, and so little dedicated effort on the issues her constituents are concerned about?
"leftist deference to Muslims ...exaggerated tolerance" You obviously being triggered by any discussion of Muslims? Exaggerated INtolerance.
Muslim Americans killed in combat include Staff Sergrant Daniel Isshak; Specialist Omead H. Razani; Captain Humayun Saqib Muazzam Khan; Marine Staff Sergeant Kendall Damon Waters-Bey; 1st Lieutenant Mohsin A. Naqvi; bottom row, left to right: Major James M. Ahearn; Specialist Kareem R.

Remember Bush was in office for 2 weeks!!! prior to 9/11.  The CIA stated they had unequivocal evidence of weapons of mass destruction, not Bush!! Yes Obuma pulled  the troops to appease ideology, even with top advisers stating it would lead to a complete  collapse.  Now we have hundreds of thousand dead Muslims,  a completely destabilized Middle East that will take  generations to fix.  Trump,is simpler the outcome of  Failed Presidency of the last 2 terms., let's see what Justin's administration creates, O'Leary???
Nowhere in the world do Muslims live peacefully with others. When their population rises to over 10-15% they will terrorize the other groups in their midst. Where do they live alongside others in peace on earth?
While Muslims excoriate us about supposed Islamophobia, we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, Judeophobia and antisemitism, , Christophbia, Europhobia, Americanophobia, democraceaophobia,  iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal  wars of extermination between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects are the cause of all the civil war ad genocide going on across the Muslim world. Its worse than anything expressed in the west, even by Trump
I agree with this author completely. In the great battle for equal treatment under the law patience will only get you so far. Eventually you realize that power never relinquishes control of its own accord, it must always be challenged, resisted, and opposed.  On the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration we're being told that his victory was the result of white people who had decided that enough is enough when it came to their economic distress, caused by policies enacted by people they supported (something they now willfully ignore) but blamed on immigrants, people of color, Muslims, and various other "others."   And now on MLK Day we're supposed to buy into the myth that their economic distress is in any way comparable to the kind of oppression endured for generations by black people living in the south, first as slaves and later as second-class citizens with no voting rights or any other rights.   As a white male, I don't think so. Delusion is not countered with patience.
Re the letter:  1)  It's not a ban, it's a 4 month hiatus for 7 nations that are hotbeds of radical Islam (ie, terrorism).  2)  A huge percentage of Muslims believe in things that Christians don't believe in.  Things like how it's perfectly fine to kill anyone who leaves Islam, or who is homosexual.  And of course immoral women too; sometimes they are burned to death, or stoned to death.  This isn't just true in nations like Egypt, it's true for European Muslims as well.     In other words, there are demonstrably clear reasons that there be a  * preference * for Christian refugees over Muslim's from radicalized nations.
The U.S. has been providing "aid" to "rebel" groups in Syria since at least 2011.  Since at least 2014, the American military has been involved in strikes on Islamic "terrorists".  Though jus a few weeks ago, the U.S. led coalition "accidentally" bombed a Syrian government military base, killing and wounding many of the government soldiers who had been fighting the terrorists.  That story was in the Globe and Mail.
Ah! A hamhanded pivot to suggest I'm "afraid" of improving screening of potential terrorists. It is you Trump supporters who are afraid of the jihadists hiding under your beds.  Of course no one objects to an innocuous-sounding "review of the process," as if the 9th circuit is "afraid" of "Availability Management 101." The Muslim ban was blocked because it was a thinly-veiled maneuver to discriminate based on religion. It may have been unconstitutional. It appears to have had more to do with domestic politics than "safety." Therefore, after blustering for the cameras, Trump caved.  I'm not playing this game. Good-bye.
Cant figure out who is the bigger genius Trump or Justin ? Trump does not want Muslims with little connection to  radical Islamic terrorism while Justin wants more refugees when the economy is borderline depression with a ballooning deficit ?
You've already forgotten WWI and WWII and all the other nastiness of the 20th century. Why?  The fundamentalist versions of both Islam and Christianity are incompatible with an ideology of individual rights and representative government.
All Christians, Jews and other religious denominations are angered and will retaliate every time another Muslim demand is made and honoured. This is beyond ridiculous that Muslims are allowed to force their religion down our throats. This is a very serious situation and there will be more violent attacks when our government refuses to curb this activity. Muslims can take time from their days at school to pray, yet our Lord's prayer has been dismissed as being controversial. Yes, this is going to get very ugly and could easily turn into civil war. That comment is not outrageous. Muslims have come from that very climate and they didn't leave that on the shores behind them. This is just the beginning of a rally.
I've seen no rational reason to oppose this accommodation   Yes you do. Keep religion out of school and have the kids pray at their mosques .  It is not hatred to expect our secular standards to be understood by all.
It wasn't Irish Catholics. that flew planes into the WTC or keep shooting up nightclub, malls and US army personnel  When are the moderate muslim leaders going to start denouncing the terrorist acts in a loud and clear united voice?
"And when the IRA committed terrorism in the UK, something was terribly wrong with their belief system too, correct? When the ETA committed terrorism in Spain, something was wrong with their belief system too, correct?"  You bet. And the societies around them recognized the evil and condemned it. Maybe that's why these instances of violence ended. But I get the impression, from Pew Research and other public opinion polls, a significant segment of the Muslim community condones, or at least doesn't condemn this kind of violence. Maybe that's why we see so much Muslim violence, compared to other groups.
The low rate in UK is attracting radicalized Muslims by the droves.
What most people fail to mention is what happen to the liberty and democracy when a group of people become the majority. In time, the Muslims may become the majority in the US and they may ask for referendum to kill the democracy and liberty principles -- if history is correct, they will ask. Using liberty and democracy to kill liberty and democracy... Think about that. What principle would you use to argue against it.
Hey, this is like Amy D blubbering about the Muslim Compound, no proof.I did get a laugh out of MSNBC blabbing about Fox News had a Christmas Party(can I say Christmas here?) at a Trump Hotel then found out they didn't even have it yet and it was at a different venue. Ah the news, can we really trust any of it?
More cultural enrichment brought to the West by Islam.
Au contraire.  Although all muslims are not responsible for ISIS inspired attacks by lone wolves, all Quebecers are responsible for attacks on muslims by a lone wolf.  Because it'a 2017. In Canada. Under a Liberal government.
Fifth column indeed..has it never occurred to the supports of Islam , their right to protect and preserve their culture in the midst of someone else's culture may be seen as a diminution of the host culture? Why pretend that Islam was ever part of Western culture? Why should the Dutch or Germans or anyone else have to pretend to support or subscribe to a culture that they do not like or are not comfortable with?
No, it is not.  What is offensive is calling it something it is not....  It is a temporary ban on ALL coming from 7 particular countries.  If it were a ban on Muslims, don't you think it would include all countries where Muslims could travel from?    Did you call it a Muslim ban when exPOTUS Obama did it in 2011?  From PolitiFact.... "The order does not specifically bar Muslims. It applies only to citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. Those seven countries have only 12 percent of the world’s Muslims and Muslims from other countries can still enter the United States."  I will grant you Mr. Trump's campaign rhetoric was problematic in this area - but I think even he realized he could not issue a ban on Muslims.  This is what he came up with - but, it does not specifically bar Muslims and it is temporary.  What he accomplished was giving fodder to his detractors....
The Bible, the Koran, and any other religious texts "matter" to me only in their impact on the way followers treat others, the creatures of the earth and the earth itself.  If those texts promote decent, respectful, compassionate actions....great.  If they promote intolerance and condemnation of "others",......no so great.  Much good has been done in the name of those texts.  Unfortunately, much evil has been done as well.  Fundamentalist radical Muslims condemn Christianity.  Fundamentalist radical Christians condemn Islam.  That's working out real well, isn't it.    Gary Crum
There's something fishy about their story.  Why would anyone want to backpack in such an inhospitable area, particularly with a pregnant spouse?  It boggles the mind.  As for their captivity, how could they have conceived so many children?  It doesn't make any sense.  As for their appearance now, I would surmise that they are Islamic converts.  What's with the hijab?  That makes me wonder about them and their motives.  Perhaps we should examine their stories more closely.
Please find out the statistcs from the police data across the country. To give you some information. The hate crimes committed in Canada target the following;  Highest hate crimes committed are against jews which is 29%  and lower close to he bottom you have 11% hate crimes committed against muslims. As you can see, the real victims are the jews.
I was wondering why this BS story was happening so I did a little looking around and wala -  It seems Mr. Kahn (not his wife since she's a woman) is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. He's an attorney with a law firm in NYC that specializes in immigration, and there is evidence of links between this man and the Clintons. Wow, no wonder all the major liberal TV station are pounding this attack story for Killary Rotten Clinton. If the ADN was an actual newspaper they could have found out these little tid bits, but why would they, they'll just a liberal newsletter for the Democrats.
But I don't recall FDR ever saying "the U.S. is at war with the German people."  We were at war with the Nazi regime.  Likewise, we are at war with radical Islam (ISIS, among other groups) which is quite different from a war on all Muslims.  The ISIS propaganda quote is simply ISIS using peaceful Muslims as a human shield, and trying to characterize our attempts to ferret out ISIS threats as an attack on all Muslims.
If I cared about getting religion out of school, I'd start with the Catholic School Board, not a prayer club. To me, this is where the "keep religion out of school" argument falls down. I don't see anyone showing up at Catholic School Board meetings to tear up bibles and scream insults.  This isn't about religious accommodation. This is about Islam.
Nope, just another good old American domestic dispute with a firearm.  But thank God this wasn't radical Islamic terrorism! I'm sure the victims families are totally relieved...
It is unfortunate that this couple had to be subjected to this harassment by someone who obviously swims in the shallow end of the gene pool. Sadly , their experience can be considered collateral damage in this war of ideas and minds. The internet and global media has now arrived at a time and place where we are now constantly being bombarded with news, fake news, opinions , theories, conspiracies , etc on a 24 hour basis. Many people lack any form of critical analysis and are quite willing to cleave to any position as long as it fits their mindset.  I have a Muslim friend who was born and raised here but his family have strong ties to the homeland. When we discuss the ideological based violence he typically comments " Those people are f**kin' crazy ".  However for him and these two unfortunate people who were publicly abused the problem is connected to them , even in a ethereal way and it is the Muslims of the world who have to find a solution .
You always claim that terrorists killing in the name of Allah don't represent Islam, yet you claim a couple of people making anonymous threats prove white Canadians  are bigots. Work on your logic...
You’re not wrong. People are finally waking up to the fact that Islam and Western traditions are largely incompatible.
Islam is not a race.  The act of one crazy person does not reflect on a greater community mindset.  Is that not the often repeated claim by Muslim moderates?  Is it not hateful to demand every other person on the planet censor their opinions on religious authoritarianism?  Islam means "submission".  No free person wishes this upon themselves or others.  We don't have to worry about the Amish for a reason.  Specific beliefs leads to specific behaviours.   It is perfectly reasonable to fear a belief system (and those who demand respect for it) that supports the killing of myself for thought crimes.  How has it come to pass that expressing yourself freely and honestly about a clear, present and stated threat to liberal democracy and humanist values has become a synonym for racial hatred?  Criticism and satire are the bedrock of a free society.  Islam does not understand or respect freedom of expression and the right to challenge and openly mock self declared authority.
[some lawyers in her department were told not to inform her about President Donald Trump’s original executive order barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries until it already had been implemented.] Source?
Kap's protest is based on a false premise and anti-American views if his Muslim girlfriend.
Let's call it mass murder by a fanatic.  Be it in the name of politics or religion, or a mix of both.  Not all terrorism is carried out by Muslims, but this crime happens to have been the result of a horrific act by a Muslim.  The Swedish police is pretty sure at this time that they have the right man; a Muslim asylum seeker from Uzbekistan with FB postings advertising sympathy with several fanatic Muslim groups.  Like ISIS.  So let's call a spade a spade.
Nothing bizarre about my comments there true you can see our country being taking over by riff raff ACLU, BLM, and other Muslim organizations like CAIR and the rest of this country haters so no my comments speak of truth the are never bizarre.
ISIS beheading Christians because they refuse forced conversion to Sunni Islam is persecution. Canadian Catholics being told that euthanasia is legal or that Trudeau is pro-choice is not.
If the shoe fits bigfire. Look at their policies right now ... support of neo nazi and racism, support of pollution, muslim bans,  rolls back laws protecting customer data from ISP's, allows bear and wolf hunting from helicopters, struck down a law requiring employers to disclose labor law violations, including wage theft, unsafe working conditions and hiring discrimination, has repeatedly tried to cut off millions from medical coverage to promote a tax cut for the rich ..... ya I'd say there is ample evidence of no moral compass SMALFIRE. And that's only a small sample the he and his rabid narcissistic fan base supports.  That sweeping generalization is so full supported by facts ... it's to bad you are blind.

No matter what the globe thinks or pretends to believe,  violence against muslims is pretty recent and may perhaps be related by the never ending stream of horrible atrocities worldwide perpetuated by a certain group.  Perhaps it would be safer all around ,  for them and for us,  if they were not amongst us.
UK, recently after all the Murders committed by Muslims, most Brits have Illegally Armed themselves, British Organized Crime likes the increased business profits, "the Chunnel" made smuggling easier.   Like during "the Troubles" the British SAS have been Authorized to Operate within the UK.  The British Military now has many "panel trucks" at British Cities with full on Armed British Military Royal Marines, SAS Teams, that are on call by the Unarmed British Police (there are less and less Unarmed British Police).  At France, after the Murders by Muslims of Unarmed French Military, and Muslim Terrorist Attacks against French Civilians many French Civilians Illegally obtained Firearms during their Vacations outside of France.   Many French Caucasian Women fearing being abducted and forced into the Muslim Sex Slave Trade have armed themselves Illegally.  Ignorant Fanatic Democrat Anti Gun Nuts, cause of Gun Violence at U.S. is Democrats, Democrat F__ked up the U.S. Economy. continued
The main Crisis in this country are the people who read Crisis.  There are various types of Jihad and Sharia.  It is the Wahhabi version that is dangerous - the most fundamentalist version of Islam.  Call them the Alt-Right of Islam.  May Fr. Z have a kharmaic experience regarding what he prays for.  Soon.  He is daring Francis to slap him down.  Fr. Z is not that important.  Still, I wonder if he prays for the pontiff when he says Mass.  If not, perhaps he might like joining the laity.  The question of undocumented workers is the GOP fighting with itself.  While some of its industrial wing want reform to make things all legal, others use the illegality to keep workers in the shadows in bad conditions and pay.  The tie is using broken by alt-right nativists.  If they really wanted undocumented workers out, they would repeal right to work and all immigration restrictions.  No factory owner is going to hire a foreign union worker over a domestic one.
"Part of the reason for at least one of those judicial decisions was the implicit religious discrimination against Muslims implied in Trump's order."  That's what the lunatics on the left would have us believe, but if the 90 day ban - that's right, it's just a 90 day ban designed to revue our current vetting procedures and strengthen them because there is a lot of doubt surrounding the effectiveness of the current vetting process - is a ban on Muslims due to religious discrimination, then why does it only affect travel from just 6 majority Muslim nations?  "Whatever happened to give me your tired, your poor?"  9/11 happened, THAT'S what.  And a slew of terrorist attacks by the hands of Islamic terrorists around the world since then. The United States, when taking in all those tired and poor, never meant to have millions of immigrants placed on welfare either.  The plan was to give the freedom and jobs to make them productive citizens which would benefit them and the nation as a whole.
There is also a roving muslim patrol.
technically the bar was not against Jews since Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists would have also been prevented from taking the oath   but somehow this particular argument   has been conflated to  a bar just against Jews   as Canadians we were all required  to say the Lord's prayer in public school  right until the 80s (85 to be exact)  people could choose not to participate if they so wished  so this whole "equivalent to" argument gets you nowhere since opting out is always an option  the real issue is whether a person who graduates from this school can uphold the law without recrimination or prejudice  assuming they have passed the bar ..... a lawyer is a lawyer a lawyer  whether they are christian, muslim, jewish or atheist
I disagree that "fundamentalism" and "non-fundamentalism" are the right ways to separate this. (Disclosure: I am strong United Church - once a "mainline" denomination!). Jim Wallis and the Sojourners are fundamentalist in their Christian path, I believe, and any justice-seeking Christian would be pleased to have the Sojourners on their side. And there are mainline Christians of all denominational ties who would be Franklin Graham fans.  Fundamentalism is a specific late 19th Century movement in response to mainline indifference. I believe it is better to differentiate along the lines of violence. Two or three decades ago someone wrote that the most rapidly growing spirituality was "belief in the redeeming power of violence," or words to that effect. Franklin Graham really does seem to fall into that category, and so do many other Christians, some Muslims and some Jews. And it is belief in violence that some people desire to see cross into the state (or vice versa).
Worked out a deal w/the Gov. to visit a Muslim country while one of them stays in my place.  LOL
sky  I think that is too far a generalization to say that all western males are more feminist than Muslim males. Remember, more Muslim countries have elected female leaders than the USA or Canada. As for education, Iranian women form over 50 percent of the university population. They are a lot more likely to go into the STEM programs as compared to women from conservative states (how many female Alabaman engineers do you think there are? As compared to Pakistani female engineers).  The immodest clothing is a equally complicated issue. There have been plenty of people here who think immodest clothes invite rape. Let's take it one step further. How many Muslim Presidents have groped women, versus American Presidents?  As for face covering, there were 2 women out of 680,000 that used it. Was it really an election issue? Does it really affect a majority of 35,000,000 Canadian citizens?
You're confused.  Ever heard of the 2nd Amendment?  The Constitution says nothing about limiting the right to carry a firearm only to adults, law abiding, 'mentally competent' people.  It means ALL people.    The NRA is right.  Our world would be far safer if EVERYONE, including my grandpa with Alzheimers, was issued a firearm.  And "gun-free" zones just lays out the welcome mat for active shooters.  Schools, for instance, would be a lot less appealing to radical Islamic terrorists if every student was carrying a .38.    If we start limiting anybody's right to gun ownership, we're one step away from Nazi Germany.
_"“The sad fact is that American voters this November will probably be forced to choose between a Republican nominee who thinks the United States should ban Muslims from entering the country versus a Democratic nominee who thinks the United States has a right to invade Muslim countries"_ -- "Pick Your Poison: Clinton Vs.

They interviewed a bunch of Sunni Muslim who, of course, will condone any action against any other sect, being Muslim or Christian. One day, after they attend local mosques, these people will be driving trucks on our sidewalks. Great refugee policy.
There has been a lot of air-time offered by this administration lately on the topic of "religious freedom" and how this President will be its champion.  It seems to me, that in this country when conservatives speak of religious freedom they are often referring to Christian freedoms.  In this article, the scope narrows even more specifically (as befits a Catholic publication) to Catholic freedom to practice one's faith. I look forward to these stalwart defenders of religious freedom "going to the mat" for American Muslims when discriminated against for practicing their faith, or practitioners of Voudon, Candomble, or adherents to earth based worship traditions when they are attacked for being less than mainstream.
Also may I ask why is it you felt that the TCSB is the be all to end all? School boards each have their own requirements & much of that is based on the size of the school, enrolment & location. I think you need to do alot more reading. As an added bonus if you can answer this question, my children's school has Muslims attending as do many other Catholic schools. How can that be? It is disheartening Allan that you are so very ready to fight Catholics and indirectly, Christians for exercising their religious rights and yet you come out in full fight mode to defend Muslims. Christian churches welcome anyone into their places of worship without oppressive dress code and without segregation. Can you say the same for Muslims? As a final thought, you continue to bring in the time off for Christmas, Easter etc. If you are so offended by it then I guess it's safe to say you'll be first in line to pay back any time & half for working it or not taking it off at all right? Have a great day.
The picture of those rioting repubs , are stored away with  pictures of thousands of muslims in New Jersey cheering the falling of  the WTC
ISIS is Hussein Obama's baby, and Clinton. Don't you remember the first thing he did was pull US troops out of Iraq after we stabilized the region? Then he continued to promote radical islam all over the globe, including the muslim invasion of Europe and America. Of course it's true they have been converting by the sword for 1,400 years.
Dead thread when everyone knows it was a Muslim. Nothing to white-bash or Christian-bash about, nothing to worldwide-white-supremacy conspiracy theory about. Nothing to "white cis male privilege" about. Nothing to "NRA" about.  Just... Crickets.
Then why does he say he was "right all along"?  You've offered no explanation for the fact (you can watch him talk at the link I provided) that when asked if he had changed his position, he did not say he had changed his mind, or that he had pivoted, or that his promise had expired, or that he was changing his promise.  No, he said he was "right all along" and that the questioner already knew his position.  I understand you want to believe the opposite of what Trump said.  So be it.  I'll be happy if you are right -- I don't want a president who tries to divide us by religion, and the sooner Trump disavows his campaign promise, the better.  Perhaps he'll follow your lead and tell the American people that his promise of a Muslim ban has expired.  Wouldn't that be great!
It'd be nice to see the same expectation that people have for muslims and islam be applied to christianity. Moderates speak up and keep your extremists from making you look bad. Keep your religion out of our gvmt and institutions that are supposed to represent ALL people EQUALLY regardless of faith or disbelief.
Indeed.  Piercy enabled the abuse of power.  The removal of City Hall is one of her enduring legacies.  At least City Hall is now carbon neutral!  But the idea that Eugene is supposedly a left wing socialist state is as ridiculous as claiming Obama is a secret Muslim from Kenya -- disinformation that distracts from actual critique of the real policies.  Eugene is too busy giving tax breaks to out of state developers to be "socialist," and Obama expanded the NSA's surveillance state on behalf of the military industrial complex.
Well, that Hillary thing is not me. So please, let that go. Trump won. Clinton lost, and that's that.   I don't like the stuff about the 3 million voters because that's been thoroughly debunked by the legal, institutional authorities in both California and New York, and leaders in congress of both parties.    And ironically, regarding my doubts about Trump, I believe what the man says, apparently more than you do. His tirade against a judge born in Indiana, for example, his bragging about grabbing women, and his confusion between Jihadi extremists and 2 billion Muslims. He's the first politician in my memory whose supporters don't believe him, while his detractors do.   I don't question your right to defend the president. I do however insist that doubting him is not treason. Was it treason to doubt Obama?
Even me?  Wow, thank you for that kind sentiment.  Would God falsely reveal to Mohammad that Jesus was not his son, but just a prophet, who was less important than  Mohammad himself?   I kind of doubt that, but I do believe a demon may have communicated  such lies to him.
Donald Trump, ISIS Recruiter-in-Chief.  Within hours of his signing this illegal act (see 1965 Immigration Law banning immigration restrictions based on country of origin, or religion) a mosque in Texas goes up in flames. You think these actions of his are not inciting violence in Muslim majority countries who could have been at least ambivalent? How many more enemies does Trump plan on making for us? Mexico, China, Europe, Middle East? At least Dictator Putin has our back. Impeach Trump. Pence, invoke the 25th amendment. Before this madman does more damage.
No, that is not what it says. The part of the injunction they lifted was for those who had not connection to a US person or entity. It upheld the stay for those who have a connection, like the students in the 9th circuit case. Read it yourself https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-1436_l6hc.pdf The court has not made any ruling about the valid claim that Trump called for a Muslim ban in the campaign and that the EO addressed predominately Muslim countries. If we want to read tea leaves about how the court will rule in October, it looks like it will not allow the EO to impact people with relatives in the states, nor will it allow it to impact students and workers with visas. Which accounts for almost everyone from the 6 restricted countries. In addition, it is also going to rule whether the EO expired from the date it was signed or from the date it was implemented.
Lots of time for everybody to read Nietzsche, Mao, Fidel Castro, Karl Marx, Leon Trotsky, learn Arab languages and the Islam book, and grab degrees in Law, Medicine, Government service, and Wall Street investing. Opportunity for many years of a quiet environment is yours now. Happy readings.
In the United Kingdom, in the most recent year for which we have data (2011), the gun death rate from all causes was 0.23 per 100,000. That works out to about 145 in 2011. The US has approximately 5 times the population of the UK, therefore you could legitimately expect, as a similarly developed country with vaguely similar socio-economic beliefs, the US would have a total number of gun deaths of around 700 to 800. That is if your argument is that the proliferation of guns in the US has little or no impact on the number or gun deaths. There were 33,636 gun deaths in the US in 2014  If you argument is that in the UK they use other weapons knives etc that is not true either the US also has a higher murder rate with all other methods.  If your argument is against Muslim insurgents, in the last 10 years for every 367 gun deaths 1 was attributable to a Muslim, more were attributable to toddlers under 3 years old.  You guys just like guns and the NRA and Co. like your money.
A few years ago Muslims in Ontario schools were caught citing "hate speach" prayers. As a result the school board had 6 pre-approved prayers made up with local Imams. Because of the backlash caused by the Muslim community the school cancelled this and backtracked allowing students to once again use their own prayers. So that and the fact that the school blatently lied by stating “They’ve never heard of an incident of hate being propagated.”is certainly cause for concern. Just because a parent is concerned does not make them a "bigot" or "racist"
That one was new to me!  Thanks!  "Today the dialectic is active in every political issue that encourages taking sides. We can see it in environmentalists instigating conflicts against private property owners, in democrats against republicans, in greens against libertarians, in communists against socialists, in neo-cons against traditional conservatives, in community activists against individuals, in pro-choice versus pro-life, in Christians against Muslims, in isolationists versus interventionists, in peace activists against war hawks."  "No matter what the issue, the invisible dialectic aims to control both the conflict and the resolution of differences, and leads everyone involved into a new cycle of conflicts."  http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/05/dialectic.htm
this is a symptom of intolerance, not just some silly municipal 'right'.  The Muslim community has the right to have a cemetery to bury their deceased just like Jews, Christians do. Denying this right is undemocratic, unCanadian and wrong. Simple.
If Trump had a brain he'd be dangerous...but he can't shut his mouth and keeps shooting himself in the foot. "One would think that because courts keep blocking the executive orders precisely because the Trump administration keeps admitting that the orders are Muslim bans that perhaps Trump would stop admitting that. But as he demonstrated at a campaign rally in Nashville on Wednesday night, he has no such intention. Dismissing the revised executive order as a “watered-down version,” Trump said, “I think we should go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first place.” Trump should be prepared for that comment to show up in another court decision as these challenges make their way through the courts."  "As Trump boasts about his Muslim ban, the courts use his own words against him"  https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/03/16/as-trump-boasts-about-his-muslim-ban-the-courts-use-his-own-words-against-him/
Probably because he's actually read the motion and knows that it's not exclusively about Islam. And that he has met many moderate Muslims who are able to make their own decisions about their religion just as Christians and Jews have done for centuries.
ISIS is known to attack Muslims too, so who knows what this was.
A Muslim, a machete, and a car walk into a crowded area...  ...stop me if you've heard this one already.
Nothing to see here and nothing to do with religion. This is simply a case of "cultural relativism" and the solution to women being treated like property under the guise of piety is more dialogue and mutual respect - #it's2017. After all, every country in the world governed by Islamic law is highlighted by gender equality, unfettered freedom of expression, and individual liberty - any criticism of political Islam (or the idea that society should be governed by Islamic law) is simply a reflection of "Islamaphobia".  The definition of human rights at the UN is too "western" and doesn't take into account cultural differences of countries who prefer to live in the 7th century.
Certainly no Islamophobia at the Globe.  In fact, no criticism of Islam allowed at all.   Tremendous progress.
This of course is the first steps of Trump's holy war. He said he will wage it during campaign, and now he just started America Holy War on Islam II.   America Holy War on Islam I was waged by GW Bush. But he used a somewhat more 'robust' method - full scale military invasion of Iraq complete with Shock & Awe missile strikes. Today, after about 5 million deaths, Iraq is an American vassal state, just like those NATO puppets.   But Trump admirers should not worry about his order lack of colors. Count on Trump to ramp it up. He will certainly outdo GW Shock & Awe when he launches invasion of Iran. Count on Iran to prepare for this day with 100% urgency.   If the conquest of Iran works out, the next target is China. Trump invasion of China will be most, shall we say, interesting?
From the Openings Gallery website:  "This exhibit will occupy the entire south side of the church, placing the Islamic work side by side with the permanent Christian frescoes and statuary, creating extraordinary visual and ideological dialogs between the two traditions’ expressions of faith." Ouch.
There is a very offensive anti-Muslim ad on this page.  It talks about giving "child marriage" the finger?  I've reported this Islamophobic ad to the editors.  We must be tolerant of child marriage, genital mutilation, subjugation of women and anti-gay attitudes.  These fundamental tenants of Islam must be tolerated in a tolerant Canada.   Yes?  I fear the M-103 police will not tolerate my opinion.
Unfortunately, most of the Islamic "immigrants" are not looking to integrate
In Australia, a Muslim woman in a burqa was caught speeding and refused to reveal her face to the police officer arresting her. When the court hearing was held, she then claimed they couldn't convict her   because the police had no photographic proof it  was her under the burqa.
Really? What nation is being flooded by Muslim terrorists? None in Europe. All of the terrorist attacks in Europe have been by locally raised, just like here.
Agnostics and secularist in Canada should fear the religious right wing, the Christians, the post-Christians, the Jews, the Muslims and post-varieties. They were all raises as such religious people, they have no spirituality, no teacher. They just think they are pious because they own a book. Their teachers Mohamed, Jesus, Moses all dies 2000+ years ago. They have big ego's these followers, pragmatic and narcissistic.   We should all fear the next zealot, the next witch hunt, the next victim less crime laws (against free speech like gender pronouns) the next Drug War, the next War against Sin, War against men. We are not safe as long as "God" is in our Charter of Rights, as long as our tax dollars are used for their religions; as long as we have government schools that teach dogma as fact.
re "there is no seat for hate here"  I hope that our Muslim friend takes this message to her fellow Muslims around the world - no one needs to hear it more.
In all honesty - I see little if any  "Anti-Muslim hatred" - I see somewhat rational  fear - but little to none  "Anti-Muslim hatred"
That was just for 420. What I don't understand is why someone - like 420 - will point at the perps and say "Black!" or "Muslim!" without looking further and recognizing that there is in fact another commonality. They are, but for a rare anomaly, men. Why is that so difficult to acknowledge? Most mass murderers are men. Mostly white men. Just a little more information....  And yes, I am jaded, but I'm an equal opportunity disdainer....
For the purpose of clarification, is this article an example of Islamophobia condemned by M-103?
CBC profits down 62%, we can only hope the same will be applied to the G&M.  The anti white, anti Christian, pro sharia, and certainly anti women media outlet that spends more time on bashing Trump than the issues here at home!  Trump has done more in over a month than Obomber did in eight years.  Obomber left his hometown of Chicago as a crime infested wasteland, 4000+ shot, 800 killed.  Doubled the debt and managed to drop more bombs on the ME than GW, causing massive civil unrest and causing an muslim refugee crisis all because he was trying to help the Saudis build a pipeline while being ISIS airforce.  Great job Barry!
In Islamic terms any male that reaches puberty shall be considered a man.........and Harper had nothing to do with this so you can stop with the blame game when you know nothing about history and what went on.....started with the Liberals....ended with the Liberals.....try some research.
Hmmmm, gee I wonder why Saudi Arabia hasn't been blacklisted yet. Isn't that where most of the 9/11 hijackers came from? Or Pakistan, the provenance of some of the recent terrorist attacks? Or Kyrgyzstan?  This so called "Muslim ban" seems like nothing more than a temporary embargo on countries already blacklisted for trade with the US, an act designed to please some of his voters who are hell-bent on seeing a real ban put in place.  The logic bouncing in the White House must have rung like this: "Let's put a 4 month ban on unstable countries we're not doing trade with. This'll please those who voted for us. Then we can get down to real business."
Shakespeare said it best."Doth protest too much"  Anyone hear any Muslim protest the treatment and violence inflicted on Christians and other minorities in Islamic countries? Diversity is good, but radical diversity is destructive.
"Iqra Khalid is a case in point."  OMG! Are Muslims sending Iqra Khalid threats? OMG!!!  LOL
Back when Trump wasn't in charge he challenged Obama to refer to various acts as "Islamic terrorism".  So, now that he's dealing with "Islamic terrorism", apparently we're not to refer to the travel ban as an "Islamic or Muslim ban".  It's just a ban on countries that represent a danger to the USA.
"A Ban on Muslim cemeteries....."  So, where is "the ban"..... Is there a new law I haven't seen.....  Oh I see. A simple zoning bylaw issue turns into a "ban".....  Ha !  Well in that case I'm quite sure many things have been "banned" - not only in Quebec but around the world.....
"Not by agreeing with it (that Islam and democracy are incompatible ,,,)".  It is imperative to call a spade a spade.    Islam besides being a  religion, it provides an operation conduct for its adherents, like Sharia law.  May be there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  That's why it is built into almost all Muslim countries for its societal operation. Islamic system will work if the majority of the population is of that affiliation. China has another form.   However, it is in diametrically opposite to be in concordance with western societies and hence the constant conflict. British born children of the  Pakistani immigrants, who were brought in by the then departing British in the 1960s to work in the mills and mines,  cannot comprehend the dichotomy  of their teachings and what is at large outside --with freedom to think or even dress. No opportunity to integrate in that society unless they have unwittingly come out of the closed society.   Very complex circumstance.
I fondly remember a thank you luncheon I sponsored for a design team that I led as we completed a major module on an oilsands project.  One of the excellent lead designers was a fine young married Muslim lady. Who just happened to show up at the luncheon with her brother in law (who none of us had ever seen before )as a chaperone, I guess in case any infidels made a move on her. He ate his share, never said a word, and kept a close eye on the proceedings and the men.  That was over 5 years ago mind you. I am sure they've become much more tolerant in that time.
Baloney!  He is merely throwing red meat to his anti-Muslim followers.
No, Catholics or any denomination of Protestants or any Jew for that matter will be allowed to express any opinions on this highly secular newspaper's pages!  This is purely the privilege of the one officially approved religion by the G&M, namely Islam!
I think it's pretty clear what has happened. Quebec has long tolerated muslim extremists and as long as they stayed away from the US nothing was done.. The Americans watched but said nothing. There's a new sheriff in DC and he isn't going to tolerate Quebec or Canada being a conduit or launch pad for them. I'm pretty sure both Couillard and our glorious leader were read the riot act by the US after the the Flint attack. If it happens again expect the border to be made difficult for Canadians and Canadian products, and that would hit Quebec hard. Canada is playing a dangerous game if it thinks the US is going to sit back and do nothing. And Couillard is simply echoing that new reality.
Notice how Trudeau was silent at the protest of women in Iran who were being clubbed for refusing to cover their hair. Why is it that the Globe is incapable of addressing the issue at hand - political Islam or the idea of society governed by religion. There are 57 members of the OIC at the UN, should Canada attempt to accommodate symbols of a belief system that are only common where gender equality, press freedom, LGBT rights, and freedom of expression (religious satire) are non-existent?  The Globe is incapable of taking a position on Islamism, why is that? Trudeau's position is equivalent to arguing why can't Quebec be more like certain suburbs of Paris... because most Canadians don't support social regression paraded as hashtag diversity.
The author demonstrates what's called categorization error:   Most people who are violent predators are men. However, that does not mean it's true that most men are violent predators.  It's a common enough psychological error. We also see it when people notice that most violent terrorists are Muslim, and conclude that most Muslims must support  violent terrorism. And yet the author, and the G&M editorial board, does not treat the two errors the same. Strange.
At least 42 Christians accused of murder in Pakistan were reportedly told they’d be acquitted if they embraced Islam. The accused face the charges after the lynching of two men following twin suicide blasts at churches during Sunday mass. Prosecutor Syed Anees Shah initially denied telling the accused he could guarantee their acquittal if they converted. However, he later admitted he did, when told by Pakistan’s Express Tribune that the accused had a video recording of what he said.
Eventually it will end, and quite possibly not well for us.  Islam has a 1000 years to get its way, and  they will not stop, ever. Check back in 3017 to see how things are going.
Her entire  article reolves around two things that percentage of Muslims in Cananda is far lower than what Candians think and second that small number of Muslims women wear scrarf or Niqab that might be correct.  But problem lies somewhere elese that she didn't talk about is whether Muslims living in Canada support gender equality, LGBT rights, support secular values of Canada, oppose armed Jihad. we see the segregation of women in some univiserities reported by the media. There is large majority among Muslim community still claims that 9/11 was conspiracy of Jews and US agencies.Simialrly, many people living here support blasphemy act back in Muslim countries. So it is not perception but the mindset and values we carry and pass on our children that causing serious problem here.
It is not as simple as their dress.  Islam requires strict adherence to its religious tenants. Muslims have repeatedly shown that they are not interested in assimilating or being tolerant of other races and religions.  When they reach a certain portion of the population, they attempt to institute their religious practices such as sharia law which is what they have done in Europe and are attempting to do in our country.  They represent a serious danger to our nation as their beliefs are totally contrary to our Constitution, Bill of Rights and our Judeo-Christian beliefs and values.  What you see in Muslim countries is the true face of Islam and they intend to bring this to a place near you in the very near future.
There's no such thing as a Jewish, Christian or Islamic terrorist.  There is, however, no shortage psychotic killers using the name of these faith communities in a feeble attempt to justify their love affair with violence.  They don't fool anybody who knows anything about Judaism, Christianity or Islam, but they do fool the hard of thinking who are ignorant of what these three faith communities who all worship the God of Abraham stand for.
No Muslims love Jews, Israel got it all wrong. Perhaps you should go their and inform them of that fact. Truly you are amusing.
@JoeC: Just like we didn't hear a global outcry from Christians when Timothy McVeigh blew up the Federal Court House in Oklahoma City or when Dylan Roof executed 9 black people in a church in Charleston, SC. And we didn't hear a huge outpouring of rage from Democrats when Janet Reno and slick Willie burned 87 people to death in Waco, TX. Fact is that Christians who don't believe in murdering people who fail to agree with them don't see themselves as the problem and don't see their religion as the problem. Same is true of ordinary Muslims who don't support murder and mayhem of unbelievers, they know that they themselves are not creating or contributing to the problem, so they just keep their heads down, go to work, raise their kids, care for their elderly and keep on keepin' on. Your implication that they are somehow different from ordinary Christians is poorly informed.
No. There is no "Muslim ban." There is a Trump EO which reiterates an Obama EO, which was pursuant to a federal law signed by Obama.
I gave you a star because I agree that all religions and religious practices should be entirely removed from public schools.  However, admittedly, I am an atheist and have no use for religion. As long as the law requires that religious needs to be reasonably accommodated, I don't think asking to use an empty classroom to pray is unreasonable.  When I was a kid in school, I would get detention when I refused to stand for the Lord's Prayer.... now THAT was unreasonable.  Muslims may want to practice their religion, but at least they've never tried to force me to practice it... which is more than I can say for Christians.
Ah right. But British troops along with those from other western nations like Canada are in Muslim countries because that’s where these Islamic terrorists are based. See how it works?
Protestants, Anglicans, Muslims and Jews also seem to have no problems making it work.
All I see in his words below is horrific distortion to create fear and hate.  “We must disrupt those who would seek to send troops into our streets to deport the undocumented, to rip mothers and fathers from their families. We must disrupt those who portray refugees as enemies, rather than our brothers and sisters in terrible need. We must disrupt those who train us to see Muslim men and women and children as sources of fear rather than as children of God. We must disrupt those who seek to rob our medical care, especially from the poor. We must disrupt those who would take even food stamps and nutrition assistance from the mouths of children,” the bishop said.
Let's do a reality check.  The U. S. is the source of all evil in the world ("The Great Satan").  Almost anyplace is better than here.  Our medical system is a disaster, Canada's and Europe's is much better (I hear this all the time.).  Yet the Muslim Shia paradise of Iran can't produce doctor's that can perform this procedure and the parents would rather come to "The Great Satan" for their child's welfare than Europe or Canada.  Not to mention people are lining up on our borders by the millions to come here.  Something just doesn't compute about this perception of reality.
Another G&M front page Islamic/Refugee/Muslim type of article!  Let me take a guess at this weekend front page title...  "Syrian refugees feel uncomfortable with Christmas terminology and traditions. Justin Trudeau to propose national ban of the word Christmas"
Our laws already forbid the horrendous acts that the author details. It is obvious that he obsesses about Muslims just like Ms.Leitch. It's simple. No you can't come here and kill your daughter  if she brings home the wrong boyfriend. But you can tell her you are pissed off.
Fabricated? You mean 4 people were not killed?  Gregory Hicks, deputy chief of mission in Tripoli at the time of the organized terrorist attack in Benghazi, watched in horror as the Clinton machine kicked into hyperspeed to whitewash the attack in which four Americans were killed.  My jaw hit the floor as I watched this,” Mr. Hicks told House investigators, describing U.N. Ambassador Susan E. Rice’s wall-to-wall appearances on Sunday political shows.  “I have been a professional diplomat for 22 years,” he said. “I have never been as embarrassed in my life, in my career, as on that day.”  Ms. Rice was simply setting up mirrors and fanning the diversionary smoke set ablaze by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who immediately dismissed the attacks as some sort of unforeseeable, instantaneous reaction to some obscure anti-Muslim Internet video that nobody had ever heard of — at least not until Secretary Clinton made it instantly famous around the globe by blaming it for Benghazi.
I have a female cousin that was attacked in London by Muslim men telling her to dress more modestly and convert. I wouldn't say that makes London a no go zone, but to deny that Muslim extremists aren't beating and harassing non-Muslims in Europe makes you no more credible than those who say it's common.
That's not true.  Most countries consider the settlements illegitimate, not illegal. They are perfectly legal according to the international law. And countries consider them illegitimate because they think these Israeli villages are obstacles for peace.   Watching how Arab and Islamic states constantly war with each other. only completely insane person may think that Palestinian Arabs will live at peace with Israelis.
Equality is not right!    All black people in the US deserve an advantage over all others in the US.  It's called affirmative action and applies in education, hiring, promotion, housing and all aspects of living in this country.   All Hispanics in the US deserve to enter the US without complying with any of the requirements that any other racial or ethnic group must comply with to come here.  All Muslims must be allowed entry to the US because of their religious beliefs.  This pernicious concept of "equality", especially of opportunity,  must be stopped immediately!
“continues to relay a message of disparagement” to Muslims. If you have  a religion that preaches they have the right to kill infidels, and if someone is a Christian or a Jew they can only live if they pay a special tax, would it not be reasonable to relay a message of disparagement?
Clayton you forgot to mention all the "free-stuff" that Norway gives to the masses even the Muslim invaders who only 1 in 20 ever gets a job and refuses to assimilate and are taking over all the "free social services and medical" and yes the Islamic in-breeding causing birth defects covered by working Norwegians who   provide for these dregs. Oh wait we do the same here in the US. And Dearborn does have Sharia law. Norway, the land of the Nobel Prise that was given to your guy Barack just for breathing? That advanced society of Norway? And yes I still have relatives in Stavanger who feel the same as do I.
If a local public issue is decided on a discriminatory basis, it doesn't matter if it was decided by a direct majority vote or a majority vote by elected council members.  The purpose of enshrining rights in a constitution is to protect minorities from majorities.  It's not a new thing.  While the article has no direct evidence that the local residents were motivated by anti-muslim feelings when they voted, it's not hard to imagine that Julius Grey has his contacts.  In any event, that's the principle ... and why a constitutional lawyer has spoken up.
Except for this ("He did not include the UAE or Saudi Arabia where the 911 crew originated. That is likely because he does a lot of business there but I notice the media has left that pretty much alone.") I agree with you.  The 7 states were chosen by the Obama Admin, not the Trump Admin. The choice had nothing to do with who does business where. It had to do with the reliability of government-provided information used in vetting visitors/immigrants/refugees. The Obama Admin determined that these 7 states were not providing reliable info, and the U.S. was at risk when people from these states came to the U.S. Trump promised to use 'extreme vetting' and that he would suspend immigration from states requiring "until we find out what the heck is going on" and 'extreme vetting' is implemented.  The fact they're muslim-majority countries is irrelevant. The 5 largest muslim-majority countries aren't included.  Your conclusions are correct, I believe. Countries need to control their borders.
HHM M:  You, quite obviously are well-informed on this issue.  My knowledge is shallow, but I really feel conflicted on the State of Israel and the systemic discrimination of Israeli culture.  It seems to be one of those situations with, quite literally, no good answer available.  Some "two-state" compromise seems to just further and further from the realm of possibilities.  We're seeing further settlement development in the occupied territories which, as I can only see it, each day makes anything resembling a solution more impossible. Simplistically, I think the real "mistake" was made 70 years ago by founding the Jewish Homeland in the middle of the Muslim world.  I think taking a good sized chunk of Germany would have made more sense.  Locating it is Palestine was a guarantee of an eternity of turmoil...Given the location, given the hatred on both sides and given the intransigence and the power of the conservative Zionists in Israel, I can't even imagine any great "breakthrough."
Terrible situation . . . did the 2 young Muslim women finally contact the police to help as witnesses to the murders & to show solidarity with the families of the men killed protecting them??  /..
You need to get a clue about your fellow conservative Christians. They aren't all so benevolent. Right now, two Christian city councilmembers are shocked that the Muslim community in Greeley wants to build a mosque and asked for a zoning hearing. They are further shocked that there IS a Muslim community in Greeley. This has happened elsewhere, as well. Too many conservative Christians want government funding for religious schools, so long as the schools are conservative Christian. Too many conservative Christians want broad leeway on how and where they build their churches -- but ONLY for churches. Mosques and ashrams and temples need not apply. I don't care if you disagree. And, yes, there are people who want no government voucher money for religious schools. If some religious schools are included in a voucher program, all religious (and strictly secular) schools must be covered as well.
a speech like this that speaks out against or criticizes Islam will soon be against the law in Canada   welcome to "post national" Canada
Women in Islam   are breeding stock, worth half the value of a man and worthless without  a man.  Do  we want really more of that old time religion here?  Our feminists, LGBT communities,  and Liberals say yes, the more the merrier.
Canada is a country with a Christian heritage and legacy.  Vestiges of this legacy are to be found everywhere in Canadian society.   Are you proposing that the vast majority of Canadians should be willing to abandon their cultural heritage in order to accommodate newly arrived Muslim Canadians?  When Muslim majority countries welcome hundreds of thousands Western immigrants to their countries and offer them state resources to carry out their religious practices, then prayer rooms can be offered in Canadian schools.
There is an unholy alliance of white racists, Hindu extremists and Jewish extremists that are fueling all this anti-Muslim hatred. These haters are all losers in life and have found Muslims as a scapegoat for their own poor lot in life.
Sikhs are allowed to eat beef or any meat. So other than letting us know you don't know the difference between Sikhism and Hindu, is there anything else you wish to share? They are forbidden to eat eat meat ritually prepared Halal in case you next confuse with Muslim (or Kosher).
A good read supporting George Borjas common sense approach to immigration can be found in "Reflections on the Revolution in Europe; Immigration, Islam, and the West" by Christopher Caldwell.  The immigration proposal by Tom Cotton backed by President Trump makes good sense.  Living in Canada for many years, their immigration policies attracted many great people that continue to contribute to society.  It's a great plan.
Remember when President Trump was first elected there were several elite designers who said they would never "dress" Mrs. Trump, not design for her or fabricate dresses for her. No one got upset over that. If an individual went into a Jewish deli or a Muslim food place and demand that the restaurant serve them pork, they would refuse. How are either of these scenarios different? The couple should have just gone to another bakery rather than making a big stink, but then that is what liberals excel at.
"Personally, I doubt that El Salvador is anywhere near as anti-Muslim as the U.S."  So even you agree that your statement was improbable.  If El Salvador is unlikely to be anti muslim, then the attack is also unlikely to have been religiously motivated.
Is the NCR looking for filler articles that allow MNN space? If you are looking for Mary articles, how about Mary in Koran? Mentioned more time than in NT. What do Muslims know that Christians don't. Maybe MNN could do some original research than rehash.
I neither said nor implied that either fact was illegal in and of itself.  There is, however, a good argument that the anti-muslim nature of the campaign was illegal in the sense that the resulting decision violated the Constitution.    Don't take my word for it, that's the opinion of Julius Grey, one of the country's leading constitututional experts.  See "Quebec Muslims would probably win court challenge of St-Apollinaire referendum rejecting cemetery: Julius Grey" in the July 17 Montreal Gazette.
It's not the legal and technical aspects of illegal immigration that's important. It's the reason Trump's increasing enforcement. He referred to illegal immigrants as criminals and rapists. He advocated a Muslim ban, etc, etc. In short, the motive for his actions are to pander to his base and inflame them with lies about immigrants. All agree illegal immigration is a problem. But whatever the solutions, they must be fact driven and with some compassion for violators, particularly children. Trump lies about immigrant crime and highlights immigrant crime to demonize a whole class of people. Because of this, Trump crosses the line between enforcing the law and victimizing a whole class of people. We cannot let this stand.
Hmm...how about George Hennard, Seung Hui Ho, Adam Lanza, James Huberty and Charles J. Whitman?  Each killed large numbers of folks.  Were they Muslims?
Careful now, all you anti-immigrationistas vehemently and passionately defending the Mad King's rescinding DACA. Though the psychic pain he is inflicting with this move is all too typical of the institutional sadism of his administration, he's already signaled he just might flip on the issue, double crossing you all. It's a particularly dumb move in light of the ideological threat President Beefsteak claims America is facing from radical Islamic extremism to declare war on a completely assimilated group of young people who fully support our culture and democratic norms of gubmit.
Sheema, where are you!?  We need you to help us make sense of this, just the latest in a string of attacks on Muslim driven cars by packs of roving pedestrians.
No mention that we need the peoples of the world working co-operatively together to make it a better place.    No mention that we need to work with the Islamic peoples to get rid of their radical elements.   No mention at all that survival of the world depends upon emphasis of the Golden Rule (Do Unto Others that ... etc) and that all other religious dressings such as even American evangelism have to be downplayed.   No mention that when we talk about God, we talk about the unknowable, but that regardless, a universal God has not and will never favor one country.   No mention at all that for America to prosper requires that everyone help everyone else in the world to prosper at the same time because that is what stimulates economic growth for all.     Yes, this was the worst speech that anyone could have made.
So this is how Middle East immigrants thank us for giving them sanctuary--they try to kill us. There is a serious problem in Islam which most of their leaders ignore and by doing so promote the hatred and killing of us in the West. Maybe Trump is right--screen very carefully and be prepared to say NO a lot.
Where in the Indonesian constitution does it say that? Or the Bangladeshi constitution (those are the biggest and fourth biggest Muslim countries in the world)? Where in the Malaysian constitution does it say that?
I agree that the total definition of fascism as above does not capture Trump.  But I do believe Trump: Exalts Nation: Nothing against being proud of one's country. But Trump is portraying a world against the United States. He raised fears that the 14 people killed in San Bernardino represented a national threat.  We are the wealthiest country in the world with the greatest military, yet his slogan is to "Make America Great Again".   Does Trump exalt race? He's more clever than that. He presents those who differ from us ("Mexicans" and "Muslims)" as a threat.   Does he want a "centralized autocratic government"? The opposite would be power sharing. Do people believe Trump is more favorable to power sharing or having it his way? Think "you're fired".  Dictator: No. Just a hard  bargainer. Would he seek to change the Constitution?  Economic and Social Regimentation? He proposes high tariffs. Abortion is a crime.   Forcible suppression: "I'd like to punch (the protester) in the face."
You're missing the point.  We all feel terrible about the Benghazi  attack.  Trump gives the impression he hates all military thru his hatred of Muslims.  Trump should have honored the gold star parents and moved on.  This dude Trump  would run the other way before he complimented another human.   Something definitely wrong with his central processing functions.
I am guessing this was aimed at me but it seems to have disappeared. But so JackBlack is aware, I do think ISIS is the enemy. They're the enemy to Muslims as well as the US. Millions of Muslims have condemned ISIS but I am guessing fox doesn't tell you that.
Qatar has been in constant conflict with its other gulf neighbours for decades. They actively fund the Muslim Brotherhood and are the base of Al Jazeera tv which is critical of regional governments. However they have also had friendly relations with the United States and host a large US military base on their territory so this complicates things.
How many deaf female Japanese nationals are muslim terrorists?  Did Inouye airport officials find an AK-47 in her check in baggage?  Botulism toxin in a vial? Explosives in her shoes? Without a sign language interpreter, her probable inability to understand english and being deaf with probable severely limited verbal skills in ANY spoken language, it would be easy to misinterpret her lack of communication as being uncooperative.
Regarding: "We begin with Rana Abdelhamid, founder of the Women's Initiative for Self-Empowerment (WISE), who discusses the reality of the "hijab grab" that many Muslim women have experienced. She explains why she runs a self-empowerment and self-defense class for Muslim women." - Groups such as WISE do great good. - One way that they can do greater good is to lead discussions about how Islam, Muslim life, and Shari'a interrelate. - For instance terrorists will cite Shari'a to defend slavery, religious discrimination and slaughter, murder of men and women who step out of perceived norms of behaviour (gays, women who do not dress according to certain norms). - Muslim community would help all by identifying those laws and show how they have been already rejected by Muslims, or should be rejected by Muslims. This discussion ought to be held using languages other than Arabic. That is, make the rejection of shari'a that inhibits the global community transparent and global.
Rest assured I use the community organizer's Muslim name with all due respect and admiration.

Arrival City: How the Largest Migration in History Is Reshaping Our World by D. Saunders  B. The Myth of the Muslim Tide Drawing on voluminous demographic, statistical, scholarly and historical documentation, [WOW!]examines the real lives and circumstances of Muslim immigrants in the West: their politics, their beliefs, their observances and their degrees of assimilation.

C. New Book -- Maximum Canada: Why 35 Million Cdns Are Not Enough. Award-winning author..[G&W] feature columnist Doug Saunders argues we need 100 million Canadians if we're to outgrow our colonial past and build a safer, greener, more prosperous future.  Yeah, sure.
Then why were legitimate immigrants with green cards being turned away at the border?  Why are muslims being targeted for immigration bans?
Thank god for the 6 Muslim countries.   Where would we be if not for them visiting our island.
And I'm a racist and fascist for wanting to stop Muslim immigration?  There is something very sick in this Socialist Marxist horror world we live in that I would be called a racist for being sensible....  In the past a moratorium would be in place until a strategy could be developed to allow immigrants from these terror countries into ours?  What does the Liberal party do Open the floodgates...  We have lost our country to a group of globalists who will not stop until our country is destroyed.  Its time to move to a country that is blocking these people.  hmmm where would that be I wonder There is a reason the US stock markets are up 20% and real estate is booming.  Internationals with assets are fleeing from their countries who let these people in into the US to protect their families.  Trump absolutely has the right idea
And in yet another telling move, and despite their recent victory, Russia and Iran immediately call for talks aimed at a political settlement of the conflict in Syria. They have done so consistently since it began. The reason why the 'genuine' Syrian opposition didn't seek a political settlement was because Western and regional governments were backing them with arms, finances, personnel and intelligence. Those outside parties wanted the opposition to destroy the Syrian government, and they encouraged their proxies to give no political quarter. As well, the vast majority of opposition territory in Syria is held by the terrorist groups al-Nusra Front and Islamic State. They don't negotiate political settlements. For them its a holy crusade, and they'll either push the Alawites and Christians into the sea, or die trying.
Whats your stand on misspelling names over and over and over and over and over? And you misspelled gnashing. Whats the deal with you Liberals, you hate a guy that hasn't done anything yet but you love Obama that has deported more Mexicans then all the other presidents combined in the 20th century and killed more Muslims then the Spanish Inquisition (2,500 to 3,000).
Well, the only other thing I said was that if any other religious group tried competing with them for prayer time, there would be a Muslim backlash. I also included those 2 words. So, what’s wrong with that?
1,600,000,000 muslims around the globe need to rise up and forever stamp out radical Islamic terrorists.  They should be able to accomplish this with sheer numbers.  They know who they are.  Muslims execute women and homosexuals, why not terrorists???
Nuclear bomb capability is like a virile virus wherein containment by quarantine is minimally adequate and has a short shelf life .. or should I say short half-life. N.Korea is one of several worst case scenarios .. a madman in control, posturing, threatening & seen as truly dangerous. By whatever means at hand, Korea's threat must be eliminated - not merely pacified & temporarily contained.  Iran, sworn to eliminate Israel, the USA & the non muslim world, openly postures & struts its power, & must be finally eliminated as well. Our enemies are getting smarter, more technologically advanced, no less hateful, & therefore far more dangerous. We should not put blinders on to keep us from the obvious necessity of removing these & other serious adversaries.
A very good and needed piece of writing, Margaret, congratulations. One detail needs to be amended in the text, though. The phrase "prayer in school" usually means that denominational prayer is offered to an entire body of students, with a few asking for exemption . This story is about the opposite. Observant Muslims would retire to a private space for short private prayer, which is simply a personal accommodation for a minority. As you say, the opposition is thinly-veiled bigotry.
I think fact that our scriptures and traditions developed within a Mediterranean culture, limited and unaware of the rest of the world. No knowledge of China, little of India and Sub-Sahara Africa, and nothing of the cultures of the Americas and Australia. Most of the people of the world were excluded simply because they did not live around the Mediterranean sea. Only in more recent times have we begin to engage other faith traditions, which promise awakened life and eternal happiness. Vat II simply recognized the vast expansion of our awareness and urged us respectfully to engage with other traditions. That in turn triggered a reevaluation of Judaism, for there never was a clean break, and thus with Islam and their promise that being a servant of God (Muslim) ushers one into paradise. There is so much richness in the traditions that to refuse engagement and just call out "Lord, Lord," is not a gospel choice. St. Francis de Sales: "You catch more with honey than with vinegar."
Do not worry.he will never Going to fail in election. What you think reason for bringing refugees with right out citizenship status? He will get half a million loyal votes right from there. Another million from the refugee sect already here in Canada. Ismail Muslim community is a large vote bank in Toronto. One of the social housing complex near finch & Weston area in Toronto just assigned to them, when poor people black/Hispanic  stay in waiting list to get a spot. Those who liberal weed smokers will learn a lesson soon once these cult take over this country.
It's not a question of supporting "intolerant cultures", I think it's about not supporting the intolerant "aspects" of cultures. If we go around labelling an entire culture as wholly intolerant then we lose the opportunity to find common ground and a starting place to address what we find to be intolerant. Just today there was an article about skewed sex ratios in children of Indo-Canadian women of Punjabi origin. Does this mean we label Punjabi's as intolerant? Or Indians as a whole? If we see this as sexual discrimination then how do we reconcile it with the fact that Catholicism doesn't allow female priests? Is Catholicism therefore intolerant? Or is this acceptable since it's only restricting females, not aborting them? Is Catholicism even a "culture" or is it just a religion? Do we label all Muslims as intolerant just because of the actions of some? Do we label all Christians as intolerant because there are some who oppose same sex marriage? This isn't history, it's happening now.
With strong support of JT & Liberal government, it will be a Muslim ONLY cemetery in this town.  In fact, it will be wherever they want to have with JT  government 's blessing.
It was true in Indonesia for many years.  We should have learned from there example.  Unfortunately after W Bush took a country in the Black to war with the muslims, it is less true there or any other place.  It was he who called the war against Iraq the new Crusade.  It really was a war to help the oil companies, nothing else.  Any way W took this war off budget pretending it did not belong there and Obama put it back into the Budget.  When Democrats such as Clinton, balance the budget largely on the backs of the poor, the Republicans seem to want to go back to war.   Sr. Bush went to war!  Reagan administration financed the horrible wars against the native Americans in Central America.   However Democrats like Johnson muddied the waters with his war in VN.  All these wars were started with lies to the American People.  The lies were geared to make us fearful.  Now Trump want 10x the number of nuclear weapons.  So ya, lets just balance the budget....
Canada is multi-racial and multi-religious society where we welcome immigrants from every corner of the world. However, we should all get along and be considerate to each other. To that end, various religious minority groups should not disrupt the social and religious harmony by incessantly making excessive demands on the rest of out wonderful peaceful society. We don't want to descend into the chaos of the United States or Europe where wanton killing happens on a daily basis. We need the cooperation of religious and racial group to make a contribution to that by not making so many demands that risk destroying the social fabrics of our society.  Compared to the United States, Canada has a  wonderful record to respecting and helping the muslim community. In the United States, muslims  in many cases cannot even board a flight without causing a disruption. We do not have not problem. But mulsims also need to be sensitive.
"I will not worship your false gods; as for me and my House, we worship Allah."--Joshua (upon him be God's Peace).
The media has a large role to play in violence against Muslims in Canada. In the many incidents of violence in Europe and Canada and the US involving Muslims, including 9/11. the violence has been attributed to Muslim extremists. The fact that in every case, Muslims had been attacked was never mentioned. 9/11 for example followed decades of interference by the US in the Middle East, particularly in Palestine. That was not even mentioned in the official report on 9/11. The media did not pick up the absence of retaliation as one reason for the Muslims's attacks. And that has continued through almost countless attacks.   What a difference in attitude to Muslims if Canadians had been told by the media that every attack by Muslims was preceded by an attack on Muslims. Instead the media kept repeating that violence was due to Muslims. The media is very effective establishing propaganda. And we all suffer, including the media, as demonstrated by Goebbels in Germany.
Taqiyya is the Islamic practice of deception. Muslims are permitted to tell falsehoods to  infidels, Jews, non-Muslims to defend Islam. Taqiyya is as basic to Islam, as charity is to Christianity. Taqiyya is a moral duty. No other religion has such a thing as Taqiyya. It is anathema to western thought, and so it is hard for non-Muslims to understand that it actually exists and is used regularly against western culture and political stability.   The worst part is that the Liberals, police, and news media like the Globe are now giving us  the taqiyya   voluntarily, doing Islams dirty work.
Timothy McVeigh wasn't a Muslim. See the difference? Lol
Skip, the courts banned the Lord's Prayer because it was imposed on ALL students:  "The recitation of the Lord’s Prayer, which is a Christian prayer, and the reading of Scriptures from the Christian Bible impose Christian observances upon non-Christian pupils and religious observances on non-believers." ~ Zylberberg v. Sudbury Board of Education (1988, Ontario Court of Appeal)  That's in no way the case with Friday muslim services in a spare classroom of Peel high schools.  So, no - Judeo-Christian values do not carry less weight than Islamic values.  The Freedom of Religion found in our Charter of Rights applies to all religions.
The reason the biased media calls it a Muslim ban is because they can reliably count on low information progressives to believe that it is.  The "peace loving" communists refer to it as agitation and propaganda, I call it yellow journalism.   And just as a side note for those of you who travel by air frequently.  Never forget why airplane security is so intrusive. It is a direct result of Muslims blowing up or threatening to blow up airplanes to advance their 14th century ideology.  And as an extra added bonus let's not forget how the LGBTWXYZ crowd are treated in Muslim majority nations.    I don't expect this post to make it past the civility police simply because there is no way to refute it.  But I can hope.
Stop empathizing muslim when it is towards all people from those countries.
I get confused.  Is Muslim a religion?  Had the same problem with understanding what is a Jew.  Is that a religion or a nationality, and since they once had no country, then is it a race or tribe of people?  Well, since I don't know what or who they are?  Who is the enemy?  I forget!
The world has been consumed by Muslims and their problems for the last 20 years.  Why are the rich Muslim countries not taking in their fellow travellers?  Saudi Arabia has hundreds of thousands air conditioned tents that could accommodate all these refugees.
Got to say I agree with John Tucker.   Keeping the base, but moving the nuclear weapons to Turkish archrival Greece would send an unmistakable message we are unhappy with the anti-democratic and pro Muslim Brotherhood direction Turkey has headed under Ergodan.   He is also right about the 1993 Turkish vote not to assist us in the Iraq war.
Glaring hypocrisy.   We should be prepared to talk about everything.....except....funnily enough.....most Muslims, like this author, do not want to talk about the links between terror and the Koran and Hadith.....nor the links between violent intolerance and the same books, nor the links between child brides and the same books, nor the deeply immoral acts of their religions founder. Those are somehow not to be discussed. And thats the problem here.   We can't  let a group decide what we can or can't discuss through the threat of being labelled Islamaphobic (whatever that is) or rascist or through threats of violence....  This is why free speech is so important. and must be defended.    Something the G&M doesn't seem to understand. And most certainly doesn't defend.  Which is why you will never see an article on certain issues related to Islam and whats written in the Koran and Hadith, Ever.
1. Are you disappointed that the only one to 'like' your post, is yourself? So sad.  2. Your post is a non-sequitur so hardly surprising you had to up-vote yourself. Just because you have the freedom to worship whatever imaginary sky-being you wish, does not mean that he/she/it should have a role in electing a party leader. Why  do I think that if it was muslims or buddhists or janists influencing a vote, you would definitely not be in favour?
At least your consistent in being abysmally wrong.  Islam is as much a western tradition as Judaism or Christianity--between the three the latter was subject to the most 'eastern' influences (mostly Hindu).  I'm a product of western culture.  I like it just fine.  That doesn't mean I'm incapable of acknowledging its warts and rejecting its moral failings, any more than it means I'm incapable of denouncing crimes perpetrated by those identifying themselves with my Faith.  Your problem is you can't conceive anything other than lockstep acceptance of ALL western 'cultural precepts' and rejection of all others, therefore you're incapable of seeing anything OTHER than 'one-dimensionalsim' despite the reality I accept what's positive from many human cultures and traditions (including this one).  In short, when you bleat "projection" you accuse me of that which you yourself are most guilty.  And as for feeling 'inferior', once I stop pointing and laughing I'll try to respond to that.
AT, you resort to insult. You call me a "stooge". You say I "throw tantrums". You are a poor person. You don't care about the peaceful followers of Islam, why? One can only assume that you don't care about the peaceful followers of Christianity either. When you say "we", who is the other person"? Maybe Peter, your best friend? Most of us care a little about peace-loving people. I would like to have only peace-loving people around me, like Syrian refugees who have a great deal more intelligence and education as well as better personality than you apparently have.
RC, the problem is whenever anything violent happens we seem to be drawn to whatever stereotypes we want to confirm. In the case of minorities, we'll usually find some family background that is angry black, dissatisfied middle eastern, islamic, antiamerican immigrant, etc. But other than some token "connected to white supremacist" or misplaced southern pride these events the usual story is abstract mental issues, depression, etc. It's rare to see anything presented as "my faith drove me to it" even if the evidence is out there. Obviously, it's all nutty. Violence is not the answer. But don't kid yourself. They all do it, right/left, christian/islam/etc, and the usual thuggy riot enthusiasts when there's no soccer game to pillage over.
I am happy you were able to emigrate to America, but your situation and the current orders are comparing apples and oranges.  In 2015, Obama had to defend his strict Syrian refugee screening and years earlier, there was a moratorium for six months on Iraq refugees whilst more comprehensive screening was enacted after an attempted attack by an Iraqi immigrant.   A President's first responsibility is to his citizens. Europe has been plagued with immigrant crime and terror attacks over the past several years, and the countries listed in the President's EO- embroiled in civil unrest or actively combating terrorists - can pose a real danger to America. You do it a disservice by labeling it 'a Muslim ban' and by doing so, further propagate an erroneous characterization; the majority of countries that possess a predominantly Muslim population are not affected by this temporary order.
On the home page of Civil Beat's website today there is a picture of a girl is holding a sign which says "Stop Gun Violence & Homophobia Now". What is most disturbing is left-leaning Americans fail to acknowledge this was an act of terrorism first and foremost. Under Islamic law most Muslim led countries have laws in place which criminalize homosexuality to this very day. When Eric Robert Rudolf bombed a gay nightclub it was over 20 years ago when both Democrats, Republicans and an overwhelming majority of Americans opposed gay marriage. Times have changed in America but not for those in Muslim-majority countries.  Now it turns out Mateen may have been gay or bisexual. He allegedly was a regular at the Pulse Nightclub. Homophobia is defined as "irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against homosexuality or homosexuals" It is more appropriate to intellectualize this horrific event as "Jihadism" instead of making this senselessness principally about homophobia & gun control.
Hasn't it become obvious that the poorly educated, in Islamic dominated states, like hard-line authoritarian leaders. The greater proportion of the population, rurally based, still largely live in the 10th century
Your response is a false equivalence and the product of sloppy reasoning, as usual. The exact equivalence in response to John Hobson's comment would be: Was ISLAM the U.S.' friend before the election? Which is as absurd a question as: Was Christianity (or Judaism, or Hinduism, etc) the U.S.' friend before the election?
We'll I tried to post a rebuttal, but G&M's censorship got in the way.  It contained a quote from the book below, which was non threatening, but thought provoking .   So I'll just encourage Alceste to broaden his /her knowledge and read “Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now” by Ayaan Hirsi Ali  Wake up and smell the reformation.
It's International Women's Day and yet the Muslim women who stood up to speak in Parliament never once used the platform to condemn the misogyny and chauvinism institutionalized in Islamic-majority countries. Instead, the crowd was hectored on the evils of "Islamophobia," the boogeyman (boogeygenderneutralperson?) of our time.  In 2019 I will remember your shameless pandering to special-interest groups at the expense of one of our most cherished freedoms, Mr. Trudeau.
Let's try an "analogy" more to the point: how about a gay couple going into a muslim shop and demanding 1. pork 2. a pro gay wedding cake? Should the muslim baker/shopkeeper be forced to "accommodate" them in either scenario?
Public schools are non religious institutions  paid for by people who  predominantly rightfully  assume that there is no religious activity, That is  what they indicated when  they filled  in there property tax form . There fore with all due respect  this accommodation where ever it is should not be made available. When one comes to this country take it as is . Rest be assured I am not at all a anti Muslim person far from it .  But this pushy entitlement  Muslim attitude is some thing they should be more care full with.
She is one person among 1,600,000,000 Muslims. Do you read her book because it conforms to your biases and prejudices?  There are over 50 Islamic countries. In terms of population, the countries with the biggest Muslim populations are Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, etc. There is probably no single solution for all the Muslim countries.
Pope Francis doesn't want to criticize Islamic violence because we have Christian violence, well I wish he would criticize Catholic violence and I wish the grand Iman would criticize  Islamic violence, in fact both should criticize all violence by either party.
Again, Khadr has yet to say anything that shows he's rejected Islamic fascism.
yup! he's working for the Muslim/Islam foreigners.
"As a woman, I can say I have definitely been discriminated against several times by Muslims. I have never discriminated against them." ~ ~ ~ Voluntear... you are among many who have witnessed women being discriminated by Muslim men & Muslim women.  The special term 'Islamophobia' seems to be striving desperately to set itself apart from other 'religions & collectives' ... it certainly seems to be especially drawing into itself a great deal of Canadian oxygen.  Bigotry is a Human issue -- Islam is just an other religion just like Judaism -- Neither is special.
1. Those who support the legislation are demonized, as are those who question some religious practises. But the concerns are also expressed within Islam like Globe letters by Shaul Ezer and Leila Kayali . 2. The issue of rights colliding in a very pluralistic society needs to be addressed.  Muslim Kamran Siddiqui wrote in an oped, "In a secular society, religion is a personal matter and the practicing of religious rituals is restricted to the private lives. In the public sphere, every person is equal in the eyes of the state, irrespective of race, religion and gender." Columnist Yakabuski wrote -  European Court of Human Rights upheld the French niqab/burka ban in 2014 on the grounds that the requirement to show one's face in public fell under "the respect for the minimum requirements of life in society." 3. in a pluralistic society we need to work hard to separate from any religion its peripheral practises which appear to have theocratic or traditional tribal origins.
Like your self , I've been to Burma , and Bangladesh and agree with your last paragraph .  The Buddhists of Burma have no problem with the Christians or Hindus or other ethnic minorities because they do not insist upon you believing in their ideology.  Unfortunately the Sunnis in Bangladesh are being taken over by the Wahhabi sect promoted by Saudi Arabia .  This sect promotes "jihad", the "conversion"  by any means , including force  .  This has been on going for a good number of years .  It began in Bangladesh with the military's (Wahhabi officer corp) taking out whole valleys of Buddhist farmers along the border , and has expanded into Burma .  All hatred is ugly , but there is a reason for it . Wahhabi Islam , not Sunni or Shia , is a very real threat to the world.
"Hearing liberal friends and family froth at the mouth in their vehement hatred of Trump . . ."  Meanwhile conservatives embrace the Kenyan-Muslim-socialist-gun grabber with nary a trace of froth.
This electronic ban won't happen because our gov't is rife with islam sympathizers.  A ban would be seen as an affront, and the Libs are so very sensitive to that happening.  Would they put the public at risk just to have islam rub their belly?
A Muslim witness may be required to remove her niqab veil to testify in court depending on the seriousness of the case and the sincerity of her religious beliefs, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled several years ago.  The decision means that a Toronto sexual assault trial that was halted during the preliminary inquiry stage resumed, now that the trial judge had instructions on how to assess the complainant's request to testify from behind her veil.  In its 4-3 decision, the court said there are times when even a significant religious belief must bow to other social and legal concerns.
I prefer that people be discreet about their religious affiliations when not relevant, yes, but when they are given a public forum AS Muslims, I expect them  to use it for what it was meant, i.e. inform the public about their beliefs, just as I expect a priest given a column will express what his beliefs are.  There are splits within the Muslim community, that is obvious to all. The more liberal ones are just as critical of the conservatives as liberal Xians are of fundamentalists, so why isd it that supposedly "liberal" newspapers give the conservatives a mouthpiece rather than their liberal critics?  I use "hijabi" because that is what they call themselves. Isn't using the term they prefer the politically correct way? And it's interesting that having claimed it is "prejudice" to assume all Muslims are "conservative", now even wearing a hijab isn't considered "conservative", it actually takes a burqa to qualify?    tbctnd
I would say by the number of high ranking black and hispanic employees that Mr. Trump employs that no, he isn't a racist.  Why do you feel he is?  Because he wants to protect our borders from illegal aliens that the current administration welcomes with open arms so they will vote for them?  Or is it the fact that he wants to stop muslims from terrorist nations from being able to come to America, so that we don't have another marathon bombed, or night club, etc.  Or is it that because you are a liberal with no actual argument or backing for your claim, you just scream racist because that is what 90% of the Soros owned media has running as a headline?
Yes, but about Trump, not God.  This is a good first step, along with his Executive Memorandum of President Obama's signing into law, on December 18, 2015, the immigration and visa restrictions from SEVEN countries. Fifty other Muslim majority or controlled countries did NOT make that list.  I am also pleased with ALL of his appointments so far, but Steve Mnuchin's hiring of Craig Phillips to Treasury is not so good. He had given $100,000 in October 2016 to Hillary aligned organizations. Maybe Trump can get him out like he got Sally Yates out.
What I learned at a Madrasa and Islamic Studies (University) external to the U.S..  Accepted Definition of a Muslim, an Islamic Believer that is completely subjugated to Islam.   As for an actual Muslim Islam is All, All Politics,  All Religion, All Laws, All Culture, All History, All Ways of Life, that supersede the politics, religions, laws, cultures, history, ways of life at all other nations, countries.  This is why Muslims cannot assimilate into other Nations, Countries  as Modern Law for Muslims to remain Muslim.  The Minority of Muslims at the U.S. and "Western Nations" do NOT determine what Muslims are or are not, nor do they determine what Islam is or is not, the Majority of 1.8 Billion Muslims Worldwide external to the U.S. and "Western Nations" determine what Islam is or is not, and what a Muslim is or is not.  Mandatory Islamic Tithes, to fund the Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam.  $Trillions a Year, mostly from Rich Oil Muslim Nations.  Really ignorant CriticalReader.
Yo JACK!!! Why don't you tell us what Taqiyya means.  While you're at it, if YOU'RE not practicing taqiyya, tell us who the infidels are. Are you one?  What does the Qu'ran say about infidels?  Now, Jack, remember, I know a little about the Muslims and they worship an Allah who is worshipped as the "Great Deceiver" , so don't lie, in America to tell a lie is bad.   j
ctd...  Legitimate criticism of Islam, Islamic fundamentalism or Islamism should not be called Islamophobia. Or if it is Islamophobia then the word should definitely not be in the motion.  This is where the motion goes wrong and is kind of like a blasphemy law to stop criticism of religion, in this case to stop criticism of Islam. Unacceptable.
Strange: on other boards, I have been censored when I ask proponents of Canada's ridiculously lax immigration policy if they are ready for a Canada of 100 million by 2100 or sooner.  Heaven forbid if you also ask what they think about the ethnic makeup of that population.  I have had comment restrictions placed on me for showing a reasonable model that projects a majority Muslim population in Canada by 2090 at the latest, based on the current increase in Muslims in Canada as a percentage but applying a decline rate to that percentage which would of course happen as the base number increased.  And then along comes Doug Saunders the Globe's leading Muslim apologist, who finally lays bare his agenda with this book, and he is celebrated as some kind of wise soul.  Ironic : Saunders and I see the same demographic future for Canada.  But we see radically different quality of life futures for Canadians when those predictions come to pass.
One would hope that Gary Du is being sarcastic.  In any event the more The Donald speaks the better people understand his temperment and beliefs.  The Donald is the man who spoke glowingly about the myth that U.S. Gen. John Pershing executed Muslim insurgents with bullets dipped in pig’s blood.  One truly wonders if The Donald could even find the Philippines on a map.  There is a term which describes such behavior, fabulist.
No, I don't this so.   The problem with Palestine was that it did not belong to England, or the UN, both of whom had no right to partition anything, let alone Palestine.   And it sought to "accommodate the right of the Jewish people to self-determination and self-government" at the expense of the people already there--Muslim and Christian Palestinians, who formed the vast majority of the existing population. .  Moreover if the partition of India (a British colony) caused such displacement and loss of life, why would anyone think it was a good idea to submit Palestine to the same treatment?  "Colonialism" is exactly what it is about. As for "Euro centric conceit," that describes the founding of the State of Israel quite aptly. It's ironic you should use it against critics of Israeli.  The two-state solution has failed. Let's see whether Israel-Palestine becomes a democracy for all the inhabitants, or continues on the path of treating the Palestinians as untermensch.
And if anyone thinks Hillary won't continue to do the same as Obama or that Trump won't do the same as Obama, they are deluding themselves.    We already know that a President can cancel a Treaty with 60 days notice to Congress; George W did it on SALT.  We already know that the President can exclude any class of alien on any grounds he chooses as Trump has said he will do.  "US Code Section 1182 (f)   Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President   "Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate."  The same US Code also prohibits entry by an immigrant who intends to practice polygamy, as Muslims do.
Thank you Alceste for taking on formerlyrbfromcalgary.   I appreciate that you kept your comments above board when your adversary is blinded, bitter, and tiresome, with a hair trigger.   As a 60 plus year businessperson, having worked in Ontario, BC, Sask, and Alberta, I still am somewhat disappointed by the article, as I feel Mr. Mason did single out Alberta unfairly.  In urban affairs, Alberta is progressive, Calgary has a muslim mayor, and support for social services is very strong here.  I have lived most of my life in Alberta and find most Albertans to be fair, reasonable, and hard working . Unfortunately, many Canadians get their impressions of Albertans from the narrow and very conservative groups who control our media and business groups here in Alberta, and from the occasional bitter person like formerlyrbfromcalgary.  However, there are people like that everywhere.   There is a strong progressive group of Albertans who did elect a NDP govt, knowing what they would get.
I was convicted of possession of a firearm, for taking a photo holding the  firearm with the legal licensed owner of the firearm standing right beside me.  The reason they found me guilty is because my uncle violated his authority to transport (ATT) that firearm when he picked me up to go target practising that day at a local gun club.  Since late 2015, an ATT is no longer required for transporting restricted firearms for certain activities, like attending a shooting range or gun club. My charges were never about me obtaining a firearm without a license, it was about whether a photo was taken under the right set of circumstances. I was arrested and put in jail for 56 days while denied bail even though I had no criminal record.  The accusation of being Arab/Persian, having guns and drugs, having a criminal record and being armed was enough to be automatically arrested.  A subsequent search found no gun evidence, no drug evidence, no criminal record.  Too bad I have a Muslim name I guess
Trump at least had the sense to oppose the Iraq war which was the start of the fire that Obama and Clinton threw a giant barrel of diesel fuel on and turned the Middle East into an even worse mess than it was. Clinton represents the worst of establishment crony politics, and her direct decisions (or indecision) led to the deaths of American diplomats and staff security. She put an unknown number of American secrets out there for a high schooler with a laptop to hack and somehow she's more qualified because Trump "insulted" a Muslim American? The left is suicidal in their commitment to the cause of socialist revolution and the over turning of the free republic. It's so interesting how quickly we forgot lessons of 9/11 and how the left has aligned with political Islam.
THIS - my comment from B4 - had SEVEN likes and ONE dislike, and was BANISHED. Wonder by whom... or what: - This seems to be a case of zealous psychic projection employed as a defense mechanism: I MEAN -- You expelled some acrid flatus but are afraid to be accused of it, so you accuse everyone around you of it preemptively. It's an amazingly effective strategy for better or worse.... Now, I claim these Liberals and even many Muslims themselves, are in fact themselves the most virulently Islamophobic among us... Consider the possibility that the Liberal government is soooooo afraid of Islam in all its incarnations, that they enable these measures to protect themselves? The many Muslims I refer to are soooo afraid of Islam because adherents to that ideology are killing each other big-league. Muslims kill each other at a FRIGHTENING rate. Read:Shia VS. Sunni. But you know what's easier than honest debate on this? Blaming President Trump and every Liberal's favorite word: Racism.
Indeed it is Beans, but I have lost track the number of times I have heard Christians referring to the Old Testament to justify a belief or action. Nor did Christ say his words are to displace previous scripture.  And, of course, there is a major religious group that does not accept the New as scripture). Then again, Christians have spent many centuries persecuting that group despite the generous words of Christ.    Bottom line, what is known as the Old Testament is full of hate and represents source material for Muslim scripture (an Abrahamic religion).
Boasberg has been an unparalleled train wreck as Superintendent. The fact that Boasberg doesn't even live in Denver would speak volumes. Boasberg's stated intentions to bring back forced busing to "racially balance" all of DPS is lunacy of the first-order. Under Boasberg, DPS is openly hostile to Christians. For example, at Denver Green School, Christmas can't be mentioned in any publication. Children are forbidden to sing Christmas Carols or utter the word Christmas. Christians are consigned to the Catacombs under Boasberg's insidious campaign against Christians. Denver Green School is a microcosm of the open hostility towards Christian students in DPS.   Conversely, illegal foreigners are embraced by DPS under Boasberg. At Denver Green School, Kwanzaa is celebrated. Likewise, Jewish and Muslim Holidays are embraced by the faculty and staff. Christmas and Easter are openly disdained. Even a mundane holiday like Halloween is strictly forbotten at Denver Green School. Boasberg's legacy.
FGM is not an Islamic dictated practice but seems to be more of a long African tradition. There does not seem to be much of it in places like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, Pakistan, etc.
It is a shame that the young students are not well organized.  If they were, it would be great if all the Muslim kids dressed up as popes and nuns, all the Christian kids dressed up as Sikhs with turbans, and all the Sikh kids dressed up as bearded Imams and Burka wearers.  And all the teachers and principals could go pound sand.
If Canadians were given the choice of having massive islamic immigration or not, they would choose to not have it.  So would the French ( the majority of whom think Islamic values are incompatible with French values), the Dutch, the Italians, Americans, Hungarians, Poles, Spaniards, Australians, Japanese, Koreans etc..   Since the public has no control over immigration policies which are rapidly changing many of their countries, the public sometimes turns out to vote down things like Muslim cemeteries. The real issue is massive levels of immigration from the Islamic world.
I am looking for any learned opinions on why the left supports radical islam.  One theory is that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, i.e. radical islamists and the left share a distain for the US and what it represents to them. (meaning the USA going back years, quite distinct from the current US President)  Has anyone else seen other theories?
This is a problem because the Europeans dont properly intergrate immigrants into their society. Canada could be a temp plate for Europe. Muslim immigrants feel alienated by the European culture. Canadian model should be used world wide.
So we are going to determine whether a group of people (Muslims) have rights to have their own cemetery based on whether the majority of 47 people living nearby decide in a vote. That is ridiculous. Rights are suppose to be inalienable, not to be decided by democracy.
Just like many other religions over the centuries have had to redefine themselves and defend themselves to prove they were committed to peace after being radicals (includes Christianity), so do the Islamic people now.  And unfortunately, the radical Islam's out there are the cause of it by committing terroristic acts all over the world including America in the name of Allah.  So you have a lot of people understandably scared and nervous.  I do believe that before someone posts something they read, they need to investigate with due diligence the source and information of a story.  I can guarantee that if any American walked around in Iran, Iraq or most any other Country with a majority of Islam people, you would find yourself in deep trouble pretty quick or headless.  Until the radicals are stopped in a majority of the world, people of Islam faith will unfortunately face this kind of action even though they don't deserve it.
I haven't noticed that, but I have noticed that the standard response is to somehow try to invoke antisemitism whenever M 103 is mentioned.  You do realize that jews are not muslims?
Take a look around the world and you will see example after example of no go zones, where only muslims are allowed.  In Toronto last year a disabled man was denied housing in a government housing project because he was not a muslim!
I SUGGEST THAT WE STAY OUT AND LET THEM CLEAN UP THEIR OWN MESS. WE SHOULD BE MORE INTERESTED IN INVESTIGATING THE 36 MUSLIM CAMPS HERE, ESPECIALLY THE 5 JUST ACROSS THE BORDER IN N. VA. AND THE FEMA CAMPS BUILT IN EVERY STATE.  PUBLIC LAW 414, PAGE 2, SECTION 212 PASSED IN 1952, BARS ALL GROUPS SUCH AS ISLAM FROM THIS COUNTRY.  WE ARE NOW IN WORLD WAR 3 WITH THE MUSLIM RACE.
Nothing surprises me about Trudeau's misleading political machinations.  But I must tell you that a Muslim friend of mine owns 8 Horton's franchises.  He chooses to give a 10% seniors' discount on everything sold in his franchises.  He doesn't have to do this and most Horton's do not but he does.  I also point out that the Aga Khan is spiritual leader of the world's 15 million Ismaili (sic) Muslims, the most modern, progressive and adaptable of all Muslim sects.  An Ismaili Muslim couple I know came here from East Africa in the 70s with almost nothing and have worked very hard in a couple or convenience stores they were eventually able to own as well as operate.  Their three kids all have at least one professional degree and are delightful, fully integrated citizens giving back much more than they took out.  Khan's foundation is a lobby group.  JT's free luxury holiday is a clear conflict of interest.  And JT has some unsavory Muslim pals supporting sharia and terrorist groups.  Pity!
"divisive politics" is  leftist code for stifling free speech. It mean that some delicate topics and opinions  are simply too harsh for delicate ears to hear and for delicate persons to engage in.  Muslims calling for the extermination of Jews however is still considered Constitutional   free speech.
Radical Islam like White Supremacist Christianity?  All demanding to be armed to the teeth spouting the 2nd amendment "rights"?  Stay with the topic instead of injecting unrelated issues outside of the intent of the opinion - gun control.  It would have been so much better to have McCain/Palin running the show.
Yeah, we progressives believe that your hero's Muslim ban is unchristian.
The important thing for Canada is not to be there, so get our people out, close the embassy and save Canada the grief and treasury. Shut er down. This Muslim uprising sweeping the Muslim world impacts us Canadians way more than necessary. In my view we must avoid being in Muslim countries, I know we can come up with an improved way to make sure they do not bring their behaviour here and we will not be impacted by this inter/intra faith war. We worked and travelled for  years in Muslim world, but now is the time to stay out of these countries be they Sunni or Shia based, they are not safe. Maybe Canada can ban travel to these countries and if a Canadian feels it necessary to ignore our travel ban, they will be totally responsible for themselves. Our political people are not taking the actions we as Canadians need keep us safe. Sure we line up like sheep at the airport checks, body scans but are these even necessary in Canada or can something better be done.
Canadian author Irshad Manji has also challenged the ideas that seem to produce from orthodox Islam a disproportionate stream of barbaric persons, practices and authoritarian theocratic political movements. Too bad you (understandably) feel the need to mention 'it's not a book about bigotry'. Challenging the hate passages of any religious text and their resultant real world practices has nothing to do with bigotry, quite the reverse really, and we should quit apologizing for having the discussion. (This being wooly headed Canada your  trepidation is understandable.)
In the Friday Feb. 17 issue of my local paper (the Waterloo Region Record) on page A5 was an article in support of M-103.     On the preceding page was an article re: the IS suicide bombing in Pakistan that took 'at least 75' lives and another article re: the car bombing by Islamic State in Baghdad that took 'at least 55' lives.   Sure appears there is absolutely no reason to be critical of Islam, doesn't it?
Christians ignore the Old Testament. They left it behind several centuries ago. Christians have had the Reformation and Enlightenment to drag them out of the primordial muck of antiquity. Muslims have had no such reformation.  Muslims continue to follow the Koran literally.
Large numbers immigrants from Muslim-majority countries started arriving in Sweden in 2004. From 2007 to 2016, the overall numbers of sexual offences reported increased from 12563 to 20284, an increase of 61%.   This is a large increase, and makes your 'this is an outrageous claim' assertion sound pretty silly, as it is certainly possible that the immigrants were responsible for it, at least in part.   While this doesn't prove causation, and Sweden -- and Europe in general -- are very wary of publishing immigrant-related crime statistics, it is an interesting trend.  And you're asserting that this trend is simply a result of changing definitions of rape, and that actual assaults didn't rise, only the reports?    In other words you're saying those women were lying and the police were correct to not believe them? That's funny: I was told this kind of attitude was a symptom of a rape culture.
Two German troublemakers whose theories resulted in millions of deaths and little else in Russia.    Not because of the theories themselves, of course.   Just like Islam today.  Just because of the perversion of their theories by those who use them yo exercise political power over others.
When you read unhinged rants like this: "People who know history and hate racism and fascism need to prepare by obtaining firearms for personal protection and then need to organize a resistance to Trump's future pogroms against Americans of color, Americans of the Muslim faith, and LGBTQ Americans." It becomes much more clear as why Hillary lost when her support comes from such weak minded uninformed individuals.  Lynn I haven't seen the "convincing proof" either, As illegal as hacking is, Democrats want everyone to ignore the context and content of their e-mail exposure. The Anti- Semitic & Christian hate, homophobia, xenophobia, misogynist long with the exploitation of the mentally ill and homeless revealed in their e-mails is beyond any measure of appalling. The Democrat Party is a cancerous wart on the _ _ _ of humanity and IMO no real American should want or wish to be a part of such evil.
Canada has failed Omar Khadr  Canada has failed natives Canada has failed women Canada has failed transexuals Canada has failed LGBTQWERT Canada has failed immigrants Canada has failed refugees Canada has failed Muslims Canada has failed Quebec Canada has failed the poor Canada has failed left handed people  Why bother?  Clearly the world would be better off without Canda since we are so lousy in all things to all people.
Wow, my original post here was deleted for some reason. The comment didn't even warrant the admonition that it didn't meet the G&M's civility standards. I pondered whether the MP who authored M-103 believes in the Western concept of human rights or the Islamic concept, the latter being embodied in Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam. There's a good opinion piece in today's Toronto Star, 'Muslim majority needs to become more vocal,' apparently authored by a Muslim, that expresses concerns similar to mine. In discussing the growing rift between majority and Muslim populations in the West the Star article notes that "[there is a] lack of acknowledgment [by Muslims] of the values and expectations of a secular and pluralistic society." Bill Maher has said essentially the same thing. But the G&M apparently believes we can't ask our politicians where they stand on such matters.   https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/02/17/muslim-majority-needs-to-become-more-vocal.html
While the circumstances here are unfortunate- and any threats of any kind against Jones and his family reprehensible it is true in the end most all of us wind up having to explain our religious beliefs or lack thereof. Given the state of the world it is not surprising that Muslims find themselves having to explain that they do not adhere to the Wahhabi, Salafist  brands of Islam that continue to spread hate , fear and backwardness throughout the world.
Despite all the memes and Chicken Little-ing, the US is still the place to go... If Canada really had anything substantial to offer over our neighbours to the south OR if Trumplandia were half as bad as people pretend, we'd have been seeing massive imports already but we are not.  Heck, once all of the (not really a-)Muslim ban ballyhoo is settled, those same people crying about their "torn apart families" and "living in constant fear of what tomorrow will bring" will happily ease back into their American apartments/houses and count their Greenbacks having never once considered Canada for anything but a punchline to a faux protest slogan.
"You have a better chance in the US of being killed by a toddler with a gun or by a mass shooter than you do of getting killed by a terrorist."   Unfortunately not true in Europe, Asia, Africa, Middle East. For example in UK, France, Belgium, Sweden, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Egypt ......you have a better chance of being killed by an Islamic State terrorist than a toddler with a gun
Look how many comments. Hundreds people murdered in Congo-no comments,thousandth Muslims murdered in Burma-no comments,dozenth in Pakistan -no comments and list is endless,Mention Israel and non stop comments.
There's a great article my an ex-white supremacist, neo-Nazi guy who explains how those guys tend to be the same kind of guys who join ISIS. Hint, it is not generally people who grew up as devout Muslims who support ISIS, it is people who end up as misfits and petty criminals before flipping tracks.
Perhaps a "new start" might be a welcome opportunity thanks to Trump .....  An unintended consequence  .-) ... and opportunity !  NATO as representing an artifact of the Cold War may be judged obsolete in the context of the current and ongoing ME instability and terrorist threat. The latter applicable, by the way - to Putin's Russia, ditto China - both of which have significant Muslim minorities.  Perhaps now is the time for the EU ( et al ) to reconsider their true interests, which would indicate raprochement with the East, the former USSR. Putin is no Stalin and neither Russia nor China are Communist. Both face gut wrenching political transitions from brutal socialist dictatorships towards free capitalist markets and democratic institutions. It will take generations, and western sanctions and adversarial media do not serve any constructive purpose.  Sadly Trump represents the worst of what is known as " The Ugly American ". And consider what their policies have achieved in the ME ...
Trump should learn to control his impulsive, often improper & inconsiderate spontaneity, to take deep breath before taking the bait, maybe even listen to trusted advisors.       But his Nationalistic views are far from racist - not even close.     We should all push for controlled borders, careful scrutiny of all immigrants, especially muslims -read the koran with its dozens of passages of how to abuse, kill or convert all who are not muslims -, we should discontinue providing free military protection to countries except the USA, we should insist that trade agreements benefit primarily the USA - because that means all of us US citizens.  And we should take serious measures to demand that each person take responsibility for themselves, rather than depend on government to do so.
i would say this. few in the west know much about islam. so before you go embracing, or condemning, why don't you study history? because until you know what you are talking about, you should be quiet.
"The only extremist here is Alceste, the guy perpetuating the advancement of Islam and all other communist leftist ideals."  Hello?  Where is your evidence that Alceste busies himself perpetuating the advancement of Islam? And what does that even mean, the advancement of Islam? Do you mean Shariah law? Given the frequency with which Alceste invokes the Charter, it would appear doubtful he would embrace a religious government model for Canada.  And how is it "extremist" in Canada to advance leftist ideas? You realize, yes, that hardened leftists are in the NDP, in the labour unions, at the Toronto Star, in the ranks of the Communist Party of Canada which runs candidates in every election, in academia, in the Council of Canadians, and among Canada's book writers?  Look, I'm not saying I AGREE with their policy preferences, but to call them "extremist"? I don't buy that. It reduces the word "extremist" to meaninglessness.  Alceste is no more "extremist" than Naomi Klein or Maude Barlow.
This was not an anti-Trump rally.  I did not attend because I was protesting Trump's presidency.  I understand how democracy works.  I marched so this current administration recognizes that millions of Americans care about the rights of women, immigrants, disabled, people of color, muslims, the educationally and economically disadvantaged and LGBTQ+.
If you truly want to respect history, you must acknowledge 1) The land is and always was Israel's 2) Any Islamic presence in East Jerusalem, or anywhere in Israel is nothing more that a concerted indignation towards the Jews and the continued intent to wipe out the Jewish population 3) The Israelite ancestors are indigenous to the region, and their descendants deserve every right to claim land there.       If any of that can't be understood, then two state solutions are an impossibility and war is imminent.  Moving the capital to Jerusalem will only start whats going to happen anyway.  May as well get it over with.
What about barbecuing pork with muslim or Jewish neighbors?  What about going topless?  What about listening to music?  What about  praying?  What about [insert topic here]?
I have watched her in debates. I am not convinced she has the answers to complex issues. I read Irshad Manji's books, and realized that a Muslim person writing books criticizing Islam would be a huge enabling tool to the non Muslims who are prejudiced. It gives them a cover against the charge of prejudices (see, even a Muslim person says Islam is flawed..).   The more interesting book to read is the one that Muslims respect. If you want to truly understand the issue. I have lived in 4 Muslim countries, and don't want a superficial understanding of a complicated issue.
I wonder if this has anything to do with that wonderful Islamic religion?
Layla The  west took over land in Palestine post WW2. And continues to take over land. And invaded Muslim countries, Iraq being especially noteworthy. Retaliation is to be expected, right or wrong. Understandable.
This is an unjust law. Any law that is unjust doesn't make it thru legislation. Instead of trying to change immigration law, which likely will not change, Denver is sidestepping with changes to local law that will circumvent federal law. Colorado owes no resources to enforce federal law, so don't use that as a point of argument. What they are doing is changing law to directly deflect the federal government from doing theirs. This is equal to judges block of presidents travel ban. Only Because Trump Indicated Muslim Country in prevoius discussion, Judge blocks every attempt. Because Hancock first proposed to help immigrants, he can't change that this is the reason he moved to change the laws. This is just another social handout provided by your democratic officials.
As fighting raged in Europe Fall of 1944 Comrade Stalin issued a decree that all Germans be expelled from designated areas: East Prussia, Memeland (Lithuania), Silesia, Sudentland (Czech), Hungary, Romania. Total expelled close to 17 million. This solved the German minority crisis which was the cause of WW2. Germans lost 25% of their territory. Germany has become the most peaceful nation in the world. Regarding the Moslem crisis in Europe expel them to the middle east and do a population exchange of Christians in Syria, Pakistan etc and this will settle the problems of terrorism and utter chaos. Both parties would benefit from this.
"While terrorist attacks are surely frightening and shake our belief in our own safety, they are, in fact, responsible for very few deaths. That is how terrorism works – it terrorizes through its randomness. In the past few years, common household items, such as ATVs, have killed more Americans annually than terrorists. A restriction or ban on small household appliances would make us safer."  So everyone getting hysterical about the attack in Quebec City should calm down, it doesn't mean Muslims are "under attack" by "white males"? I agree!  As for your Egyptian grandmother, she came here a long time ago, and I am sure was grateful to be here and encouraged you to integrate and mingle with Canadians, not feel aggrieved that Canadian society wasn't Muslim enough. She would have passed my test for Canadian values.
Good column. My Canada includes welcoming Muslims to be part of it.
I agree with you almost completely, except to add that moderate muslims are up against a formidable foe.  Therefore, we need to support them in this endeavour to weed out the people in their own communities who are suppressing them.  Ironically, many muslim "small l liberals" will tell you (privately), that liberals in the west have aligned themselves with the very radicals from which these moderates tried to escape when they left their home countries for Canada.
Isn't Islam great!  Not even Moslems are safe from it.
So Pocho, what are you most impressed with the Donald at this time?  I love the fact that he has cancelled obama care and has given us the best medical care imaginable.  lol  I love the fact that he is buiding a 50 ft wall along the southern border to keep those pinkos/Muslims out.  I am just constantly amazed at all he has accomplished.  lol  Keep up the good work Donald.    Now if you would only release your tax returns like you said you would.   Come on Donald, no one cares you sent tons of money off to Russia.
If a white non-christian goes into a church and shoots the parishioners,what do we call him ? Chances are this would be referred to as a hate crime as it was an attack against a religion, and the shooter would simply be labelled as mentally unstable. A person goes into a mosque and shoots Muslims, and our politicians label this as a terrorist act. Why?
Islam is not the blame for the problems that exist. It is those who join partners with God, the extremist element that had kidnapped the Faith and used it for their own selfish purpose. The Black Flag was flown more than a century ago, so their use of the Black Flag is a lie. There are thousands of Muslim Canadians who live good honourable lives and contribute to the betterment of Canada. Do not demonize anyone in Canada.
I'm thinking the Muslim group that was denied their cemetery will be taking the Saint-Apollinaire council to court citing the Charter,M-103,bigotry,xenophobia,racism,Islamophobia,etc and JT will be standing there with a chequebook and pen asking them how much they need to make them feel better.Let's see,$10.5 million,sorry,too recent.$35 million,sorry,work in progress.Let's split the difference $22.5 million,yeah,that should do it.And JT will then inform us at the press conference that it's "what Canadians want."
I'm happy to see more light shed on the exploitation of Africa (read:Barrick / Coltan etc...)   However, to bring up white Christian's colonization and slavery and to throw the Portuguese in there without mentioning some of the other key whitefolk, AND, to not mention the centuries long Muslim slavetraders aspect in Africa, is once again tarring one religion and culture while whitewashing another.  White Christians are not the only peoples who have to answer for stuff....
Barry Hussein Obama Muslim MonkeyMan will not be happy when he learns that EPA can't seize my house bc I have a puddle in my front yard
Just for one little fact,  what about the way women are perceived in Islam?
Halloween and winter sports aside, face coverings are generally regarded as disguises in western culture. This idea is deeply ingrained in most human societies and predates the influx of Muslims into Europe and North America. In most cases, disguises are associated with some sort of wrongdoing. People who insisted on wearing ski masks indoors, or in the summer, would likely be regarded with distrust and hostility also, whatever their reasons and whether or not they intended any harm. I don't know the answer to this difficult question, but accusing everyone opposed to niquabs or burkhas of being a bigot is not helpful or true.
Nice try- do you not grow tired to defend the indefensible ? - South Sudan is indeed Christian - and it has been persecuted by the northern Islamists for decades - "The Sudanese  civil war culminates a long history in which the North has tried to spread its religion and language to the South, which has resisted these efforts. The introduction of Islam in the seventh century , primarily by traders, then led to descent groups in Sudan tracing their genealogy back to Arabia; in the case of politically or religiously prominent families, they claim to have roots going back to the Prophet Muhammad himself. Islamization set in motion a process of gradual decline for Christianity in northern Sudan, culminating in the overthrow of the Christian kingdoms in 1504 by an alliance of Arabs and the Muslim kingdom of Funj. In due course, Islam and Arabic gained hold in the North and overshadowed and displaced  the indigenous and Christian cultures. " - Islam = war , oppression and discord
and then there is: "Al-taqiyya: Muslims lie when it is in their interest to do so and “Allah” will not hold them accountable for lying when it is beneficial to the cause of Islam. They can lie without any guilt or fear of accountability or retribution. A lie in the defense of Islam is approved even applauded in their “holy” books." (muslim fact). Another difference between the scriptures. As for my sins: as Paul said "I am the worst of them".  the issue, mr. M, is that our faiths have nothing in common, we do not worship the same god, and the only possible connection is in a claim  to 'abraham'. thereafter they part. my only interest is that people educate themselves and come to this truth. (By the way God is very clear that divorce is something He hates, and forbids all sexual immorality, including the taking of more than one wife.)
Yes.  Though some stereotype us as 'holocaust deniers' thanks to a few vocal idiots among us, neither I nor the Muslims I know deny the reality of the Third Reich's mass-murder of European Ashkenaziim.  Indeed, there are Bosnian Muslims in the US whose relatives were dragged to the camps and the ovens on the orders of Hitler himself, because they dared hide Jews from the Nazis and their Croat allies.  The minority of my 'co-religionists' buying into this falsehood should realize continuing to endorse it is against our interests because it merely encourages those itching to repeat this atrocity to 'putsch' further toward their hateful dreams, but with Muslims being loaded into the cattle-cars to camps with "Christ will set you free" banners over the entrances this time.  One can publicly revile Muslims today in ways that are no longer 'fashionable' if applied to Jews.  Just words, right?  That's how the Nazis started.  Then they progressed to eggs, then fists, then rocks, then bullets.
Do you have a better understanding than  Ayaan Hirsi Ali she lived in Muslim countries too.    Going back to your previous comment "The more interesting book to read is the one that Muslims respect.", which books would those be?  I'd be interested in reading those books as well, I'm looking to broaden my knowledge in this area and I'm looking for your input.
So in other words, extreme Islamists are causing hunger because the groups causing the fighting in the affected countries are Islamists.  The Sri Lanka example is interesting because its government was once fighting the Tamil Tigers and could have been in the same situation as the countries Doug mentions.  I don't know how the Tamil Tigers were tamed, but maybe it's an example for other countries to follow.
Since the ban on Muslims was imposed some 300,000 Muslims from other countries have entered the US. Don't hear much about that in the mains stream liberal news media.  For  99% of all  Muslim travelers its just business as usual.  But I as a gay man would be denied entry to Saudi Arabia if they knew.
Liberals continue buying Muslim votes.  Paying compensation to a terrorist and enemy fighter, who killed fellow Americans, cannot be justified by any non-political court. Considering, that he is a citizen of Afganistan and that the war he fought was in Afganistan, there was no reason for Canada to intervene on his behalf - Afgani authorities had to deal with him.   That was wrong for Trudeau to do. Any of his selfies with Khadr will not look good.
The author of this piece has to admit that Islam's coverage in the media over the past decade or two sure hasn't been very favourable to his/her belief system - both in theory and in practice. This is the huge elephant in the room which cannot be ignored or glossed over.   There are so many negative facts, incidents, attacks, and issues - far too many incredibly disturbing to the western mind - that it's not even worth beginning to list them here. That said, what has clearly worked against Muslims in Canada are attempts to implement Sharia Law in this country, plus Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party's efforts to treat Islam as some sort of extra special religion in Canada with their M-103 motion.  M-103 really was the straw that broke the camel's back infuriating almost all Canadians. Trudeau and his Liberals really didn't do Muslim Canadians any favours with M-103 - from what I've seen and read, moderate Muslim Canadians were as opposed to M-103 as the average non-Muslim Canadian.
1 to 1.25 Million Europeans were enslaved by the Barbary Pirates; whole communities along the Mediterranean coast were emptied out. The entire town of Baltimore in Ireland was enslaved in one night. How did it all stop? The US Marine Corp that's who. Oh yeah and who stopped the Nazi's from completing the final solution? Other Europeans/Russian/Americans/Canadians/Indians that's who. Who stopped the Armenian Genocide? Um ....no one. To this day have Muslims (Turks) admitted to the crime? No. When the Bosnian Genocide was in full swing, who eventually stopped it? NATO. Darfur? Black Africans rounded up and slaughtered by Muslims. See a pattern here?
No, just a ban on a lot of Muslims -- Muslims from countries where The Donald does not have business relationships.
Yeah, go ahead and shuffle the deck so that everyone in Cabinet is a bigger and tougher bully than dTrump0....that;s the ticket to success in this decadent decade. While Junior is at it why not shuffle off to Muslim-land along with your buddy in the Bahamas.....permanently...it would be doing Canada and true Canadians a favor!
I can't help but wonder: if it had been a white student who had made some comment about "Muslim fragility," would Khan have been supportive of  the argument that criticizing this student would have infringed on the student's free speech and identity? Probably not.
Your comment is extremely naive, and such generalizations are both ignorant and dangerous.  Islam does not promote any of the things you listed.  Yes, there are extremists who do, as there are in every single religion in the world.  However, the vast majority of the 1 Bn+ Muslims do not believe or follow any of this nonsense.  For Trump to impose blanket bans, as he has, based on religion is unconstitutional and flies in the face of every value America claims to be propagating to the world.  How can a country who claims to be bringing democracy and freedom to countries turn around and discriminate the very people it has just "liberated"?
But what about the Quran and its exhortation to destroy all infidels?
The only thing your posts prove yourself to be more ignorant of than black communities is Islam.  Not surprising you grouped 'em together in this one (above).
This is a denunciation of Erdogan, not of Turkey, not of Turkish citizens, not of Muslims. It's not all one and the same.
I bet that's not the case. How could you even presume to have a clue? It is possible your comment stems from anti-Muslim bias? Say it ain't so!
"particular religious faiths"? Doesn't that sound like you're trying to say Islam without actually saying it?  There is a huge difference between what usee to happen with Christianity when it was presented as essentially a state sponsored religion and what is happening by allowing Muslim students to use an empty classroom one day a week.   I have yet to see evidence that the parents and imams expect the school to enforce that Muslim students to attend prayers. Unlesss you can support that I suspect you're reading more into this than is really there.  The Israel and Indonesia examples are interesting but I don't see how that has anything to do with Canada unless you're suggesting we close schools at 1pm on Fridays. But at least you acknowledge that other religions have prayer times that don't match the Christian ones. Given that schools do not close at 1pm your assertion that this isn't such a big deal is so insesnsituve it verges on blatant ignorance of the situation.
M-103 is only intended to create the need for new laws to protect Islam. What ever they study about Islamophobia, it  will be used as a pretext to implement draconian laws against anybody with alternate opinions about Islam. . It may even have a recommendations for Sharia law as the only viable solution to the egregious sufferings of Muslims in Canada. M103 is only a tool to wring concessions and privileges out of the rest of society, to build a separate and unaccountable Islamic power within Canada.
From today's Globe: Muslim extremists abducted a Catholic priest and more than a dozen churchgoers while laying siege to a southern Philippine city overnight, burning buildings, ambushing soldiers and hoisting flags of the Islamic State group, officials said Wednesday.  Clearly, there is a problem with islam extremism and the world needs to come to its senses. Ibbitson is out of touch.
Religious studies but not religious practice.  Good idea. Christians and Jews  can agree with that.  But, no Muslim parent would ever permit  their kids learn passages from the Bible or listen to a guest Rabi explain  the Torah.  That could lead to apostasy,  the worst sin in Islam.
How welcoming would Mexico be if 250,000 displaced Muslims from Syria washed up on their sunny shores and immediately demanded subsidized  housing, health care and welfare?  Say what you like about how disgusted you are with us Canadians, but  I tell you straight out as a nation we are better than Mexico.
There are 50 Muslim countries, and you can't treat them all in a similar fashion. I suspect that you haven't lived in a single Muslim country, but I could be wrong.  Here is a fact - the oldest Christian communities in the world are in Muslim countries like Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Palestinian Territories, etc. There isn't a single ancient Muslim community in a Christian country (there used to be in Spain, Portugal and Italy) because every one of them was killed, converted or forced to flee.
I would bet Trump will back off from this. He is like kid playing fire without understanding consequence. It will be more severe than Mexico pays for wall or Muslim registration, it is real money, huge amount of money.
No, this is Justin Trudeau's dream. He gets to open Canada's borders again to Muslim refugees. . It will look like he is compassionate for all the poor suffering people often earth, even if all that suffering is completely avoidable.  Be prepared to be scolded by Ralph Goodale about how just awful we are to even question another million Muslims beating our immigration system.
The Southern Poverty Law Center documents 1,094 bias-related incidents from November 9 through December 16, 2016.  The incidents include, in descending order of frequency, anti-immigrant, anti-black, anti-Muslim, anti-LGBT, Swastika, white nationalist fliers, anti-woman, anti-Semitic, anti-Trump, KKK.  The report also lists a dozen reports of bias-related incidents that were likely false reports.  The report is here: https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/12/16/update-1094-bias-related-incidents-month-following-election
When you can show me how something you drop falls up rather than down, I will be happy to have a conversation about the reality of natural law. Until then ....  That most other Americans - Christian, Jewish, and Muslim - believe homosexual behavior is immoral behavior is a demonstrable fact. The majority of Americans say to you and those who share opinion on "it makes it difficult to raise children who are morally straight" and "it weakens the family as the cornerstone of society", "So what?"  At the end of the day every law, including the Constitution, is a matter for a majority decision.  Sufficient arrogance can lead to a practical demonstration of that reality, as the last election did.
Thanks America for making the middle east and Muslim countries unsafe to visit.     Is that better?
Trump is explicitly banning refugees from Muslim countries  as of now with an executive order Christians are officially preferred. It is now official U.S.  Government Policy. So it is much more than a strategy of differentiation in the political marketplace as you have claimed.   http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/us-politics/donald-trump-refugees-syria-executive-order/article33809191/ This one inconvenient fact (among others) undermines your entire Trump apologist argument and strengthens that of the article.
I think it is more than fair to say that the Muslim communities are appalled and disgusted and even fearful by what happened.  Maybe the media just don't give them the same coverage to be heard.
Nonsense. I know lots of Muslims in Canada, in China, in Japan, in the United States, and other countries whom I have met in my 287,000 kilometers of travel in the last 20 years.  You should distinguish between Islamic extremists and those who are good people. Just like in Canada. People are good and people are bad. I'm a good person. What are you?
"Anecdotal evidence suggests..."  No it doesn't.  It suggests that you're just making things up because you don't have any *actual* evidence for these claims.  It's not clear that when Bannon said "platform for the alt-right" he was referring to the specific subset of white nationalists.  There is no indication that Bannon himself is a white nationalist.  A more accurate term would be American nationalist.  Anti-immigration, anti-PC, anti-Muslim, pro-Jingoism.   If this is racism then it's a specific *kind* of racism that was mainstreamed after 9/11 and describes the views of at least half the people in this country.    People respond by saying that Islam is not a race and therefore it's not racism.  But it's no coincidence that we're bombing the crap out of a certain region and that this kind of foreign policy probably would not be tolerated if we were bombing all the terrorists in Ireland or some Eastern European country.  It's only acceptable because Muslims are "others."
M-103 has been very enlightening. Even more clearly than did the murders in Quebec, it's revealed the degree of Islamophobia in Canada. Richard Roskell ----------------- ask why Islamophobia and not Sikh-phobia,  Hindu - phobia? Buddhist phobia?  what is the Root cause?  Could it be something to do with lack of integration, assimilation, too much accommodation?  it is not so one sided
The author has not been paying attention. Racial slurs directed at people of colour are now forbidden. Not so racial slurs against whites; they are now all the rage. So too slurs against Jews in their Homeland, which are very popular among leftists and Muslims. Slurs against "infidels" by Muslims are widespread, not least in mosques. The author has missed the new, good, postcolonial racism that is all the rage at universities and generally on the left.
I agree on most point. Buty this gy and his cult follower are not considered Muslims by many.
The story lists victims from many countries but omitted to mention Israeli citizen  Lian  Zaher Nasser, a nineteen year old girl of Arab origin, who was repatriated home by the Israeli government.  http://www.timesofisrael.com/thousands-attend-funeral-of-israeli-girl-slain-in-istanbul-shooting/  "A large number of women and young girls came to the funeral to express their solidarity with Nasser after criticism was heard from religious circles that the victims, including Nasser and her friends, went against Muslim tradition by being in a nightclub and celebrating the secular New Year, according to Haaretz.  Tira resident Dr. Ala’a Abdulahi, who was also in the nightclub at the time of the shooting, told Haaretz that “this attempted slander is another murder of Lian,” while adding that “we arrived in Istanbul as independent young women and it is our right to celebrate the New Year’s in a well known and exclusive club, and whoever this does not fit can go and break their head.”"
Thomas Dye, your  "At a December 2015 rally in Charleston, South Carolina. etc."  is a fabrication is it not? There is no mention of a rally in Charleston, South Carolina in the Challenge is it not?  Otherwise, show me the number among "Campaign Promises" where the words "rally in Charleston, South Carolina" appears in the Challenge.  Nevertheless, No. 38 refers to December 7, 2015 and tells of a "press release" concerning  "complete and total shutdown".  And yes, you are correct in saying that "complete and total shutdown" means "All"  But No, that is irrelevant and meaningless even if it means "all"   For the matter under discussion is my claim that the word "all muslims" does not appear in the Challenge.  And John Kawamoto made a verbatim quote saying  "I believed candidate Trump when he said ** he would ban ALL Muslims from entering the US"**   The New Travel Ban does not ban All Muslims.
This article is an example how idealism makes us vulnerable to romantic primitivism. A psychological vulnerability that causes us to vilify everything modern and progressive while romanticizing everything primitive and barbaric. We are conditioned into this flawed form of reasoning by prenatal experiences of floating in our mother's amniotic fluid. It is the cause behind Garden of Eden myths every ideology has.  Israel is a modern secular state. Human rights are evident in Israel. Women enjoy relatively equal rights. Gays have parades. Muslims can live there and publicly engage in dissent. It is the Enlightenment's foothold in the Middle East.   The West Bank and Gaza are Islamic terrorist territories . Women are murdered for not being obedient . Gays are thrown to their deaths off  buildings. Dissenters are murdered and hung from light posts. Yet Mr. Kaplan, and those sharing his political ideology, see Israel as the oppressor and Palestinians as the victims.
@S.K. ALI & her friends Freedom of Expression in this case means that I have the right to "criticize", to ‘interrogate', to 'condemn' all religions and without "infantilized", "discredit" them as far. There is a person in sick brain in your entourage  unless that person to the sick brain is you in your entourage Fatima Houda-Pepin/ Jeudi, 27 octobre 2016; «…Because they predate the birth of Islam, these clothes (chador, burqa and niqab) are NOT religious symbols, but signs of the enslavement of women...( )...man-woman equality is a legacy of the “Quiet Revolution”. Today, we'll give in on it?... »
Don't forget about the 1990's that anti-abortion killed the Conservatives. Even the debate with the Rohingya showed that the Conservatives may champion that group but is showing definite weakness on women's rights and the rights of Muslims.
"failed to provide a valid reason for keeping people from six mostly Muslim nations from coming to the country"???  Jan. 30,2017 (CNN)'The seven Muslim-majority countries targeted in President Trump's executive order on immigration were initially identified as "countries of concern" under the Obama administration.'
What a way to combat Islamic terrorism.  Humiliate and insult the Muslim people again and again.
apparently you have not read the koran
If Trump's intention was to block all Muslims from entering the US, why then did he leave over 90 Muslim majority nations off his list?  Is it not possible that these 6 countries either cannot or will not provide enough information to properly vet their people?  Watson's order is not based on what is written in the EO. Any other president could have issued the same exact order without any legal challenge whatsoever. If you ask me it's Watson who is discriminating in this case, not Trump.
"Regardless of your faith"??? - Justin Trudeau  HAHA!!  Then why did it take so long for him to accept Yarzidi people as refugees? The Conservatives had to twist his arm to let them in. Trudeau clearly favored Muslims over other refugees.   Also a Liberal MP is trying to make criticizing Islam illegal in Canada (a blasphemy law). Look up m103 .
I can tell you who will be next.  After they take away rights from transgenders, it will be the gay community.  An assault on the rights of the Moslem community is also likely.  There are large numbers of Americans who are uncomfortable with minorities of any kind.  There was in fact a time not long ago when these people would discriminate against anyone who wasn't white, male and Protestant.    Trying to roll back the clock to a time when minorities were not acknowledged or even welcomed is all part and parcel of the GOP agenda.
On April 9, 2017 you should attend join ‘Muslims Against M103’ to protest the infiltration of the Muslim Brotherhood and Jamaat-e-Islami agenda in Canada’s highest corridors of power, the House of Commons. (event location linked below)  Moderate Muslims Tarek Fatah, Tahir Gora, Asif Javaid, Shaan Taseer, Salim Mansur  in 2011 and in 2017 state serious issues.   Do you support Sharia Law? Please review your Sharia Law article from 2004 sourced below.  2011 Muslim Canadian survey indicated empathy for Hezbollah & Hamas. 2011 study: "conducted by the MacDonald Laurier Institute, found 65% of Muslims questioned said they would “repudiate absolutely” the terrorist organization, while 35% would not do so. 2011 "62% of Muslims supported Sharia Law."  sources: http://tarekfatah.com/canadian-muslims-protest-motion-m103/ http://www.torontosun.com/2011/11/01/strong-support-for-shariah-in-can http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/life-under-sharia-in-canada/article743980/
I believe Lee is to be admired for his effort to unite the country after he lost. Also, his statements against displays that kept wounds from healing. And I'm fine with museums, history books, etc. And I'm always glad to hear of people such as you, who believe blacks should have equal opportunities as fellow citizens.  I wasn't born a person of color, I'm not Jewish, I'm not Muslim, and I'm heterosexual --none of this by choice; it's just the way it is. In short, I don't face their challenges.   With this understanding, and also after spending time with coworkers and friends who do face discrimination, it hurts me to see their hurt when they share some of their experiences. And some of it is darn ugly for no other reason than people judging them based not in fact, but on bigotry.
" A strident group of anti-Muslim activists have been waging a noisy campaign to end Muslim prayer at schools in a big district near Toronto"  Aren't secular schools suppose to be secular, non-religious?  Christian prayers were banned from Public School Boards because they would violate the secular nature of Public Boards.  Why the exception for Muslims?  Why does equality for all become, somehow, anti-Muslim?  Everyone is equal except some are more equal than others?
False perceptions? Quite often it's just common sense.   If you're going through security a lot of us would feel unsafe were women in niqabs  allowed to go through without removing face covering. I think a lot of women who identify as feminists are concerned about the adoption of niqabs, burkhas and to a lesser extent hijabs. The reasons for adopting such dress (when male muslims do not) is contentious. Obviously sometimes it is forced on the women by male relatives but in many other cases it is embraced by the women themselves and one has to ask why. It is not required by the Quaran -  so why is it adopted  - and outside Saudi Arabia it has only become common in the past 3-4 decades. Is it to to advertise the fact that the person is a muslim and is different from kuffar?  If so then obviously it attracts attention and it is hardly surprising that people notice the difference.
Here, lets just sum up the posts by our left wing posting friends before they start hitting the censor button...  Fundamental Christianity=  bad.  Fundamental Islam = good.   As it happens, also the sum total of M-103.
The only troll is Amira herself, trolling for Islam and for western civilization's submission to the Koran. Her hijab is the sign she handed her fate to Allah.  Giving up free will is just one thing Muslims ar expected to sacrifice for their religion. Inshallah .  8
We work and live and go to public businesses every day with people and we don't necessarily know their citizenship status or sexual orientation or gender identity but a story on someone makes their identity up for discussion. In the current climate, we have a presidential candidate who calls for deportation of Mexicans, banning Muslims, and that has emboldened many, including some ADN readers, to question Arriaga's immigration status, whether she is following the law, and whether she can vote. We have no legal civil rights protections for LGBTQIA people in our state. Even if a person is "out" or "open" about their identity, to write a story about that identity can subject people to a range of ills from antagonistic comments to eviction, wrongful termination, and being turned out of businesses. I just think writers should be mindful of that.
It's not that Muslims don't speak out, they do, and they are key allies in the fight to stop homegrown radicals.  The problem is that the media mentions it only in passing (if at all) and the 'misguided angry people' are misguided by the right-wing echo chamber which informs their beliefs.
You're making my point for me. You don't hear about it when Muslims condemn the violence any more than you hear it when Christians condemn the violence. The Norway terrorist attack was in 2011.  Why should the Muslim community claim nutjob extremists "as one of their own" any more than the Christian community would claim a crazed killer as one of theirs?
You cite facts, G & A, and remark on religiously motivated intolerance, thus siding with an oppressed minority. These aren't the kinds of Muslim-related remarks people object to. It's the ones designed not to side with struggling persons but to demonize a group using weak arguments in order to create a new class of struggling persons, i.e. law-abiding Muslims in Canada.
While not naming any country, Francis appeared to refer to anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim attitudes that surfaced during the U.S. campaign and since the election. The U.S. Justice Department said on Friday it was investigating reports of intimidation and harassment in schools, churches and elsewhere since the election.  Pope Francis speaks as he leads a consistory ceremony to install 17 new cardinals in Saint Peter's Basilica at the Vatican November 19, 2016.  REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini One of the new cardinals, Archbishop Blase Cupich of Chicago, told Reuters the pope was "very much aware of the fact that if that (animosity) is not checked, it is very contagious and it can spread quickly, it can be like a wildfire". Section 2 Reuters today
"activist radical Muslims" is no different than "activist radical Christians" ... with about the same percentage of radicals within each. The radicals do not define a religion ... they are radicals, no matter their religious "cover".
Sanctimonious, I agree that most of the people posting in this article - which happens to be for subscribers only - are decent people.  Sadly, that's too often not the case on articles open to non-payers.    As the Globe says at the top of the page: "Articles on certain subjects, unfortunately, attract a high number of offensive and abusive comments."  Anything about islam is on that category, but it's not the only one.
Nowadays whenever I see a "Muslim Accommodation/Tribulation/m103" story in the Globe, Judy Collins' tune - "Send in the Clowns" begins playing in my head. And I don't refer to the muslims as the clowns here, so Justice League do holster your hair-trigger [d e l e t e] fingers...  I do refer to a nice swath of the typically 200+ comments that these stories generate. But, keep it coming lads, God Bless Debate! (Open Debate shall save Us)
Maybe we should consider "Is Turkey a reliable ally? Do we need another Iranian (the only nation operating F-14's since 1976 beside U.S.Navy) Islamic Republic as long as the possibility of a Turkish Islamic Revolution almost looks like a certainty (turning it to the only Islamic State with F-35 stealth attack/fighters)?
And just out of curiosity, how is he going to vet "real" persecuted Christians from those of the Muslim faith?  Take a lie detector test?
"proposing that muslim women could not wear religious garb as a lesser public forum.."  You are missing the point. Objecting to the niqab isn't because it is "religious garb", it is because it is the most extreme form of erasure of women from social space, something anyone who claims to care about the status of women in society should oppose.  Sikhism, BTW, is a very egalitarian religion, founded in reaction to  Islam's treatment of women, and Hinduism's caste system. It actually explicitly forbids the face veil as demeaning to women.
Wow  Don't suppose that the fact that the guy only got to the poor Muslim women who endure the abuse of the male muslumers every minute of their totally male controlled lives after unloading on other passengers first makes a difference. Yes it only because headline worthy because it provides a great opportunity for trump bashing. The guy probably voted for Hillary.
In Tennessee and Kentucky, Muslim teachers began teaching Islam in class,without any notice or permission. School kids were expected to recite the shahada oath of conversion, and to write it in their lesson books, as a school assignment.  They had Muslim prayer sessions in class and girls had to wear hijabs as part of their "diversity" education.  It was discovered when a parent checked the child's  homework. and reported it. Parents were denounced as  Islamophobic for being opposed to it.  It has  happened in school across the US. but it doesn't get any national news coverage.
In any urban centre in Germany after the sun goes down, you will see how wrong your assumption is. The under 30s still in the streets are mainly non European and Muslim. Population replacement is no accident.
The "title" of the article is wrong, misleading and misrepresenting. The largest democracy of the globe with over 1.3 billion population has people from various religions, cultures who speak over 100 languages. It has roughly 18% Muslims and this practice of divorce was only prevalent in followers of that religion and also in a small proportion. Therefore categorizing women of the entire nation suffering from this barbaric practice is totally incorrect. Western media and specially reputed mediums of press should be more responsible before making misleading title headings such as this one. Great judgement by Indian Supreme Court not falling for religions pressure, time for western media and courts to rise up applaud this.
All religions start out closely reflecting the views of their founders, but as time goes by that may change. For any religion that's been around long enough, it's inevitable.  As a Christian, I do not consider religions interchangeable. While I respect the sacred literature of other religions, I consider the Bible the inspired Word of God in a way that I don't believe the others to be.   But I also acknowledge that my religious tradition has been subject to the same abuses as other religions. Thankfully, we no longer burn people at the stake and engage in holy wars, which I see as evidence of our maturity as a people of faith.  Keep in mind that Islam, as a belief system, is younger than Christianity and prevalent in lands that are less developed. Also keep in mind that there are places on this planet where Muslims, Christians and Jews live side by side in peace, which is -- by far -- what most people on the planet, no matter their religion, desire.
Do you guys even realize that when ever you say something against Muslims, and that they are evil, bad, and should remove them, then ISIS will latch on to those feelings to convince already bullied people that Americans hate them, and their only choice is to fight back with these attacks? Do you honestly not realize this?
Dude, I have great news for you. This is 2017 and fact based journalism has been almost entirely destroyed by Google, Facebook and the internet. If you want to read articles about how brown people are the source of all your troubles, muslims should be banned, incarcerated and deported based on their religion and Obama, Hillary and Schumer are conspiring to take away your precious assault rifles there are no shortage of ethical, honest websites to visit. Go to Breitbart right now, I bet they just posted one and if you hurry you might not miss it!
Not at all Rodney - I am suggesting that these so called priests, exactly became priests, because it will afford them the freedom and luxury to be paedophiles at will or use and abuse women.  They certainly did not do this IN the name of Christ - but they used it to commit their crimes.  Does that make God evil or man evil? It is disgusting what has happened throughout the centuries under the banner of religion (mainly under RC rule) But please lets be fair, what about  Communism (an atheist ideology) who wiped out MILLIONS of people, imprisoned, tortured because of their religion & non-compliance to(atheist) ideology. But this is always conveniently forgotten! Do you even know what is happening in places like North Korea, India and many other Muslim & secular countries right now?  CHRISTIANS & other non-compliants are being persecuted, killed, jailed & tortured daily! Read the Red Holocaust - 60M+ people killed by Marxism, that exclude the rapes and other atrocities!
That was a very sad act of violence against Muslims in Quebec City.  And more recently in England. We need to be reminded of this, so thanks. I am really struggling with this issue.   Violence begets violence. How do we stop the cycle? Is this a Clash of Civilizations,  as Samuel Huntington called it, that must play itself out? On a personal level, I will be kind, as Ms. Khan earlier advocated in another article - I will have to leave the political solutions to others, because I am honestly at a complete loss as to what can be done to resolve things on a macro level...
What's a 'transgender boyfriend'?  How many 'x'-chromosomes?  And may I suggest you take the trouble to actually become informed about the authentic tenets of my faith before presuming to pontificate on it?  That way you can avoid slagging your own arguments.  And the real joke is that I couldn't marry a second wife--and have it certified--in my OWN Masjid ('mosque').  Because the secular government will impose legal sanctions on any qutb ('preacher') who exercised his right to practice our faith as written in our Scripture.  And there is such a thing as 'freedom of association'.  At least for now.  We don't have to marry you in our Masjid, because by our rules at least one of you has to be Muslim.  For starters.  If the bishop has any sense, he'd take that position as well.  Offer marriage services only to Catholics and this whole thing goes away.
For example: a former Australian Christian missionary who became Muslim told how his former 'born-again' colleagues would offer to babysit poor Nigerian Muslim farmers' children while the farmers worked their fields.  The missionaries gave the kids toys, telling them "These are from Jesus."  While they napped, the missionaries surreptitiously removed and hid the toys.  When the kids awoke and asked for them, they were told, "Muhammad took them away."  Trinitarians usually attempt to justify such disgusting behavior by quoting the Impostor Paul: "...if my lie redounds unto the glory of God, why do you call me a sinner?"  As if God can be "glorified" by lies.  I do NOT equate the petty viciousness of these pathetic "Christians" with the Boko Hara'am slave-traders' bloody atrocities.  But neither do I fool myself that the former wouldn't be just as bad, given opportunity.  They've been so in the past, and not that long ago.  Allah save us from "Christian love"--we have enough problems!
Plenty of room in Islamic countries since Muslims push out all their minorities. Pakistan is a great example of a place with more room.
Exactly.  People like to hate more than help.  Israel has actaully done more for Syrians living on her northern border than Syria's own Arab and Muslim brothers.
Link to Jones clip?  The SPLC site says:  "refers to the alleged "Jewish origins of bolshevism, Jewish dominance of Hollywood and the media, [and] Jewish control of Congress."  Which of those statements is not factually correct?  Ever ask yourself WHO insisted you believe that "Nazism is evil," and WHEN did that happen?  SPLC labels Catholics evil bcz critical of Jews;  says readers should be sympathetic toward "Jews" and reject Catholics who are critical of Jews.   What if, for example, "Iranian" is substituted for "Jews" in each of the 68 times "Jew" appears on that SPLC page; or "anti-Iranian bigotry" substituted for each of the 41 times "anti-semitic" is used?  Would you still be so angry and still have "Croesus 'pegged', Neko?  Are Iranians not entitled to be defended and their human rights and sovereignty protected?  Are Catholics forbidden to hold and speak opinions critical of Jews, or anyone else? Muslims?  Why are "Jews" entitled to special treatment but Catholics aren't?
It's mainly muslim hate for each other and everyone else
The E.U. is going through pretty uncertain times and I think having a strict Islamic state as a member is not in the cards.
Canadians need to become better informed about the practices of underage sex in Islam. This occurs both for boys and girls and is not only in the practice of underage marriage but also in men abusing young boys as a sexual substitute. This has been a major problem in Europe, where these practices have been tolerated as part of religious freedom. Do Canadians really want to go down this route, and are they comfortable with these practices occuring legally within Canada in these communities? I would venture not.
Good. Next, Arab States and Muslim States the world over need to isolate Pakistan, another State where the ideology of terrorism seems to flourish.
pianocello, it must be really hard for you to be so afraid. There are many places in the US also that it might not be wise to walk through at night, but not because of Muslims. France by comparison is very safe, and there are no places that the police are scared to go. That's an urban myth. I regularly go to Muslim neighborhoods in France, and I've never had a problem.  By the way, the reason our dear Canadian leader continues to focus on Islamophobia laws is precisely because of people who display such abysmal ignorance.
The U.S.A. has banned certain electronic devices in the passenger sections of certain flights heading from certain Muslim countries to the U.S.A.   Britain has followed suit and has also banned some electronic devices on flights to Britain.  If the Canadian Trudeau Liberal government doesn't do the same, what will that mean? Will it mean the Canadian Trudeau Liberal government doesn't  care about the possibility of terrorism or the safety of airline passengers?
"Just 61 per cent of Muslims said they had voted in the 2016 presidential election, fewer than any other major religious group or the public at large"  What were the percentages of other religious groups, or the public at large? Is the difference at least statistically significant?  "One in three Muslims who did not vote said it was because they did not like any of the candidates."  What about other religious groups, or the public at large? did non-voters from those groups also decide no candidates were worth voting for?
Ward 1, that's a very positive approach to this tragedy; and here's another one--the Portland Muslim community is speaking out on  it's appreciation for the "Three heroes" who stepped up in defense  of  the two young girls -- this makes me proud to be an Oregonian:  "I am very thankful as a Muslim, I am very thankful as a Portlander ... that we stand together here as one," Muhammad A. Najieb, an imam at the Muslim Community Center, said Saturday. The two young women "could have been the victims, but three heroes jumped in and supported them," he said." A fundraising page launched by his group for the families of the dead men, a surviving victim and the two young women had raised $50,000 in its first hours, Najieb said. Police said they'll examine what appears to be the extremist ideology of suspect Jeremy Joseph Christian, 35."  The good and the bad both come in all shades and colors, don't they?
Despite admitting 40,000 Syrian refugees – carefully selected, mind you  WHY is the media simply incapable of telling the truth? Based on over a dozen committee hearings I watched over the past year, these facts were revealed:  -the body Trudeau used to vet Syrian refugees, was staffed with racist muslims-the UNHRC screened for Canada, ONLY Muslims and vetted out those whose lives truly were threatened, including the Yazidi. The refugees we got, were safely ensconed in safe zones in half a dozen middle east countries, whose lives were NOT on the line  -the hypocrisy of the announcement this week of the 1200 Yazidid Trudeau brought in is staggering. They mocked the CPC when they were in power for NOT bringing in the Yazidi, knowing full well the above truths, yet now, get positives from the media from bringing in Yazidi AFTER they voted down the Rempel motion last June to fast track the Yazidi  -the cost of the 39K refugees to taxpayers: $2 BILLION
I confess i didn't read it in the Koran.  I got it from a Bill Maher show; a Muslim guest on the show responded in the affirmative when queried by the host.
Five things that are recognized as inherently harmful in Islam and when they are repudiated and nullified will a true Muslim Reformation have been achieved:   1. Muhammad's semi-divine and infallible status along with the literalist reading of the Qur'an, particularly those parts that were revealed in Medina;  2. The investment in life after death instead of life before death;  3. Sharia, the body of legislation derived from the Qur'an,  the Hadith, and the rest of Islamic jurisprudence;  4. The practice of empowering individuals to enforce Islamic law by commanding right and forbidding wrong;  5. The imperative to wage jihad or holy war   Those 5 points must be addressed by the Muslim's in Canada and around the world, otherwise we'll always have a problem.   The Christians went through a  reformation, which took time and  I'm sure Islam has the ability to do this too.
Well, Mr. Minshall, you are just one man. Are you saying then that all Jews committed war crimes then? Did I say you committed war crimes or did I say our nation committed war crimes?  In 1948, Israel was attacked. How you think otherwise is beyond all logic. Then you talked about Semitic people living in Israel since the dawn of time. You know well as I do that it is not ethnic differences that is creating the havoc today but religious difference. Palestinian Jews and Arabs are divided by faith, not race. So it really don't matter who was there first. But we do know that the Jewish nation has been there far longer then a Islamic state.....actually that part of the world never been a state of any kind once the Jewish kingdom was destroyed by the Roman Empire....until 1948. Then the Arabs decided to  exterminated it and failed. Because they failed, you are whining over the petty notations.
Hardline Muslims are as conservative as they come.
Turkey is more in the German orbit than the American. The physical semblance of modernity visible in their cities can be attributed to that. However many glass towers and smart phone carrying sophisticates there may be doesn't completely mask the underlying collective mentality of unease the population has with Western European civilization. The deep foundations of Muslim faith and the draw of the East  exert a powerful magnetic attraction. The turmoil in the Middle East and the perception that it's all the White Man's fault is also a contributing factor. Expect more developments to that effect in the near to mid term future.
Majority of these migrants are from Africa. What the world is facing is a population explosion in Africa and the Muslim world. Presently the world has 7.1 billion people by 2095 (according to the UN projection) the world will have 11.2 billion people. Average family size in Denmark, Japan is less then 2. Average size in Pakistan and Egypt is 10. Highest in the world is Nigeria with 12 children (fertility rate). The problem in Africa is getting worse because of improved medicine and food from the west. Theory was 30 years ago African and Muslim population would decrease but in fact has increased at an alarming rate.
Of course in 2000 years of history there have been contributions from other cultures as well, the Muslim one being important in the Middle Ages in serving as a conduit for Ancient Greek and Roman culture. So were influences from China and other Asian countries, India, etc. I never implied there were not.  But our basic institutions are based on our Roman, Greek and Christian heritage., e.g. the 7-day week,  our calendar and holiday traditions, our language and expressions, etc.., and there is nothing wrong with that, and there is no reason we should be striving to extirpate these influences from our culture because they happen to have religious origins. That's my point.
Why are you referring to Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada as this article is about Trump and Muslims not being allowed on flights to the USA?
Come on Dave, can't you give me a half point on this one ? You seem like a nice guy, you want to hug the Muslims , how about us Christians ???
Fortunately,  Sharia Law has not been enacted in this country yet, so that is not the test.  And even then, Islam requires that there be three MALE  witnesses who testify for there to be a rape!
Schools have a holiday every Sunday, so that Christian kids can go to church without having to skip school. Schools have public holidays for Christian festivals (Christmas, Easter) only.   On the other hand, the world's largest Muslim countries, like Indonesia and Bangladesh, have public holidays for Buddhist, Hindu and Christian festivals.
Newreader, as usual, you couldn't be more wrong.  Muslims have marched and condemned terrorism time and again.  The problem is that the mainstream media doesn't report that because they know a large segment of the American population doesn't want to hear it.  Get some facts before you post.
Premier Couillard should not be criticized for speaking to a fear that many Quebecois and Canadians feel about the tide of Islam-inspired terrorism, which can in turn inspire blow-back terrorism from weak-minded persons within our dual-majority English and french cultures in Canada.  While many causes have inspired Islamist terrorism, one factor must surely be an increase in fundamentalism within the Muslim religion.  More liberal or syncretic versions of Islam have increasingly given way to the extreme Wahabi version practiced and exported from Saudi Arabia .  That has happened in the middle east where secularized states, such as the Shah's Iran and, yes, even Saddam's Iraq, have given way to more overtly Islamic governments.  It has affected west Asia (Afghanistan, Pakistan) and is a threat to the more moderate Islam of south-east Asia (Indonesia, Philippines) and the west.    This is the factor  the Premier was speaking to - the need to sustain a moderate version of Islam.
Steven...am glad to hear from the bishops on these matters....think it will be hard to shake loose any Trump money for much in the way of international relief or for that matter, increased numbers of refugees to come to the US....but am glad to hear from these four bishops and very glad to hear language that deals with persecution of folks of other belief systems, Muslims et al.  Perhaps it takes Trump horribleness to evoke this balanced response.  Am currently very worried about multiple US to Mexico deportations occurring right now, with what sounds like much tougher standards than previously....not just known criminals which Obama also did, but apparently folks with a social security card, or a drivers license et al...a Trump deal...feeding red meat to his base I think as his earlier detention efforts were a bust.
Yes it's amazing. Liberals have Canadians eating out of their hands with multiculturalism because they're afraid to be called racists or even worse, "unsophisticated provincials". Then they had Canadians eating out of their hands with same sex marriage because they were afraid to be called homophobic. Then they had Canadians eating out of their hands with Islam because they were afraid to be called Islamophobic. Now they have Canadians eating out of their hands with feminism because they're afraid to be called sexists. All this feeding at the Liberal Lunch Cafeteria while democracy disappears,, the middle class vanishes, sovereignty gets lost, the electoral system lollipops and the economy tanks.
They are pandering to a blood thirsty base, they are not coming up with solutions.  Perhaps making a national announcement that anyone caught crossing the border illegally will be immediately sent back to their home country, or if they arrived in South America first (as many are) they will be returned to those countries to make a claim.   No economic shopping around, I thought they were fleeing safety.    Also, mandating that hearings are held within 30 days even if it requires night court.  Also illegal border crossers should not be permitted to walk free after being registered they should be held in detention pending the 30 day hearing.   The UN should be ignored until they have the cajones to tell these countries to slow down on procreation levels.   Countries should be sanctioned for overpopulating, not assisted.  Turkey tells people to have at least 5 kids...crazy.   MSM did not report when he said Muslims will be the face of Europe and be its leaders in a few decades.
The rest of the country (most of it) is mostly Muslim. Malaysia (Muslim officially) celebrates Christian, Hindu and Buddhist holidays.
It seems many of the commenters don't believe Israel commits false flags. So the Feds have "Jewish Defense League" listed as a terrorist group for being extremely charitable. The USS Liberty never happened. Zionist "Larry Silverstein's" insurance policy, specifically for "Terrorism" 6 weeks before 9/11 was pure dumb luck, as was having a doctors appointment that very day. Allowing Israeli artists to live in WTC, months before the attacks with unrestricted access, on the same floors hit by the planes, was just a nice coincidence. Netanyahu only said, "9/11 was great, Israel is benefiting from the attack," because kinder words have never been spoken about a mass murder incident. Calling Muslim retaliation for our terrorist acts, "Islamic Terrorism" doesn't serve to keep the focus 1 sided. And now, invading an Islamic country is called "defending freedom." and killing their citizens is called "liberation," because it's true. Disagreeing with any of it, is antisemitism. See how that works?
More genocidal actions by the Islamic State group.   This group is the modern day Nazi's.
People fail to recognize that many of the Middle Eastern customs and manners of dress are mostly a result of the historical reaction to climate and weather and have little to nothing to do with religion.  Covering one's face and eyes is necessary to keep out blowing sand in desert winds which can develop on short notice.  A favorite in my neighbourhood are the new Muslim Canadian girls who wear hoodies over their hijabs because the thin fabric is not warm enough in winter.
2/2 (Bishop McElroy, cont'd.)  This duty has been violated by one of our parishes, and thus it is essential to make clear:   It is contrary to Catholic teaching to state that voting for a Democrat or Republican automatically condemns the voter to hell;  It is contrary to Catholic faith to state that gun control legislation is a form of slavery;  It is contrary to Catholic faith to fan the flames of hatred against Muslims or any religious group.  The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued a comprehensive statement on the substantive implications of Catholic faith for the current election.  It can be accessed at http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/faithful-citizenship/index.cfm.  I urge all Catholics to consult these teachings, pray about the vote that you are going to make, and then in conscience select the candidates whom you are going to vote for in this very difficult year.​
while it is horrible what had happened, at least it shows what will happen if you bring Islam into your life....just a reminder to Trudeau
[What are the rates for sexual assault against muslim women in Canada? Lower? Serious question.] Well, let's project that even further: What is the *incidence of reporting* the alleged offence?  And further again, how does the application of "unfounded" relate to that?
Muslims are not being denied the right to have their own cemetery.  They're only being told that specific location is not suitable, according to the people who live there.    Quebec is a huge province with a vast land area.  Is this particular location the only place in the entire province where the Muslims can locate their cemetery?
Some Friday classes have been cancelled to accommodate Islamic prayers; they are not praying on their "club time" as Christians are required, but on school time.
The U.S.A. has banned certain electronic devices in the passenger sections of certain flights heading from certain Muslim countries to the U.S.A.  Britain has followed suit and has also banned some electronic devices on flights from certain Muslim countries to Britain.  They seem to fear Islamic terrorism.  Is this a case of Islamophobia?  Does it have any merit?  Should the Trudeau federal Liberal government in Canada pass a motion to denounce and condemn Islamophobia?
And here's a  link to an ACLU piece on the NYPD's spying on Muslim communities. https://www.aclu.org/other/factsheet-nypd-muslim-surveillance-program
People misconstrue race and culture. Like it or not there is a distinctive flavor to the white culture as is there to the others be they carried on by blacks, hispanics, muslims, or others.    Unfortunately the liberal mantra that we are all the same is just a crock.  Its the ticket that gives creedence to those who are trying to flee the effects of cultures they abhor while at the same time demanding their culture be added to (or supercede ) the one they are "joining."    For a long time I've thought a ought to print up a bunch of bumper stickers that say "Diverity-the path to totalitarianism."   The more we keep heaping this "diversity" garbage on the Republic the faster she will continue to crumble under the weight of such insane BS.    When casting your vote in a few weeks please keep the Republic in mind....
Blaming all liberals for this terrible crime is despicable, just as blaming all Muslims for the terror attacks of a few is despicable. No one in media or in the Democratic Party, and certainly not Bernie Sanders who has never advocated violence for any reason, is in any way responsible for the terrible choice made by one person. Bernie Sanders this morning immediately and publicly disavowed this violence. I would remind you, WALLe and others, that violent speech from all corners of society has inspired many acts of domestic terrorists against a broad spectrum of society: Jews, blacks, government and its workers, police, Muslims, gays, and of course, liberals and now, conservatives. We all need to limit our protests to speech, and foreswear taking up guns.  I would point out that neither the president nor any member of his cabinet was targeted. I would ask you to take down your insulting and inflammatory post, and join the rest of us in deploring this tragedy brought about by one man.
The Conservative Party’s effort to pass a new motion cleansed of the word “Islamophobia” and replaced with condemnation of “all forms of systemic racism, religious intolerance and discrimination of Muslims, Jews, Christians, Sikhs, Hindus and other religious communities” is obstructive and, frankly, misses the mark. It does not help to alleviate the incredibly hurt sentiments of many Muslims.  give me a break. obstructive how? misses what mark?  i don't care about your feelings, snowflake. you have no right to have your "feelings" protected. the jews have suffered far more than muslims and not just had their "feelings" hurt. They've been discriminated against,  murdered, their houses of worship burned, their nation constantly under threat of nuclear annihilation, all by muslims. And then theres the holocaust. How dare you suggest the "feelings" of muslims trump the actual injuries and threats to jews.
The Muslim World of Religion & Politics. Go to Google & Look up Brigitte Gabriel on U-Tube She tells some interesting stories about Muslims. Canada is entering a huge huge dangerous time now. I tried putting the website on here but they wouldn't post it
bavius writes:  "the very same Saudi Arabia that Trudeau sold $15 billion in weapons to.   The very same Saudi Arabia that Trudeau wants to develop stronger relations with.   The very same Saudi Arabia Trudeau's government has deemed to be Canada's valuable strategic partner in the Middle East."  --  Perhaps you misunderstood my post.  I'll try to expand on it for you, in simpler terms.  My post didn't advocate for or against Saudi Arabia.  My post didn't advocate for or against the Trudeau Liberal government's policies vis-a-vis Saudi Arabia.  It dealt with the glaring inconsistencies in the application of Trump's promised "Muslim ban".  Does that help you?  Your bald and weak deflection away from the content of my post - the inconsistency of Trump's policy - to something to do with the Trudeau government, strongly suggests that you are unable to defend the Trump policy and thus are conceding it is indefensible.  Thanks for your response, always a pleasure.  .
I find this a very sad commentary on your understanding of Catholicism, let alone spirituality. This obsession with gatekeeping and exclusion, feed by the past two popes is, to me, cultlike and unchristian let alone uncatholic.  How are these attitudes any different than Muslim extremism?
Muslim views discussed by Brigitte Gabriel.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry3NzkAOo3s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guXBTgAxhIw  http://www.israelvideonetwork.com/brigitte-gabriel-reveals-the-muslim-brotherhood-plan-for-america/  https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidnoriega/meet-the-charming-terrifying-face-of-the-anti-islam-lobby?utm_term=.xg3dOljA3#.cdpdGnQYW
Why does Islamophobia exist? Four reasons:  1. While many Muslims are nice people, invite 20 million to come here, and Canada will be a Muslim society with a Muslim government. Some Canadians ask themselves: Do we want to live in a society similar to those in the Middle East? Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for Sharia law.  2. The violent conflicts between Muslim groups in the Middle East are well known. Do we want to import those conflicts into Canada?  3. Many Canadians from Europe are familiar with the "white slave trade". Between 1600 and 1830, 2.6 million white girls and boys were kidnapped and sold in the Middle East slave markets to serve as labourers, domestics and sex slaves in harems.  Indeed slavery still exists.  Type into Google the words slavery and the name of a country in the Middle East to learn more.   4.  Former Libyan leader Gaddafi predicted Muslims would conquer Europe thru numbers.
I love diversity by the way, I have many friends of different cultures. But since when did it become racist to preform a criminal record check on someone entering the country. Everyone who works there butts off to enter this country legally has to submit a criminal record check. What makes Muslim refugees exempt? Justin's hit the bonga little to hard up in whistler or something. He shouldn't even be the leader of an Under 6 soccer team
"Nabra Hassanen's murder may not be a hate crime. It's still a tragedy for Muslim Americans"  ~ That's the headline on one news item.  You'd think that the people who, for whatever reason, didn't share that sentiment would at least have the decency to give their regular anti-muslim comments a rest.    Apparently not.
That's your rule, but it is not the way things work in Canada.  School properties are used for all kinds of things, religious or otherwise.  The problem used to be that all students were required to say the Lord's Prayer (for example).  This isn't anything like that - nobody else is forced to attend the muslim prayers.
Undocumented immigrants should not be deported but no more should be allowed into the US.  A wall is a good idea although it may not be feasible.  The real threat is not from the South but from the East and with many Islamic terrorists entering via Canada.  Maybe a wall on the Northern border is more necessary.
Of course St Peter's Bacillica in Rome has some very great genuinely religious art. In fact in ages past most of the great art was inspired by Catholicism. Moslem contributions have been next to nothing in the field of the fine arts.
Hey if the UK don't want their Muslims, we (Hawaii) will take them with open arms.  According to our Gov and his AG and all the liberal snowflakes in this state this is the land of aloha.
2/2 But, with Egypt and Iraq as my evidence, I think stable democracies absolutely require one other thing--robust legal protection for minorities from the potential tyranny of the majority. We tend to forget that ingredient.  In Iraq, free and fair elections led a tyranny of the majority Shia over the Sunni; and then ISIS. In Egypt, already in their constituent assembly, the constitutional scales were tipped for Islam and against secular thought (to the chagrin of the secular students whose protests set the stage). Free elections, majority tyranny of Islam; then military dictatorship.   It is a very long shot to suggest that Syria, uniquely, will get democracy right with iron clad protections of minorities (Christians among others) from the tyranny of the majority.   I'm not suggesting Arabs can't handle democracy; rather that western mentors fail to grasp that our powerful protections for minorities are essential to stable democracies. (So says Dennis, today at least.)
more laughing from brain-dead types who believe it's OK to falsely accuse Muslims who haven't shot or bombed anybody of doing so.  I've lived here 12 years.  You'll perhaps be disappointed to learn in all that time I haven't shot a single person or bombed a single place.  Nor have I done so in the 50 previous years I've lived in Michigan, Missouri, California, Mississippi or North Carolina.  Recently someone who was angry with me did some 'online background check' hoping to be able to proclaim to the world what a scoundrel I was.  She came up with...a few 'fix-it tickets' for cracked rear-view mirrors and such.  OOPS!  How long a list of crimes do you think I could accuse you of just because I think it's likely that you MIGHT do so?
Interesting race for DNC Chair, Latino vs. Muslim, which was not mentioned in the story.  I wonder if this indicates how the Democratic Party intends to rebuild.
The headline is really misleading. This man had plenty of evidence on his computer to show that he was a part of the muslim organization that has clearly stated OVER AND OVER that their goal is to kill everyone who refuses to submit to their rules in their koran and they will not kill who they consider infidels quickly. They state that they will make it a long and painful death drawn out to cause as much pain and heartache as possible. Santiago did not slip through any crack miss boots he was pushed through a crack because for some reason Alaska's law enforcement does not want to admit that this jihadist organization is alive and well in our state. Santiago lived within walking distance of the mosque in south anchorage. The mosque is funded by CAIR, and several other organizations that are tied to the jihadist's that want us dead. This is not a religion but is in fact a military organization that is being allowed to infiltrate our state. They are just doing what they said they would.
It was an Uzbek asylum seeker, who was facing deportation, that committed the terror act in Stockholm earlier this year.  He had stolen a beer truck and plowed down his victims on one of the more popular shopping streets in that city. Uzbekistan has become very hostile to the Islamic part of the population and it seems many are radicalized abroad where they form terrorist cells.   The New York act is very tragic also as it plays directly into the hands of Trump, who is jumping at the occasion to talk of harder measures.  While also trying to derail attention from the Mueller Russia investigation.  Russia is of course also solidly behind the harsh treatments of Muslims in Uzbekistan.
Jesus says this to Muslims: “I AM the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me.  John 14:6  RSV
At the height of the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburgs and Balkan countries were the European bulwark against an Islamic onslaught. Who’s performing that task here? I would wager that it’s not the Liberals.
I  disagree ...the  way we identify ourselves in the free world is by showing our face , we need to maintain that standard ....if you do not want to  show your face you are assummed to be a criminal .  Face covering by Muslim culture is suppression of women plain and simple .
"Other bishops felt the emphasis on religious liberty overshadowed concerns about justice and peace. "  My Catholic-raised daughter left the Church at the earliest opportunity.  Two years in the Peace Corps in an Islamic country only reinforced her opinion that organized religion in general, and Catholicism and Islam in particular, cause more harm than good for the world.  However, she is now going through a Catholic Relief Services vetting process to allow her to be part of a support group for refugee families settled in her community.   The only chance of getting millennials back into the Church will be through the door marked "justice and peace", not "religious liberty".
Ah the results of the dreadful M103 coming now to fruition. Not much longer now till Canada fulfills its new destiny as a Muslim enclave.
I wish you could see the sadness of what you write: telling Canadians to write to a Muslim to support the letting in of more Muslims. Canada does not need to make the mistakes made by Europe. There is a very serious terrorist threat and the violence and warfare that has spread across the Islamic world is not something Canada should be importing.
MP's should condemn anti-Muslim, anti-Christian, and anti-Jewish behaviours and get on with more important matters. Our existing laws should be able to handle any contingencies.
Perhaps, but not EVERYONE is an avowed enemy to the United States, as Conferate generals and soldiers were.  "The history of our country" also involves Nazis and radical Muslim terrorists, but we do not honor them with statues and memorials in public spaces.
"A correction now: Over the course of this last week we have made some regrettable errors on air regarding the Muslim population in Europe, particularly with regard to England and France. Now, this applies especially to discussions of so-called ‘no-go zones,’ areas where non-Muslims allegedly aren’t allowed in and police supposedly won’t go.   "To be clear, there is no formal designation of these zones in either country and no credible information to support the assertion there are specific areas in these countries that exclude individuals based solely on their religion. There are certainly areas of high crime in Europe as there are in the United States and other countries — where police and visitors enter with caution.   "We deeply regret the errors and apologize to any and all who may have taken offense, including the people of France and England."  ~Fox News.  Yes, Fox News.
I believe the basic purpose of all islamic jihadis is to get "the infidel" (us) out of their countries.  Why dont we try it.
There is much of value in this column.  But there is also sophistry in that the author is excruciatingly careful to give equal weight, frequency and condemnation to hateful violent Islamist and ultra-right comments and acts as well as to the correct responses opposing such comments and acts by both Muslim and non-Muslim communities.  The problem with this is most sentient beings know this is 2017 not 617 and that today the overwhelming, unrelenting and obvious priority threat is from the radical Islamist groups not from the ultra-right wing political and religious groups.  A related problem is that moderate non-Muslims fall over over themselves to atone for and condemn and develop ways to prevent further Islamophobic comments and acts but  moderate Muslims including imams and other leaders are largely passive, silent and non- engaged when it comes to atoning for and condemning and developing ways to prevent further Islamofascism.  Non-Muslims are tired of this one way street.
Didn't you used to wax poetic about how Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim, Richard Rhyner?  Speech is free for a reason, reread your Constitution (or read for the first time) and learn to respect differing opinions.
No overthrow of Ghadafi no ISIS...let's not forget who was out praising the Arab Spring and supporting the Muslim brotherhoods takeover of Libya/Egypt. The same fighters who dragged Ghadafi through the street courtesy of Obama and Hilary's policies are now in Iraq and Syria causing mayhem. But let's keep blaming Bush because all Democrat failures are because of a Republican before then and all Republican successs are due to riding the coat tails of a Democrat...gimme a break! Lol
Sad really, we do not have this issue in NB  schools as the praying at school stopped when I was in grade 8 but the class mix of protestant, catholic boys and girls did not start until 4 years latter in grade 12. It takes time but if the taxpayer has to pay for cops just send the bill to the Muslim family. but really the religion in schools has to stop, I can not believe they still have separate schools in Ontario, I thought it was an Alberta problem only. May you all be safe..
The connections of Trump's inner circle to Russia run deep. Tillerson is just one of the many with extensive Russian ties. Flynn is another. His previous campaign manager, Paul Manafort, has extensive ties with pro-Russian political actors in the Ukraine.  DJT probably does too, which is why he won't release his tax returns as they may show Russian money and influence (and his indebtedness to China and some Middle East Muslim dictators).  This will be his undoing. These Russian connections and the investigation into them aren't going away anytime soon.  Expect impeachment proceedings to begin before October.
FYI Dumping on religions and being racist are two very separate things.  Race or Ethnicity is NOT a choice, religion and faith is!  Don't stoop to conflating anti-theism with racism, as the M103 supporters would have you believe. Being Anti-Islam or Anti-insert relrigion here is NOT racism. Islam and other religions are NOT races.
There were a number of Canadian participants at a violent white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., earlier this month, and there have recently been anti-Islam and anti-immigration rallies in cities such as Quebec City, Calgary and Vancouver.  -----  There are at least 3 false or misleading statements and omissions in one paragraph alone.  1) The number of Canadians participating in the rally has been confirmed at 2, out of a population of 30+ million.  2) The violence began when the mayor declared martial law, revoked the permit of the protesters, ordered the police to disperse the protesters into the waiting hands of antifa, then ordered the police to stand down.  All culminating in the tragic death of a young counter-protester.  By all accounts this was an orchestrated failure of policing that led to the violence and a lone wolf.  3) The recent rallies were protesting RADICAL islamic extremism and ILLEGAL immigration.  There were no racist overtones.
In Pakistan they still stone the odd Christian occasionally. It looks like Muslims are tolerant only when they are a minority.
Nailed it. Most of this is culture war stuff and identity politics. If the president* is not a conservative or Christian, but says he is and acts like a strong daddy that will keep out the turrists (but only the Muslim kind) that is good enough for them.   Oh and he will "end PC", meaning they think they'll be entitled to engage in unwarranted special privileges again.
Begich might be a threat but not as bad as the threat of Obama poisoning us with chemtrails, male perverts in the girls lavatory, Muslims imposing sharia law, or the teaching of sex education in high schools.
Kinda doubt that Trump will put more ships in the state that was the first to fill a frivolous lawsuit against his Muslim Ban. Somebody should tell the AG that showboating has consequences.
"...teach classes in American studies at the University of Hawaii-Manoa" Seriously? How much is this charlatan being paid to brainwash impressionable young minds with leftist doctrine? She can't even put together a coherent op-ed article! Where do I start: the first 4 paragraphs rail against Trump's Muslim ban, but she is trying to conflate it with caregiving. Apples and oranges.
The Bible, Christianity, and the Lords Prayer were kicked out of our schools years ago.  Now, mosques are allowed in? Because Muslims demand this?  There is a simple solution...Christians, ask to have the Bible and Christianity brought back into the schools.
Muslims?
Anti-semitism and islamophobia are pretty much the same, although not exactly. but they are the words available. Blame the English language.  Muslims in Canada are not obliterating free countries nor returning them to the dark ages.
"I'd say social peace and progress rests on acceptance of differences, and accommodating them where it's not a hardship to do so."  Alceste: The current dispute over Muslim prayers in public schools pretty soundly disproves your contention. There are two different philosophies in conflict here, one grounded in secularism  and the other in religionism. Definitionally, never the twain shall meet.
Some of us condemn such acts no matter who commits them.   They are not to be mistaken with progressives, who can be relied up to twist and turn whichever way to excuse the incredible number of Muslim terrorist attacks that happen every year.
Good points: the Canadian public were hoodwinked by the Liberals. They voted for a real green agenda (lower pollution, fewer toxic chemicals, nicer communities), modern, 21st-century infrastructure (which they are happy to pay for), a modern military that defends Canada only, and competent budget management.   Instead, they have got run-away deficits, buckets of money thrown at mostly Muslim migrants, a phoney, fake green agenda of higher energy prices and not much else, little new money for infrastructure, and a military being sent off to fight horrific wars in Africa, the Middle East and Europe. The Liberals have plastered a smirking, air-gulping PM doing selfies on TV screens to sell this sell-out.
Kaiulani Milham:  - -"His race-driven hatred for people of color, from Muslims to Mexicans, will be felt by Kānaka Maoli, too. Guaranteed. What’s worse is that the hatred he represents reflects the values of his share of U.S. voters who voted in this election."  Hatred?  A counter to anti-Trump brainwashing propaganda is this:   "Donald Trump: A President For All Americans" --- http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2016/10/05/donald-trump-president-for-all-americans.html  Aspirations by Hawaiians to restore  Hawaiian Independence faces zero chances of becoming a reality in this the 21st Century and much more in the future.  All noble talk about independence has to face the reality of who will grant Hawaiians independence.  ** Not the US because the very existence of the US depends on Hawaii being the 50th state of the USA  ** If not the US, who?  ** Not the UN because of the US veto power. Hawaiians must face the realities of the 21st Century.
Most of the terrorism attacks in the USA & throughout the world in the past 3 decades have been perpetrated by muslims.  The muslim ideology is not worthy of being termed a religion, rather it is a malevolent socio-political form of total control of people. Promises of virgins as rewards for suicide bombers lure many young men to commit these unconscionable acts.  This is a new type of war we are facing ... one which we cannot afford to ignore.
I just can't stand back and not reply to  n article that is so blatantly wrong . First , the writer must know the subject to be able to comment . We are faced with a Culture that is diametrically opposed to the Canadian Judeo/Christian values on which Canada is based . Muslims following the Qur'an know that Killing Christians and Jews  is a duty and you can hear it in Mosques across Canada . The ultimate goal of Islam is not to convert the world but to establish Sharia Law over the entire world  They will do this by population . Muslims have increased their population in Canada from 1 Million in 2001 to 3 million in 2011 . I'm sorry to say but in 20 years they will be a force in Canada , and Canada as we know it , will be no more ! If we , as Canadians , sit back and do nothing we will only have ourselves to blame . We even  let Immigrants change our Laws by insisting on Face Veils at Citizenship ceremonies ! This  is not hatred of a culture but good common sense .
What a horrible way to die-my thoughts are with the families and the survivor.  Sounds like this terrorist was targeting not just Muslims but multiple religions/ ethnicities. The headlines are rather misleading. Hate is hate, and sounds like he hated many.  From article: "hate speech toward a variety of ethnicities and religions"
There are still plenty of those who think we need even more Muslims in this country.
Since I/we are neither Sunni nor Shiite, they both hate me.  I've never understood why, since they flee Islam, they don't renounce it and get on with their lives.  Why do we support them?  Thank you for your wishes and Happy New Years to you and yours!
Or, the way to correct it, could be for Muslims to come out publicly, and regularly, against extremism, sexism and homophobia in their religion.
In the context of the "protests" sweeping the nation at the moment, we need to be aware of the fact that ALL of these "protests" are being masterminded and paid for by George Soros, the "majority shareholder" (over 90%) in the Democrats. In short, they are his local US version of his "color revolutions" that swept Eastern Europe, and his "Arab Springs" that swept the Arab world. They are not genuine grassroots uprisings.  He is trying to overthrow the Trump Administration by a supposedly "popular uprising". He better be warned, White, Protestant Evangelical America will not stand idly by and let this happen. Too much Godly prayer has gone up for Trump. Also, Trump's principal reason for winning was his position re Israel:  Clinton: Establish Jerusalem as the "capital" of a Muslim "Palestinian" State. Trump: Transfer the US Embassy to Jerusalem as the undivided Capital of the Jewish People and the Jewish State. Gen 12:2,3 & Matt 25:31 to 46 applies here.
Applies to Abraham's SEED.  The Covenant was ratified IN THE FLESH through circumcision.  Isma'el (alayhis-Salaam) was circumcised.  He was a Semite.  The Covenant applies to him and his people.  Begin,  Sharon and their ilk, though circumcised (as are all Muslims and most American Christians), were NOT Semites.  They were European invaders whose people originated in the region of the Black Sea.
Yes, Honey Badger, it was during an evening meal Macron attended in celebration of Ramadan.  He added a warning against a 'repli identitaire' after thanking the muslim leaders in attendance for their condemnation of jihadist attacks over the past two years.  Can you imagine Marine Le Pen (or Donald Trump) joining with muslims for a Ramadan celebration?
I'm not sure it's mind reading. During his campaign, Trump publicly expressed contempt for a dead US soldier of Muslim heritage and his family, and likewise publicly ridiculed another soldier, Senator John McCain, for having been captured by the enemy. Also, Trump, arguably a draft-dodger, compared service in Vietnam to his avoidance of sexually transmitted diseases as he played the field on the home front.
This is the second time I had to reply to your message, seems G&M is still censoring.   So you haven't read  “Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now” by Ayaan Hirsi Ali., but have spent 6 months in the Middle East.   First of all you've been brainwashed by Islam.   Second of all gaining knowledge is the primary purpose of life, looks like you're going to die in ignorance.  Knowledge is power.   Also, I have read the Ontario legislature that this article is about and have read the full text of the motion.  Amazing huh!  Now my turn to ask questions, do you  want Sharia law in Canada?   Man/woman up and tell us the truth.   What countries did you visit in the Middle East and Asia?   I see you don't mention anything about Christophobia in the Middle East.   I love communicating with you, of course at G&M's censor's discretion, you're definitely my kind of people.  READ the Book, don't let others make decisions for you, make you're own.   I like this post, so I think I'll like it too.
So lets get a battalion of American Islamic Fighters to defeat this scourge. Japanese Americans and Immigrants proved their loyalty to the U.S.A. despite the fact that they were repressed as a people here, just as Black Americans did too during W.W.2. Our  Elderly Relatives, as well as the new immigrants here (legal and illegal) believe in the Hope and Future of the United States of America.This Country was the First Country to give the power of government to the People and for the People. People world wide know this, and thats why they Vote with their feet.
" Dutch airline said on Saturday it had refused carriage to the United States to seven passengers from predominately Muslim countries."  Hello editors, wake up and insert the three lettered noun after the word airline.
Terrorism does not come from legal immigrants who wait endlessly to be admitted after vetting hon.  The terrorists are already here and most are not Muslim at all.  Read the news.
You mean the model where muslim parents take their kids out of music classes? Or the one where non muslim kids have to change the way they eat and dress so muslim kids can be integrated. This model works well. There were never attacks by jihadis in Canada. We do not alienate our jihadis.
Islam is a hierarchy of submission; The world must submit to Allah (Islam) All Muslims must submit to Allah and the Prophet Mohammad (shahada)  Men must submit to their Imam A wife must submit to her husband Children must submit to their parents.  Females must submit to all males. (A mother must obey her own son)  Human laws are not to be obeyed unless there is a benefit for Islam to do so.  How can a 15 year old girl say no if her parents want her to marry a 60 year old taxi driver with another wife?  She is literally the bottom of the hierarchy.
I wonder how Justin manages to defend M103 when he attends the pride parades? Seriously, Islam is not the LGBTQ community's best friend.
Can you point any post out that justifies the killing of this young women? Or any post that fuels hatred towards Muslims? All posts even remotely critical of Islamic dogma are immediately reported and censored by Alceste, Allan Ross or guantanamo, so I highly doubt that any posts actually fueling hate or celebrating this brutal death could make it past the attacks on free speech. ----- The above post was up for all of 5 minutes before Alceste popped out of the shadows to report it.   2 times now...lol...  Tell us about yourself Alceste?  Retired?
Dragon I don't know where you got your stats but I am pretty sure that in America one has more to fear from white boys than Islamic terrorism.  Now this person could be a recent islamic convertee but for sure he was a white boy.  lol
Hedzer, Mel is a right-wing anti-muslim poster who pretends to be the opposite, in order to provoke reactions like yours.  The two posters who 'liked' your comment are fully aware of that.  You can form your own opinion of what Mel does.
Judicial overreach my foot.  And it doesn't make America look weak; it makes Trump look like a fool.  If you want to guarantee more radicalization, treat a few million people like dirt because of the actions of a handful.  These moves by Trump will make America (and the world) less, not more, safe.  Remember, ISIS used his campaign rhetoric as propaganda. Perhaps when the father of the Muslim soldier killed serving America offered Trump his copy of the Constitution, he should have taken him up on the offer -- and read it.
Can politics not be set aside and everyone condemn Jewish centre bomb threats, mosque murders and other expressions of hatred against both Jews and muslims? Surely it's time to realize that words have consequences.
The Hitler/Trump parallels are there for everyone to see. The comparison can start and end with Trump's notion (can't glorify it by calling it a "plan") that Muslims should be listed in a database. That alone disqualifies him from any consideration as President.
So we are absolutley counting on integration and declining birth rates? A risky reliance on both counts. Islam does not accept secular government nor is it able to refrain from shoving its fascist ruleset down the throats of all around it since forced proselytization is built into its scripture. There is no shortage of examples around the world where Islamist sourced violence illustrates the truth of this statement (Sweden, Iraq, India, Nigeria, France, Germany, Indonesia, Philippines, Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Bangladesh etc) Please show me plenty of examples around the globe where Islam is heavily present demonstrating the wide scale error of this statement or otherwise explain how an aversion to Islam for non-Muslims should be labeled "prejudice" as opposed to rational bias?
I read what was posted and I still consider it a "ban" as that is the basic definition of what Trump signed, which violates constitutional law.  Iraq was a war zone, with different actions and rules applying; but I guess you never gave any thought as to how extremists get into a country that is trying to block them and keep themout, huh?  They don't fly from any Muslim controlled country, they fly to a neighboring country and change flight plans.  Even President Trump is bound by constitutional law, he is not "King" and does not have the power to unilateraly make laws that can hurt the US and it's citizens!
It was 3.2% 5 years ago. But the Muslim population in Canada has been doubling every 7-10 years since 1971. It will likely be 7% in the next census in five years, and 14% ten years after that. Especially since so many Muslims are immigrating to Canada every year and Muslim families are having a lot of babies.
This is  not where moderate  Muslims distance themselves from the radical Muslims.  This is where they  become indistinguishable. ( but they always were)
I thought Trump hated the Muslims.  Why are the leaders of the Muslim world treating him like royalty?  I don't get it.
"All over the internet in comment sections, articles, blogs etc, people are voicing their concerns about Islam. "  Which is exactly the point of M103.  Islamaphobia like yours is all over the internet (as is misogyny and anti-Semitism, etc.) and inspires the terrorists who murder innocent people in a Mosque.  Your hatred is also a great recruiting tool for the Daesh.
It's a 'standard" response only in that it perfectly illustrates how some posters here complain about special treatment for Muslims because Islamophobia is specifically mentioned in M-103 yet they ignore previous examples of the same such as the antisemitism motion.  I'm surprised I need to explain that to you.
Trump’s reckless killing of civilians in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen is many things: barbaric, amoral, and criminal.         It is also, ironically, likely to strengthen support for the very groups — ISIS and al Qaeda — that he claims he wants to defeat, given that nothing drives support for those groups like U.S. slaughter of civilians (perhaps the only competitor in helping these groups is another Trump specialty: driving a wedge between Muslims and the West).
"Canada condemns today's terror attack in Barcelona — our hearts, sympathies & support are with the victims and their families," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted. President Trump tweeted Thursday that his followers should "study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught," apparently referencing a debunked claim relating to Gen. John "Black Jack" Pershing. Trump was referring to a supposed practice of shooting Muslims with bullets dipped in pig's blood or burying them with the bodies of pigs.  There is no evidence to support this claim. Snopes, a website that fact-checks Internet rumors, declared it to be false. Politifact, another fact-checking website, gave it a "Pants on Fire" rating. Apparently ScottyKnows nothing.
"Islam is a political ideology intent on world domination. This is the observation of a former Muslim, Hirsi Ali.  Because this is her experience of this religion, does that make it wrong; is it Islamophobic?  Am I an Islamophobe  if I concur?  What about all those Muslim nations that are busy committing theocide against Christians?  Is that Christophobe?  As Canada's Muslim population swells, as it surely will, will M-103 be expanded to include Christophobia?
How so?  When Nidal Hasan- an Islamic Terrorist-  killed our men and women in uniform at Fort Hood, this President called it "workplace violence."  When another Islamic Terrorist (A registered Democrat and Clinton supporter) killed homosexuals at a Florida nightclub, the word "terrorist" was hardly uttered by him.  The issue is that when you do, in fact, "meet the terrorists," you can't call them what they are, and subsequently can't address them as a problem or proper threat that they are.
Why is the G&M so infatuated with refugees from the Middle East?  Its enough already!   The wealthy Arab countries in the Middle East do nothing and refuse to take in their own.   At this point I would be very happy if  Canada looked more after itself then trying to be the goodwill ambassador to the Muslim world which will never work.
The Globe capitulated to their new over-lords. All hail Islam.
Judge Watson halted the order based on public quotes, that he interpreted as racist. He failed to acknowledge Trump's clear intension to reduce the ability of terrorists like ISIS, who say they are Muslim, from entering the USA. Remember that Trump was elected with this as one of his clearly stated goals.  The Supreme Court is likely to support Trump this time. Even if they don't, Trump has many more tools to work with to achieve the same ends. He can simply increase the analysis time for visa applications, to screen ALL applicants more extensively for possible terrorist tendencies. This does the same thing as an executive order, but without regard to country of origin. Applicants from certain areas in the world would face more in-depth research than others, due to profiling.
The Muslim World of Religion & Politics. Go to Google & Look up Brigitte Gabriel on U-Tube. She tells some interesting stories about Muslims.
Could you point me to one of those polls? Because the Muslims I know are not in favor of imposing Sharia Law on the rest of us.
I wonder to what extent the continuation of the Church's sexual teachings is based on the fear that there will not be enough Catholics in coming years, and in particular not enough to outnumber Muslims.  It does indeed seem natural to try to restrict sex to activities that are likely to result in more babies if you are overcome with anxiety about the future existence of your group and consider yourself responsible for it.  If that is your underlying motive, you can't really think too much about luxuries like the rights of gay people or women.
Yes!  The name game!  I love this game.  Let's see, when Zehaf-Bibeau murdered a soldier and stormed parliament, that wasn't an act of terrorism and Harper was just fear mongering.    When Hasan Sharif attacked a police officer and went on his violent rampage, that was terrorism, but it wasn't Islamic terrorism.  Sorry, it was not radical Islamic terrorism, but it was terrorism.  According to Justin anyways.    Two very similar instances under similar circumstances, one wasn't terrorism the other one was.
I fear Christian Sharia as much as I do Muslim Sharia.  They are both pretty similar, once you remove the US constitution.
Yes, he did. Rudy Giuliani confirmed on national TV that Trump called it a "Muslim Ban" and approached him on how to effect such a ban legally.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOs4WUr7sJg
The UNHCR wants the U.S. under Trump to resettle Muslims?  Have they not heard of the "non-Muslim" ban? Have they not heard of Trump's spat with Australia? Is this a joke, or is that organization clueless?
Don't believe Apple for one minute is concerned about Immigrants from the 7 Muslim countries. Apple is a huge corporate and its all about money. Apple is really worried about upcoming Trump immigration reform of skilled workers. Apple is worrued that it will be unable to use the US H1b visa system to import cheap skilled labor. Apple doesn't want to pay US workers prevailing wages and pensions. Apple is a cruel employer that imports cheap labor , uses them for a couple of years then fires them after they reach age 40. Apple then repeated the process.
"Muslim births projected to outnumber Christian births globally by 2035"  Very interesting, how quickly this article became buried by NCR editors: out of sight, out of mind.   The news is not surprising. The difference could be succinctly summed up as follows:  In our "enlightened" and "progressive" Western society and culture people by their mid or late twenties tentatively manage to identify (often with extensive professional help) their gender and/or sexual orientation.   At the same time, in Muslim countries and culture, people in their late twenties have already raised a family of four.
The analogy is directly on point.  All Muslim nations are at war with the United States today, just as the Nazi Germans were in 1943.  We were also at war with Japan, and imprisoned all Americans of Japanese descent, so I assume we should put all Muslims in the US behind barbed wire now?  Perhaps we can use the camps FEMA set up for Christians?
The Kurds are an ethnic-cultural majority in their own geopolitical realm, yet  Muslim Kurds hate secular Kurds: they all have schisms between them, endless regional agendas ...Muslims a la Kurdish, most of them have been propped up by  moneyed Saudis-Wahhabi  who are the unforgiving, righteous guardian of Mecca and the Sunni-Muslim word in certain ways. Since the 60's  most of those imams, mosques, have been under the subtle and overt payroll of Saudi Arabia -  Myanmar's confrontational activists & terrorists have been trained in Saudi Arabia. And here comes Catalonia to create another sac of cats led by a (  not) majority that has been programmed by hate and resentment by the simple reason that, while in the 20's, powerhouse Barcelona was the cultural- racist Mecca that looked down to Andalusian as "moors ...black .." etc Spain has evolved to such a point that Barcelona has become ...provincial , and Madrid is the true cosmopolitan one. ( Not just) the tribal ego is a Pandora box ...
As we can see everywhere Islamic Jihad is the source of many wars. These wars are ideological first and territorial second.   Arab Israeli war is another example of Jihad. Arab states took 99.99% of lands from Ottoman Empire, including most of the land allocated for Arab and Jewish Palestinian states. This current war is not to give Palestinian Arabs another state, in addition to Jordan. It is to destroy Israel in stages by making it vulnerable.   Calling lands Judea and Samaria means more than the West Bank (of Jordan River). Especially for Good Samaritans, who are never called West Bankers. Indeed, West Bankers are not always Good Samaritans.
I only read what I did of that article because I felt duty-bound as a citizen to enlighten myself about this disturbing emerging political movement, if you can even call it that. Recently I mentioned in a comment having read about a Bulgarian mystic named Baba Yanga who died in 1996 predicting the beginning of WWIII on May 13th of this year. Apparently she had an 85% success rate in her predictions. One thing she predicted which caught my attention was the rise of the "White Brotherhood" in Russia, later spreading throughout the world. Since Russia is seen by some as the ancient ancestral home of the Aryans (Hitler's feeling that that distinction belonged to Germany notwithstanding) that made the few hairs on my head stand on end. This is especially relevant since many white supremacists apparently view Putin's Russia with awe as a white bulwark against the creeping Muslim "invasion" from the south. Sound familiar? Given what we know of Trump and Russia, be afraid, be very afraid!
these judges and a lot of people don't understand why trump wants to ban these people from six Muslim countries, they have no stable government where we can get a good background check on them so they could be terrorist, for example someone from these terrorist countries wants to come here and live and says he is a doctor and he shows his license but has no background you gonna let him in, or here is a father with his wife and  two kids and they want to come here how do you know he is not a terrorist just because he has a family go ask Israel how many suicide bombers had wives and kids and still blew themselves up to kill other people, I rather have this travel ban from countries that have no government, can't these judges and people understand how dangerous  this is, get a life folks before you get a rude awakening.
This article on the Muslims, presented October 24, is arriving October 25, 2016, just in time for Liturgy of the Word, Reading 480, Tuesday of the Thirtieth Week in Ordinary Time II.  The Ordo reads:  “* (USA)  At Mass, the approved alternative shorter reading from Ephesians (see Lectionary, vol. I, no 122 (in my copy, it is no. 802.6 on page 499)), excludes the first part of the longer version, namely:  “Be subordinate to one another . . . so wives should be subordinate to their husbands in everything.”  I wonder what the Openings exhibit will have about that.  “Why would liberals even endorse a religion that has instructions for beating your wife?”—Max de Januario  Answer above.
An irrational fear is being afraid of something when you have no reason to be apprehensive. If you have not read the Koran, then a fear of Islam  i.e. 'Islamophobia' could rightly be called irrational.
I don't. Please explain why having a Muslim cemetery is more threatening than a Jewish, Catholic or Sikh cemetery? Or one that honours First Nations religions.
"Balderas didn’t offer specifics, but nationwide, members of some racial or religious minorities have said they are disturbed by Donald Trump’s comments singling out immigrants from Muslim countries and from Mexico and Central America."  Here is another example of inserting the notion that Trump somehow is anti - immigrant. My understanding from what I have heard him say multiple times (he is everywhere on tv) ...he is all for immigration but it must be done legally for those coming from our southern border. As regards Muslim's it was about more stringent vetting before entry because the radical arm of their religion is warring against us. Now I may be wrong about all of this but still feel strongly that if you are submitting an article do not try and slip in innuendo that suggests something other then what the subject has said. We, the general public, afe not stupid and know the difference, regardless of whether we agree with it or not.
It has been around for awhile.    And the link was from Pakistan!     The counter-intelligence types used to use  the acronym MICE to explain how to turn someone in our favor (or vice versa).  M= Money.  Pay them to be traitors.  I= Ideology.  They reject the politics of a society.  C= Compromise. 'Honeypots' like these allegations; LGBT revelations (still available where it's illegal,  punishable by death or not protected (Muslim nations, Russia) or anything else that is culturally unacceptable.    E= Ego.  The target thinks s/he is smarter and can't get caught.   Most people who qualify for  higher level security clearances get instruction on these sorts things.    It's part of that 3-hour briefing where they tell you about your crazy aunt who used to be a card-carrying Communist.  That way, nobody can blackmail you later.  'They' know about it and you know that 'they' know about it.
Niqabis are as representative of most Muslims, as the Westboro Baptist Church is of most Christians. I don't see mainstream Christians defending the Westboro Baptist Church by claiming opponents are "Christianophobic".  Please stop calling disapproval of the niqab with "Islamophobia".
I could care less about France, a small country full of cheese eating surrender monkeys half a world away. I mean, I do sympathize with them and think they need to do more to crack down on Islamic terrorists, but their pacifist and open nature has exacerbated their issues. But meanwhile I do care more about stuff that affects me in my community, like the scourge of pot.
In Judeo-Christian-Islamic system inherently draws a line between believers and non-believers. It is so strongly held in the Islamic faith; hence millions -- in the Balkans by the Ottoman and the marauding forces from the Arab world into the sub-continent to far-East-- were commanded and demanded into the faith system. And millions fell to the sword as noted above. German people did that only 80 years ago by just believing a Jew- the Christ and disbelieving the other Jews. And the Jews not believing Him.  Essentially all religions have loaded the societies with untold hardship.  But here we are now - a modern world. Keeping the scorecard is not going to bring peace. However, adherents of Islam insisting on their total acceptance whilst retaining them to be in a closed society within an open society is inherently built with fault-lines. Great minds have to bring some sanity for the future.
What kind of absurd idea is that you need to submit to the president? Dissent and informed debate on the issues is a patriotic duty. I've questioned the motives and flat out disagreed with plenty of policies from almost any candidate regardless of if I've voted for them or not. This idea of blind support is baffling to me.  I am claiming to know intent. I am stating things him and his advisors have said: "How can I make a Muslim ban legal?" If I asked "How I can make murder legal?" and then next week my worst enemy's car malfunctions and speeds off a cliff, and I was his mechanic...you can see where this is going.  I'd agree that the inauguration, by some metrics, was the most viewed. That isn't what I'm talking about. I'm talking about his claim about the size of the physical crowd at the Washington Mall. He said multiples times "It was so big it went back to the Washington Monument." It did not, and you'd have to be oblivious, inept, or a liar to say it did.  Again, admit he lies.
Definitely a Muslim apologist. Everytime Muslim terrorists attack Alcestis repeatedly and loudly proclaims that they don't represent Islam. Yet when a lone crazy kills Muslims in a Quebec Mosque he's proof of Canadian Islamaphobia and racism.
This must be difficult for some young muslim girls in Canada .  I recall that the Shafia sisters were allegedly murdered for trying to date "secularly".
Center can not hold, things fall apart .. Brexit, Catalonia, ..  West's narrative is that its growth was due to its penchant for Freedom, Democracy, rule of Law, ingenuity. Others, and some even in West differ. Says Samuel Huntington:  ” .. The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion, but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence. Westerners often forget this fact, non-Westerners never do ”  —— The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, p. 51 ...  China, Russia, Muslims, others see Trump as real face of West. Are they wrong?  Rise of the West was a fluke. For 1000 years Sunni Kaliphate sat smack in middle of Silk Road milking world trade with Tariffs (Arabic word) till Europe found new routes to Asia.  Now China reopens a New Silk and Belt Road to unify Europe, Asia, Africa in a Common Market to reclaim its rightful place on globe. Agenda is peace, trade, innovation, clean planet.  The party is over, Catalons know it.
"Everyone has a right to go one whatever websites they want to go on, generally speaking, so the fact that people are on websites that happen to be — whether they're white supremacist, anti-Jewish or neo-Nazi, or Islamic radicalism — until they do something generally speaking, all law enforcement can do is watch," Kelly said.  That statement, right there should scare the absolute BEEJEEZUS out of anybody in this country that cares even a little bit about the First Amendment and individual Rights in general.  The day we let government start regulating information (on the Internet or anyplace else) based on CONTENT and what THEY think is "bad"... Well, brother, that's it. GAME OVER MAN.  These people need to be reminded THEY are there to enact the will of the People, not enact their will ON the People.  Yep, we get it. Law enforcement isn't easy.  Too bad.  Stop trying to take the EASY way out by infringing on MY rights. Save that stuff for the criminals.
Sorry, skyofblue, but you are also misinformed. Those terrorist groups in the seventies and eighties did indeed commit mass murders in Europe through bombings. Google it. The fact that they didn't use suicide bombers is relevant exactly how? Dead is dead. The argument that an American is more than a thousand times more likely to be killed by a fellow American was used to demonstrate that the reality of gun crime is scarier than the fiction produced by Trump and his kind about the imminent dangers of terrorist attacks. The risks of the latter are relatively minimal as the statistics show clearly. Directed fearmongering for political gain should always be condemned, don't you think?  Now, how do I apply that argument to the rare attacks on mosques and Muslim women? In exactly the same way.  Please try to stay on topic if you want an actual discussion. (Note that I didn't mention the number of people killed by falling in their bathtubs).
The media misinformed the public in all the incidents of violence where Muslims were accused of violence. The US, France, Britain, Spain, Germany, Canada. The media did not report that every incident was preceded by an attack on Muslims. Starting in Palestine and proceeding through Afghanistan.   All the violence by Muslims was blow back/retaliation.
Fox published the erroneous statement, and, unlike other media outfits, they did not correct it in a timely manner, even after clear, contrary evidence was available.  They were so delinquent in this regard that the Canadian PMO wrote to them, requesting they correct the record.  I don't have an estimate of how many Americans will now wrongly believe that Muslims were somehow involved in perpetrating this attack, but with tensions running high, Fox's actions likely contributed to that misperception.  Misperceptions like that are grounding discriminatory and un-american actions.  The exact moment when Fox corrected its error, may not be the most important aspect of this.
Why "in the name of Jesus"???  Why not Chuck Darwin or Wile E Coyote or Santa Claus???  Peterson wants everyone but himself to support, stand with, defend and take care of illegals, radical Islamic terrorists and perverts.  What is HE doing in that regard?    Why not support, stand with, defend and take care of homeless American citizens especially veterans?
@ALbertD3 >>So, in saying that, am I an online troll? You didn't define it very clearly, just as M103 fails to clearly define Islamophobia. This is a dangerous game. .   We have articles conveying 'Muslim victimhood' and 'Canadian -phobias' - most of the time authored by a Muslim woman in a head-scarf. . Hold the outrage, before marking the post, and ask yourselves - why is that a pattern? . Where are the Muslim male authors? Or non-covered Muslim female authors? Or opinions different than those having been relentlessly published in G&M?
what's been said by Lloyd Axworthy and Allan Rock--misrepresentation of the reality.  They wrote: Ms. Suu Kyi has given no sign that she will accept the (Kofi Annan commission) report's proposals.  Reality: As stated by the International Crisis Group on Aug 27th, the Kofi Annan-led Advisory Commission, released on 23 August; it's welcomed by Suu Kyi and the government.  The cause of recent crisis started by an unprecedented coordinated over 1,000 armed Rohingya Muslim extremists attacked on 30 Police Posts and army base across Northern Rakhine jut one day after releasing of the Kofi Annan commission report, and the Muslim extremist attacks on non-Muslims minority native ethnic nationalities including Hindus. Muslims are majority that region with over  90% of the population.  Over two thirds of minority indigenous Non-Muslims (Rakhine Buddhists & Hindus) fled to the safety due to the extremist attacks. Thus one needs to condemn these armed extremist who are causing these atrocities.
Very glad to see that China did not blink.  Add this reversal to the growing list of broken campaign promises that Trump is accumulating:    Hillary locked up, nope;   Wall Street out of politics, big nope;  draining the swamp; nope;  Muslim ban, big nope;  separating personal/family business and politics, big nope.    At some point his supporters will realise they have been hoodwinked.
While some of McCarthy's methods may have been questionable, and he may have gone overboard in his obsession, the fact remains that communists were  embedded in many layers of government and Hollywood was full of them. Of course, just because one is a lefty doesn't make him a communist, but leftists tend to admire and support communists. You can be sure our government is full of people, including leftists, communists and muslims, who hate our country, our way of life and who wish us ill. Times haven't changed, and now, as then, anyone with the courage to tell the truth is called a racist, bigot, homophobe because the left deals only in emotions, never facts.
"Religious accommodation is not meant to mean setting up a mosque inside a public school" And that's not what's happening here. ------------------ Would Allan Ross accept "setting up Muslim prayer space"  then if not mosque?  Separation of Church and state ?
Geert Wilders accused   opposite of failing to stand up for Christians, and said resisting Islam was a matter of survival for the Netherlands. He has stated the following:  ‘Political Correctness and Islam Will Destroy Our Nation’ Why,Islam and democracy cannot coexist. And you can see that in, literally, every country in which Islam is dominant. We can see a total lack of freedom, you can see widespread violence and oppression, whether you are a Christian or Jew or whether you are an apostate or a critical journalist" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma2Tbkk8lZc ==== This as Justin Trudeau’s call to the world that Canada could be the first ever “post-national state” with “no core identity”.!!!!!! Talk about worlds apart,
I cant help but be reminded how much the right (and specifically Trump himself) constantly criticized Obama for refusing to say "Radical Islamic Terrorism" immediately when talking about terror events that usually occurred outside of the United States.  But now when it comes to our own domestic issues, our own President cant even call a spade a spade?  I mean, seriously, even Gardner and Sessions called it for what it is.  But apparently, it is more important to identify and properly call out hate and terrorist groups related to other nations, than ones being fed and rallied up in our own.
MP's should recognize the atrocity in Quebec for what it really was;  an expression of the deep-rooted, xenophobic nationalism that has threaded its way for centuries through pur laine francophone consciousness.  The ghastly partisanship within La Belle Province reared its ugly head before, notably in October 1970 with FLQ kidnappings, bombing and murder.  The quiet loathing of  the foreigner has always lingered there.    You may recall the antics of Pauline Marois and her 'secular charter', aimed, of course, primarily at Muslim women and their niqab. http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/tasha-kheiriddin-in-quebec-xenophobia-is-alive-and-well  Put such a motion before the House, condemning  Quebecois intolerance and watch the Liberals scream outrage from the rooftops.  The truth hurts, I suppose.
“To wink at racism or to condone it through silence, or false moral equivalence, or elision, as some do, is no better and no more acceptable than racism itself. Just as we can justly identify radical Islamic terrorism when we see it, and call it out, so can we all see the racists in Charlottesville, and understand that they are anathema in our society, which depends so centrally on mutual respect."  What a presidential president would have said about Charlottesville https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-a-presidential-president-would-have-said-about-charlottesville/2017/08/12/9f1ffec6-7fa4-11e7-9d08-b79f191668ed_story.html?hpid=hp_no-name_opinion-card-c%253Ahomepage%252Fstory&utm_term=.ddf036b2c7bc
If terrorists cited the Torah instead of yelling Allah Akabar with their last dying breaths as murderous 'martyrs',  you might have a point. Only Islam claims that the words of their holy book are given word for word, directly from god. And despite his direct 'miraculous' words, believers 'misconstrue' them (for centuries and all over the world in exactly the same way).
"Your islamophobic statement has been reported under M-103."  .  Expect a call from the Speaker Of The House, TDM, and have a lawyer ready.  Dick, you need to see someone about your fallacious logic.
Great article, but the premise is total B.S.!  We already have hate and discrimination laws in Canada!  islamophobia is a term that was invented in the 1990's by the muslim brotherhood to shut down all criticism of islam!  M103 is a national disgrace and a travesty being forced on Canadian's!
MANY Muslim majority countries have constitutions recognizing the supremacy of Allah.
They are Irish but converted to Islam. I suppose their kids when the grow up might decide to convert to Catholicism should they have the choice.
In 2002, Saudi Arabia's religious police forced schoolgirls back into a blazing building because they were not wearing head coverings and long black robes.  15 girls were brutally killed because they did not have the time to put on a niqab while escaping an inferno.  The niqab is the symbol of a ruthless religous ideology and many Muslim countries do ban full face coverings.  I hope that Canada follows Quebec example; full-face covering should be banned from public places­.
"the Islamic community"--yes, because all Muslims are exactly the same regardless of the version of Islam they practice or where they come from. I live on a street with Muslims. I see people walking their children to school and buying groceries just like anyone else. They do not reflect the stereotypes offered here.   Reading the comments on this forum one would think it was Muslims who carried out an attack at the end of January in Quebec instead of Muslims being gunned down.
"Hebdo was lauded for mocking muslims. Not so mocking white people." Spot on!
These people were in Myanmar for generations! This has nothing to do with the birth rate of any country. This has to do with the displacing, raping and murdering of one million peaceful Muslims. As the UN officials said, this is textbook ethnic cleansing and something needs to be done to stop it
The original poster commented that Boyle had probably converted to Islam prior to going to Afghanistan.  I responded that I was in agreement based on the fact that a co- worker in New Brunswick told a journalist in an interview that Boyle kept an islamic prayer mat at work and took breaks in order to pray.  That was the entire conversation.  It was you who misread  a simple statement of fact.  Perhaps you should read the entire thread before getting carried away with possible meanings that contradict what was actually written.  Save your outrage for where it might actually be needed.
Elite left thinkers are something. They judge others from the height of their ivory towers. Yet, it's not their neighborhood that is affected, nor are the majority of Muslims their neighbor. The elite have lots of land around their big houses to preserve their privacy, and they have country houses to retire to. Yet, they dare judge, and condemn, us poorer lot because of our decisions and choices. They say "we must open our borders to refugees. We must accept them." Yet, it's not they who accept them, it's us. They have no clue whatsoever as to what the reality is, here, down on the lowest floors. I too, would refuse a Muslim cemetery in my neighborhood because there are already spaces in existing cemeteries to accommodate them. Enough with the special treatment. Canada calls us "racist", yet, the rest of Canada has been openly racist towards us for centuries and nobody gives a hoot. I'd call that the pot versus the kettle. Where is the other shoe?
If one reflects upon the ideological alignment of the US Bishops (including some Cardinals) with the Republican Party around Ayatollah Trump and the right to alt-right one can see our western "leadership" rapidly cloning the ideological Muslim model.  It seems to boil down to the preservation of ideological privilege, personal advantage fed by the subservience of everybody else and their power to punish dissent and destroy everybody else.  Neither has the slightest idea how or willingness to try to deal with order in a world of moderation, inclusion, reason, and how to address difference - let alone evil. Clinging to what "monicadeangelis" terms the "Temple Priesthood Model" of Church is simply an evolutionary dead end. Redemption aside, for a moment, Jesus was smart. Whether "His" model can save the "repressed adolescence" model of hierarchy is a matter of faith in the Holy Spirit and a will to begin.
Finding this strangely surreal. Now high school sports in Alaska are dictated by the ideology of Islam? Whos culture is it? What about the rest of us that are not Muslim? (Majority). What happened to separation from church and state? Is that only reserved for the Christians? This is total B.S.  Play the games as scheduled no matter what religioys ideology a person follows.
So, now we are an ACTUAL pawn in Trump's "big body, wannabe tough guy" approach to International relations and diplomacy.   He decided to pick a fight, I think with calculation.  What's a few asians, eskimos and Hawiians in the Trump world?  Less people he has to try and figure out how to BAN in the future to appease his base.  Too bad the world is shaped the way it is.  NK being able to strike Mexico and South American countries first would have "made the day" for Trump and base.  Trump just put your life at ACTUAL RISK when it comes to NK potential nuclear aggression.  That ACTUAL RISK did not exist under any prior President.  That's what Trump did in the four and a half short months of his reign.  BUT!  He blocked Muslim grandparents and grandchildren from entering the country!!!  So, I guess that's something.
Thanks for proving my point.  Nobody is "pro illegal immigration". Which seems to be what people think if I simply say a wall is not the only solution on the table. Same thing with not being for a "muslim ban". That doesn't mean I'm pro terrorism or think it's not worth protecting people against.  I'm for border enforcement, I'm for the rule of law. I'm just not for grand expensive gestures that are meaningless and ineffective. I guess I'm conservative that way.
What I find interesting is, muslim students in catholic schools. What's the use of been 'Catholic" if anyone of any fate can attend the school, choose no to be part of the religious curriculum. Strange, very strange.
Buff, yes, you are right, you caught me.  I am biased against Donald Trump and the alt-right hate groups, both. I'm not fair and balanced. I believe that neo-nazis, KKK, and white supremacy are evil and that opposition to them is good as long as it isn't violent. And I believe that a president should not systematically intentionally undermine the legitimate free press. I do sympathize with BLM and the Islamic Society of North America, neither of which, as far as I can tell, is built on and/or believes in racial hatred, injustice, or bigotry. So yes, guilty of bias, I don't believe in the equivalence you suggest. But I can still oppose violent protest from whichever side it comes.
The people doing the name calling and ripping up the Koran, aren't Muslims. And none the less we shouldn't avoid a discussion just because there are some who won't be able to approach it in a responsible and adult manner.  What's your source for your assertion about why this started? In Toronto, one school started having prayer at school because the students would go to the mosque and then not go back to school afterwards. The school itself brought up the idea so that the students wouldn't skip out. You seem to be claiming that it's the parents who are doing this in order to force their kids to pray. Is another example of your fear of Muslims coming out? I doubt that the school is forcing the students to attend or reporting back to the parents f they don't.
Nazem Kadri is Muslim and my cousin currently plays on his line. Kadri is ten times the Canadian than any of the basement dwelling Muslim haters out there.
So the Arabs held the Greek work for a thousand years (the Greek civilization was over around 100 B.C.) without any modifications? Places like Gundeshpour (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundeshapur) were great Muslim universities where mathematics made great advances. And it wasn't just Greek, but Indian and Chinese texts that were translated there. In the Euro-centric history that you are taught, the contributions of non western civilizations is always suppressed. In fact, I bet you can't name one ancient Indian or Chinese scientist.  Europe learnt the decimal system (for example) through the Arabs (though India invented it). Algebra is an Arabic word.   And the greatest reason for western domination, gunpowder, came to Europe from China, through the Arabs. Even today, military weaponry is derived from variants of gunpowder. Neither the Greeks, nor the Romans, nor any other western country invented that.
NSDAP & Fascism differ. Fascism= Mussolini's attempt to unify & modernize Italy.   Both have been reduced to epithet by propagandists.  Imo it's extremely important to understand the those labels fully and objectively, not from pov of the enemies of Catholics, Christians and USA.  Frankly I'm not that Catholic anymore.  Catholics today seem to be far more cloistered than my semi-cloistered convent. I'm extremely concerned about US foreign policy; I thought RCism was in best position to be a counterweight to the real threats to Christianity (as well as Muslims) but too many RCs remain willfully blind to the real threats, out of a combo of ignorance, cowardice, laziness, and more understandable fact that they've been lied to for most of their lives.  It's difficult to penetrate the shell of lies & confront reality 1st, to make the effort, 2, to contain the rage at having been lied to; 3 form a positive solution. Colleen WAS used & wasted her energy in pursuit of undefined, empty goals.

There you go again, deliberately being the victim by deliberately interchanging the word People ( Muslim ) with Belief system/ Superstition (Islam). Everyone here supports People. As rational, objective people from Western Countries ( US, Europe, Australia) we can question and debate any belief system or superstitious we choose. You'll need a big supply of hankies to sob in if you think rational and objective Westerners will back down and not question a superstition
Re: "The USA has the right to prevent the spread of Islam in it's territory."  NO, actually, it doesn't. Their Constitution promises EVERYONE the right to believe as they choose. And, it also forbids Congress from passing ANY laws "respecting of religion.  Please stop spreading mis-/dis-information.  Re: "As for Graham visiting Vancouver, who cares?"  People who care about spreading hate in the name of religion seem to "care" - a LOT!
How many non-Muslims fear for safety ?  How many non-Muslim women fear to walk in some parts of European cities because of the clothes they wear ?
And so do your vapid one-liners.  Care to provide a real response, or you are just on duty (as usual) to "protect" by declaring anyone who would question the Islam-pandering  Liberal agenda, exploited by political Islamist,  a bigot, racist ( as if Islam is a race)?
Interesting, Winnipeg Warrior. Your impression is that media treats Muslim violence as individual acts and white violence as a societal problem. My impression is the reverse, that the media are more likely to treat Muslim violence as a product of Islam, and white violence as the result of mental imbalance. And many expect Muslim clerics to apologize for Muslim violence, but we don't expect the same of Christian clerics. We seem to believe what we want to believe. How do we resolve this?
And he should know that talking about his dream of getting some land and starting a "Muslim enclave" would not be very popular here, also.
Trump will go away someday- the problem is that tens of millions of Americans support a man who was clearly unqualified by experience, knowledge and temperament, a man who is both amoral and immoral, and a man who got (and still gets) loud applause for insulting millions of innocent Latinos, millions of innocent Muslims, encouraging white supremacists  with his nods and winks and statements about "fine" individuals in their midst, and who even mocked a disabled person, while also reducing women to sex objects.  Yet millions voted for him, including women, including a majority of white Catholics, including a majority of so-called "christians".  Trump will pass, but will the "movement" he unleashed - of hatred, of fear, of scapegoating, pass with him?  Jeff Sessions is pursuing a racist agenda at DOJ, the Republicans in Alabama nominated a man so bigoted he was removed from the courts. You see many here who defend Trump and his agenda. What does that say about the state of our nation?
By quoting DJT declaring his action to be a Muslim ban you have also put Dillwinkel Dillwinkel on record as declaring that trump is a member of the left. Good job.
I liken this rabble of the left destroying statues to ISIS who are bombing historical monuments to wipe out the past they are trying erase How can we go forward is we don;t remember or learn from the past?  Thus one can easily see and assume that the radical left, natives, narco-fems, and every other wierdo group are trying to wipe out our history because they are simply ISIS in the mirror  It was Obama btw who opened the wounds of class. It was Obama who told blacks to organize into Black Lives Matter, It as Obama who split America down race, economic, and cultural lines.  Trump is just reaping the horror as the slobbering zombie left that was triggered and unleashed by agent provacateurs paid for by two billionaires hell bent on creating a Caliphate in the West.  Again the left as ISIS has never been discussed but needs to be.  We should also audit the Trudeau Foundation it is receiving 100s of millions form Arab groups to open the borders to Muslims. Why is this never discussed?
does not meter what happens to the bill Mr.Trump will not live to tell the tail if he goes on with this form of muslimani he is putting more cross hair on American working abroad in all non Muslim countries.  he is just not going to lay down and give up he and his sidekicks will try everything to get this bill  passed even though it might cost him big time which he really does not care about just that he is right about the Muslim factor in all holly wars and there involvement in them.  he is waking up a sleeping giant in america who we call the neo nazi front and the hells angels gang and of course the white supremacist group arena nation and last but not least the Ku Klux Klan who are still alive and well doing it in the shadow as alway in Washington and in Chicago area and even in California.
To put things in context, there are three times as many moslems compared to jews in Canada, yet in absolute terms, there are twice as many hate crimes against jews compared to crimes against moslems.  After the shootings at the mosque, many synagogue members in Montreal and Toronto formed  "human rings" around neighbouring mosques in a show of support.  It would have been a nice reciprocal gesture had the moslems included jews and other minority groups in their request to the government for more tools to fight hate crimes. Instead, they just focussed on their  own requirements..
So, if half of all Canadians think that immigration is damaging the country's culture, how come there is not a single member of parliament asking the question on behalf of the electorate whether it needs to be scaled back?  This is where the problem lies in Canada.  There is no real representation of the people and their views.  And now they intend to shove that anti-Islamophobia law down the throats of people?  In other words, they will make it illegal to question whether a massive Muslim influx is a wise choice or not?
Rightfully so. But I'd go even further and call this NYC perpetrator inHuman cause he killed innocent humans who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. No respect for innocent lives at all.  Who knows some of them may have been of the Muslim/Islam Faith. And if they're were I guess these Islamists could say those followers died for the sake of Islam and Allah, they were sacrifices for the greater good(in their eyes) of spreading Islam. :(
It is an undeniable fact that different faith communities in Canada have their own cemeteries. Why should Muslims be denied these rights?  "Religious preference leads people to be buried in different cemeteries, e.g., Catholic, Jewish, Protestant (of various varieties), interfaith or nondenominational. In the past, people of minority races and of "disapproved" ethnic origins were forced to be buried apart from others".  http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/cemeteries/
Uh, Islam takes many forms, and in Saudi, a fundamentalist approach is very much in place, similar to Christian fundamentalism. Culture often dictates how the religion is engaged in its culture. If it were actually a religion of violence, billions more Muslims would already have taken over the world.  Look at the United Arab Emirates. Jennifer Anniston is in two of Emirates Airlines major television ads.  I lived in Saudi Arabia, and I know how the religion, which is actually very split when it comes to "sects" around the world, varies due to "culture". Shia vs Sunni is just one example. (I also took social psychology in college.)  Fundamentalist Christians in different denominations and sects have and have had strict more codes on dress in the past. Cultural development, not religion, has changed this. The Amish still dress like they do. Mormon women are criticized by peers if they wear hot miniskirts and low-cut tops, etc.  That they released her says volumes.
There are deeper issues here.    Many religious people were born into a specific doctrine and had no choices.    There seems to be a need for more freedoms and choices.    For example, it wasn't long ago that Catholics were `indoctrinated' to have large families.   Fortunately, that seems to have waned.   But many Muslim families are 5, 7, 9 children.     Also some religions have passages inciting hatred and even death for non-believers.   All in all, there seems to be a need for an on-going push on all religions for more emphasis on just the Golden Rule and dropping of other religious doctrines.    Many years ago when I was a child, my father said that no one deserves a larger headstone than any one else.  I think this also suggests that when we die, we drop our silly `dressings' and lie side by side as dust to dust and ashes to ashes.
Laughable. Facebook is the main contact and method of communication of Arab/Muslim/Islamic terrorists. Even I would agree to boycott Facebook in that case.
>>> "And it is a fantasy for a party heavily populated by African-Americans, Muslims, the LGBTQ, immigrants and other marginalized peoples yearning to breathe free in an increasingly oppressive environment, to think it can attract angry, older white voters who believe that what America really needs is to be made "great again." <<<  Fascinating that Mr. Pitts thinks dividing people into competing tribes (also called "interest groups") is a solution to common problems in a civil society. When and where has this worked to create harmony? And moving to the political extreme, by definition, means excluding consensus, balance, fairness, respect for others, and compromise. I would like to mourn the death of the idea of the brotherhood of man, but Mr. Pitts would no doubt condemn my words as sexist without looking at the content of the phrase.
I would hardly describe an interview of Kellie Leitch by Mark Steyn as wonderful. She's a divisive figure and he panders to the far right. And I certainly wouldn't describe anything they said as being TRUE, CIVIL, or DECENT.  I have no problem debating. But that requires one concedes what is FACT and what is OPINION. That one cannot distort the truth and make up facts or set up Strawmen. If you cannot admit that the Muslim teens at this school have a right to practice their religion, you shouldn't be commenting.  The question hasn't been about them setting up another separate school system. It is whether they can take a 15 minute break on Fridays at the school rather than simply skip Friday afternoons to attend service without being called Truants. Jews get the Sabbath off. Christians get Sunday off. Why do you feel so hostile to giving Muslim teens what amounts to a coffee break off on a Friday afternoon?  Sheesh! My Canada includes accommodation. Sorry.
I received an email report from my Rep. Tulsi Gabbard about this trip. I don't care if Azerbaijan banns, nor did I care negatively  about her fact finding trip to SYRIA with former Rep. Dennis Kucinish, Ohio. whom many in Hawaii respect. I hope that the next Congressional fact finding trip will be to PALESTINE. People there have endured genocide since their land was taken in 1948 to creat ISRAEL. Conditions are quite cruel under Israeli illegal occupation. Perhaps congress could stop funding the war crimes of Israel toward the Palestinians, CHRISTIAN and Muslim. That would be a step in the right direction.
Except, of course, it is NOT exactly a ban on Muslims.....
The very definition of "Nazi" is "National Socialist  German Workers Party"    They were "socialists" by definition.. You can look it up in Wikipedia.  They were basically the 'right wing' of socialism, Communism being the left.   Two sides of the same totalitarian coin.   But you proved my point that, "there probably is some hatred among those on the far left"  Thank you! You just affirmed that which I didn't "show"  The socialist, Jeremy Christian,  supported    Bernie Sanders. Sanders was man enough to apologize for it.  Jeremy hated Muslims, Jews and Christians and  is  typical of the  'confused'  religion hating,  left wing zealots of today. They are volatile, usually un-employed, like most of Hitler's supporters were in the 20's and 30's.   They feed on racial, ethnic and religious  hatred/tensions, exploiting it wherever they can.    Laws  must be upheld.      Those who break our laws,   need to be punished, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or political affiliation.
"Why single out practitioners of Islam?"  Cause their the only ones taking pictures while holding heads maybe?
So the three Anchorage shootings this weekend were radical Islamists?
The actions of a couple wastoids galvanize the Muslim Protective Society(Democrats) into action every time. Watch the White Hate tirade spew forth. Rip America a new one, Sequim Gazette. Don't hold back, let's see what you got.
It's possibly worse at the level of doctrine.    I'm not all that excited about any of the Abrahamic religions and since Islam has not gone through a reformation it's especially problematic right now. Though that reformation thing didn't really help too much in Northern Ireland.
People down vote this kumbaya post because extremist Islam is not like other religions.........
Because the millennial progressive journalists at the Globe have been instructed at university to accept and accommodate any form of diversity or else they are being racist.  So, like for our PM, there is only a sunny side to political Islam - selective vision makes everything wonderful.
Yup, in your obsession with Muslims you've proved  some of their ancient texts are as hostile to gays as is the  Old Testament, the basis of the Judeo-Christian  moral code.  Fortunately, the majority of American Christians, Jews, and Muslims have moved beyond this level of tribal hatreds and have shown  great sympathy for the 50 dead--   THAT is the solution here- how about you? https://webmail.uoregon.edu/?_task=mail&_caps=pdf%3D0%2Cflash%3D1%2Ctif%3D0&_uid=34469&_mbox=INBOX&_safe=1&_action=show
Here are several:  A Christian student tradition called "SYATP", or See You at the Pole Christian students used to pray for the coming school year.  After several hostile incidents and being told they could not use a classroom for the prayer day, they started meeting at schools various flag poles.  Canadian universities use discriminatory hiring practices against Christians, as well as being told they actually have to hire professors who do not fit into the University's moral or ethical codes.   Christian chaplains are being told they cannot speak to Muslim students, because they claim that the chaplains are inciting blasphemy.  A multi-use prayer room at Western University gave way for a Muslim-dedicated prayer room.  You can google all of these, except the one about the chaplains.  This wasn't even covered by media, but was in churches in Ontario.. You can bet if a Muslim Imam was told to stop talking to non-muslims it would be all over MSM.  There IS a definite double standard.
What do you think is going on? Islam is not being introduced to the students. Instead, Muslim students are being given permission to go to a part of the school to pray for 15 minutes each Friday. Whoa! Is that so terrible? It's not public. It's not part of the official curriculum. And we accommodate other "private matters" in the school. You just seem a bit out of the loop.
Hedzer, you are wrong about what Fox News said.  Here is is exactly:  "A correction now: Over the course of this last week we have made some regrettable errors on air regarding the Muslim population in Europe, particularly with regard to England and France.   "Now, this applies especially to discussions of so-called ‘no-go zones,’ areas where non-Muslims allegedly aren’t allowed in and police supposedly won’t go.   "To be clear, there is no formal designation of these zones in either country and no credible information to support the assertion there are specific areas in these countries that exclude individuals based solely on their religion.   "There are certainly areas of high crime in Europe as there are in the United States and other countries — where police and visitors enter with caution.   "We deeply regret the errors and apologize to any and all who may have taken offense, including the people of France and England."
I was obviously referring to the following outburst:  <<Is this what is being taught by Professor Garcia? Indoctrination of his students with screed?>>  Hilarious.  <<what attacks on our Constitutional liberties has been launched by Mr. Trump?>>  Well, the First Amendment. Thus was the Muslim Ban struck down.  <<Whose payroll?>>  I do wonder.
An Egyptian Muslim just-arrived in the United States on a Diversity Visa—precisely the type that Donald Trump is trying to blame for the bike-path murders on Halloween in Lower Manhattan—in fact stopped a terrorist atrocity that would have been much, much worse in 1997 on the New York City subway.  https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-diversity-visa-winner-who-saved-new-york-from-a-terror-attack?source=twitter&via=desktop
Actually, just the opposite is true here.   People like Carey Hilbert who want to hide away the horror of terrorist acts, are themselves actually helping to serve the terrorist cause.  People need to understand just how monstrous these acts of Islamic terrorists are.   To hided this horror away, is to deny just how evil this threat is.  People need to understand just how inhuman these atrocities are.    And a picture will always help convey that, much better than any written description ever will.
Vatican Muslim didnt know that! Thanks for the update.
Are you sure you aren't remembering things wrong?  I don't recall Trump espousing "hope and change."  Trump was elected under a mantra of "Make America Great" and here's the important part, "Again."  This wasn't a call for change but a return to greatness primarily based upon old concepts like isolationism (Muslim ban, Mexican wall), protectionism ("America first" for treaties and trade agreements) and, based upon recent conduct both here and throughout America, stiggin' it ta da lefties (repeal ACA, lock her up, etc.)
So, Muslims are not "our people"? Let's say the number of Black violence equals that of Muslims; do they then become NOT "our people? When white violence, does; do they then become NOT "our people"? I believe it's spelled: "Habeas"
Islam means " Submission". Every Muslim must submit to Allah and thus to Islam. . It is the duty of every Muslim to put Islam first, before any man made law or non Muslim. To refuse to comply with their demands, or to simply resist submission to Islam is  deemed Islamophobic. Our own desires to live our lives as we wish is irrelevant to Islam. We ought to be concerned about Islamic supremacy which is manifested in Bill M-103  legislation against free speech.
Mostly by other Muslims.
Yet amazingly hundreds of thousands of Muslims live in Canada without any issues. You and other similar posters are making gross generalizations which is why you are regularly called out for it.
This shooting was terrible, and absolutely  destructive to not just the shooting victims, but also American society as a whole..  The media (and GBA)  report that the shooter was one James T. Hodgkinson of Illinois, known to be  anti-Republican and a rabid Trump-hater. Much as many of us detest Trump and current Republican policies, there is absolutely no justification for this sort of political violence within Liberal social philosophy. I hope most all  of America's liberals  and "Leftists" would join me in condemning this armed attack on some Republican leaders peacefully practicing baseball. Our nation is tense and any political violence is likely to cause a violent reprisal of its own. It's a sad story  that when we hear of such a horrid event, we immediately ask, "was it terrorism?"  And, "was it by extremists of the Right, the Left, Blacks, Muslims , government reps, or just a                                                                                   total mental case?
AI1144, no, disagreeing with the notion of public money being spent on prayer rooms does not make one 'anti-muslim.'  But keep in mind that many of the people posting here have been doing so for months or years, and it's pretty clear who is anti-muslim.
Taking in people occurred after Canadian soldiers were attacked.  Canadian soldiers were attacked  after Canada attacked Muslims in Afghanistan.   Bring our troops home for their sake and the sake of their families.
Trudeau has never had the west in his heart. From day one he has been sympathetic to communism and islamic extremists.
"These gestures are the result of a minority of citizens who were already hostile to immigrants in general or to Muslims but who did not dare to display it beforehand. The debate had the effect of mitigating or eliminating their inhibitions, as well as thickening the clouds of suspicion and fear that surrounded newcomers in a section of public opinion.”  I think this is a correct assessment of the situation, especially when the xenophobic influences of Brexit and Trump are added in.   Mr Taylor and Mr Couillard  are right: the passage, and even the debating of Bill 62 will do more harm than good. Everyone is entitled to wear clothing or insignia that reflects their religious beliefs.  Kill Bill 62.
Please show me where i "support" a Muslim ban - which, of course, it isn't....but anyway.  Show me where please?
Maybe you should live in a country like Russia, China or any Muslim nation for awhile and then please inform us on how unjust the American Justice system is.
It is being reported by a national news outlet that the Hawaii plaintiff, Iman Ismail Elsikh of the Muslim Association of Hawaii in the suit blocking Trump's temporary travel ban from the six mainly moslem countries,  is directly tied to the North American Islamic Trust which owns the property on which the mosque is located.  The North American Islamic Trust operates the majority of mosques across the US and is a front organization for the Muslim Brotherhood, a terrorist organization which has been so designated and banned in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.    The Muslim Brotherhood will likely  be designated by the federal government as a terrorist organization very soon.  Makes me wonder why our political ruling elite here are so eager to associate themselves with people who are closely allied with organization  like the North American Islamic Trust and the Moslem Brotherhood who wish to wage jihad against the West and impose Islamic rule worldwide.
I suspect this was not an attack on "children" but on girls and teens who behave in "un-Islamic," "immodest" behaviour rather than being demure and focused solely on learning to be a obedient (young) wife and mother.
Chris I think it has been shown that ArabséMuslims and Jews do not get along. So it seems impossible to have a Jewish state in the Middle East. The Jewish leaders are being very selfish in wanting their people to live in violence for life. All for a chunk of sand.
Doug Chin gives priority to muslims... hey maybe OJ will convert and be welcomed with open arms and narrow closed minds.
Thanks for a thought provoking comment.  I am not sure if "secularization has mutated into a militantly anti-Christian and anti-Church ideology" or if Christian ideology has not mutated into a "militantly anti-secular society" ideology.  Both "sides" are battling. .Same is true in Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist societies - the religion is trying to control the secular society.  It worries me that we need the influence of faith based people to know how to live together, to not fall into traps of nationalism, which is tribalism writ larger.   All these faiths do teach us a basic respect for one another, of the God given humanity we all share.  But each faith wants to determine social rules that all must live by.  Maybe they just want villages of their own faith and separation of people by faith groups.    That isn't going to work.  We are in a time of globalism, of movement of people across and around the world, of instant and constant communication capabilities.  Faiths must learn to get along
Do not trust Snopes. I have lived in Japan, they are extremely allergic to Muslims being there. I'll give you 50 bucks if you know a single one who has emmigrated there.
I am more concerned that she and the other members of the Alaska Congressional delegation have been silent on Cruz's call for special patrols in Muslim neighborhoods in the U.S.? What is she, Sullivan, and Young waiting for? Walls with razor wire surrounding the neighborhoods?  Muslims being forced to wear yellow crescents on their clothing? Kristallnacht?  Doesn't an oath of office mean that one doesn't to stand by while a candidate calls for political oppression of members of a specific religion in the United States?   p.s. Maybe they can also tell us if they support Trump or Cruz.
This isn't the Koranic trend where Islam does not consider itself as other religions and must...DOMINATE !...
A Muslim illegal migrant purposely crushed an 11 year old child with a stolen truck.  Let's call it what it is.
Wow, a bunch of posts supporting democracy and the vote just disappeared here, including mine. Censorship at its finest, nothing new at the G&M. They used to not allow comments at all on articles related to muslims, now they have gone one better, they only allow positive, fawning comments.
Why are you perpetuating this fantasy that the Harper Cons were somehow different from the party of Kellie Leitch? This is demonstrably and obviously false. Leitch singled out Muslims as the "other," as enemies of Canada. This is the only group she attacked. In this, she doubled down on what the Harper Cons had done with absolute consistency throughout their entire time in power. The "barbaric practices hotline" was not, in any way, an aberration. It was something that the party had been heading towards for some time.  The Harper Cons reached out to other communities, but they always peddled in intolerance.
It is simply wrong to condemn all Muslim refugees for the acts of the very few. The identity of the perpetrator is not even confirmed at this time but the flood of irrational hate begins - always the usual suspects.
"mostly female Muslim head-covered bloggers"  And you say that some people 'play the the racist, bigotry and what have you card.'  Imagine.
The way that the Editorial direction of this newspaper has been heading, they will be moving into smaller and smaller offices until no one is left to close the door.   A few things to consider:  - Political correct articles are not helping.  - Treating "whites" and "males" in a constant bad light. - Constant biased opinion pieces.  - Repetitive articles from same authors. - Downright racist articles (hiding under political correctness) articles. - Overload of Muslim/refugee/Islamic articles. - Calling everyone who voted for Trump or Brexit xenophobic racists!  The list goes on....
You know about 'Machismo' and Mexican males? Nieto's suffering from a major case. It's an irrational behavior characteristic of men in a paternalistic society like Mexico which leads to self destruction as it's considered disgraceful to reasonably accommodate an opposing view. You know it in Canada as It's common amongst the followers of Sharia law and Islam. It's why Mexico is a failed state.   It's actually a brilliant move of Trump. Trump wants regime change in Mexico and he'll get it as Nieto can't back down now. Next target is Trudeau. Should be easier to attack Trudeau's vain and superficial characteristics
First we needed strength.  Then diversity.  Then unity.  What we need is stop radical islamic terrorism in its tracks.  Do not let people in this country until you can vet them properly.
" mandatory Islamic studies in the public school system; "  What are you talking about?? There is no such thing.
And how many Christians have been murdered by Muslims?  We are a country founded by Christians, and the progressive politicians are attacking anything that resembles a Christian based family or being able to celebrate Christian based holidays......eg.  Happy Holidays has replaced Merry Christmas, Christmas Concerts cannot have the nativity story in them, nor be called Christmas Concerts, Cadbury just had an Egg Hunt,  leaving out Easter in the equation, Traditional Families with a Mother and Father are being changed on birth certificates in Ontario to read 'Parent', omitting the Mother and Father terms......and the media who seem to be endlessly pushing the Pro-Muslim agenda along with the so called Progressive movement cannot fathom why people are ticked that there are now Muslim Prayer accommodations in Public Schools.......roll eyes......wow.
Except the Buddhists didn't kill any Muslims in Afghanistan.
Your only concrete justification for prohibiting muslim kids from using a classroom to pray, was: "we have police at school meetings and kids who are apparently scared"  And sorry, I don't think a court is going to blame the muslim kids for that one.  Like a couple of others here, it appears you'd be happy if Canada had the same standards as Saudi Arabia.  And that's sad.  Here's the thing: since religious freedom IS a Charter right, and there's no concrete reason it can't be accommodated, it's up to those opposed to justify not allowing it.  That's the way it works.  And you've provided nothing so far.  And really . . .  you think that hate threats by bigots should justify stopping it?  That's a head-shaker.
Thousands of US parents have sacrificed their children in the war.  Why Khan is so special?  Is it because he is a Muslim with connection to Hillary, that he is being appeased?
I posted that Muslims don't like bacon. My comment disappeared after 5 minutes.
20x more terrorist acts committed by white supremecists in the US last year compared to Islam  Similar stats elsewhere
In another 50 years Canada will break up join parts of the USA (that have broken from the USA), other parts of Canada will join China, other parts will join India and finally Canada will have large pockets of Independent Muslim nations loyal to Saudi Arabia.
I constantly question our motives.  My dad came here after WWII because the Russians were going through his country (Slovakia), and taking all of the young men off to labor camps.  They also took his parents' farm.  Someone here said we fight for freedom, but we certainly rolled over and let Russia stick it to Eastern Europe, didn't we?  Sometimes it stinks that countries go through upheavals and turmoil.  But, I've always been a firm believer that outsiders don't understand a country like its own people, and those citizens have to find their own way.  Besides, if we really want to help people, why not drop food, medical, and infrastructure on them instead of bombs?  I'd bet the Muslims in the middle east would think much different about us had we done that instead of constantly intervening with our military and missiles.
Is this now the Globe & Islam or why this heavy advertisement for a religion that is less than 5% of the Canadian population? Or is this part of a series? Then I am waiting for a similar story about orthodox Judaism/Buddhism/Hinduism/Christianity and so forth. Thank you.
Like most cultures, Islamic culture has its good points and bad points. There are many aspects of Islamic civilisation that are admirable, such as its art and architecture, its literature and music, the beautiful artifacts, rugs, textiles, food, traditions of hospitality and concern for the poor, etc.   Unfortunately its bad points are the ones most in evidence recently, because those are the ones that affect non-Muslims the most.
Logic says you should judge a belief system by the behavior of the majority of its adherents, not the fringe. Ever ask yourself why the billions of peaceful Muslims don't see mass murder instructions in the Koran? Perhaps it's because they understand that not all religious texts are to be taken literally.  Let's cut to the chase. You want a reason to blame the actions of terrorists on Islam -- even though they represent a fraction of a percent of Muslims -- so you can justify keeping Muslim refugees out of the U.S. I don't find that reasoning either logical or charitable.  I'm moving on.
- An off-hand comment repudiating decades of US-China relations; - Opinion - you have no idea what China is thinking   - A campaign to keep Muslims out of the country that began with comments on the campaign trail and has so far manifested itself in a clumsy, ham-handed, and possibly illegal travel ban; - Read the order, it does not mention Muslims  - A complete disdain for ethics laws, and especially those involving conflicts of interest with his family's businesses; - Opinion  - A clear lack of understanding of the rules and function of government; Opinion  - Upending the National Security Council by replacing the Joint Chiefs of Staff with a political hack who has a fetish for the apocalypse; That is why we elected him  - Skipping intelligence briefings to tweet commentary about his daughter's business failings; Where are you getting this ? Every day thing ?   - Continuing allegations regarding ties to the Russian government - ties that may be he result of blackmail. - Speculation
62% of Canadians support or partially support Bill 62. Why? Because they are racists? Because they hate Muslims? No, it is because the notion of "Other", as symbolized by women who wear the niqab or the burka, is too far for them to accept the differences. The issue for the Federal government to address is not Bill 62, but Canadians' reactions to the bill, and Canadian's capacities to face the "Other".
"The racists embrace conservative values like respecting the flag, saying Merry Christmas" Wow, just wow. You have truly lost it. Consider your comments here bookmarked for future reference Do you know why racists want people to say "Merry Christmas"? Because the Klan, the Nazis, and other racists DON'T want to admit there are JEWS in this country! They don't want to admit that Chanukah falls in December. They don't want to admit that Ramadan can fall in December. Well, guess what, Thor? In 2030, 2031, and 2032 Ramadan happens in December again! This whole "war on Christmas" phony baloney began during the 1990s, when Ramadan fell around Christmas time, and some merchants decided to respect their Christian, Jewish, and Muslim customers by saying "Happy Holidays". And the USPS issued Chanukah and Ramadan postage stamps. You and Bill O'Reilly went nuts. So, saying "Happy Holidays" fundamentally changes America? Well, guess what? The USA isn't just for Christians any more.
Facts continued,   The over 1.8 Billion Muslims Worldwide determine what Islam is or is not, not the minority Millions living at the U.S. , Europe, or other Nations.  Why Muslims cannot assimilate like the Japanese Immigrants did,  Muslim definition by Muslims, Islamic Believer completely subjugated to Islam, "Islam Is All", All Politics, Laws, Religion, Culture, History, Ways of Life, that supersede the politics, laws, religions, cultures, history, ways of life of all other Nations, Countries.  Therefore as Ordered by Islamic Laws the Muslims Must have Islam supersede "Western Civilization and Culture".   The Holy Koran and Hadith are Modern Law for Muslims.  "Collaborators to the Christians, Jews and Unbelievers must die a horrible murdering to dwell in that firey place".  "The God and Prophets of the Christians and Jews are False.  They must be made to see this, they must become Subjugated to Islam"  Mandatory Islamic Tithes to Support & Fund the Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam.
Israel has their own reasons for doing this. I's obvious the more divided the Islamic world of the Middle East is the better for Israel.
Hey Alceste, have you read  “Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now”  by Ayaan Hirsi Ali.  It'll put a different spin on your point of view.   Remember knowledge is power.
nothing new here folks this decision was expected, this country is founded on judeo Christian values and muslim countries don't want Christians in there country and they keep us out we should have the travel ban and keep them out turnabout is fair play as I see it.
A quick google search finds: "In recent decades, the Muslim share of the population throughout Europe grew about 1 percentage point a decade, from 4% in 1990 to 6% in 2010. This pattern is expected to continue through 2030, when Muslims are projected to make up 8% of Europe’s population." - Pew Research Center  Muslims make up a very small percentage of Europe's population now, and even looking into the foreseeable future their numbers will be small.
Christians and Muslims always at it.  Comical they basically worship the same god.
Except there is a growing debate between liberal Muslims and their more "pious" peers. It's not secret that countries governed by Islamic law treat free expression and gender equality with contempt (often violent). Women are forced to submit to male authority under the guise of religious piety, that is the issue (as if a women's natural cycle makes them dirty or they should pray at the back so not to arouse men). Women who subscribe to the Islamic faith but embrace their independence as empowered liberal Muslims are shunned, intimidated, and even threatened with physical violence.  There is a reason Ataturk implemented strict secular rules at the founding of modern Turkey, it's because Islamists never stop - Ataturk's vision lasted for almost 70 years and it has taken Erdogan's AKP under 8 years to regress Turkey towards Iran circa 1979, go figure.
Here in the USA we don't have queens, we have presidents. And I'll be voting for Tulsi for president. Two tours of duty, unafraid to call Islamic Terrorism "Islamic Terrorism", but preaching love instead of hate, she is everything our country needs. But "you can't please everyone", so, even after her 81%-19% re-election, there will always be some opposed to her.
How can a woman in a burqa attend a feminist march?  You see, that's the problem with diversity and inclusion, i.e. when what you are including is intolerance and discrimination against women based on religion, and anti-feminist values such as within Islam and sharia law.
Duh, because even Trump is smart enough to know that if he tried to extend it to all Muslims and named it as what it really is that it would have been tossed out even faster than his partial ban.  Rudy Guiliani has been extensively quoted as saying that Trump approached him about how to do a Muslim ban and make it "legal". The compromise, for the sake of his base, is the one that has now been tossed out twice. Sheer incompetence. Fortunately.  What else would you like to know?
Conservatives are citation averse because what they "feel" becomes the truth. See: Obama born in Kenya, Obama a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Benghazi, Trickle Down Economics Works!
Dear ALLAN ROSS  "Religious accommodation is not meant to mean setting up a mosque inside a public school" And that's not what's happening here --------------- Allan's objection was to "a mosque" so i clarified, not "mosque" but "Muslim prayer space" for Allan's sake then Allan goes spinning and dancing all over --------------------------  You know you don't have to cut and paste my post to reply right? Juts click "reply" and the system will do that for you. Given the extent to which you comment over and over I would have expected you'd ave figured that out by now.  Allan deflecting with trivialities
Seems to me that anti-western sentiment on the part of Muslims who wish to destroy our way of life and replace it with Sharia Law is the main cause of backlash.  Any quasi intelligent person who reads up on the Qu'ran will quickly understand the Muslim mind set.    May I suggest that Sharia Law with all of it's sixth century thinking (brought forward to today)  be taught (exposed) to uninformed non-Muslim Canadians.
Simple.....one reason is that ISIS is not being trained there, nor are they exporting terrorism.  Besides that, it is not a muslim ban.  And yes, it is legal and justified as the SCOTUS will soon prove.  Your Hawaii guy is just plain wrong.  He ruled just based on PC, which runs through his veins, and which is exposing us all to harm.  He did not rule on the law, but on his own bias. It has gone too far.  Hawaii never gets this stuff right.  Too many democrats to run an efficient state in most ways that matter.  Aloha is good, but blind aloha will be exploited.  The times are changing, those that blind themselves to this fact will rue the day eventually.
I find it all very amusing how in the 90's all the SJW's were up in arms if my christian cross that I wore around my neck was visible. There were laws enacted that government workers couldn't wear a visible cross while working at their jobs, and my religion was always maligned. Now the very same SJW's say that the muslims have all the rights to the world to their religion and their customs, etc. I guess the only intolerance still allowed in this country is toward Christians and white men.
They are called Muslims.
I've pointed out to my liberal friends that they need to focus on things that make Trump uniquely awful like the #MuslimBan rather than stuff they would oppose if Jeb! was president.  Once Trump's policies like the Muslim Ban are overturned and he is (hopefully) impeached then Ds and Rs can go to battle over their policy disagreements.  There are lots of GOPers, especially upscale suburbanites who hold mainstream Republican positions, but are horrified by Trump.  Liberals are wasting their support by focusing on things like DeVos rather than remaining laser focused on Trump's bigotry.
So the scorpion can't change its nature. The last sting by Obama. The major hindrance to Israel’s negotiating position in future peace talks is absence of the real partner interested in the resolution.  First the Palestinian faction can't talk to each other civilly.  Then Hamas is bent on extermination of Israel ad is interested in short term ceasefires to obtain more weapon.  Also the Islamic world will never accept existence of the non Muslim state in the ME.
We have hate speech laws. What about the irrational fear and proselythising of the religious cults and skyfaerie worshippers against non believers and the secular a-religious?! Where in the motion im103 is there any additional protections from relgious cults?   Besides equating religion with racism is disingenuous and fallacious. You dont choose an ethnicity, yet one chooses to worship and have faith in  a religious cult!  Finally what does islamophobia really mean other than irrational fear of islam? Does it mean one fears just fanarics or theocracies? What about secular muslims or moderatea? It is such an ill defined and sweeping word so as to be a dangeroua catch-all!
- An end to the “pink mafia”.  - Affirmation of the teaching of the universal ordinary magisterium on ordination.  - Affirmation that clerical celibacy remains the norm.  - Affirmation of the Church’s norms for priestly formation.  - Affirmation that clergy and religious should identify as such publicly.  - Paraphrase of the Roman Missal replaced with a translation.  - Saints for the new millennium infallibly declared.   - Service at the altar viewed as source of vocations.  - V II Council viewed in continuity.  - Provision for Catholics in the Anglican tradition.  - Provision for Catholics in the Latin tradition.  - Clarification that “churches” require the apostolic succession.  - Clarification that Islam is not a substitute for Christianity.  - Clarification that Christ fulfilled the OT promises.  - Restoration of religious institutes.  - Reaffirmation the end does not justify the means.  - Restoration of historic practices.  - Church nearly doubles in size.
"Okay, I see that angle, but they killed people. There was no rule of law. "  You're confusing post-Gaddafi Libya with pre-Gaddafi Libya.  Libya was once Africa's wealthiest state per capita.  Now it is a cesspool for ISIS, Al Qaeda, and other radical Islamic terrorist groups.    What's most bizarre about the whole Benghazi "controversy" is that nobody bothered to ask the question:  why wasn't Benghazi safe in the first place?  Why were there terrorist groups roaming around the city completely unopposed?  Because we destroyed that country.  We destroyed their entire government and the military, literally.  They didn't have one anymore.  That's why the Ambassador died.  That never would have happened if we didn't bomb Libya in the first place.  We destroyed that country.  Compared to now, life was great under Gaddafi.  You can talk about the bad things but when you compare it to today, it's no comparison.  Today is *objectively* worse than under Gaddafi.
I agree and also believe that any suggestion that Christians are threatened more than others is wrong.  Muslims who do not agree with the ones doing the violence are just as much at risk.  Assad is not targeting Christians, but those Muslims who disagree with him.
"Podesta responds by mentioning the creation of Catholic in Alliance for the Common Good and Catholics United.". Rather misleading, the actual quote is “We created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this. But I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up”. Certainly an admission that the Democrats created these top down phony front groups to try to undermine Church teaching. I don't see how any Catholic can say this is not a scandal.  MSW failed to mention the racism at work as well, also from Podesta "Some groups of people are almost always highly successful given only half a chance (Jews*, Hindus/Sikhs and Chinese people, for example), while others (Muslims, blacks** and Roma***, for instance) fare badly almost irrespective of circumstances"
Then by your definition Islamophobia does not exist. You include those who claim "none of this system of beliefs." Therefore you have a category within Islam who are afraid of themselves. Don't misunderstand me. We should have a fear of those institutions that condone human behavior by fiat.
Islam the religion of peace?
"...there is no difference in the intent of murderer in Las Vegas and the wannabe murderer in Canada this past weekend."  That sounds pretty clear, moon howler.  My assumption is that your word "intent" is used as a substitute for "motive."  Correct? If so...  You are wrong.  We don't KNOW the intent (motive) of the guy in Las Vegas. Maybe (gasp) he didn't have one. He may not have been in the thrall (or employ) of a known terrorist organization.  He may not have been politically motivated in any way. The Muslim arrested on charges stemming from the Edmonton very likely was.     The guy in Las Vegas may not have even been certifiably mentally ill.  He ACTED like he was--but that's a different thing.  MY point is, WE DON'T KNOW. And neither do you.   And "the resulting carnage"--some injuries no deaths in Edmonton; lots of dead and wounded in Las Vegas, is irrelevant to this debate.
As a teenage WASP in the '60s I was more than susceptible to all the hatred and venom poured onto those other than White Anglo Saxon Protestants. Seems like only yesterday that the "Other" were the "Wops, Kikes, Polacks, Spics, Greasers, Gooks, Slopes, Frogs, Krauts, niggers, and on and on. Commie were to be feared above all else no matter where they were from and now a few decades late it is the same divisive fear heaped onto the Muslims. America is stronger because of our immigrant heritage. The most powerful nation in the world because of our acceptance of and tolerance towards those not like us in skin pigment and religious beliefs. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself so watch out for those who are perpetrating that fraud on America.
Well let's see, the Podesta emails clearly show that the Clinton inner circle was well aware that Qatar and Saudi Arabia are funding and supporting ISIS. From those same emails we found that Qatar and Saudi Arabia gave the Clinton foundation massive cash gifts. I think that it's pretty clear...amazing how 15 years since 9/11 and the left has become the Islamic radical support party
The people of Crimea - mainly Russian - voted to join back with Russia.  The problems in the Ukraine were due to attempts at EU and NATO expansion, pushed by Merkel and Obama respectively. Frustrated in their efforts they have tried to pressure Russia.  The only governments that boycott Israel are a collection of Arab and Muslim states.
Time will tell....wonder if he was European or Muslim.
Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Syria and Vietnam.  What do nearly all of these countries have in common? They're led by authoritarian dictators. Put in place a leader with authoritarian tendencies and you can rest assured that one of the first things they'll do is demonize a non-dominant religion. The next thing they'll do is outlaw said religion. If the dominant religion happens to be the one to which you subscribe then everything is hunky dory. If not, well, that's a different story. Just ask the Jews who survived Hitler's reich.  We just elected a leader with strong authoritarian tendencies. His first step has been to try to demonize Muslims. If we don't stand up for our Muslim brethren now and defend their religious freedom before anti-Muslim sentiment gets out of hand then we're no better than the German Christians who looked the other way during WWII.
“As public employees, we have to be politically neutral and are bound by Oregon law to not express our opinions, although we all have them,”   He spoke these words at South Eugene High School where my kids were regularly required to go on protest marches during school time.  What an absurdity! He doesn't even have a clue what is going on in his own classrooms where the Social Justice Warrior crowd rules with impunity and without a shred of opposition.   If he think 4J is full of families of Trump supporters who are harrrasing Hispanic and Muslim students he is just a fool beyond belief. Actually, it is much more likely that a kid wearing a Trump shirt to school would be harrassed than a Hillary supporter. Not that such a kid even exists in 4J.   And then cue to generic comments about "caring and concern" for the students hardest to connect to. No surprise the hall rang out with applause and some were brought to tears.   This guy is a talented rhetorician, and that's it!
I got deleted for asking how many non-Muslims were afraid for their safety.  Maybe the censors should ask the people of London how they feel.
Fighting the settlement would have risked his support in the Muslim Communities of Canada.
Moore is of the opinion that if American law is at odds with his interpretation of "God’s law", then God's law takes precedence. The legitimacy of the entire government and legal system is suspect when it conflicts with his religious beliefs. He has said that no Muslim should hold political office in the US, despite  Article VI, Section 3 of the Constitution saying "The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States." So if Moore becomes a senator, and takes the oath to support the Constitution, yet pushes his idea that Muslims cannot be public officeholders, then he will be forsworn.
Tell that to the LGBTQ, the women, the Muslims, the African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Semitic Americans, etc-Americans ad nausium, all those who partake in cannabis as part of their spiritual and recreational or medical program, tell it to those who love world peace, international cosmopolitan social plurality, tell those who elevate humanism, rationalism, explain to those who love life itself on the face of planet Earth, tell those who value liberty, freedom, justice, fraternity, progress. Your words will come up short and empty, friend.
A man writes about his father's death and funeral, and all you can think to write about is how unfair it was that so many priests and a bishop presided at the funeral mass?  How petty. Please take a look at MSW's bio.  He is a Visiting Fellow at Catholic University's Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies.  Arguably he meets and is friends with more priests and bishops than the average person, and they came to support him in his time of grief. Not because MSW is important, but because they know him personally and wanted to provide moral and religious support for a friend. There is plenty to comment about MSW and his politics and religious writing.  However, this type of comment on the day of his father's funeral is disrespectful and unacceptable behavior from anyone, Catholic, Christian, Jewish, Muslim or None of the above.  This comment should not have passed the Civility test.
Le Pen is close to becoming France's first female President, women can't drive in Saudi Arabia - but keep pushing the false-parallel, it highlights your contempt for reality in favor of "progressive" narratives.  St. Denis, Molenbeek, Rinkeby - all areas where police are under constant threat of attack from the local population. No go zones are a depressing reality of what happens when countries take a passive approach to integration. This has nothing to do with picking on any religion - France is a secular country and should not kow tow to demands of accommodations from a system of beliefs that is only common where gender equality, free expression, and freedom of association are non-existent. There is a difference between liberal secular Muslims (like Ismailis) and Islamists. Every country in the world (without exception) governed by religious law treats women as inferior - why should the west accommodate regressive cultural practices?
>>In terms of mass murder, Christianity scores well above Islam. .  You would like to have this narrative, but what do you back it up with?  Incessant posting of falsehoods, your hate of Western culture is well established already - no need to convince us any further.
Maybe, but more of a motivational factor to vacation in Hawaii was the recent beheading of German tourist by the Muslim Abu Sayef group in the Philippines when his ransom was not paid.  Also many Japanese have not forgotten the crazed Guamanian who murdered three Japanese tourists in Guam's Tumon Bay tourist mall for no reason in 2013.  Add the Muslim extremist mass murders in France, Norway, terrorist killings  in the US mainland, Asia, South America, Europe, Middle East and pretty much Hawaii's tourism industry with Japanese, Canadian and US mainland tourists will remain strong as long as it is free from terrorism and uprisings.
Turning America into an islamic nation is not the answer. Those who welcome them have had nothing but problems. It's nice to think we can all live in a utopian society but we have to be realistic. Look at the problems that Germany and other countries are going through.
The victims of Islamic extremism do not care whether their murderers were lone terrorists or part of a coordinated assault.  The common thread linking their murders is Islamic extremism, a point you seemed to have missed.
So you're going to pound all Islam followers,  all because 1 homophobic one just killed 50 ? It appears he didn't do this in the name of religion, either.
they were both muslims.
"In the Bible..."  Aaaaand that's where you lost me, Jim. The United States has a secular-style governmental system, Jim. I recommend you move elsewhere if you can't appreciate that. I hear Iran has lovely falls and winters. Not surprisingly, fundamentalist Christians and fundamentalist Muslims have LOTS in common, mostly relating to the forced adherence to their beliefs via legislation.  Let me know if you need any help packing!
Yes the article is great and good for you for mentioning that. However, the indiscriminate smearing of Islam and by extension all Muslims negates the good at the beginning of your post. Mr Ahmed said that too many Muslims support an anti-LGBTQ line but he did not say that all Imams are pushing that agenda because, I suspect, that few do.
" ... it may seem like a minor point that President Donald Trump and his advisors, in seeking to justify and normalize the executive order, have made a series of false or misleading claims about steps taken five years earlier by the Barack Obama administration." From an article published on January 30, 2017 on the Foreign Policy website.  The article specifies the distortions and falsehoods offered up by Trump and his defenders in defense of their Muslim ban.  The article is here: http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/30/sorry-mr-president-the-obama-administration-did-nothing-similar-to-your-immigration-ban/ Trump lied his way into the presidency.  Obviously he thinks he can lie his way through the presidency, too.  We'll see.
Stop whining.  I ridiculed your arguments, justifiably.  And clearly you weren't paying attention.  I have REPEATEDLY denounced the Da'esh (wrongly styling themselves 'ISIS').  I have in-laws who are directly threatened by them.  Same goes for their US-funded predecessors al-Qa'eda, the Taliban, and the other kharijite/salafi movements which have sprouted like foul fungus-growths from the rotting, toxic carcass of  of Ibn Sa'ud's criminal Wahabbism (established by the British).  I have skin in the game.  I've confronted Salafi agents who attempted to (ultimately successfully) take over a Sunni masjid I attended in Norfolk, VA.  I stood up in Mina (outside Mecca) and denounced Sa'udi crimes and the lies one of their fraudulent "Sheikhs" attempted to foist on the American Muslim party I went on Hajj with 19 years ago, and laughed at Sa'udi cops who subsequently threatened to make me "disappear".  And I honorably served six years in the US military (8404 grunt corpsman--Semper Fi).
Considering the depth of  Antisemitic preaching  openly by prominent Imams at Ryerson, in mosques in  GTA and other cities in Canada , which gets exposed from time to time, why should we be surprised young Muslim men might hold the same ideas? Exposing them is a public duty.
Sorry - Japan has had Muslims for a long time. Here's link to the oldest mosque(1935?) in Japan - https://matcha-jp.com/en/1291. When we visited my family in Tokyo in 2013 - I was surprised that there are Halal restaurants in Tokyo. We ate at one late one night while wandering around Shinjuku. Very friendly staff - mostly Pakistanis and a few Indians.   "The Kōbe Muslim Mosque, the first mosque in Japan, was built in 1935 through the donations of the neighborhood Muslim community, which consisted of Indians, Tatars and Turks. It has survived air raids during the War in the Pacific as well as the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake, and the original building is intact even today."  As for beheadings and dousing people with gasoline - I think you might get a different opinion of the historical behavior of Japan if you talk to the Chinese or Koreans who were occupied by the Japanese. All countries and peoples have done reprehensible things. YMMV
The PM won't be running to their defense like he does for muslims
What a bunch of horse dung. I am appalled. As many have indicated in previous comments, immigrants of the past DID NOT receive to much help from we the taxpayers and they succeeded in adapting.  You are telling us that after spending a fortune of tax payer money on getting these people here and paying for their living here, we should pay even more? APPALLING AND A DISGRACE!! I have had just about enough of this liberal rubbish propaganda. Also..they are muslims, we aren't even talking about how much problems that will cause down the road, because that is the real issue at hand. In 25 years we will be fighting for our right to practice our own culture and traditions and religion (Christianity) here in Canada, just like they are in some European countries now. when they numbers get to about 7% + we will start to see the enforcement of Jihad.
A very large proportion of the Muslim refugees sympathize with these acts.  http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/articles/opinion-polls.aspx
A school is a place of learning, not religious practice.  Secularism means respecting everyone and allowing all to practice their beliefs in a respectfully private way. It does not mean that public schools should allow overt expression of religious practices by Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs or anyone else. Let kids explore Newtonian Physics, Ramanajun's Math and Plato's philosophy.  If religion could have done anything for anyone, there would be no plague, no poverty in 75% of the world, women and kids would be free from bondage everywhere, and the world would be full of Love and Respect ( supposedly the calling creed of every religion).  But clearly, the world is full of prejudice, injustice, hate, dogma, etc. Therefore, let schools be the place where the next generation discusses constructive ideas, and it should not become a battle ground for what religious preaches but never practices.  Defend character, promote justice, embrace ideas. Everything else is BS anyway.
Trump on why Sudan was removed from his Muslim ban. https://mobile.twitter.com/yjtorbati/status/913132988027764736/photo/1 Read it. It's classic Trump.
The onus should now be on the provincial government and the municipality of Quebec City to assist to find a site for a Muslim cemetery in the Quebec City area.
LOL.  Three of 7 countries are not even Muslim - Iran, Iraq is Shia, Syria is Shia led.  The real trouble maker Sunnis, who consider Shia non-Muslims  - Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Qatar, UAE, Egypt are not included.  Political correctness aside, Trump's analysis that Sunnis create terror has to be taken seriously. Whereas he is  identifying the threat, he is not offering solutions, except to partner with Putin to eliminate Sunni terror.
What a provocative idea - Christians listing themselves on a mandatory Muslim registry.  Reminds me of the Dutch wearing yellow stars in fraternity with the Jews in WWII.  How many of us (myself included) would have the courage to do that?
What would compel Canadians to show solidarity for an ideology based on supremacy of religion?  At most Canadian mosques, the friday congregation includes a ritual prayer asking, “Allah to give victory to Muslims over the ‘Kufaar’ (non-Muslims).”  And by the way, Kuffaar is a highly derogatory Arabic term used to refer to non-Muslims.
.  BurntErnest,  you are wasting your time with Alceste.  His only role in these forums is to deeeflect and qualify anyone questioning anything Islam  as a non-Canadian, bigot, supremacist: . "... no doubt that a lot of participants in Globe comments despised this writer merely by seeing her hijab, but that isn't representative of Canadians." . Background: ------ . The above quote is a new "talking point" for him, which he adopted since last week. It was result of me questtioning the motives of the G&M (and other media)  publishing "opinions" of onnly (practically) hijabed women. As if the Westerners should be  brainwashed that only a hijabed woman can be a true Muslim woman.   I find it interessting that the bulk of the  media doe not publish Muslims, critical of Islam, and calling for a reform - a hard look as to the state of Islam today. They do not publish Muslims, critical of the hapless left who is used as a Trojan horse to advance political Islam agenda in Western democracies.
Trump used the Muslim ban executive order to play to his Islamophobic and racist supporters.  When he was inaugurated he was crossing his fingers when he pledged to protect and defend the Constitution.
When a Muslim terrorist acts, it is not representative of 99.999% of Muslims.  When a single white man commits an act of terrorism, there's a wide scale problem in society.  The double standard and the willful blindness in this day and age is just incredible.
Don't worry Ms. AMIRA, with Muslim average family sizes(8-10) and continue growing strong with traditional stay at home Muslim women and condoned polygamy, non taxable free childcare benefits(6400 per child) + welfare on top of it as well as  current Muslim favoring immigration laws, Canada will have Muslim PM and Muslims will become majority within 50-60 year time. So be happy & keep making babies.
Reports have it that in Dearborn, MI over 100,000 Muslims (45% of the city!)have settled into a “no-go” zone. The area is governed by Sharia law. The Muslim authorities of the compound build as they like, create schools, and write their own curriculum. How do you call it?
I grew up as a visible minority in Shawinigan (Québec) and he's going to be a tough sell there. The leader of the Bloc Québécois and Québec NDP MPs have said as much. Imagine if a Roman Catholic cleric became leader of a major federal party and refused to give up his religious garb while trying to convince Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus and Buddhists that his faith doesn't influence his policy outlook. This is what Jagmeet Singh is trying to do. I wish him well, but it won't be easy to campaign in Chicoutimi, Moncton, Red Deer and other small communities.
The bigoted haters here have missed the point completely. The point is not whether Muslim students should be allowed a place to pray--that has been so for twenty years. The point is whether the self-proclaimed "journalist," who offered the reward, is promoting hatred of Muslim students. I am sure that he is and he should be prosecuted for promoting hate.
This story is about the opposite. Observant Muslims would retire to a private space for short private prayer, ------------- except Virtulem forgets this private prayer is held in a public school, where prayers of no other religion are said  the same public schools that prohibit the Lord's prayer and Christmas Nativity scenes in a predominantly Christian heritage country known as "my Canada"  perhaps public schools should have Nativity scenes next christmas non-Christians need not attend but I am sure many would not mind attending
>>> Public history classes teach more about Islam than about any other religion.  Even if true, that is not indoctrination. That is history.
Why did Thousands of Refugee Syrian  Men flee to Europe without their women ? Is it because they wanted our benefits and can complain about Assad from a safe distance ? They will never go back home because now they are safe and can turn our country into a Muslim Sharia Country and marry our women !
Instead of asking no one the questions, wouldn't it be better to ask everyone the questions, muslim or not?  That way, there would be no group singled out.
Conversion from Islam to Christianity in Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan is punishable by death.  So yes, I am deathly afraid of Islam.
Why was my comment deleted???  I did not swear, nor was I rude, or derogatory.  I posted a link to the Iman of the Toronto Police who thinks it is OK in Islam to marry a 9 year old, like their mohammed did. This article was in 2016.  Why was my comment deleted?  Child brides are happening here in Canada. Wherever it is happening in the world, it is wrong. This practice has been going on since the time of Mohammad who married a little 6 year old and then consummated their marriage when she was 9.
Some Muslims want to apply some aspects of Sharia Law (which includes protection of widows & orphans and alms for the poor) in some family disputes, just a Christians and Orthodox Jews have the right to do.  Nothing that contravenes the criminal code or the Charter would ever be allowed to stand in such a resolution. There is absolutely no basis for a fear that Sharia Law will "(replace) our judicial system...".  That's just absurd.
Do you recall that the Crusades were a response to the invasion of Christian lands by brutal Muslim conquerors? Did you know that when Muslims invaded India they slaughtered 2/3rds of the Hindu population, their leaders bragging about how high the piles of 'infidel' heads were outside cities they destroyed? Are you aware that there were over 14,000 terrorist attacks carried out in the world just last year in the name of Islam?
Once again, Alceste, let's point this out "No formal designation".  Once again, I've seen the "no go zone" in Schieringin and other areas.  Have you? There is a problem there.  Fox news back off because of threats made by the countries mentioned.  Doesn't mean it isn't true.  The reasons for these areas are many and varied, but pretending there isn't a problem isn't a solution.  There ARE high crime areas in the NL, which are predominantly  populated by muslims.  Go ask Ayaan Ali.  She'll tell ya.  Ask Theo Van Gogh too.    Why are we so quick to condemn white supremacists yet refuse to acknowledge there is problems with other cultures and races?
What a tempest in a teapot.   - Give it 4 months and the students agitating will have forgotten the issue entirely (i.e graduated).  - As for the racists banging the drum to harass or monitor their fellow citizens whom happen to be muslim, they've outed themselves as bigots worthy of censure, and scorn for their un-Canadian values and activities.
We do not "need" to do anything except what is in our self interest.  If accelerating the Islamification of Canada is in our interests, we should do it. If it is not not, we should not.  Canada is on track to be a Muslim majority nation by 2080. Go ahead and do the math based on a current Muslim population of 1.2 million, and use annual percentage growth rates of 8%, decreasing by 1 point every 10 years through 2080. Currently the Muslim population is increasing by just over 9% per year by the way, so the 8% number is not fictional.  And if your argument is that those Muslims will secularize, joining the trend in the rest of the populace, provide evidence of that.  Oh and by the way, my opinion is that accelerating this in NOT in Canada's self interest.  Lets see how many times this gets censored  as "uncivil"
No, they just give Islam a pass and they will again for this latest attack carried out in the name of Islam .
I can see that she is a woman but I don't see the sigh that identifies her as a Muslim.
You are using the term "racist" incorrectly, it is not racist to point out that Justin is coming to an area of my town that is heavily populated by Muslims.  So perhaps it's you that needs to reach for a dictionary.  But I know, to you those indigenous people that fought against the European settlement of North America were just also "racists", they didn't get that their attitudes were anathema to a healthy country.
http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/u-s-doctor-arrested-for-performing-female-genital-mutilation-on-two-seven-year-olds-from-muslim-sect  The Globe knows it will suffer the same fate as Charlie Hebdo if talk about   of Islam is allowed to go too far. Next, there may be images of Mohammad. We can't have that. @;(>
When a person commits a crime, status is unimportant.  Thinking otherwise is akin to saying "Only Muslims can be terrorists."  Status aside, a crime can be committed by anyone, even native-born Americans.  And then the same folks say "Deport!"  So the deported return to re-offend repeatedly.  What a plan!  Treat all criminals the same, and keep them in prison.
Looking around the world, one can clearly see the patches of Eden people in predominantly Muslim countries have built for themselves. Obviously we will be forever in their debt for their industrious efforts to perform the same miracle here in Canada.
Or what about when Obama's regime encouraged and fostered the Arab spring, toppling the govts in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and elsewhere and putting the Muslim Brotherhood in power and sparking the migration crisis that is engulfing Europe that threatens to end western civilization?
In historical terms the whole of Jerusalem ( founded  1000 years ago) was  Jewish...it has been destroyed twice, captured and recaptured 44 times...Arabic speaking people first  conquered it in 638 AD...since then it has bennconquered and reconquerd  with Crusaders massacring both Muslim and Jewish inhabitants in 1099.  Despite everything, the Jewish people gravitated back to it time and time again.
Muslims are Trudeau's chosen people in Canada. This government will do nothing to cross Muslims. The rest of us will have to sit at the back and be silent.
Varna is a concept well established in the Muslim world too. From Pakistan to Morocco, lighter skin is favoured. Darker skinned people from Africa were slaves throughout Islamic history. Sudan's civil war was one consequence. The Bangladesh civil war was another consequence.  Pakistan's history, according to Pakistanis, started when Bin Qasim invaded Sindh. Most Pakistanis claim Arab lineage (because they don't want to accept that 90 percent were converts from Hinduism). Therefore, the Indus Valley civilization was an Indian one, not Pakistani.   And Lothal was the premier port of the Indus Valley civilization. It is in Gujarat, which is in India.
This is Justin Trudeau's dream. He gets to open Canada's borders again to Muslim refugees. . It will look like he is compassionate for all the poor suffering people often earth, even if all that suffering is completely avoidable.  Be prepared to be scolded by Ralph Goodale about how just awful we are to even question another million Muslims beating our immigration system
"Barrack was the top fundraiser for Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign... He disagrees with some of Trump’s proposals, including his efforts to ban immigrants from certain Muslim countries and his push for a border wall with Mexico."  Huh? The Trump campaign's top fundraiser was against the Muslim ban and the border wall? That was his whole campaign...   Billionaires like this (and there are plenty donating on both sides of the isle) don't really care about what is good for the country. They only want access to power.
I've traveled 186,000 plus kilometers in the last fifteen years.  Like all Canadians who travel as much, we see the world differently.  Lining up to board a flight at any major airport around the world, there are people from many countries. Muslims rub shoulders with Christians who rub shoulders with Jews who rub shoulders with Buddhists, Sikhs, and people of intense spirituality and faith and people of no faith.  Fundamentalism, racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and hate must be rooted out. Disrespectful people like Drumpf and Leach  don't rule goodness. Quite the opposite.  The repulsive behaviour in this horrifying (think of the children) does not reflect (are you listening Kellie) Canadian values.
Probably for the same reasons Muslims don't follow the Koran to the letter either.
...and spread to every nation the Koran is read in.
He or she is correct. Saying Trump has "no right " to speak here is a complete repudiation of American values. There is much to criticize about Trump (his plan for registering Muslims is probably the most heinous) and much to fear, and it is clear he is a product of a broken political system - but making fun of his name and hair is just plain childish.
ISIS takes sexual slaves, burns people alive, targets non-muslim children for torture and chops innocent peoples heads off while smiling at the camera. You believe there is some sort of moral equivalence to this?
whatever you do, don't equate Islam with these attacks...
Since the Globe is fixated on trying to normalize the growing Islamic presence in Canada, how about some real reporting?  How about some actual interviews with Canadian Islamic leaders.   Demand to know if criticism of Islam, and even ridicule, of Islam is to be tolerated. And what about Sharia law? Do they agree that it is medieval and NEVER to be in force in Canada, and that Canadian laws , precedents and legal institutions are sacrosanct. And what about gender equality, the right for women  to work live and love as they choose.? And for those who leave Islam, are they to be punished and hunted down like Salman Rushdie?  Ask some questions for once, instead of feeding us soppy articles like this, or preachy finger-wagging editorials from writers like Sheema Khan.  Islam is growing in Canada. Explosively. Within this century, without secularization and smaller Muslim family sizes, Muslims will be at or near majority status in Canada.  We had better know what we're in for.
"let's have all kids learn about the Bible and the Gospels in class too." Well you couldn't have a class about religions that doesn't cover that.  As for the rest, some seem reasonable, others not. Having rabbis as guest to explain the value of being mensch makes sense, being familiar with key passages from all the major scriptures as well, trying some foods culturally related to the religion also, singing songs, why not? As long as it is a one-day thing, not a regular diet, and all major religions are treated similarly, what's wrong with that? Having Muslim girls take off the hijabs, obviously not.  In fact a Catholic went to court about it, they wanted to be able to teach the class from a Catholic point of view instead of a secular one. They eventually won.  http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/loyola-can-teach-catholic-studies-but-must-still-teach-other-religions-scoc-rules
The British have been invited to train the military in many Muslim countries. Why would an article on terrorism "mention" that well known fact?
A Christian cannot become president in any Arab or Muslim country, except for Lebanon. Hey, non-Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus, etc, are not even allowed in Mecca. Egypt did have a Christian prime minister, Boutros Ghali, 1908 to 1910. I reckon it would next to impossible for this to happen now. This simple fact is only one indication of the drop in religious tolerance across the region.
What do you not get? Islamic State has been at war the West for as long as they have existed! Do you think Obama neutralized IS somehow?
“I pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may God protect him [in Arabic], on behalf of the Islamic State,” Mateen says on the new transcript.    The old version had several words scrubbed and read: "I pledge allegiance to [omitted] may God protect him [in Arabic], on behalf of [omitted]."    House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., called the earlier decision by DOJ and the FBI to release only a partial transcript "preposterous."  Part of the inconvenient truth.
From the N.P.  "OTTAWA – A Liberal MP and the Liberal Party of Canada President were among the group of friends that joined Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family for a New Year’s holiday at the private island in the Bahamas owned by the billionaire philanthropist and spiritual leader, the  Aga Khan, the National Post has learned.  Seamus O’Regan, the first-time MP for St. John’s South—Mount Pearl and former CTV broadcaster, and his husband Stelios (Steve) Doussis as well as party president Anna Gainey and her husband Tom Pitfield spent a week with the Trudeau family on Bell Island as a guest of the Aga Khan, who is the spiritual leader of the world’s 15 million Ismaili Muslims.  O’Regan said in a telephone interview Tuesday  that no Canadian government business was discussed during his time on the island.  Trudeau, for his part, declined Tuesday to confirm O’Regan’s attendance and would not say if any other MPs or other public office holders were with him for his holiday."
Over and over, people in the West go to great lengths to state and re-state that not all Muslims are terrorists, which is of course, incredibly obvious. What is also obvious is that every nation under Islamic rule or with large Muslim minorities within it, experience serious social problems. Lack of freedom of religion, disregard for human rights, and growing censorship of speech are patterns found in those societies. Islam like any other ideology must be questioned, and the act of doing so is not bigotry: it's what you expect civilized, rational beings to do.  Do we fear the questions or the answers?
And you gave example of Charlie Mason. At least im on topic regarding Muslims and Turkey.
Muslim views discussed by Brigitte Gabriel. Go to google an type in  - wwwDOTyoutube.com/watch?v=Ry3NzkAOo3s.

That muslim girls "willing" pray in the back implies that they have a choice.  What happens if they "willingly" pray with the boys?
As I recall, Harper was strongly criticized for bringing in Christian refugees from Syria.  I believe that the words "racist and islamophobic" were the words used by Liberal supporters.
Maybe the man meant "you will get what you deserve, a wall across the border with Mexico, the expulsion of illegal Mexicans, the internment and investigation of Muslim citizens, a 45% tariff on WalMart imports, 25 million kicked off health care, privatization of Medicare and Medicaid, an end to poor women's reproductive health care, vouchers to replace public K-12 education, cold war with China, Trump branded buildings and golf courses in Russia (where are those tax returns?), the end of the EPA, acid rain from Joe Manchin's new coal power plants, the privatization of public utilities, and much, much more.   So yes, sometimes you get just what you deserve.
I understand what you mean, but I imagine that there's a more lengthy definition of 'harassing, disturbing, or offensive to others' written within the actual policy. As it is, there's a bit left to common sense, courtesy, and plain old communication—talk to each other if something is offensive. A Muslim is not offensive. That should be simple enough. If someone is playing one of the ISIS journalist beheadings at high volume on a big screen without headphones, that's much different. There is a difference between a religion and terrorism. There isn't danger in a pro-gun site, unless it's an article on 'How to Hold Up a Bank.' Too, the library is public. If a person is questioning whether this research should be done there, perhaps it should be done at home, or at a friend's house. And, one final point: the main point of this policy was in direction to pornography, which is not information. I'm not sure what it is, but it isn't information. Real information will have leeway on this matter
By the same group of "Muslims" who've slaughtered over 100k muslims
Catholics do / did not force women to cover themselves from head to toe.   Catholics do / did not kill women Catholics do / did not treat women like property Catholics do / did not make it ok to beat women  Islam does.  Not all muslims, but the religion itself.
There they go again. When this terrorist act happened on the anniversary of 9-11, Obama and his minions lied their butts off to America and claimed this wasn't an act of terror, it was due to a cartoon insulting Muslims. Obama and his minions lied because this was close to the November election. This lie was to cover up the gross incompetence of the Obama administration that enabled this terrorist attack. Furthermore what came out of this investigation was Hillary's contempt for law, and her use of a private server.
Beyond speaking out, thousands of Muslims sacrifice their lives in the fight against terrorism. To ignore this fact is a travesty.
Muslims/Islamists love L,G,B,T's  it's written in the Koran. Allahu Akbar!
Our lovely Governemtn workers and goody two shoes will do as much as they can to regulate you.One day soon if you say something against Islam your passport will be cancelled and sent to the States to stop your entry.Just wait for it. CSIS loves control over everything and so does the RCMP and all they want is a yes switich to turn on from Parlament
Oh - he's created a Muslim ban! Hillary got it wrong - the basket of deplorable was occupied by one man - who got elected President. Isn't this executive order an impeachable offense? Wake up Congressional Republicans! This man is destroying your country!
Thank you,"Lifeofthelay"! That is the primary reason that I distrust ANY Muslim scholar/theologian's assessment of the Christian Faith; when all is said and done, when you reject the reality of who Jesus the Christ is as the Scriptures proclaim Him,you have no idea what you're talking about.😑 PEACE IN CHRIST, ALWAYS,THE ONLY LORD AND SAVIOR OF ALL MANKIND.
Germany has let in 1.2 million Muslim immigrants in 1-year. That is plenty.
It is very doubtful that those supporting Trump in the voting booth or on these pages will care whose "fault" caused their economic armageddon.  . They will take to the streets with torches and pitchforks in a mindless protest to avenge their betrayal by the very elites that their votes put into power.  . In reality the impact of raising interest rates will be but a blip when compared with the turmoil caused by European populism, Chinese expansionism, Russian adventurism and Muslim extremism.  . Finally when opining on economic determinism one should have a longer time horizon than "the Federal Funds Rate from 1950 to today".
Clearly, Trump having failed to deliver on 3 of his 4 principal election commitments (blocking Muslim immigration, abolishing Obamacare, & the wall along the Mexican border) is desperate to achieve the fourth and only remaining election commitment: getting rid of NAFTA. The man is an obfuscator trying to appeal to an electoral base that will take a major hit if he does abandon NAFTA. Auto workers in the rust-belt states should not be deluded by this scam artist.
Actually, the list of globalist traitor presidents goes back to Bush 41, included Bill Clinton, who has been aligned with the Muslims since the 1990's, was greatly promoted by Bush43, who flooded in Muslims POST 9/11 rather than keeping them OUT FOREVER!  Then there's Obama, who spent 8 years in the White House as a globalist puppet.  That's 28 straight years of promotion of globalist goals rather than pro-American policies.  Hopefully President Trump will be granted 8 years to BEGIN correcting the damage.  If he's followed by 8 hours of Michael Pence, even more repair can be completed.
His parents are muslims from another country.
Quote: "no substantiated evidence of any systematic, official anti-Muslim actions". 1) Trump's declaration during the campaign? 2) New regulations re: flights from Muslim countries?
The Muslim woman might get in trouble at home if a stranger like you smiles at her.
Don't think Hispanics, the father of the slain US soldier in combat or the mayor of London, both dark skinned Muslims, would agree with you.  It was clear after 8 years of Obama, many Americans wanted to bring the white back to the White house in Washington.  Unfortunately even after winning the election and becoming the most powerful person in the free world, that did not humble Trump to ease off on his arrogant, racist, greedy, tyrannical tendencies just enough so he would not be heading toward impeachment after less than 2 months in office.  Community organizer Obama coming from the teachings of Rev Wright and Bill Ayers also had his own personal agenda, however Obama toned down his 'weather underground' tendencies while Pres of the US just enough to get him a 2nd term.
"The practice is carried out by both Muslim and Christian communities, although it predates both religions and is not sanctioned by the Quran or the Bible."  Do you really think that is an honest statement?  Do you really think you will help young girls to escape mutilation by stretching and deforming the truth?  Shame on you!
A Public Secular school should not have anything to do with religion (other than social studies), before or after school, full stop.  Why don't these kids go to a local community centre, mosque, or rent space nearby.  Do I really need to explain how a public school is (or should be) different than a catholic school, or Jewish, or muslim or any other faith based school??  I think all schools should be non-denominational, but that's not gonna happen, so if Catholics want to practice their religion at school... then go to a catholic school.... and that goes for every other religion as well.
"They don't want a Catholic cemetery there, they don't want a Jewish cemetery there, they don't want a Chinese cemetery there, and they don''t want a Muslim cemetery there. What's so hard to understand about that? "  What's so hard to understand is why you make that claim with no evidence one way or the other.
Lost in the debate are a couple of obvious questions. Why is it no school districts other than PDSB allow religious activities on school premises? Other school districts obviously believe that school should be secular.   Second, why are the muslims in Peel Distrct so demanding? Mulsims in other school districts can live with not praying at school. Why can't those in Peel District do the same?
You're actually talking about "Globalization", which is something different than globalism.  And no, embracing the far-right only makes things much worse.  All far-right politicians do is exploit the public’s anger at the crises caused by corruption, neoliberal “globalization”, unprecedented corporate power and inequality, and of course, the incessant US-led criminal wars of the past 15 years, and redirect it from those deserving of it and into the usual scapegoats – Muslims, refugees, immigrants, minorities, as well as Liberals/Progressives – in order to protect the very status quo it feigns opposition to in order to win support.
The Israels knew where they stood when President Obama on his first day in office made his first phone call to the head of the Palestinian authority.   This was further confirmed when President Obama  made his Cairo "Blame America" speech to the Muslim world badmouthing Israel.  And Obama  as the President of the United States  bowed to the waist before a Muslim Saudi King like some dhimmi apostate.  And then the absurd Iran Nuclear deal where Israel was not even consulted on something that affects their very survival by the terrorist state Iran who has threatened to wipe Israel of the face of the Earth and kill every Jewish man, woman, and child.  President Obama had a long association  antisemites like the Reverend Jeremiah Wright for twenty years, Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam, Al Sharpton, and Jesse Jackson who calls New York "Hymie Town".  Donald Trump is now the 45th President of the United States and Israel can once again trust the United States.
I think the promise to ban Muslims helped Trump in the election, don't you?
Here in Manoa I have a Muslim neighbor and we have a Mosque and there have been no problems.  We don't need sickos who are scared of their own shadow to stir things up.  If the Japanese go elsewhere, tourism does go in cycles, there will probably be a lot of Japanese owned real estate for sale at a steep discount.  I wouldn't worry about it though.  More worried about the Columbine punks or McVeigh types.
FACT: 2016 (latest year they've data Stats Can,  hate crimes declined in 2013, but  increased against Muslims & Jews. What's up with the Liberals? Minister Jim Carr; why aren't you advocating for Jews?   Nat'll Council of Cdn Muslims: “question for all of us must be – now what?” Calling for 1) special training for local police forces, 2) sensitivity courses in schools NATION WIDE, 3) name Jan 29, National Day of Remembrance and Action on Islamophobia. Quite a wish-list.  FACT: 1847 to 1900s,  Toronto bastion of WASP, treated the Irish Catholics like dirt - the city’s original immigrant underclass, faced bitter discrimination for decades. Sectarian tension ran so high TO became known as: "The Belfast of Canada! Off the boat, if they THOUGHT you had a cough you were sent to the Cholera Sheds - death beds! Shopkeepers window signs "Irish now welcome/don't apply". This discrimination endured til WW.  Let's get real, every group no matter the year faces lack of acceptance, hatred & bigots!
Sadly, the usual practitioners of anti-muslim hatred got nothing from this column.
Many are smart enough to make a distinction between celebrating a religious belief, and celebrating a secular holiday.   I was invited to celebrate Eid with a family, and I did. It did not mean I accepted Muslim beliefs, it only meant I joined in with some friends in celebrating their festive holiday.  But then, they aren't fundies.
A person of color that worked hard and understood the USA actually growing up here and not educated in a Muslim school in Indonesia? That might work.
LNG is most unlikely to be the reason. Muslim Brotherhood is a real worry of Saudi. Islamic Caliphate established by the Muslim Brotherhood with Erdogan as Caliph must be the real worry of Saudi Royals - then end of their Muslim leadership.  Egypt is known to hate Muslim Brotherhood. UAE, Kuwait equally worried.  Qatar supports it. So the common enemy.  God knows where the conflict will lead. Problem lies with Islam. Being a political religion, it is always exploited by the powerful at the cost of humanity.
Then why aren't all muslims included from all predominantly muslim countries.  There are significantly (overwhelming so)  more muslims excluded from the temporary ban. I guess its just a question of biased intelligence.
No Canada does not have to take in all the islamic terrorists in the world!  When do the islamic states start taking in their islamic brothers?  This is nothing but jihad by flooding non muslim countries with muslims!
No one is protesting the presence of muslim children at the school.  They are protesting the presence of religion in the school.
Does Hate-Free include Radical Muslims?  Since 9/11, over 3000 of my countrymen have been murdered by radical Muslims and it appears there has been only 1 murder in retaliation in this country.  Clearly, the hate is primarily in 1 direction.  I'm expecting to see more condemnation against Radical Muslims than shaming us. We don't want more Radical Muslim attacks, we have had more than enough.  We see what is happening in Europe and we do not want the same to happen here.  Stop making Muslims out to be victims, when it is non-Muslims that are dying.
Why do you think Obama was filling our population with Muslims from the middle east and hispanics from south of the border, if it wasn't a step toward the globalization collectivism agenda. Obama was running for the the President of the world which is why he fought so hard to divide this country.
Normally I'd agree.  But when you've been launching bombs/missiles at someone for decades, that might be their defending themselves.  That whole Muslim terrorism thing didn't start targeting us until after we helped overthrow Iran and prop up the Shah, while funding Hussein to fight Iran.  Can you blame them for coming back at us?  At some point ya gotta stop waging war, otherwise the retributions will continue.
It can't very well be challenged when there is information missing from the bill. As I hinted at previously, this is an election ploy. One that may put the safety of muslim women at risk
I think the Muslims are quite capable of defending themselves, don't you?  When have the Muslims defended the religious freedom of Catholics?
I think that the editors are confused about the meaning of  "high fashion" .  Wearing patterned jean cut pants with a cotton sweater is a standard female outfit in the non moslem world, but hardly original or high fashion.
"We came to this country for the same reason everyone else came here: freedom to worship,” Yasir Abdalrahman, a worshipper at the mosque, told the newspaper. “And that freedom is under threat. Every other American should be insulted by this.”  Maybe we should be told where in the world Muslims aren't free to worship their faith. It seems it's in Muslim countries that non-Muslims might find it difficult to practise their faith.
So does it mean you are anti-Muslim if you oppose Sharia law in America?  As I was reading this article it came to a part where it said that the Republican party is anti-muslim because they opposed Sharia Law.....did I read that right?  Or did I misunderstand it?
Once again completely ignore why Islamic State would take credit for this.     wn, As far as the elimination of the Islamic State, nope, Democrat President Obama's "Regime Change" (Overthrows of U.S. Allies Established Governments) by Supporting (Funding) the "Islamic Democracy Movements" of the "Arab Spring" created more "Islamic States" as the Islamic State Egypt, Islamic State Sinai, Islamic State Libya, Islamic State Tunisia, Islamic State Mali, Islamic State Niger, and quite a few more.   And President Obama's Support of the Non Syrian Citizen 30 Million Kurdistanis of Muslim Army Ansar Al Islam as the "Obama Syrian Rebels" to attempt to Overthrow U.S. Ally President Assad of Syria a U.S. Ally since 1990, only caused lots of the Kurdistanis aka Kurds 30 Million of Ansar Al Islam to flee to the U.S., Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Canada, other Nations as "Syrian Refugees" eventhough they were never Syrian Citizens.  The Kurdistanis aka "Kurds" have fought the U.S. many times.
Once again not a mention of British troops in Muslim countries.
Going along with your idea (I agree with you), if the baker found out it was a Muslim wedding and he believed that Muslims are a violation of his religious beliefs, or prior to the late 70's when inter racial marriages were still illegal in many states and he refused, then according to T-Rump administration its OK to refuse service?  We are returning to the great lunch counter sit in at Woolworths...making America great again!  The simple fact is this is just another form of discrimination justified by religion that the Constitution clearly states is not recognized by our great nation. "Religious right" ENDS when it takes away from my freedom.
I agree that anti-Muslim hate must be condemned in absolute terms but I question the supposed correlation between the Quebec massacre and the Ontario public school issue. It's not a secret that a more assertive political Islam is taking root in Canada in terms of demanding more accommodations for cultural practices that are only common in countries where freedom of expression and gender equality are treated with violent contempt. So we must ask what message it sends as a society to accommodate a religious practice that excludes women during their natural cycles, especially in public schools. Is it a form of "cultural relativism" that we accept women pray at the back because otherwise they would arouse the men? Is defending Canadian values of gender equality more important than accommodating cultural practices under the guise of religious freedoms?
Islam and Feminism go together like peas and carrots. Both women and Muslims are high up on the victim hierarchy.
Like many once-worthy causes, the feminist movement seems to have been largely hijacked by forces opposed to what they label as the 'patriarchy.'   Many of the hijackers, banded together with a hodge-podge of various 'social justice' advocates, seem intent on fomenting nothing short of broad-based revolution.   That their revolution offers no meaningful alternative, aside from destruction of the status quo, seems to cause no bother as they spread their tentacles through university campuses, NGO's, not-for-profits, government funded media operations and other publically funded and hijackable social institutions. Women at the forefront of the modern feminist movement are no more part of this current drumbeat than are Muslims of the spread of radical Islamist terrorism, but they are not caught in the same crossfire, and thus feel no duty to get rid of their movement's hijackers.   Thus the cancer spreads.
Most is the keyword-most. Mercer was also strangly a white supremist, was of mixed race as you point out Obama is (whatever relevance that has) and had learning disabilities and mental disabilities, got kicked out of the army for attempted suicide. And had an AR 15 at his disposal. He was not Muslim.
"Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says Canada is committed to,,, focus on combatting the “hateful, backward-looking death cult”of the Islamic State"   The Minister is in agreement with the Canadian Muslim reformer Raheel Raza.  Here are two URL's where Raheel gives a peaceful resolution to radical Islam, take a look:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSPvnFDDQHk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2KsvcJ4Myw
(In Switzerland, in June, 2016, after a huge debate of Muslin boy students refusing  to shake the hand of their female teacher)  The Chairperson of the Forum for a progressive Islam, Saida Keller-Messahli:  "...the refusal to shake the hand of a woman is one of the symptoms of political Islam who wants the separation of the sexes in all areas of public life, who wants headscarves for girls, who wants to veiling women and assign them a secondary place in the mosques and  in the public space."  The parents or guardians of students who refuse to comply with the new directive may be subject to a fine of up to 6500$.  Got it...6500$CND ?
Hi PP of V, I have taught ESL for a number of years. Many students are muslim. Almost every one, that I know of, is married to their first cousin.   This means their children are inbred.
The mothers of Orlando, Santa Barbara, Nice, France, Paris, Texas, Baton Rouge, New York City, Belgium, Germany have had their sons and daughters sacrificed on the altar of political correctness gone amok.  Until our government leaders stop with the propaganda assault on the mothers and fathers of the World who are afraid to send their children on trips, to the Olympics, to Europe for studies,  Donald Trump is the only leader who is willing to stand up and fight for the rights of all mothers.  This Muslim mother of a fallen soldier lost her son by a suicide/homicide fellow Muslim fanatic killer.  Donald Trump is the only leader who will fight an all out assault on the enemy of Western Civilization. These parents did not speak out against the enemy responsible for the murder of their son.  They spoke out against their "fellow" American.  They fled Pakistan and their murderous brethren followed them here to America.
The Muslims know that the liberal left will do far more to break down Western society than their terrorism and bombs.  The goal of the left is to disrupt society, not nurture it.  It's rampant in our schools, politics, and social media.  Once western culture is broken, Muslims will be there to rise out of its ashes.  Wake up, support the values that made the West the best and most progressive culture in the world.
To be fair Mr Nenshi did not say that there was any rascist element in reporting or jornalism. He was referring to online commentary and I'm sure some of us who read the comments section recognize this to be true. The most benign articles will can bring out rascist and anti-Islam comments, often unrelated to subject. Coded language exists, that much is true, but a lot depends on the context. Mr Nenshi refers to "uppity" and "too big for his britches". We ought to remember that uppity was often used in the American south to refer to black people who weren't submissive. I've never heard anybody use it to describe a politician, even by Albertans who loathed Pierre Trudeau. Before Obama was elected a friend asked me what i thought of him. I said he was "well spoken" and before I could continue my friend chided me for useing that term. He told me that "well spoken" was being used in America to refer to Obama's blackness. That was news to me. Today he still reminds me of it over a beer.
PDX Yellow Cab is the name of the service and I wonder if anyone can seek employment there or just Somalis...which of course would break state and Federal employment laws.   One has too remember that Somali Muslims and Muslim tribes in general do not get along with each other, so what makes anyone think they can get along here and with a much more diverse population?
It seems to me that those who are determined to keep the word Islamophobia in M-103 when there are plenty of other/better/more accurate words are wanting to condemn with a very broad brush any criticism of Islam. It's starting to look like a blasphemy case. The Liberals will lose a lot of support if this motion passes and they (Liberals) all support it.
the notion id Islamophobia is made up.  Gimme a break.  Look at all the non muslim folks protesting with you, not against you. stop making things up.  We DO NOT AGREE and stop bashing the same folks who support you.  No more lies and innuendos please.
All right, Mr. Minshall, I do apologies for that. But where you do get your 70% of Israelis to be atheists. Ah, writing a lot don't mean you are right. After all, we both agreed...finally that faiths, not race divide the issues.  Most atheists are relapse type of people.   So what you are saying is that only those who worship Abraham's God deserves to live in the Holy Lands. But since the Jews were there first, its their homeland before coming of Islam. Over 1,500 years prior to Islam, the Jewish faith existed in that land.  Since both faiths honored Abraham's God, both faiths deserves to share the land. That is your premise?
"People... can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a Muslim TRAVEL BAN." -DJT
The travel ban is common sense, but was made into a political issue because the MO is to oppose everything proposed by Trump. When you're on an island, does it make more sense to screen people at all public events , but let them in the country because we don't want to discriminate. If I were an honest , law abiding Muslim, I would encourage "extreme vetting" or temporarily banning Muslims from the countries listed. Isn't that common sense?
The EU recognizes the above facts, and they've tried to solve it by opening the gates to Muslim immigration from North Africa, because they're young and have a high birth rate, much needed to support the social welfare systems.  But instead of assimilating, they're going on welfare and rejecting Western values, making the EU's problem worse.  I doubt the EU will last 2 more years.  Fun fact: there is only 35% as much money in the world as there is debt.  There is nowhere near enough money to pay it if you put a 100% tax on everything.  How is that going to rectify itself and return to reality?  A 70% Deflation of all asset prices.  Read: Depression.  Interest rates will soar when nobody wants to buy the bonds, and the bonds will lose 70% of their market value because the rates they pay now are too low.  Same goes for real estate and stocks, the latter priced at about 310% of actual book value.  When rates rose on the 10 yr note by almost 1% last November, the 10 yr lost 38% in value.
How about we start by discarding the ridiculous term "Islamophobia"? People may be against Islam for many reasons - maybe they are anti-religion in general, maybe they have legitimate concerns about women's rights in Islamic countries, maybe they are racists,  and yes, maybe they are irrationally afraid of Islam. The term "Islamophobia" assigns a motivation to any criticism of Islam that in most cases is simply false. "Anti-Islam" is a perfectly fine term and does not presume to assign a motivation to someone without justification.
>>But political Islam was no where to be seen.  Really?  Imam, sermons - accommodation of religions services in a Public School?
Nice headline from the prog-lib ADN.   I didn't ask him to explain his faith, did you?   Honestly, it sounds like a well-orchestrated "witch hunt" by a guy who wants to be on the assembly at the expense of current assembly member Amy Demboski, who just exercised her free speech rights (on her own time), to ask some honest questions about the possibility of religious militant compound creation in Alaska.  Even Jones does not dispute that. He said "his family's dream is to buy land and establish a Muslim enclave like the [militant compound]  in South Carolina" Hate to say it, but these compounds are militant in nature, folks. Deal with it.  After all, this is supposed to be about assimilation, not segregation, right?   How does creating "terrorist training compounds" integrate radical religious immigrants into our society and our culture?  What it's REALLY about is the PHOBIA of liberal locals & media, and slandering an honest assembly members good name.
Trump cannot take any action against Muslims, regardless of any national security concern due to inflammatory statements he made as a candidate. Every terrorist out there can now apply for asylum at the nearest US consulate. More will try to enter the country illegally because the ACLU says they will defend them once they're here. Apparently illegal immigration is now a civil rights matter too.
I would tink so as I assume them Chicago and other cities have gangbangers shooting down many hundreds of people every year. I'm rethinking the deeds of Islamic Terrorists are secondary to the U.S.'s gang/drug killings and could very well be behind Global Warming as The World Order have concluded. Don't worry about the Terror these people do today but the Bigger Picture hundreds of years from today. But back to the weapons being used, it's being said the new mass weapon of destruction are motor vehicles. Less conspicuous not showing intent using everyday things that could be used as weapons. If there's a Will, they have a way for Allah
" The first casualty of war is the truth". We may never know who did this but we do know this is a civil war with no solution in sight. If the Americans get involved , the worlds Muslims will be unhappy about it but so far the majority seem to be pretty quiet and unaffected with news of this unspeakable carnage.
Ian Has there been an attack by Muslims before Muslims were attacked?
"Heard of the Bosnian War, in the 1990s? The massacre at Srebrenica qualifies as genocide "  Interesting example of the Western countries intervening in a civil war to protect the Moslems against the Christians. When was the last time that some Moslems helped out any Christians?
Your efforts in Afghanistan sound downright heroic, Hoseloader. Congrats ... and thanks. The refugee situation is entirely different, of course, and I'm surprised you don't recognize that. Also at odds with your brave mission years ago is your local focus. What I learned in my years working with Muslims in a Delhi slum is how alike we are, and how the need for medical care, food and a warm place to sleep is universal. Refugees can't get that where they are; that's why they're refugees.
"hyperbolic"?  Trump called Mexicans murderers and rapists.  Those are his words.  Calling that a rant is "hyperbolic" to you?  Perhaps you should look up "hyperbole"... and "rant". Ummm... and he repeatedly stated he'd block Muslims from entering the country and create a database of those living in the US.  Further, a Trump aide pointed to Japanese internment camps as a model for his administration to follow on the issue of dealing with Muslims living in the US.    I didn't attribute Harper's deeds to Trump.  My point is that our democratic institutions are being eroded by specific interest groups who are attempting to deny the rights of their perceived political opponents.  It doesn't matter to me which country is doing it or which leader is responsible.  You're still thinking within the narrow margins of political ideology. As if being on the Left or the Right somehow justifies depriving others of their rights. Your petty party loyalties are irrelevant to me.
The problem here is that you cherry pick a news report to fit your convictions. - 1) Trump himself wrote in Twitter - "We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place. 4:37 PM - 25 Jun 2016 - 2) You deliberately cut off Katrina Pierson's last words in the quote " but had been misreported by the media as being an all-out ban on Muslims." -  "There has been no change. Mr. Trump still wants to stop individuals from coming into the country who cannot be vetted. That "Mr. Trump still wants to stop individuals from coming into the country who cannot be vetted" - is "misreported by the media as being an all-out ban on Muslims."  - Trump himself stated the change in suspension of immigration to only regions linked with terrorism. There is no change with respect to immigration from other regions where only persons who can be vetted are allowed in. Those who cannot be vetted are not allowed in. There's No all-out ban on Muslims.
You could start by sticking to facts and not speculation such as "I understand FOX news is still running with the story that the Quebec mosque shooting was perpetrated by a Moroccan Muslim." Either they are or they aren't. Just look online and then state a fact.
People do get that this guy is Wikipedia editor "Sherurcij", right? -- the most prolific defender of Islamist terrorists on Wikipedia
Police shoot  truck driver after he kills 8 people in a truck ambush. Muslims around the world are outraged.
It does not matter what happens in the election. It is too late for europe.  Islam will control the continent within the next 20 years.  Sad when all the politicians had to do was read the koran to recognized the danger it represents instead of embracing it and praying with the cult leaders at their mosques.
".... we need to talk about Islamophobia... " . Let's talk, but also address Islam  reformation?
I guess the author can revise our history to that the contributions to our nation building include the efforts of Blacks and Muslims.
Yes motley I do.  Remember weapons of mass destruction?  Do you really think the gov will let this horrendous tragedy go by w/o the gov spinning it to gather more of our rights?   Motley....There have been a few news shows that have had hands.on folks who know the pulse of people that knew  that area and more.  More info coming out.  He was interviewed by FBI 2 times.  There was a 3 hr delay from when the cops came.  It was a hate crime.......and sadly hate comes in many flavors.  I hear Trump used this crime to strengthen the kick out of Muslims.   I threw up.  Terror does NOT equal Muslim.  Our media is a failure.  The guy who shot the 22 year old singer while she was signing autographs?  White.    I just try and keep an open mind.  I still go back to my original post:  May comfort wrap the lost souls/families/friends who have suffered directly from these murders.  May we all seek the strength to become a collective w/a common goal: STOP THE VIOLENCE.  l2g
I'm sorry you stated "Donald Trump has said some questionable things, and his behavior at times has been unfortunate. But he has not targeted Alaska's workers, or our economy, or our values, as his challenger has done." So as  a former Republican chair, this is very telling, you don't think Alaska's workers or values include Muslims, Immigrants, Mexicans, women...these  are all examples of groups he's targeted...but you look the other way because...?
Since you admit that it is a fact that you are suggesting we as a non-Muslim country should "follow the example" of religious and political extremism in Muslim countries have a question for you.  Why do you think it is a good idea to violate the Constitution and discriminate against a specific religion? Putting aside the fundamentals in regards to the thinking and decision-making of other nations but it seems you think it is a good idea to toss aside one of the principle concepts of American democracy. Nostradamus moment: Lars is just going to ignore the question and respond to something else entirely.  Then when called on only responding rather than answering the question will repeat that he answered the question.
With increased muslim immigration, Canadians will notice that our country is by no means superior in integrating certain immigrants than the European countires are...
That's your view. Mine is that anyone that still supports Trump is naive, a victim of brain-washing. Say, you don't think Obama is a Muslim, do you? Or doubt he's American? Guess what, MC,  you may be crazy, but that's you. And do you think, in retrospect, W was a good president? The answer will say a lot about you.
Whenever muslims are fighting each other, it is imperative to arm whichever side is losing.
Wonder why he hasn't shut down Indonesia (most populace muslim country in the world)??? Trump Hotels? Other family business interests???
Goldberg is right, what does it mean to say "Take Trump seriously but not literally"? The phrase is gibberish in this context. Maybe Trump's insiders can excuse Trump's campaign promises as "serious but not literal", but can Trump's fired-up base? To take a man's promises literally is to take him at his word. When Trump promised he would build a wall and make Mexico pay for it, his base took him at his word. When Trump promised he would bring jobs back with high tariffs on foreign outsourced goods, his base took him at his word. When Trump said he would ban immigration of Muslim refugees, his base took him at his word, and started a hate campaign against US Muslims which goes on today. When Trump says he will "make America great again", his base regards that as a promise to support all the bigotry and reactionary persecution his base thinks that entails.  Maybe Trump's inner circle thinks "no problem, just never mind"; but Trump's base took him at his word, and they are fired up.
London, as well as most of Europe, is deteriorating rapidly.  London now has a Muslim mayor which shows how they have infiltrated all levels of government.
Where do the tensions come from?  Perhaps from the Islamic religion in Western societies.
"Far from being infantile, I think that it is absolutely Machiavellian, as it has itself created the discord that it now purports to prevent, thus justifying it's own need."  It hasn't done anything of the sort. What it's done is to EXPOSE, for all to see, the degree of Islamophobia and bigotry in Canada.  Bigotry prefers to work just under the surface, acting in non-obvious ways. As long as minorities don't get too uppity, too visible or too successful, bigots are generally satisfied. But when an event like the mass murder in Quebec takes place, and society wishes to express solidarity with the victimized group, all the bigotry bursts forth. How dare society single out Muslims for special expressions of sympathy. How dare society criticize hatred of Muslims. How dare anyone peel back the scab that covers the festering mess under my skin!  M-103 has been very enlightening. Even more clearly than did the murders in Quebec, it's revealed the degree of Islamophobia in Canada.
JP:    For what it's worth I never stated it never happens, I will state that the numbers and frequency as well as the professed intent of committing murder, leaving of written or recorded statements, not committing the murders as a secondary action, speaks for itself.  The simple matter of the number of victims, and the actions of the shooters, making it clearly a matter of religious action. From Mumbai, to Belgium, San Bernardino, to Boston, 9/11, and now Orlando, we find ourselves engaged not only in battling radical Islam overseas, but increasingly on our own shores as well.   One thing is abundantly clear, all of these crimes were committed by those that most would consider zealots, or mentally unstable.
It includes no such wording.  From the definitive source (OED):  "Dislike of or prejudice against Islam or Muslims, especially as a political force."
Outsider:  That is not at all an accurate description of what he said.  Ali was clearly in favor of segregation and against miscegenation.   He considered it to be unnatural for different races to associate with each other and intermix.  These are clearly views of a racist.  And note his comment about his extremist religious viewpoint, that the races were not the same or equal. That is something that the nation of Islam vehemently preaches to its followers like Ali.  Are you not aware that the Nation of Islam is a well documented racist hate group?   The renown Southern Poverty Law Center, which has tracked racists and hate groups in our country for many decades, and fights hard for justice and equality for minorities in America, has very detailed information about the bigotry and hate they spread.   And Ali was a fervent member.  Malcolm X himself oversaw Ali's conversion, and gave Ali his new name.  https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam  .
Granted, hatred and intolerance know no ethnic, racial or religious boundaries.  However, it appears that Islamic jihadists have killed far more people than the white supremacists that the author decries.  Furthermore, the Islamic jihadists are fully convinced that they will enter paradise after detonating their devices and killing innocent passers-by.  Otherwise, why would they willingly kill themselves? This alone makes them more dangerous than the white supremacist nutcase who has no such illusions about entering paradise after committing some horrific act on innocents.
It doesn't preclude anyone from discussing anything  It simply shows solidarity with the Quebec victims and condemns HATRED of Muslims.  Talk about what you want, it has no legal binding anyways.
I agree.  If Trump were to single out a religious group qua religious group, that would be wrong.  If Trump were to oppose immigration by Mexicans on grounds of race, that would be even more wrong.  But you assume he hates both groups, and as much as I "dislike" Trump (to put it mildly), I just don't have the evidence to say he hates them, or wants to discriminate against them on the basis of religion or race. Take the travel ban.  Yes, strictly against Muslim countries.  But not ALL Muslim countries, and it affects a relatively small percentage of Muslims --- those from countries that pose the most significant threat of terrorism.  If he wanted to discriminate against Muslims qua Muslims, he did a pretty bad job of it.  And the ban is only temporary, until the people affected by it can be properly vetted.  Given the risks that terrorists pose, that's not unreasonable, not when almost every significant act of terrorism in the world is accompanied by shouts of "Allahu Akbar."
Maybe it has something to do with the trillions of dollars we have spent bombing and regime changing Muslim countries for the last century ? Just saying ? Maybe ?
"The Police" "Gays" "Muslims" "The Other"  I guess it is just easier for some people to look at another group of people as a homogeneous blob where everyone has the same characteristics and opinions.    There's been so much negative publicity on this issue, you'd think someone at Pride would relent and say, "Okay, police officers, you can march in the parade in uniform as an individual police officer (Meaning: We're still mad at TPS as an organization) if you sign this pledge to promise to treat everyone respectfully and report any officer you see who doesn't ..."   Police officers that are so inclined can then get what they want and BLMT can continue its war with TPS,
It's the Turkish people voting, not "Muslims". The population of Hungary is not majority Muslim and it has the same kind of vicious, power-mad leader.
The penchant radical Islam has for recruiting under-age youngsters to perpetrate their nefarious deeds is well known.
How about the panty-waist Governor ordering that all Muslims living in the State of Alaska report to JABER for immediate relocation back to the Mid Eastern country of their choice ?
Why will you not recognize that the Catholic Church is a large part of the problem?  The Catholic Church in the US has been fomenting division ever since the late 70s.  The Church has continued to do this by firing gays from their jobs and by, essentially, condemning people to hell if they were to vote for Clinton.  The US Catholic Church is, in significant part, responsible for the election of a man who has elevated all sorts of bigotry to an art.  His election has already created an atmosphere in which people feel free to openly harass, intimidate and threaten those whom they consider to be "undesirables", whether it's blacks, or Muslims, or immigrants.  And you suggest that THIS institution be given the role of bringing about peace and unity?????????????????????????
"Arrayed on the other side of the great Muslim civil war are the Sunnis, moderate and Western-allied,"  Moderate? The Whahabbists are moderate? This guy is a running joke - I guess he must of forgot all about 9/11(short memory).
Automatic weapons have been illegal to purchase for nearly 30 years in the US and were not used in either of the recent tragedies.  You and all other posters on here need to calm down and learn some facts before emotionally responding.    The right wants to ban muslims and the left wants to ban guns - the truth is neither will work and you're all just irrationally scared.
To understand the columnist's point of view , we must first understand the use of  "Taqiyya".   Taqiyya  is the Islamic practice of  deception by telling only half truths (omission) or telling non-believers only what they want to hear (concealment).  Taqiyya is one of the "Five Pillars of Islam", to protect Islam from skeptics and critics. It is hard for non-Muslims to understand that not only does it exist, but is regularly used to play the suffering victim.
Go ahead and call me what you want - but I'll make a prediction here. I know that hard-core atheiests/secularists and leftists hate the separate system (and religion in general). But I predict that given non-catholics are free to attend such schools, that students who are (and whose parrents are) followers of Islam will eventually flood Catholic schools in areas where possible, make similar demands as per this article and go one further, seeking further accomodation and inclusion of Islamic practice/religion - and will be encouraged by the left on the political spectrum so as to further the aims of destroying the catholic system.  (Yet may create something unintended??) Yes my child does go to catholic school. At the public school, every holiday was celebrated (other religions/cultures) except her's. (As she was in the public system prior). Now her culture is valued and she feels valued.
You're right, not show how I manage to completely missdate Marco Polo like that, I really should not try to argue from memory alone :P  However what is undeniably a fact is that paper was brought to Europe by the Moors who had in turn gotten it from the Arabs who had gotten  it from the Chinese via long and elaborate trade networks.  It's quite ironic that one of the key technologies behind the spread of Christianity throughout Europe was brought to Europe by Muslims.
no wonder america is so hated by these muslim countries.. we tell them they are all heathens and that the only god is our god.. then we take their oil and leave them wallowing in poverty with hatred fueled by ignorance... imagine if they came to america and treated us this way.. oil field diplomacy and christian philosophy is a stew for war...
Not one word has yet been printed in the Globe or Star about how the local residents feel or why . Everything is seen solely from the Muslims' point of view. This is getting very close to sharia , where not being Muslim is the problem.
I'm just amazed at how quick they are to jump to the defense of Islam while at every turn bashing and belittling Christians. I don't know your leanings but I think it's time we call out politicians on both sides when they clearly work against the interests of everyday Americans
The Muslim Ottomans and Safavids ruled Christian kingdoms in Eastern Europe, Armenia, Georgia, etc - but did not convert them en masse. Other than Russia, European kingdoms were not as liberal. There wasn't a single mosque in Western Europe till the 19th or the 20 century.  As for the Japanese, they never went to a foreign country and forcibly converted people to Shintoism.
I didn't know Muslims have a prayer for that.
'Meltdown' of the truth in mainstream media and Canada's pro Muslim propaganda rags! Great victory for the legitimate government over Saudi and American mercenaries,terrorists,and provocateurs that are our real enemies in the West! Kudos to Putin for doing the job the little potatoes of the world won't.
Why panic and call for a moderator (censor)? Is this not a free society, freedom of speech and thought? jtowne is allowed to have his opinion! Political correctness can take a back seat.  I imagine that saying ban all "Islamic extremists" from our societies would be more realistic and attainable.
Christianity was spread by the sword too. In latin America, Spain, italy, Portugal, etc not a single Muslim or Jew was left unconverted. The ones who refused to convert were killed, to the last person.  Whereas there were significant Christian communities in Muslim ruled territories of the Ottomans, the Safavids, the Mughals, etc.
The refugees are political not religiously dislocated. The Syrian civil war is a battle of regime against democracy which has turned into a proxy war of allegiances. There are christians, muslims, sunni and others on both sides of the war.
Trump is right, London mayor coincidentally feels it's erroneous to name the religious extremism of terrorism. He's not alone, in this same forums you'll encounter those who believe the religions of peace have nothing to do with those cowardly deadly acts , just like another Canadian celebrity at the helm of the PMO, you can not name the perpetrators, just in case he will introduce 'just a motion' against islamophobia, soon to become law in the summer. So disturbing.
‘Second, why are the muslims in Peel Distrct so demanding?’ I’m sure the Serbs in Bosnia during the mid-90s asked themselves a similar question.
If he had converted to Judaism  or to become a Lutheran woudl that be a story ?  The gist of the story is the Islam is superior to us.
Under Harper, the CPC established itself as a solidly and actively anti-Muslim political party from the very start. That has not changed. Andrew Scheer's attacks on Omar Khadr, his willingness to try to turn that unfortunate situation into a political wedge issue spoke directly to racism. Scheer never would have made an issue of Khadr if Khadr was named "Patrick Fitzpatrick" and was a child soldier for the IRA. Of course, if Khadr had been such, Harper would not have done all he could to block him from getting back to Canada. The Rebel embodies that kind of anti-Muslim bigotry. The genius of the CPC on this score was to reach out to most Canadian ethnic/religious groups while loudly singling out one particular group for exclusion and demonization. As far as I can see, nothing has changed.
When Harper started the anti-niqab campaign, even the non Muslim immigrants realized that they were next.
While the lead is likely too big to change the results substantially, recall that the November 8 2016 exit polls showed Clinton winning and everyone had all but declared her the winner by 8pm.  Rutte will win in seats, but let's see the final seat count and hopefully Wilders will win over 20 seats when all the ballots are counted. In any case, the Dutch have voted for suicide and surrendered their country to the Muslims.  They deserve what they voted for.
The MP bringing forward the motion wanted to "quell" Islamophobia: quell means to suppress by force. Quell has a definition. A phobia is also defined: it is a psychological condition based on irrational fear. Having concerns with the increased practice of Islam in our country is not racist (Islam is not a race and has a multicultural following) when acts of terrorism around the world are undertaken by Islamic followers, when segregation is practiced routinely, and when we can see women subjugated by the religion by both the male and female followers of the religion and this gets taught to their five children versus my teaching my one child that men and women are equal.  Having worked in a community with predominantly Muslim male businessman, I know full well that the opinion about women affects EVERY woman's rights, not just Muslim females. Why women aren't marching in the streets against this bigotry that is growing in Canada is beyond belief.
The Muslim apologists, and the Globe has three of them as editorial writers, are in overdrive to distract from where the real threats lie.
So it's ok with you if during the campaign Judge Watson formed a negative opinion about Mr. Trump's anti radical Islam stance, then later dredged up that personal bias to use in a ruling?  Is that what they teach at Harvard?
"Islam forms the core part of our identity, but this core is not in conflict with Canadian values."  Sharia law governs the political, social and moral duties of faithful Muslims. Are you trying to argue that creating a parallel legal / social system doesn't conflict with Canadian values? I really want to see you bend yourself out of shape answering that.
Maybe, just maybe, if you actually knew or worked with any Muslims you would find many to be bending (gladly) to western culture rather that trying to make Canada into an image of the horrible fundamentalist and/or police states many have left behind.
It's hard to see how this call for greater compassion and conscientious activism to help refugees of different backgrounds, faiths and colours applies to contemporary Canadian society.  Perhaps the authors did not see Rosie DiManno's recent column in The Star, where she defended the lack of empathy for Muslim victims of terror in Islamic countries because their 'culture' is unrecognizable to 'us'.    However, DiManno insists that we automatically feel empathy for victims of attacks in Berlin, Brussels or Manchester because "few [Canadians] can picture themselves in Kabul or Aleppo or Mogadishu."  Odd, I thought *universal* human rights and refugee protection was about recognizing ourselves in other human beings, not in their cities, cultures or religions.  After all, by DiManno's logic, non-Jews should feel justified in not feeling empathy for victims of the Holocaust.  Canadians are losing touch with their own values and identity.  That's the story here.
But, the court is asking if the travel ban isn't just a thinly-veiled attempt to ban Muslims. They are trying to grapple with that the ban only applies to six or seven countries. If it were a true Muslim ban, then it would apply to those from Indonesia and other places. So, we will have to sit back and see how they reason.
Let's not forget how some of the Indian merchant class (Muslim and Gujarati) exploited the poor local Indian community. The wounds still run deep in the Indian community.
Rambling and trivial. Forget the wife. Trump gets the angry vote...but Hillary gets the rich man's money because he is mentally unstable. Hillary is not just “crooked” or “corrupt.“ She espouse the evil of disaster capitalism…where America overthrows governments (Libya, Syria), conducts relentless bombings and drone assassinations (with incidental murder called “collateral damage”), makes wars for immense profits in arms and munitions manufacture (investments financed with public money) , “rebuilds” what was destroyed, privatizes over-priced military “support” services, etc. “The War on Terror” is big business. A big business that depends on Americans being scared of getting their trivial heads cut off by some guy in a turban…while our government…under the rule of the rich…kills Muslims by the thousands for profit. Hillary is evil...but otherwise "stable." Trivial column…many trivial comments.
Why can't the Jews living the West Bank live n a future Palestinian State? Are there no Arabs, Muslims, Christians living in Israel with full citizenship?  Netanyahu is the current PM.  Previously, there were may Israeli leaders who offered to leave the West Bank (and already left Gaza).  What of the Palestinian side?  When are the next Palestinian elections?   This article is ridiculously biased and serves no useful purpose.  it continues the false narrative that the settlements are at the heart of the problem.  There was no Palestinian State prior o the settlements. I am not saying the settlements are helping but they are not the obstacle to peace.  Only another convenient excuse.
Conservative Christian churches like Garret Hashimoto can freely ignore the IRS rules because they think they can get away with it, and they are counting on the Republicans in Congress to rein in the IRS. Look for the possibility that the Republicans will rewrite the rules to permit politicking by Christian churches but not Jewish synagogues and Muslim mosques and even amending the Constitution making the US a Christian nation.  A truly frightening prospect.
What exactly are you saying?  Are you saying the march of islam is better then the brownshirts?   " Their primary purposes were providing protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies, disrupting the meetings of opposing parties, fighting against the paramilitary units of the opposing parties, especially the Red Front Fighters League (Rotfrontkämpferbund) of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), and intimidating Slavic and Romani citizens, unionists, and Jews – for instance, during the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses."  This sounds strangely  like the SJW warriors and far left disguised as progressivism in todays world.  Scary how history repeats.  The danger is not in populism, nationalism, and closed borders.  The danger is the opposite.
The two situations are not the same. The Muslims were not rounded up and put in to camps and had their property confiscated. The Japanese tried very hard to assimilate, to become a part of the country that they adopted. I don't know if you can say that about most Muslims that emigrate here or come as refugees. If wearing a hijab makes people stare at you, why do you wear it? You don't have to wear it. Because of modesty? That's how it was where you came from, what you're trying to get away from, I assume. Maybe if you tried to fit in people wouldn't stare at you. Just saying.
>>Check the new for both ISIS and the Kurds  Said former subjects. Besides - ISIS is not blowing stuff in Turkey because of colonialism.  Kurds are not former subjects either. Armenian terrorism was also based in separatism.  >>. Now think how bad it would be if Turkey were still a world power.  They were, for 500+ years. What part of my point you don't understand?  >>Historical events have repercussions. . Here is a question for you - why is it that only fanatical  Islam seeks "repercussions?".  Why aren't Eastern Europeans blowing stuff in Turkey today?  Why aren't French and British blowing up stuff in Germany?  Why aren't  Americans blowing stuff in Britain?   Why aren't Asian countries, butchered by the Imperial army, not blowing stuff in Japan?   Why aren't African non-Muslim blowing stuff in Europe? Why aren't Africans blowing stuff in the Arab countries? Why aren't South Americans blowing stuff in Spain, Portugal, Britain? . Why is radical Islam seeking "repercussions" in 2001?
Did you know that Japan has super restrictive immigration policies and for instance does not accept Muslim immigrants because they believe  that they do not intergrate well at all.  Could having the courage to call the shots as they see fit be responsible in part for such a high ranking ?
Muslim radical today plows into crowd in spain killing over a dozen.  Left wing response="you can't blame all muslims for this".  White nationalist dude has his car attacked by dozens of thugs with sticks and bats.  He panics, crashes his car and one woman dies.  Left wing response="you can blame all conservatives, conservative websites, and the president for this"  See the consistency?  Yeah, me neither.
Islam's impact was the most notable in the expansion of trade. The first contact of Muslims with India was the Arab attack on a nest of pirates near modern-day Mumbai to safeguard their trade in the Arabian Sea. Around the same time many Arabs settled at Indian ports, giving rise to small Muslim communities. The growth of these communities was not only due to conversion but also the fact that many Hindu kings of south India (such as those from Cholas) hired Muslims as mercenaries.[118]
Trust me, the 71% of us with common sense that don't support paying a terrorist $10.5M will not forget about this when the next election comes up. In fact, we'll keep this front and center every day till that time comes. Not to mention the billions Tater Tot has given those muslim countries. That won't be forgotten, either.
The problem is, treating one with love and inclusiveness, are you sure the one you are treating to will return the same level of love and inclusiveness to you?  Quite frantically, I actually think the so called "love and inclusiveness" of the western world is actually the breeding bed for extremism, Islam or not Islam.
There have been a number of progressive Muslim over the years along with religious scholars that have argued that the veil has nothing to do with Islam. If this is correct it will hard to argue a violation of your religious freedom, unless the argument is that religion is what you say it is, which would open up all sorts of issues.
I forgot for the moment that primary and secondary Catholic schools in the States are private schools. In most of Canada Catholic schools are publicly funded... in Anglophone Canada we speak of "public" and "separate" (=Catholic) schools. Our problem is that this formerly just situation in which public schools were unambiguously protestant and separate schools were catholic, has been disrupted with the influx of Muslims and other non-Christian faiths who are busily setting up their own private, not-publicly funded schools.   With the increase of secularism, the demand to defund Catholic schools will increase, despite constitutional protection. Our bishops are too fixated in their contentment with what we have to notice the injustice in favour of Catholics. They could use the existing constitutional protection to barter away Catholic privilege for a single public system in which all faiths (including secular) have the right to teach their religion as an optional subject. Not on radar.
Canada needs to pass laws that ban the indoctrination of anyone under that age of 18 with religion. Christian, Jew and Muslims etc.
I'm hardly "willfully blind" Brew.  I'm into facts both by personal inclination and professional training. Whereas some people have backgrounds that do fit the definition of willfully blind, especially those that have of currently work for the DOC. Everyone knows the DOC never accepts responsibility for anything that happens on it's watch.  And show me where I've ever denied radicalized Muslims don't exist? Also provide evidence that it's only radicalized Muslims behind any attacks as I asked you to do.
Many of the migrants entering Canada illegally from the U.S.A. are Somalis.  That's interesting. The Muslim al Shabaab extremists in Somalia have been encouraging Somali and other Muslim sympathizers in the U.S.A. and Canada to attack soft targets, like shopping malls, etc.,  and to use every means possible to attack, maim and kill non believers in the U.S.A. and Canada.  Why would Canadian police and immigration officials take the risk and allow Somalis to cross the border illegally into Canada to claim refugee status?  And, once in Canada, how will Canada deport the migrants if they don't meet the criteria to stay in Canada?  If some or many of those migrants don't meet the criteria to stay in Canada and Canada needs to deport some or many of those asylum seekers, what will happen if the country they came from and their countries of origin won't take them back, will Canada get stuck with them at the expense of Canadians?
M-103 is causing more trouble. It is a fact that a lot of Canadians mistrust Muslims and it is a fact that Muslims do not care for Christians, it is a fact that politicians use this to get elected. Respect for each other is what is needed and M-103 won't give us that!
Help me understand..I gather there is a temporary ban for entry to the US from "the Seven Countries" until deeper more thorough vetting is completed. I don't know how many practicing Muslims reside in those 7 countries but imagine it is significant and many will inconvenienced by the delay. There is no ban on residents of other countries coming to the US be they Muslim, Christian, Hindi, etc. So my question is why am I reading headlines in major media print and protest signs that say Muslim Ban is wrong approach by Whitehouse or Muslims Banned - Fight for Muslims! Something is not correct, if there is as they the Protesters say, a ban on Muslims would that not mean all Muslims world wide are banned from coming to the US? Yet I also read that Muslims are travelling to the US from other then the 7 without incident. Isn't more accurate to say Country X citizens of all faith's are banned until vetted?   So help out if you can...these are opposing conclusions, they can't both be right.
I don't think Trump is juvenile. Obama tried that patronizing insult on ISIS and look what they've been doing. Big mistake!   Liberals are way too arrogant to be good. Arrogant and self-deluded about their own goodness.    And Trump's supporters are not child-like. Were the Bolsheviks "child-like"?  The American revolutionaries? Was Robespierre "child-like"?     The important thing for Trump's supporters is now their suffering is out in the political arena for all to see. Liberals have no excuse to ignore them. Whether Trump can provide tens of millions of good jobs is questionable. Whether he wants to is also questionable. But, hey, they want their fill and their thrill one way or another. Don't mess with them.   When you're poor decade after decade you eventually hate the whole world. Would you care about the niceties of gender equality, tolerance towards Muslims, and gay marriage when you've lost your job, your house, your wife, your family, friends and health?   NO YOU WOULD NOT.
Six Quebec Muslims died due to politicians not only refusing to address peoples' concerns, but actually insulting the citizens who have them.  The attacks occurred the day after Justin Trudeau invited all the Muslims refused by Trump to come to Canada. Coincidence? I think not.  There is a lot of official concern about "alienating" Muslim youth who might not feel "at home" if society doesn't respect and  accommodate their extreme beliefs, but none for the non-Muslim youth who feel alienated because their society tells them their concerns don't count. Telling emotionally fragile young people their government doesn't give a hoot about their concerns has consequences, too.
The only proven fact is that it is global fraud using falsified data!  It's all about taking your money and giving it to arab countries!  That is called the Jizya or jizyah (Arabic: جزية‎‎ ǧizya IPA: [dʒizja]; Ottoman Turkish: جزيه cizye) is a per capita yearly tax historically levied by Islamic states on certain non-Muslim subjects—dhimmis.  This is being forced on the world by the Islamic dominated  and totally corrupt u.n.!
There is such a thing as rational fear concerning the Islamist political ideology. "Islamophobia" implies an irrational fear and it is a condescending term that is meant to slam the door shut against any critique of Islam, and against any free speech on this topic . Canadians have a right to fear sharia law and much of the doctrines of fundamentalist Islam.
I have had two comments gassed this evening because they referred to some of the contents of the main prayer book from which the Muslim students will be praying on Fridays in Peel schools.  Why?
Be informed read the book  "Heretic Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now by Ayaan Hirsi Ali"
A few years ago Muslims in Ontario schools were caught citing "hate speach" prayers. As a result the school board had 6 pre-approved prayers made up with local Imams. Because of the backlash caused by the Muslim community the school cancelled this and backtracked allowing students to once again use their own prayers. So that and the fact that the school blatently lied by stating “They’ve never heard of an incident of hate being propagated.”is certainly cause for concern. Just because a parent is concerned does not make them a "bigot" or "racist"
I did not know Islam was a race?
Why do you think I support Sharia Law? I am not Muslim, and would be in trouble.  It is frightening to think ill informed persons get to have the same one vote as a well informed person. It is the major defect of a democracy.
The Japanese aren't known for beheadings or dousing people in gasoline then setting them alight for a belief system that actually rewards such behavior. Maybe you should talk to real Japanese people, from Japan. They don't allow Muslims in their Country. They know what's going on.
I read an article about Foucault today, it made me contemplate how much bad faith progressive intellectuals have about what is going on in Europe today, as their intellectual for-bearers were very clear about these kinds of things; Foucault certainly was.  A section of the Muslim world, with the passive approval of its majority, has taken upon itself to Observe, Discipline and Punish non Muslim bodies and minds so that they obey Islamic religious codes as a matter of instinct, as a matter of habit. They are accomplishing this through spectacular random violence, enabled via modern networking technology and Muslim diaspora communities, especially in Europe.  The results are showing as European leaders, intellectual, political, spiritual and social have been reduced to docile bodies in the face of traditional Islamic theology - refusing of their own accord to depict or even speak about Mohammed, accommodating Halal and prayer requests in public spaces, in short submitting to Power.
Of course the vast majority of Muslims aren't terrorists! On the other hand, for the past 20 or so years, the vast majority of terrorist activity has in fact been committed on behalf of Islam. While it's nice to say that Islam 'is a religion of peace', it isn't really, or at any rate there are many parts of the Koran that exhort the believer to commit acts of violence on behalf of Allah - and these parts are what the terrorists are focusing on.  So in a sense Mr. Couillard is right - the most effective way to communicate how reprehensible terrorism is has to come from the Muslim community, from the imams and leaders. The young need to be indoctrinated against terrorism.  And it's the Muslim community that needs to exercise close oversight over visiting preachers and leaders to ensure they're not inciting violence.    Some of this is already going on.  But I suspect, not enough. And that may be the point Mr. Couillard is making, not an attack on the Muslim community.
Again, metaphor little man, metaphor.  What caused you to leave those Muslim paradises btw? Have they closed the airports to incoming traffic?
If Milo were a green haired, gender social justice militant, who has embraced the innocence of Islam, everything he said would have been considered his right to say, and maybe even a step in the right direction by fellow green haired   gender   social warriors who think the arbitrary age of 18-year age  is oppression by the straight white patriarchy. Milo's primary sin was simply being conservative.
Monica...I heard Ellison on a podcast and was really interested in the fact that he had the largest turnout in his district in the state which itself has a huge turnout....  He spent time talking about how he had managed that turnout.....the fact that he's a Muslim is interesting, too.  I don't know...but was impressed. The podcast was on Keepin it 1600, and dated Nov 21, titled Ep.54:Hamilton,Trumps Swamp and Congressman Keith Ellison (interview)
Much easy to spend billions on new weapons and send troops to Europe then to build good relationship with Russia.How dare general Flinn to connect Islam and terror.
Google "Ex Saudi muslim warns Canadians about Islam" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_YzMetgALU
"One in three Americans fear an Islamic terrorist attack...... "  An article with a crazy title......
I did not realize it was against the muslim faith to be buried with non-muslims. I guess I have a lot to learn about the muslim religion.  I do not have a problem with re-zoning it and allowing the muslim community to purchase the land and upkeep the cemetary at their cost. I do not see why others would care if the muslim community is going to pay for it.
This is not an "islamic war". It is just another criminal war engineered by the Neo-Cons to dominate Syrians under a dictator they can control, since Syria remains one of the few states in the region not already ruled by one.  Sadly, when the US and Israel engineered this criminal war to dominate Syrians under a dictator controlled by Washington, they handed Syria and its allies the legal right to defend the country from it.
It's not a Muslim prayer room!  It's a room in a school where Muslim students pray for an hour a week.  What the room is used for during the remaining time is entirely up to the school itself, and it should be used for people of all faiths to pray.
"Islam suppresses women's rights."  - Of course that is neurotic 3rd wave feminism and Islamophobia.
My comment wasn't a bash against Islam, but I was critical about the person in this article.  Apparently that is not allowed.  Silly me.  My comment evaporated.
If Qatar is a puppet of Iran, why does it fund Sunni extremist groups?  IMHO Iran is far more oriented to the West.  The Saudi Royals make sure that the Wahhabis have enough money to keep their fundamentalist schools open throughout the Muslim world to brainwash the young children of poor families who can't afford any other education for their kids.  Bin Laden was Saudi. The 911 hijackers were Saudi. What is going on?? The first jet to fly out of the USA after 911 was full of Saudis heading home.  Is it still a thing about oil?  The world will run out of water before it runs out of oil.  The fact is, fundamentalist Islam has proven itself to be the scourge of the Middle East. Since its inception and spread through the area, the great artistic and philosophical cultures of Persia, Assyria, Baghdad, Egypt, Babylon, Palestine, etc.  have been totally destroyed.
Maybe the UK raised it's threat level in anticipation of the usual and predictable platitudes that follow every European Muslim terrorist bombing attack: 1. We will never bow to terrorism.  2. This event makes us stronger as a nation.  3.  The spirit of the UK will long endure, and stuff like this you know.
50 years from today the question will be asked how did the USA allow the Muslims to take over their country. That question is being asked today in France and Germany.
What a surprise!  The suspects in the Quebec shooting appear to be muslims!  Trump is 100% right!
Freedom of religion, freedom of conscience, freedom of belief, expression and association... Quebec's law violates all those fundamental freedoms. And and that's just section S.2 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Then there's S.3, democratic freedoms. Muslim women will be denied their voting rights in Quebec unless they unveil.  Then there's S.6 mobility rights. Quebec's law violates that, because it will restrict the mobility of veiled women.  Then there's S.15, equality rights. "Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability."  Quebec didn't just push a bit against a single Canadian freedom. Quebec went whole hog.
Islam means "submission". They expect the entire human race to eventually submit to Allah. Now, it is St Apollinaires turn.
To jimetjules - United Nations -  Bigotry - by MUSLIM AUTHOR - Salim Mansur  . "The reason Palestinians will receive the (United Nations) General Assembly’s undeserving support is due to the real, though unstated, institutionalized bigotry inside the world body that once voted Zionism as a form of racism. .  Against such bigotry there is no appeal for fairness.  . Ask the more deserving Tibetans."  . Excerpt from:  Undeserving case for a Palestinian state - Salim Mansur - Toronto Sun - June 04, 2011  .
ya think they will ever stop.....not likely   Muslims who closely observe sharia law, which splits the world into two perpetually warring halves, will always have a "divinely sanctioned" right to deceive, until "all chaos ceases, and all religion belongs to Allah" (Quran 8:39).
The vast majority of Canada has been made up of immigrants from Christian Countries much the same as the U.S. The intolerance was more on race and not at all about Religion. But now you have A Religion moving into the Country that has proven itself to be incompatible with all other Religions over the Centuries. Do some research will ya. This is a totally different situation and most Canadians do not understand what Islam really is, a Political Party cloaked in a Religion and it has not proven itself to be peaceful with other Religions. Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Somalia and Mr. Trumps list. Hatred and submission to Islam enforced. Already they want specific protections in the form of Blasphemy law just like their home Countries.
"The articles in this paper find new lows on a weekly basis." A ban on Muslim cemeteries is an attack on us all Trump is going to war – with the media, with the truth, with America A familiar pattern emerges. If I didn't know better I would think the GM ideology is on full display. Nah....
To Muslims, Sharia Law is most certainly​ the Law of God.
Then it makes sense to expand the list....perhaps to ALL Muslim dominated countries
There is no modern parallel to the regressive nature of Islamism. No freedom of expression, no freedom of association, no freedom of the press, no gender equality. Just look at Turkey's regression after 70 years of secularism under the Islamist AKP. Are we to believe the 57 nations of the OIC are beacons of liberal secularism and personal freedoms? I suppose a 14 year old girl being pummelled by morality police in Iran for wearing ripped jeans is a function of "cultural relativism"... political Islam is driven by an unquenchable thirst for control over all levels of society, Erdogan has demonstrated as much over the last 8 years.
Bibi knows better than many others, how is Islamic terrorist, or who is a peaceful Muslim.   Bibi stood up to Barack Hussein for long and proved that he is a man of valor.
(Part two of two parts)  When Muslim lives and health depend on dogmatic teachings on gender, it's academic if Christianity is just as misogynistic as Islam.  And add, when ANY lives and health depend on dogmatic teachings on gender . . . especially when such dogma is based on so-called “natural law.”  Natural law is different from Revealed law and is amenable to academic discussions, Papal forbidding of such discussion, notwithstanding.  See the censure of the administration of The (Pontifical) Catholic University of America, in place since 1960.  https://www.aaup.org/our-programs/academic-freedom/censure-list.  It isn’t Christian or humane to ignore injustice committed against those of another religion . . . as the movie “Spotlight” illustrates.  One of the spiritual Works of Mercy is to “Admonish the Sinner”, which is what the Faithful do when they object to human injustice of any type.
Sure Nathan - going to the Muslim war zone aka Xinjing where Saudi funded terrorists are routinely blowing themselves up , and trying to interview the terrorist sympathizers to do a story on "oppression" is such an great idea. You deserve full of it.
Marg has probably expressed how most people feel. The questions that I wonder about are: With less than 5% of the population in Canada, why is so much media attention devoted to issues regarding Muslims and their adaption to Canada? Why are Muslims religious needs so important in our secular society?  Why does the Liberal party insist on something as divisive as M-103? Why does our Prime Minster spend a Christian holiday with the spiritual leader of Muslims?  The word "hate" and racist are now used against anyone who asks such questions.  Where is this really going and what is the ultimate objective ?
Issues like this will become more common as years go by. Liberals increasing immigration to 350k per year. The whole system will need to change according to these people. Lets start with stat holidays; Christmas, Good Friday and New Years day need to change. Why is the calendar Canada uses represents the Catholic Church and Jesus? Muslims, Chinese, Hindus, Jews all have their own calendar. Maybe Canada could create a New Calendar that is less offensive. Lets base it on  PET was born which was 1919 or when he died.
Can you hear the global outcry by Muslims against this attack?  Neither can I. Maybe the quiet peaceful religion called Islam just doesn't want to break the silence.
It's Bannon that worries me most. As we're learning more about his worldview, it's becoming blindingly obvious that this guy belongs nowhere the levers of power. Yet he's weaseled his way into the Oval Office.   Trump is a chaotic dolt who makes decisions to stroke his own ego. Bannon has a religious fervor to start WWIII against Muslims around the world. He's far more dangerous than Trump. Four years is too long to have him controlling so much power.
Our previous immigrants weren't radical Islamic terrorists.  That is the different.  And Ottawa Poog has hit the nail on the head.  Immigrants are welcomed, just not the ones that blow people up.
I agree, this refuge things run out control. The liberals somehow they lost the straight thinking. The liberal media and liberal government behind it. The only cure for that, a nice Muslim attack on the western world width lots of causalities and they will be a bit more cautious about emigration.
They want the police to submit to their religion and their demands.  Islam means submission, It has nothing to do with what is in the best interests of society as a whole.
"Demagnetize" tRump's anti-Muslim card.  Last December, Gil Parker Payne spotted a Muslim woman wearing a hijab on a Southwest Airlines flight from Chicago to Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Payne, who was seated several rows behind the woman, walked up the aisle towards her while the plane was still in flight, stopped next to her seat, and said, “Take it off! This is America!” When she didn’t follow his orders, he proceeded to pull her hijab all the way off, leaving the woman’s head exposed.   On Friday, the 37-year-old man from Gastonia, North Carolina, plead guilty in the District of New Mexico one count of “using force or threat of force to intentionally obstruct a Muslim woman … in the free exercise of her religious beliefs.”
Jesus and his teaching that made this western civilization possible and his message is fully rejected by all Islamic peoples. That's all we need to know really, or is it just an option and acceptable to reject our cultural fore-bearers to be politically correct? Why tolerate people that don't follow our teacher? That's too much kindness that bites us in the end. Please delete this message as I am compiling a list of deleted comments to submit later to discredit my opponents that hate Jesus our Saviour. My human rights are being abrogated by people that don't like my Teacher. To make matters worst, they endorse or excuse Islamic violence as legitimate when it is not even Islamic and accuse us of being mentally ill for fearing religiously inspired gratuitous violence by making up labels like, Islamophobia. I hate hatred, no matter how it is justified. Islamophobia is hatred targeting us.
>>Gruhcho, your last several comments didn't contain anything to respond to, leaving aside the insults. . Really? Lets start with a simple one (of the many you avoided):  Where are these open debates on Islam (as you indicated) have taken place in Canada? . >>The only time I used the word 'racist' I was quoting you. Funny, that. . Funny indeed.  How you whine about being insulted, while not being too subtle yourself.
That's a partisan site, try again. It's somebody's blog. Why am I lazy if I ask that you justify your claim with a reliable source? Why would you say that?  Here's from the "About" tab of your citation:  "About  This blog collect and update international statistics, government statistics, newspaper articles and reports related to Muslim immigration and Muslim issues in non-Muslim societies.  We are unable to respond to emails asking for references. The references to the statistical numbers are referred to in the actual articles as they were provided.  Articles/sources are republished from media, government departments, organizations and Universities."  Organizations...that's heartening.
And Homeland has been telling stories about nasty islamic terrorists for 6 seasons now.
Gruhcho, this article is about the 2015 increase in anti-muslim hate incidents reported to police.  Bigotry, intolerance, and hatred IS the topic.  There are lots of places you can have a debate about Islam. It happens on almost every article on terrorism.   I'm not a big fan of Islam myself, but I tend to stay away from those discussions online because of the displays of bigotry, intolerance and hatred (already mentioned) they attract.  You also wrote: "I did respond, and it is my true belief that someone like you, rarely having missed to mark down, before responding to, any 'dissenting post' , is simply an 'average person'."  I'd try replying to that, but I have no idea what it means.
I am very sorry that you and your son were the victims of an ignorant verbal assault. No one should be subjected to that, especially a child. I am interested that you both practice as psychologists and wonder how you reconcile your work as psychologists in Toronto with core values informed by Islam. How do you treat your gay clients? How about any Jewish or Christian clients? Muslims wishing to leave the faith? What about the slurs that come from Muslim children towards others in the playground, especially towards non-Muslim girls? More detail is needed about how your Muslim values are totally compatible with Canadian values and I would genuinely be interested in reading another piece about this.
I dont really think much of the trump travel ban beyond, that guys doing a good job. Muslims continiously prove they dont belong in this culture, why exactly are they here? and when can we get a similar ban for Canada?
Dolphin, The idea that someone would hide behind the name of a popular marine animal to spew their  anonymous hatred of another religion alarms me far more than anything Lane County's Muslims have ever done.  Doug
It's amazing, though not surprising how many of the comments try to dismiss this article as promoting the Muslim religion rather than what it is, an attack on lies and "post-truth".  The US election provably was won and lost partially on the fact that many people believed the deliberately created false news reports. Hillary running a pedophile ring out of a pizza joint is one small example.  Whatever side of the political spectrum you are on, it's your duty to seek out facts.  Only then can you see the real world.
The article doesn't say who did this. Be careful of jumping to conclusions. We don't know either if the gunman was killed or not. Many comments here imply that 'muslims' are responsible for these murders. If it was a muslim, & I think it probably was, it's one muslim & an extremist fanatic at that.  All muslims are not responsible, just as all Americans are not responsible for the almost daily mass shootings south of the border.
99% of Islamists are peaceful How about our own people like Timothy McVeigh? Shall we go after Survivalists? Or how about  Dylan Roof who killed 9 in Charleston. He later confessed that he committed the shooting in hopes of igniting a race war. Shall we lock up racists? The worst response is to make America hate again.
The west attacked Muslims by taking over parts of Palestine - and still doing it. The Muslims are simply retaliating.
There is logic in the statement, but it applies beyond Muslims.  Anyone who faithfully adheres to a belief system that imposes inconveniences and a denial (at least in part) of sense and reason must be choosing to do so because they think it is right in some illogical way.  If they think it is right, they will support/maintain it rather than letting it go for the good of all.  Even if they don't prosletize, they are setting a bad eample.
My parents owe me compensation, but getting it would cost more than I could ever collect.  My father started stealing my dish washing money when I was 11, and tried to order me to continue working, so he could contine, when I caught him stealing from my wallet in the middle of the night. He was a purported Christian, despite being a chronic thief and a liar.  That experience gives me some degree of sympathy for a child suffering as the prisoner of a Religious Zealot parent.  Religious Zealots, Islamic, Christian and other, often think that children are property and that they have a Supernatural Buddy granted Right to brainwash children they control.  https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/father-sues-ontario-school-board-for-not-accommodating-his-religious-beliefs/article4533186/  “My children are my own.

There were no prayers  Christian Jewish or Muslim n public school 20 years ago. That is a lie.   Soon we will be told the Constitution n is based on Islamic principles.
No, we have opened our eyes and see the world for what it is, competing self-interests. It's not fear to not want primitive cultures, fascist dominating religions like Islam here.  What we fear is people like this and politicians who puff up their chests smugly while the our society crumbles around them due to lack of focus, no patriotism. Every migrant is a competitor for a job, every new muslim is someone who wants to drag us back to the medieval ages, forcing everyone to act like they believe their violent creed. It's not fear, it's sensibility and you will not scare us with these tactics.  Our eyes are open, we see the world for what it is, not the fantasy you are pushing.
Freedom from Islam is necessary to achieve all the other freedoms.
Wrong, if natives want to pro create and have lots of children thats not our business. Natives at one time were decimated  by the Europeans and are making a comeback now. Old stock Canadians have zero birthrate and thats their choice. Many people complain about Muslims having lots of children its not your business or the states business. Same complaints are made against the black community in Toronto, it they desire 6 or 8 kids its not our business. This could be borderline racism against these people because of their birthrates. No one is stopping old stock Canadians from procreating. Its about a choice and we should respect all cultures choices.
You and terrorists have  fundamental misunderstanding of Islam and its teachings.  The vast majority of Muslims have solid, peaceful understandings. Under your logic, all Christians should be placed on  a registry due to the habits and threats of the KKK and the Alt -Right.
He works with poor kids and has pretty much since his exit from the NBA.  If he was a Christian instead of a Muslim the NBA would use him as an example of a model veteran making the most of  life after his pro career.  A lot of what he did as a pro, the national anthem garbage and it's garbage from both sides, is what Curry is doing now.
boy toy will give Trump what he wants and then ask George did I do good master or do u want more Muslims to come in to swing the vote
Why is she not charged with hate crimes too? Because she is Muslim  threatening white Christians. Move along folks nothing to see here.
Extremists?  Or Muslims?  SA still toting the Obama line.
Huh? I read the article twice after seeing your comment and could not see what you did. I thought this was a very positive article on Trump. It says Trump is redoing his policy on the Middle East and on Islam in a way that other Presidents have not-- by drawing a line between Islam and radical Islam (like Wahhabism and its offshoot terrorist action-- both Islam and Wahhabism got started in Saudi Arabia-- although Wahhabism has some early connection to a college student in the United States). This will be a landmark speech if done right. It may not be received well in the Islamic world, but it will be a new doctrine from the US.
Nope.  "Retracted" is just an obstinate and irrational insistence on holding Trump to a 2015 promise that Trump modified in 2016 into just a ban on Muslims only from and only from terror regions.   **** It is ludicrous for any Democrat to be so obstinate and irrational to insist on holding Trump to a 2015 promise he modified in 2016 as still being in effect. ---- Ludicrous because Trump promised to put Clinton to jail in Election 2016
Merkel should be tried for treason against Germany, Europe, and western civilization in general.   I am sure the future history books written by Islamic historians will regard her kindly, though.
Twice now Muslims have worked harder than just about anyone other than the Jewish victims themselves to repair the damage to graveyards.  I've taken to Facebook on each instance, both on my own page as well as in groups, to highlight this.  Speaking as someone with a number of Muslim friends and acquaintances, as well as someone who has traveled in Islamic countries, the actions by Muslims in solidarity with Jewish victims represents the true spirit of Islam that I have encountered.
You moderate Republicans need to be replaced ASAP. You give illegals more respect you support these Muslims that want to come into our country and literally want to kill us. People wake up, this extremism is moving fast and if we keep people like these yahoo's, our freedom will be gone. Yes you spineless snowflakes, it will be gone and never recovered. We are at a "Y" in the road. We better put new people in office. Let's not let the democrats and moderate republicans ruin Alaska. One of the last great states. Please, let's get together and replace these socialists.
I too oppose  Israel's settlement policies because they  complicate any possible peace agreement.   But demonstrations that call for the destruction of Israel only play into the hands of Israel's hard liners.    Ms. Khan has it right--  kindness is the best weapon against extremism. And just as we must extend those acts to the Muslim community, so too must the Muslims community extend those acts to the West,  including the Jews, by not denying the Holocaust, as is commonly done in the Middle East,  and which was largely the rationale  for the foundation of the State of Israel.  It is not kind to call for the destruction if the State of Israel.
Really? Is that why the right positively lost their minds when he was elected? Talking about being "divisive", his birth certificate, how he was secretly Muslim, etc?
Only 3%.   And yet look at how this issue, already, consumes us.  Dougie Saunders has made a career out of writing these finger wagging, tut-tut articles.  But when you dig into the real numbers, one stark fact stands out.  The only way that Muslims will not become a majority in Canada within this century, is if they start having smaller families. Much smaller.  You don't believe me?  Look around you. Ask your Muslim co-workers how many children they have.  I had a taxi ride from downtown Calgary this past holiday season. The taxi driver, bearing a Muslim name, said he had 7 children. Another on the way. OK, anecdotal.  Perhaps you do not mind the prospect of Canada being a Muslim majority nation within 80 or 90 years. Perhaps, like my European forebears, generation 2 will have fewer kids. But then of course, those immigrant forebears of mine were farmers and ranchers, not urbanites.  Perhaps this, perhaps that.  Just recline back in your LaZBoy and let the hockey game wash over you.
We have a longstanding tradition and practice in Canada. Public schools are non-denominational. No prayer. No religion. If a family wants their child to observe religion during school hours then they have the option of sending them to a private school where secular and religious instruction and observance are combined. That's what I did with my kids. Why should Muslims receive special treatment?
M-103 . The muslim brotherhood must be ecstatic.
The  US is not a failed state. Why are the countries of their birth failed states ? Primarily because of  the Islamic feudal  culture they bring with them and will do everything they can to enshrine here.  They are not coming here to supplement us, but to supplant us.
The Democrat party aided and abetted by it's MSM flunkies are perpetrating acts of SEDITION against the duly elected government of the USA... and there can be no doubt about that now.  All these "demonstrations" are intended to overthrow the Trump presidency, and it will soon be met with extreme prejudice.  The extremist terrorists are rallying their people and sucking in naive malcontents out into the streets.  The "demonstrators" are just a basket of deplorables who must be crushed and condemned.  Let the pus pour out and true and loyal American citizens will see and understand the traitorous intent of the leftist feminist liberal Democrats and their muslim allies.  The battle lines are now drawn and Trump will win like he won the election.... in spite of the MSM goebbelian propaganda efforts.
klastri I already made a comment about that a few months ago and yes it is true Pershing had 10 Islamic terrorist facing a firing squad he gutted a pig in front of them and had his men dip there bullets in pigs blood and they executed 9 of them he gave the 10th man a bullet dipped in pigs blood and told him to take this back to your leaders and show them this is what will happen to every terrorist we catch and kill,, for over 40 years no terrorist attacks by Islamic jihadist happened against the US until the bombing of the marine barracks in 1967 so yes General Pershing did do that why don't you go study the history on that and maybe you will learn something.
For all the billions it will drain out of the economy, it will not change the air, water or land.  It will only provide the Liberals more money to hand out to most  favoured peoples, like Natives and Muslims.  For every dollar the tax raises, the government will spend two.
This is a made-in-Islam failure that is being foisted upon the West. Remember, it was Islamic radicals who attacked on 9/11 and have relentlessly attacked since. They were funded and trained by Saudi Arabia. Most of the conflict these people are fleeing is being funded and caused by Gulf states (think Yemen etc.). The Gulf states should be paying for and housing these refugees, not Southern or Northern Europe or Canada.
If the Arabs didn’t want to be ‘occupied’ and ‘humiliated’, then they should not have attempted to annihilate the Jews, and they certainly shouldn’t have launched their genocidal forces from our ancient heartland. If you are concerned about world peace and human rights, the pressure should be on the fascists and kings surrounding Israel committed to endless war. 11 million Muslims have been killed since 1948. Less than one percent of those unfortunate souls have been killed in conflict with Israel.
Boots you are an example of a mental-illness liberal Democrat who don't care if civilian which includes children received nerve gas by their own leader.  Don't know about President Trump advising Obama not to get involved, is all liberal fake news.  There is more than a big difference between our President Trump and the coward Obama. Obama loves the Muslims than he does Americans. Whereas, President Donald Trump is pure American who cares for every American safety, keeping jobs that was headed overseas at home for American workers.  Boots you are showing too much hate for President Trump and I presume sour grapes because of your hero Hillary was defeated in the Presidential election.
I personally like it ... get to hear first hand from a guy who can’t bite his tongue .. It’s very entertaining and let’s face it most media new outlets today really are pretty bad and fake stories and half of them always write about fake white privilage and they tell you about the white guy who killed one person but won’t right about the Muslim or black guy who killed a few people . Their are really only 1 or 2 media news outlets that actually report news without bias or false narrative to fit theeir own agenda.. Not saying trump is honest just saying reading the news today in most case I might as well just watch Disney movies
What's the point? Other nations are no different than us when it comes to sticking their noses into the political systems of other countries in an attempt to stack the deck in their own favor. Obama kowtowed to Muslims throughout his presidency and embarrassed many Americans in his dealing with foreign leaders (bowing, apologizing to Japan, etc).  The Russian government possibly felt that a continuation of Obama's "policies" were a bigger threat to world security than Trump would be. Totally understandable.
“the same month two men inspired by the Islamic State killed two Canadian Forces soldiers.”  We are really following the US. In its official report on 9-11 there were several possible causes for 9-11 considered. One was not retaliation even though the US had been involved in attacking Muslims since at least 1947 in Palestine.   And now Canada, killing Muslims in Afghanistan since 2002, does not mention retaliation as a reason for the killing of Canadian soldiers. The attack on Parliament Hill was an even more obvious case of retaliation. Parliament Hill was where our troops were ordered to kill in Afghanistan. Clearly retaliation.  Instead the killing of Canadian soldiers “was inspired by the Islamic State.” How American that statement is.
The Globe and Mail has made it impossible for a Canadian to make a respectful statement about Muslims in this country. The subject is taboo, only the beginning i am afraid.
Sharia law has no place in my Canada.  Nor does slavery, FGM, murdering gays for being gay or demanding submission to Allah.  Honour killings are not the Canadian way, nor is attacking Synagogues.   There is little hatred for Muslims in Canada, but a growing hatred of radical Islam.  Those who come here and demand the rest of us comply with a hateful  Medieval doctrine are worthy of all the hatred and contempt we can muster for them.
So you're saying that only Muslim parents have concerns about morality in public schools? Correct me if I'm wrong, but your bigotry is showing.  Are there any parents that don't want their children to attend a school with moral standards?
Public history classes teach more about Islam than about any other religion.
The Germans who were discriminated against had been here for years- but at least they weren't put into camps like the Japanese were. Discrimination, I agree, is always fascinating. We lived in a Muslim country (Malaysia) for a time- and ran into a little-oddly from Chinese rather than Muslims. My extended family is Irish and German- they faced discrimination here in Canada at one time. I am against all sorts of  'phobias"!
The author is displaying a basic cognitive defect - categorization error:   Most predatory, violent people are men. However, most men are not violent predators.   A lot of people suffer from that error. You see the same thing when people conclude that since most violent terrorism today is carried about by Muslims, that most Muslims support violent terrorism. And yet I suspect the author of this piece - and the Globe and Mail editorial board in general - take a very different stance on those two category errors. Strange.
Mary:    The figure used isn't one I brought up, however I do believe that the majority of Muslims are peaceful, but if these forums prove anything, it is the fact that one need not go far to encounter intolerance from many directions. I myself do not subscribe to any form of organized religion, but I support and admire those of faith, until their faith or the focus of that faith intrudes on the rights of others, or that religion is used as a weapon to force others to comply or face a worse fate.   Unfortunately religion, faith, and tolerance for the beliefs of others, seem to always conflict, if history has taught us anything, Religion, under any banner one chooses, has been the single biggest factor in the loss of millions of lives.
[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed] said the terror attacks were good, but the “practical” way to defeat America was through immigration and by outbreeding non-Muslims. He said jihadi-minded brothers would immigrate into the United States, taking advantage of the welfare system to support themselves while they spread their jihadi message. They will wrap themselves in America’s rights and laws for protection, ratchet up acceptance of Sharia law, and then, only when they were strong enough, rise up and violently impose Sharia from within. He said the brothers would relentlessly continue their attacks and the American people eventually would become so tired, so frightened, and so weary of war that they would just want it to end. A Devout Muslims way of life is dam near the polar opposite of an Americans. Why would they want to come here?  For the reasons stated above.  Mind you these are the words of the mastermind of 9/11
It depends on why they say no, RooseveltLai.  It's similar in principle to saying a storeowner has the right not to sell to a customer, but not if they say no because he or she is black.  I'm not saying the vote actually was motivated by anti-muslim prejudice (although that was the mayor's assessment) but that's the principle on which any challenge would be based.
I disagree with the notion that hate speech should be free. The issue is that by allowing people to incite rage, intimidation and violence on others - often on entire groups of people that consist of very different individuals who shouldn't even be judged together - by allowing this, you opt for the "rights of the strong". Whoever has the loudest, most threatening voice, will effectively silence the other group because they're afraid to speak out, because they'll be intimidated, doxxed and assaulted by the haters inspired and legitimized by hate speech.  Now, the group that's intimidated can be on either side. The article makes a good argument that intimidation and actual violence (not "I feel unwell when you voice your idea" violence) is being used against well-meaning academia. Of course, the groups that stage these campus protests are often the groups who have previously experienced the same intimidation: Blacks, LGBTQs, Muslims, etc.  Free speech must be a balance in order to work.
I do get your meaning, however it's not entirely relevant to the discussion at hand. You're talking about hate speech and seem to be referencing it solely from it's legal definition in Canadian law. What the OP was talking about, and what I've been responding to, was comments being labelled as "hate" which, while not hate speech by it's legal definition, are hateful, bigoted, and prejudiced. I was simply suggesting that the more "over the top" of the posters here tone down their hyperbole and aggressive language and post more appropriately. In this way they stand less of a chance as being considered to be posting hateful comments.  For example, to say "Islam is incompatible with Canadian values" comes across as hateful and prejudiced - although it may not be strictly hate speech, it is irrational and uncivil and ignores that Muslims have been living peacefully in Canada for 150 years. More appropriate and rational is "violent Islamic fundamentalism is incompatible with Canadian values"
What do you mean "invite profiling"?  We already screen based on characteristics we deem important for successful integration, and while it has been largely successful, we now see how it can be improved.  We have, over the last century, improved on what was already, compared to Muslim societies,  a comparatively good society for women, by expanding those original freedoms. It was done through concerted efforts at education, including of women themselves, many of whom accepted the status quo, just as Muslim women reared to accept their status do so.  Now we are inviting to join us, huge numbers of people who not only have not gone through this educational process, but believe their religion disapproves of such freedoms for women.  Once there are enough of them, they will also change our society to match their beliefs, it is a simply a matter of demographics. And there will be plenty of social strife in the process.
Muslims are great .. Islam not so much.
To confirm the crime was committed on a 17 year old muslim girl by an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador.  The issue here is not immigration but illegal immigration.
I'm fine with law societies banning TWU grads because they attending a homophobic law school, but then I also hope the same law societies also ban any lawyer practicing Islam, Catholicism or other religion that preaches homophobia.
A fabrication?  You tell me: http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/wild-donald-trump-quotes/3/  The credit is Joel Page/Reuters.  It looks like the Reuters source was good enough for Neal Katyal, the Georgetown U. law professor who consulted on the Hawaii suit.  You might Google him.  He graduated from Yale law school, clerked for Supreme Court Justice Breyer, was Solicitor General under Obama for a while, and took over Chief Justice Roberts' practice when Roberts went to the Supreme Court.  @John Kawamoto has some good company here.    I didn't hear it myself, but I'm confident Trump really blustered about a "complete and total shutdown" of Muslim immigration.  That's a campaign promise the Constitution probably won't let him keep.  At any rate, the Hawaii suit probably won't be decided based on your requirement that  the phrase "all muslims" appear in the suit.  Perhaps we should wait and see what happens?
Trudeau ( and probably Omar Alghabra , his key advisor ) spends New Years with Aga Khan  on his island in the Caribbean. Aga Khan is one of the most powerful Muslims in the world and whose organization is a registered lobbyist in Ottawa But Trudeau says these lobbying events do not influence him..Then he declines an invitation to the inauguration of Donald Trump ( the most powerful man in the world ) Donald Trump who wants to rip up NAFTA. He says he wants to reconnect with Canadians. Trudeau is the most pathetic excuse for a Prime Minister I have ever seen and I am 70 years old.
The most virulent anti-Muslim hate comes from groups like Islamic State which are responsible for those massive suicide bombings of other Muslim groups that we read about almost every day.  Islamic State uses websites (it has its own on-line magazine) and it uses social media to spread its message.  Is motion M-103 designed to deal with this most virulent form of anti-Muslim hate?  If not, what does Canada have to deal with this?
A few weeks ago, I asked readers whether German Chancellor Angela Merkel was Islamophobic for wanting to ban the burqa and niqab in Germany. I asked if Theo Van Gogh was Islamophobic for making a film about the mistreatment of women in Islam. The answer, according to some (few) readers was, yes, the above are examples of Islamophobia.  So, is this article about child-marriage in Islam an example of Islamophobia?  If this article is Islamphobic then this article must be condemned, according to M-103, along with racism and bigotry against Muslims.
Islam is much more than a religion.  Islam is a comprehensive system - political, military, religious and dietary.  You cannot have Islam without sharia law.
Good point, the NCCM is the same group that provided input on the TDSB's guidebook that deemed any criticism of Islamic politics or culture as Islamaphobic. It's clear the Globe would rather placate groups who believe in (at a minimum) accommodation of political Islam so they publish this piece while ignoring any comments from Tarek Fatah or other reformers like Ayaan Hirsi Ali. The Globe has purposefully ignored any discussion of the social implications of societies government by religious rules, meaning political religion or Islamism. There are 57 members of the OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation) at the UN, out of 57 members, how many protect free expression (including satire and comedy), free press, gender equality, and LGBT rights? The Globe would prefer silence over critical analysis, #becauseit's2017
Then please describe the condition that motivated Alexander Bissonette to massacre 6 Muslims praying in a Quebec mosque and wound dozens more with semi-automatic weapons fire.   Or Anders Breivik in Norway.  Or Geert Wilders' call for 'cleansing' Europe of all Muslims (which got him elected as leader of the opposition in the Dutch Parliament).  Or Ann Coulter's call to bomb all Muslim countries, kill their leaders, and forcibly convert any survivors to Christianity.  Or President Donald Trump to call for shooting Muslims with bullets dipped in pigs' blood to ensure that their corpses were profaned.  Or Democrat presidential candidate, General Wesley Clark (retd) to call for internment camps for 'radicalized' Americans (aka Muslims), despite the Japanese and Italian American experiences from World War II.  The motivation that drives democratic, human rights observant people to attack 1.6 billion members of a religion as a dehumanized, permanent, generic threat has a name: Islamophobia.
I really don't understand why they are only asking  police to fight islamophobia.  Shouldn't the goal be to fight at kinds of hate.. ....against blacks, jews, LGBTQ2, etc.
Are you sure those being attacked are extremist Muslims, and not just ordinary Muslims?
As a former colonial subject (actually doubly colonial -- Indian origin, grew up in East Africa), I'm intrigued by this restaurant and will gladly visit it the next time I am in town. It's clear to me that Ms. Krantz wishes to celebrate the food and not the politics of colonial power. If one feels the strong need to protest this restaurant, such energy might be better directed towards solving local problems of exploitation and bigotry (African Americans, Muslims...) in our own backyard.  Honestly, I have more of an issue with "Tex-Mex" than I do with "Saffron Colonial." It's a sign of white privilege that hipsters have the leisure time to boycott/protest/sit on their bums and rant about this/"organize" for their small cause.
Why does Trump have no problem criticizing China, criticize an American war hero senator, criticize the muslim community, criticize women who accuse him of sexual assault, critcize a union leader, criticize the press, criticize the U.S. intelligance departments......but he will not criticize Putin......Does Putin have pictures on the Donald and the new Secretary of State?  The Donald can be plied with money and sex.  Same for the Secretary of State.  The Russians now have an Yuri in the White House!
Actually, the tax as applied to dinar is a little different, at least in context of authentic Shari'a zaka'at and khums (Shari'a) rulings.  In far too many modern, ostensibly "Muslim", body politics, the wheels of government are greased by open bribery and/or blackmail--lots of it.  Pakistan is particularly horrendous in this regard.  Kinda like here, only it's called "lobbying".  Now, do you have a point, or is this just 'tit-for-tat' bickering?  If so you're losing.
Boozer:  You might want to rethink this one.  Those who suggest repealing the Second Amendment are absolutely NO threat to our nation.  Their suggestion is extreme.  It is held by only a very small minority of individuals.....and, I think, the vast majority of us "damn liberals" even oppose it.  However, I think we're all extremely frustrated with our inability to somehow stop, or, quite frankly, even slow down, the ever-increasing incidents of mass shootings.  Donald Trump has suggest one way.....close the borders to all Muslims.  Mr. Quirk, with support from Eugene Stoner, has suggested another....repeal the Second Amendment.  Both are extreme measures.  That doesn't mean either one is treasonable....they're not.    Are those who propose such ideas more dangerous to America than is ISIS?  I'd enjoy reading your rationale for suggesting Mr. Quirk or "Eugene Stoner" represent such a threat.  Donald Trump?  I'm really not sure on that one........perhaps an easier case to make......
"Far more important is persuading all Canadians – including immigrant Canadians and Muslim Canadians both newly arrived and native born – that his party embraces them, shares their values and that he will not countenance voices of exclusion or resentment within his caucus or the conservative movement."  while the majority of that paragraph is benign, what exactly does Mr Ibbitson mean when stating that a Canadian political party must persuade others that it shares " the values" of any sub grouping of Canadians ? I would have thought that the proper role of a Canadian political party would be to communicate to all sub groupings of Canadians, both newly arrived and native born, that the values they may hold, in order to be fully accepted within the larger Canadian family, must be those in full alignment with the continuance and prosperity of a free and modern liberal democracy...after that, whoever you are or choose to be ...you can knock yourself out and value whatever you want.
One of the main  problems for me with judge Watson's decision is that rather than simply applying the facts of the ban-order, he relied on his interpretation of anti-=Muslim remarks Trump or his people made during the campaign. On THAT basis, he came to the conclusion that the ban is aimed at a religion rather than just people from 7 nations. That's a huge jump of conclusion!. Also, there's 1982 Alien Exclusion Act which seems to give an American president wide latitude in refusing visas and travel. Please read my MidWeek column this coming week.
Wrong. The Mongols killed way more. In the last century both Mao and Stalin killed way more by staving large segments of the population to death.  BTW the Muslim Ottoman Empire had hundreds of thousand of European Christians as slaves.  Don't know your history.
Arabs did give us the number system and elements of math but nothing recently. Arabs and Jews are related both same family semitic. Jews dont eat pork same goes for Muslims. Jews read from right to left (Hebrew) same as Arabs. Jews and Muslim allies for at least 500 years against Christians. Just in the last 90 years they had conflict.
And a ban on Muslims, you forgot that.
"religious encroachment" Come on, be realistic, sky. We're talking about some students using an empty classroom for 15 minutes. This has been happening without incident for 20 years and isn't unique to the Peel board nor to the public school system. These simple, reasonable solutions are in effect in other school boards and even in a Catholic school in St Catherine's. There is nothing here to be afraid of.  I've been using the example of Christmas and Easter to demonstrate that our Christian heritage is so ingrained into our culture that we don't even notice it anymore. But it's intellectually dishonest to ignore how our society evolved to accommodate Christian worship. Now we being asked to make a small, very small, effort to accommodate another religion, one that has been in Canada for almost as long as there has been a Canada. Did you know that the Muslim presence here goes back as far as 1871? These aren't strangers, these are our co-worker, our neighbours, and their children.
You don't know Islam then.
Look up the "No True Scotsman" fallacy. The fallacy is used all the time by conservatives. If a Muslim kills someone, why s/he must be a terrorist. If a Christian kills someone, why s/he must be crazy. Because no true Christian has ever shot anybody. The Crusaders weren't "real" Christians, for example, using their logic. Neither were the participants in the Spanish Inquisition. See: Planned Parenthood shooter, where the entire El Paso County law enforcement establishment, from the moment the shooter was apprehended, has been bound and determined to show the guy as crazy, despite the fact the shooter provides as arguments standard pro-life rhetoric. They have an economic and philosophical self-interest.
It's about time a politician is held accountable for their campaign statements.  Trump stated he wanted a Muslim ban, and no amount of revisionism should allow him to wiggle out of it.
No, you want to give any business owner anywhere the right to discriminate against gay people merely by saying serving such people violates their religious beliefs. The government can't question a person's religious beliefs, so the government would have to take that argument on face value. A pizza maker refused to provide a gay couple with pizzas for  their simple wedding reception. Does the laying out of pepperoni or olives constitute artistic expression? And, isn't it wonderful that sexual orientation isn't a religion, and therefore gay business owners can't discriminate against uptight Christians? Religion is NOT everything. Christians cannot discriminate against Muslims based on the Christian's belief that Islam violates their religious beliefs.
Jerusalem was an ancient Canaanite town, neither built nor named by Hebrews, but conquered, sacked and then abandoned by them. The “City of David” was not settled until the 10th century BCE. Throughout this time, Palestine has been populated by Palestinians of various cultic persuasions.  Jerusalem highlights the tragedy of the dysfunctional family of Abraham, Jews, Christians and Muslims. The two-state solution is organic. The one-state alternative promotes Jewish Zionism, exemplifies American imperialism and disregards the Palestinian presence. It is neither just nor logical.  The word palestinian means “a migratory person.” Israel means “he will be prince with God.”  Ishmael means “he who will hear God.” Palestine is not about a name nor a way of living. Palestine is about living  and journeying together, organically not alternatively.
Muslim Brotherhood will like it too.
littleyoboboy chin will not do nothing about it, the 15 that are missing some could be of Muslim religion, so Chin does not want to offend them he welcomes them.
Maybe you could try reading something other than fox, brethbart and the drudge report. Mr. Khan asked to speak at this convention. He wrote it himself. This wasn't about terrorism but if you actually listened to Mr. Khan he did call terrorism on ISIS. Real Muslims do NOT consider ISIS to be Muslim. You do know, ISIS kills more Muslims than anyone else, right? I doubt Mr and Mrs Khan's son would be disappointed  with their actions. I doubt he'd be a trump supporter in any way. Do you know that the US vetting policy takes over two years? Like I said you need to start reading more truthful sites.
While hurtful acts against Muslims may be on the increase the number still pales in comparison to acts against other groups especially anti-semitic acts against Jews. Maybe the rate of increase is higher for Muslims but the absolute number is significantly higher against Jews. For that reason M-103 is misguided. The Conservatives' approach of making for an inclusive gesture is better. It doesn't raise one group's concerns above any other group.
Funny how the Post becomes concerned about Christian persecution by Muslims when it fits their narrative . . .
The Republicans ran in opposition to just about everything Obama did in dividing the country. Repealing and replacing Obamacare fixes and helps Americans. Border security and enforcing immigration laws fixes and helps Americans. Fair and honest trade deals fixes and helps Americans. Better vetting of Muslims refugees fixes and helps Americans. Draining the swamp that is Washington DC fixes and helps Americans. Keeping the central government off the backs of small and medium size business owners fixes and helps Americans. Maintaining inexpensive and reliable energy sources fixes and helps Americans. The Democrats primary goal during the last eight years was fighting for what they called social justice. Well we created a large number of snowflakes who have no idea of how the real world works and men using the women's restroom. Hooray for Social Justice!!!
THIS COMMENT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DELETED, ITS MEETS ALL CIVIL REQUIREMENTS. I AM ENTITLED TO MY OPINION !!! === The bottom line is our public school system is secular and for good reason. Recently a Muslim mob of university students in India accused Mashal Khan Yusufzai of being an Islamophobe. and committing blasphemy. The 23-year old student was shot, beaten to a pulp and was about to be burned before police intervened, while the bloodthirsty crowd shouted “Allah O Akbar”.  http://thepashtuntimes.com/pakistan-journalism-student-mashal-yousafzai-killed-in-abdul-wali-khan-university-for-alleged-blasphemy/  M-103 and schools that encourage prayer can create breeding grounds that are hostile towards secular Muslims particularly if they are critical of Islam !!  Our values and culture must be adhered to so that all can share equally in a fare and just society.
The various states have sued the administration claiming substantial harm from the travel bans. The courts have found the states have standing to sue. Their evidence is compelling. The ban is discriminatory. As the District Judge found most recently, banning travel from Muslim nations that didn't send terrorists to the US while allowing travel from Muslim nations that did send terrorists is "illogical" and discriminatory. Furthermore, it makes no sense except as a baldly political sop to the president's electoral base, which is rabidly bigoted against persons of a specific religion. The ban is disruptive to normal commerce and serves no useful function.
Unity in diversity is the most important aspect of living in Canada for people who were not born here but who come from countries where death is a daily feature.  Having traveled more than 290,000 kilometers in the past twenty-five years, I see the vast array of humanity and marvel at how much Canadian cities like Toronto have become Marvell places of cultural and religious diversity.  This law should be enacted for a variety of reasons. There's no excuse.  The safety of Canadian Muslims and all Canadians in general is at stake.  Haters should not be allowed to unleash their terror on Muslims. Canada will be the big loser if this happens.  The world is indeed looking at Canada. We must not stoop.  We must not be cowards.  We must rise up and smash those who would  want to become fascists.  We must not emulate the United States. We are Canadians. We are different. Please do not trivialize my comment by using the words 'liberal' or 'lefty' to describe me.  You don't know me.
My default is to like and trust people.  Life has taught me to be weary, and watchful.  The rise of Islamic terrorist groups, like Isis and other.  Events like 911 and the never ending acts of terrorism and murder, make me skeptical.  There is little more to say except you cannot legislate trust, this is earned and tended to.  When the terrorist and acts of terrorism end, we can then reconcile.
"The Justice Department asked Watson to clarify that the order only applied to the ban on travel from six mostly Muslim countries and not a global freeze on refugees entering the United States."  His Honor Judge Watson is perfectly correct that there is nothing in his order related to this question that requires the slightest clarification.  To quote from his order:  "It is hereby ADJUDGED, ORDERED, and DECREED that:  Defendants ... are hereby enjoined from enforcing or implementing Sections 2 and 6 of the Executive Order across the Nation."  Section 6 is precisely the section that addresses the 120-day "global freeze on refugees".  Judge Watson specifically enjoins enforcement or implementation of Section 6.  Nothing could be clearer.  Trump may not like the judge's ruling, and perhaps the Justice Dept. believes it has a better chance of successfully appealing Section 6.  But the government's request for clarification is utterly without merit and Watson's rejection of it is proper.
Palestine and Arab League the Apartheid of non-Arabs,  the Apartheid of non-Muslims (like Christians, Jews, Bahai even) the Apartheid of infidels the Apartheid of women the Apartheid of atheists the Apartheid of people who don't dress modestly
(Part two of two)  Digging deeper, from the Jews, “The LORD” as distinct from current ruling politicians “comes, he comes to rule the earth.  He shall rule the world with justice and the peoples with his constancy” (Psalm 96:13).  There is more relevance in John 1:1-18.  “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word WAS God. . . . the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. . . .The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world” by means of the Faithful this day.  “ . . . full of grace and truth . . . grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.”  Very little ambiguous about that.  Black Catholics, with more than the usual mainstream Muslim relatives and friends, especially have plenty special offerings for the whole world today.  More: We have to stop thinking of the Church in terms of priests and nuns.—Monicadeangelis  and start thinking with the Church in terms of the Liturgy of the Word.
Congratulations to the Turkish people ...as now they gave Erdogan new powers and made him a SULTAN!!! ( another word for Dictator )  HOWEVER certain things will happen :  1- More violence and arrest in Turkey.  2- You can kiss goodbye... to Democracy and human rights.  3- You can forget... of joining the EU.  4- Less foreign investments and less prosperity.  5- More Turks leaving Turkey as immigrants.  6- Muslim radicals/ extremists will now be in charge of Turkey.  7- Unless the West gives Turkey and Erdogan billions of dollars in ransom... he will unload hundred of thousand of Syrian refugees.   8- He will continue to threaten his neighbours ,like Greece and Cyprus.  9- Less Tourists from the West.  10- Possibly a civil war.  11- Christians and Christian Churches are in danger ...as many times Erdogan wanted to close  the Phanar Greek Orthodox College and transform the Church of Agia Sophia into a Mosque.  CONCLUSION: People always elected the politicians they deserve!
It's interesting that you are doing everything you can to make this not about hate speech, when the police say the assailant was using hate speech or biased language, directed against two Muslim women. That denial of the obvious as reported by police at the scene as well as a named eyewitness, must be motivated on your part. I think your denial is motivated by refusal to acknowledge the amount of violent hate speech and bigotry in our nation since the Trump campaign made that politically incorrect bigotry OK for everyone to express.
Wow, just love how you managed to integrate the "Muslim" angle into an article purely about a hockey team. Keep up the good SJW work.......BARF
So agree about 'community'! It's dumb and insulting. Here in the UK you often hear references to 'the Somalian community' or 'the Muslim community', like 'they' are all the same and all know each other. I guess I belong to the 'Australian community' :).
The Sikhs are against forcible conversions...in contrast to Muslims who were ( are) commanded to fight unbelievers until they are either dead or converted...the Sikhs protected Hindus from forcible conversion to Islam...it would be a nice change to have leadership in Ottawa that had that ' protective' attitude in their subconscious.
Change that cartoon to ISIS watching Fox "news" and complaining that there aren't any stories about trump, Comey, Sessions or Russia.  ISIS loves Trump because he makes their point that the west hates Islam.
Does anyone remember the controversy surrounding the Black cemetery in Priceville, Ontario?  The National Film Board of Canada made a documentary on titled "Speakers for the Dead".   "It was as if the town were trying to erase the existence of the black pioneers who settled this area in the early 1800s".  http://www.mattoid.ca/data/antiRacism/Ontario_town_buries_legacy_of_black_settlers.htm  In the case of the Muslims in Quebec it's as if some would like to go one step further and ensure that Muslims aren't even buried in Quebec.
The G&M is censoring anything questioning of Islam.  Why have a comments section when only the comments that G&M deems acceptable are kept?  How can dialog be freely expressed?  Censorship is the way of mainstream media, in addition to fake news.  I hope most of you realize that all mainstream forms present a narrative that is not real in terms of daily events.
you are correct Bob, and that group in the US is Christians.  Look at all the gun deaths and then tell me how many were Muslim and how many were Christian.
Alceste : Can you really tell me that there are Imams that publicly state that homosexuals, women, and Atheists are equal to Muslim men?
So a Muslim can't be an American in your book?
Interesting, commenter.  In response to the recent Islamic terrorist attack in London, you seemed unconcerned about that violence and more concerned about cancer and heart attacks.  You should have nothing to be concerned about when it comes to civil war.  Another Commenter for Hire 20 hours ago Just for some perspective, here are recent average daily fatality numbers for the US: heart disease: 1,671 cancer: 1,632 overdose: 150 automobile: 96 firearm: 90 pedestrian: 16 workplace: 13 drowning: 11 bee stings 0.27 terrorist attack: 0.15 ***** Trump's budget reduces funding for cancer research.
Right Jonah, we all of us (including Jonah) know that Trump's ban was a Muslim ban, but let's pretend it wasn't. But why pretend? Trump campaigned all over the nation as a "populist" pandering to anti-Muslim bigotry. Of course, he also pandered to anti-Mexican bigotry, but again, let's pretend that it was only "anti-rapist/murderer" bigotry, though it was directed against only one border that happens to be shared with Mexico. I don't imagine Trump himself has any more bigotry than the average white billionaire; but I bet it irks Trump that Mexican telephone magnate Carlos Slim has ten times as much money as Trump (assuming that Trump actually has a billion, and that Trump knows who Carlos Slim is).  To earn his keep at the American Enterprise Clubhouse, Goldberg threw in some Fake News about Obama and classified material, though "(t)he exact details have yet to be revealed." Also, Goldberg claims political motives behind the anti-ban rulings of several federal courts. Not a good column
Whatever people believe about one God, a Trinity, or multiple Gods, etc., how they organise themselves to worship those, or live their personal lives, etc., should be their business, because it does not impact society at large.   What matters is the impact on others, and "our society" has told the Catholics and BACs in no uncertain terms to stuff their beliefs about abortion and gays , no one worried about "alienating" them, no one fell all over themselves being "respectful".  But we fall all over ourselves being "respectful" of conservative Muslim beliefs .  At least be consistent.
Every intelligent, fact-based, reason-based argument that is posted by me at the Globe gets censored out as being 'uncivil'. I am now allowed two comments per 24 period, which will no doubt also get deleted. I know plenty about islam. For the past 10 years I have been following little else. An  'islamophobe' is an infidel who understands the truth about islam.  I should know, I am one.
Because of Muslim Islamic terrorism  yo can't carry shampoos and  grooming care liquids on the plain, you have to take your shoes, belts and watches off for x-ray,  you have to get a pat down at the airport security check points, and go through convoluted identification processes. .  But for Islamic terrorism, air travel would be an easy operation.
I am not politically correct.  However, what Kathy did was totally off base, shameful and dangerous. There have been good citizens of her country who have been captured in the middle east and threatened with beheading in return for ransom money.  People who were doing nothing more than working for civilian causes in providing aid or contractors who were trying to safeguard infrastructures.   What about these families who know there are videos out there with their loved ones being beheaded.  I am sure ISIS is taking great commercial advantage in posting what Kathy has done. She does not get it NOT AT ALL and its a sad state of the people living amongst us  who defend her  actions in the political-islamic  terrorism the world  is facing. Can't expect much from her lawyer either (Gloria Alred's daughter).
Translation: my unsupported characterization of those who disagree me does not bear answering.  I certainly cannot see any other interpretation of "it makes it difficult to raise children who are morally straight", when Muslim parents have to explain to six year olds why two men are holding hands and kissing on the beach.  What I like I like, and all else is a phobia.
You are clear then that no African American group or association or gang has conspired and acted violently and or illegally? You are clear then that no "white" group, association, gang, or even militia has conspired, acted, or would intend to act violently?  Your inference about Muslims is more hypothetical than any of the examples I cited.  I thought that maybe your choice of language was just an innocent mis-speak.  One has to be realistic but also honest and bigofree.
"Since 2001, the number of violent attacks on U.S. soil inspired by far-right ideology has spiked to an average of more than 300 a year, according to a study by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point.  A 2015 survey of U.S. law enforcement groups found they consider anti-government violent extremists to be a more severe threat than radicalized Muslims. And while jihadist terrorists have killed 95 people in the U.S. since 9/11, far-right extremists have killed 68 during the same time, including the car attack in Charlottesville." - PBS, 13 August 2017  http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/u-s-sees-300-violent-attacks-inspired-far-right-every-year/
The Taliban is the same terrorist organization that entered a peaceful community opposed to their governance and hanged the 8 year old son of the village leader. This happened about seven years ago and was reported by this e-paper. Murdering a young female child of a prisoner would fall within the base behaviour of the Taliban.  They also bomb men, women, and children indiscriminately. I would going about arranging a fatweh type decree against the perpetrators of this unspeakable crime, were I a Muslin father.  This murdered child was Canadian/American as well.
We need to talk about Islamic fanaticism.    We need to talk about, for example, Canadians going to fight for ISIS.    http://www.torontosun.com/2017/06/19/quebec-man-guilty-of-trying-to-leave-canada-to-join-isis  And most Canadians going for terrorist-training abroad are breaking the law with impunity - that is, returning without being charged for their crimes.  http://www.torontosun.com/2016/03/07/canadian-radicals-known-but-not-being-charged  If a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian, its time to prosecute these Canadians  for their treasonous activities.
It's ironic that Muslim author chose to write about "post truth", when the Koran permits lying to non-Muslims to further the cause of Islam.  Taqqiya is the practice of denying one's religion, permissible especially by Sunnites: regarded as a means of protecting oneself from persecution. The Qur’an in a variety of verses (2:225, 3:28, 3:54, 9:3, 16:106, 40:28, and 66:2) establishes the religious legitimacy of breaking oaths, lying, unilaterally violating treaties, and generally scheming against non-Muslims  Kitman is the practice of lying by omission.
http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/23/sweden-opened-its-doors-to-muslim-immigration-today-its-the-rape-capital-of-the-west-japan-didnt/  You're suggesting I read the Globe and Mail to learn something? That's pretty funny, since they don't actually print news, but globalist propaganda, social programming, and daily tips on what you should be offended by, for dim hive-mind types.   Also note: professional wrestling is fake as well.
@Ruben Reyes, no insult intended.  Please read what I wrote in the context of @LesterP's comment.  I don't see the discussion as a contest, with you as an opponent.  I'm just curious how you think about this issue.  The Hawaii suit has a chronology of Trump's statements on the Muslim ban on pages 7 through 11.  Several of the quotes are responses to questions about how Trump's position on the Muslim ban might have changed.  Apparently, he never disavows the idea.    Here is a recent example: "Then, on December 21, 2016, following terror attacks in Berlin, Mr. Trump was asked whether he had decided `to rethink or re-evaluate [his] plans to create a Muslim registry or ban Muslim immigration to the United States.' Mr. Trump replied: `You know my plans. All along, I’ve been proven to be right.'"  This suggests to me that the "pivot" is rhetorical and that the goal is still a Muslim ban.  According to the suit, the original call for a Muslim ban "remains accessible on www.donaldjtrump.com".
Which makes this the most exciting Presidential contest in many years. The very poor and powerless actually have a champion, well, the Republican tribe do. While he is a born rich billionaire who had everything handed to him, he does use the truth to get ahead, something this article does well pointing out. The W. Bush war is a war that qualifies as a war crime, and the fact that the Republican Party delighted in laws that hastened the movement of American manufacturing to Asia and Mexico is obvious and the factor that is the most at fault for the plight of those voting for Trump. The Republican Party is led by an elitist super rich cartel.   I actually can see a path to the office for Trump, but it would take riots in the Southwest, ala Nixon standing on the hood of a car getting protesters to riot, it would take a major assault on American territory by Islamic terrorists, ala 911, and it would take a major downturn in the economy. But it could happen. Hugh Massengill, Eugene
And here we go again...the problem is he's white, or he's male, or it's an assault weapon, or he's a Democrat, or he's a Repub, or he's an atheist, or he's a Christian, or he's a Muslim...blah blah blah blah...  No, the problem is he's an American.  Americans don't have respect for others' lives.  If they don't get what they want, or if they have to sacrifice something for others, or if they're scared, they justify killing other people.    We never turn the other cheek, or treat someone how we want to be treated, or sacrifice and offer kindness to receive the same.  We're simply a violent culture that takes what it wants, and we never take responsibility when we're hurting someone else.  It's always "their" fault.
Except that Islam is not a race
I am sure the majority of Canadian citizens agree with Québec on this issue.  Quebec ban of full-face covering is not an anti-Muslim or anti freedom of religion policy.  As far as I a concerned, the federal government should adopt a similar ban of full face covering in all public places.
These questions also align with Justin's personal beliefs as a devout Catholic.    Additionally, to have a candidate that represents the beliefs of other religious groups such Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists allows a choice and democracy to flourish.
" their treatment of the Falun Gong, and the oppression of Muslim Uyghurs in the western provinces, and of course the Buddhist in Tibet. Name a country that has NOT oppressed its minority populations."  It is misleading to lump all events into one as if they were all deserving of equal condemnation. Let's put it another way. How many political prisoners has Canada arrested and then tortured, killed and used as organ banks? How many countries have we annexed? How many islands have we built in order to claim jurisdiction expanded territories?  Canada has flaws. But they are not even in the same neighbourhood as China. Heck not even the same solar system.
Tell that to the CBP agents who stopped US CITIZENS returning to the country and asked questions about their last (Muslim) names and their religious views, like Mohammed Ali's son, Mohammed, Jr. The CBP agents even demanded to see the IDs of passengers disembarking from a domestic flight which is outside their purview.  http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2017/02/23/immigration-checking-ids-on-domestic-flight/  This is just the beginning of Trump carrying out Bannon's white supremacist agendas that target anyone remotely associated with Muslim countries, even if they haven't been to their countries of origin for decades.
The courts are just wasting their time and our money.  Trump's travel ban is not a ban on Muslims (i.e. religion).  In either case, how are U.S. immigration people going to know a traveler's religion?  There are only a very few countries (like Egypt and Pakistan) which show religion on their passports.
G & M gets more readership by being provocative. I lived near a native reservation for years, and found they had much worse problems that need a lot more media and government attention. But it doesn't sell as much as some article that is anti-immigration, or anti-Indian, or anti-Muslims, etc.
So what do we call a rational fear of Islam? We're all aware of what atrocities have been carried out in the name of Islam. Main Stream Media has bathed us in it. We're just supposed to ignore our own feelings or be found guilty of a crime? Our society is quickly becoming unhinged.
Did I not quote the unscripted PM Gomer from the 2013 Mansbridge transcipts in the context of the Boston Marathon bombings?  Further, on those poor misunderstood Boston Marathon terrorists: "During questioning, Dzhokhar alleged that he and his brother were motivated by extremist Islamist beliefs."  So yes, there is at least one Canadian fool who sees "terrorists, of the Islamic or far right variety (extremists of any kind), as poor and misunderstood." So Thomas, are you also part of that group of fools?
The Pope believes that the only route to salvation is the acceptance of Jesus as the Lord. He believes that the only way that all of those suffering Syrian Muslims will find salvation is though the adoption of Xtianity.  He  Pope believes that helping them to survive leaves the door open for them to convert and avoid going to hell..  Muslims believe that Jesus existed but did not die on the cross. They believe that the resurrection, the core of Xtianity, is a lie. They believe that unless one adopts Muhammad as the Profit and follows the dictates if Islam that you are going to hell.  Xtians and Muslims, through their personal avoidance of hell, have brought hell to earth.  Merry Christmas.
Sher-e-Hindustan: Without meaning to seem rude here, you seem to be demonstrating that you have absolutely no valid argument. Lebanese Canadians who return to Lebanon simply aren't immigrants in Lebanon when they return to their homeland. Neither are Chinese or Indians migrants who work elsewhere and then return home immigrants in their homelands. As far as I'm aware, most Middle Eastern countries are tribal and don't broadly accept immigrants. Many foreign migrants are permitted to live and work in some Middle Eastern countries, although for the most part can't easily, if at all, become citizens. How many Christian westerners become citizens in Saudi Arabia every year? I believe the UAE, seen as one of the most progressive Muslim Middle Eastern countries, permits non-Arabs who have lived in the country for something like 30 years and can demonstrate proficiency in Arabic to apply for citizenship.
The Kent event is not listed on the Eat With Muslims website, but I'm guessing future dinners will be posted somewhere on here: http://stjameskent.org/calendar/eat-with-muslims-2/
When a Canadian permanent resident is reviewed for citizenship the rules are well-known. Citizenship is granted on qualifications, not a word is mentioned on religious belief. When a baby is born in Canada he/she is citizen, regardless of religion, if any, down the road.   In the U.S. it has a Constitution where God is fundamental. In God We Trust. God Bless America. There is only one God possible - the Christian God. Every U.S. citizen must pledge allegiance to the Constitution, and therefore the God of America, the God of Christian Faith.   Even Muslim faith president Obama must disavowed and pledge allegiance to the Christian God. Or he will be overthrown. Obama was obliged to continue with war in the Middle East policy.   The people of the world should understand why the U.S. initiated its Pivot to Middle East after the fall of the USSR. The Pivot is to hide its holy war on the Muslim world. The agenda is to suppress the people, to plunder their wealth. It is quite successful.
A nice story, reminiscent of an ideal past - many appreciate the past more than the present because we survived the past.     Speaking as a small plane pilot for 48 years, this situation is not like our current political status. The temporary fix of the engine - maybe good enough to fly it above mean high tide line -  just ain't enough if the its a maximum spring tide, driven by a strong onshore wind. The risk is that the fix is insufficient, or just enough to be caught by the full tide.    Clinton as POTUS means several new life time SCOTUS appointments, along with ongoing Obamacare, an ineffective border, embracing muslims (read the koran, look at European countries who are being fatally abused by increasing muslims, sharia law,etc).    Looks like Trump cannot control his impulsive, immature, nastiness. We can hope that Congress will temper this man, some of whose ideas do put America First. A vote for anyone else is wasted. Grit our teeth & vote for Trump.
The real problem is not corrupt politicians, because everyone expects that from the likes of Trudeau and certainly the former PM who will remain unnamed or acknowledged. The real problem is liars blaming the 'middle class' needs for why you are selling out to Communist China corrupt billionaires. Who in their right mind would want their leader to be labelled a 'little potato' ,Muslim sellout,and all around selfie ignoramus on the world stage while seldom addressing any real local Canadian needs. A lot of us regret voting for this clown and he certainly has none of the intellectual 'wattage' or common sense his father had. But keep waving Fidel's banner,and Mao's little red book to your shiny pony entourage because everyone else sees you for what you are!
It seems like a black eye for someone of the stature of Suu Kyi. I wonder how free she is to form her own policies, but she doesn't seem too sympathetic to the Muslim minority.
Obama's action was extreme vetting and Trump did not tie it to religion (Muslims were not mentioned) but countries, the MSM/Leftys shoved in the religion. Trump listed the same list of countries that Obama listed. Please stop lying.
Where was the outrage and protests when Obama banned immigration from several Muslim countries (on more than one occasion)?
I'll add to this with a rhetorical question -- will we see Québec Muslims moving to France to seek greater security after the recent mosque attack?   We need security and opportunity for all human beings, and to fight extremism in all its forms. I find it odd that people on here are up in arms about what is going on in France, and do not seem to ponder what Muslims in Québec went through two months ago. Peace is our collective responsibility.
"Global conspiracy!" Something much worse than "The vast right wing conspiracy". I see the Trump supporters are caught in the same web of denial as Clinton supporters were in the 90's and for the most part still are. "Couldn't have happened', "it was all consensual' "politically motivated" etc etc. Its funny though how many people go through long public careers with few if any such accusations  and for others it just one damn thing after another. The other funny thing is after a year of ranting and raving about Mexicans, Muslims, deportation squads, building a wall Mexico will pay for, insulting POWs, a Gold Star family, threating to renege on the national debt, undermining NATO, using executive power to punish individuals and businesses, exploding the debt with huge tax cuts- THIS is what finally sinks him for good.
Calls for "extreme vetting", like calls for "Canadian values",  are meant to exclude Islamists, not ordinary Muslims, so Steve Jobs' father would not have been affected.
That would be controversial.  The media mustn't offend.  Muslims would not be amused.
Doubt you have as someone with family in 'em.  Would presuppose being tolerated by others enough to have a family.  As for being 'radical', all my record has are a few traffic tickets, so I'm not much good as an 'extremist'.  I can live with that.  Inshaa Allah  someone like you from one of those '98% American counties' won't try to come after me or my family because they think 'winning' an election constitutes 'permission to form lynch-mobs'.  You overlook that Iraqi Muslims are standing up and condemning the Da'esh (wrongly called "ISIS") for murdering Christians and in turn being killed by Da'esh for doing so.  And that, like the Taliban and al-Qa'eda before them, they were armed and financed by the US.  Einstein's definition of insanity comes to mind.  You parrot propaganda and attribute it to 'worldly experience'.  I suppose watching TV is a form of 'experience'.  But on this we agree: "Lakum diinukum wa liyya Diin--To you your way, and to me, my way." (Qur'an, Suratul Khafirun).
Image if the Jews ran Yemen, Lebanon and Egypt; people would go there for vacation or to retire like Miami, : good food,  4 star hotels, nice beaches, and malls with lots of wholesale shopping. There would even be a golf course or two. (Watch out for the sand trap. it's a doozie heh heh) But for Islam, that is not to be.
Justine 's crack down on the conservative right is appalling. What bringing in 30000 hate filled Muslims to vote Liberal isn't enough?
"homegrown terrorist" is Obamaspeak......... blaming this mass killing by a Muslim on America.
btlspock: I once worked alongside a highly educated Muslim Iranian woman when doing volunteer work a couple decades ago. She left Iran in the aftermath of the 1979 Revolution and was utterly disdainful of Islamism and vowed that she'd never wear the hijab, a garment that she said utterly horrified her. I think a lot of this has to do with class and education and that wealthier and more educated Muslims may well be more likely to be objective about their own religion as well as religion in general.
Why nobody thought to invite a few Yazidi women to tell the honorable MP about hundreds thousands of victims raped and enslaved by the Jihadi political organization called ISIS. What about the women in Darfur. What about the young girls in Afghanistan murdered because they dared to go to school? About the girls from Shafia family murdered in Canada by their family (honor killing).  What it’s like to be a 21-year-old Muslim woman growing in Pakistan/Afghanistan/Iraq/Syria/India/Iran/Yemen/S Arabia?  Srosh is not expected to apologize for the actions of a small(?) group of people that do not represent her.  And we are not expected to apologize for the actions of a small group of people that harassed her.  We also are not expected to pretend that the Jihadi supporters in Canada are small group   We also are not expected to stop fighting for gender equality of women in the Muslim world even if bill M-103 wants us to.
London's mayor (Muslim or otherwise) should be a tad more angry at the recent events. Methinks he deserves Trumps commentary.
Ever heard of Timothy McVeigh? He must have been muslim?   Since Sept. 11, 2001, nearly twice as many people have been killed by white supremacists, antigovernment fanatics and other non-Muslim extremists than by radical Muslims: 48 have been killed by extremists who are not Muslim, compared with 26 by self-proclaimed jihadists  Don't recall hearing if Dylan Roof was muslim?  You remember the ruthless slaying of nine African-Americans in a Charleston church with an avowed white supremacist charged with their murders,
I concur with others that this is a good article. But so what - those of us who understand and respect the words and the writer are the kind who would, are we not? Preaching to the choir comes to mind - and I do NOT say that to diminish Henein.  But if anything shows that to MANY people facts don't matter -it's Trump in the Whitehouse and Spicer and Conway shamelessly spinning.  How to reach the people honestly scared and who think everyone's out to hoodwink them and that the  falsehoods they hold are in fact, truth?  I understand FOX news is still running with the story that the Quebec mosque shooting was perpetrated by a Moroccan Muslim.
No Fuad, they are just traditional holdovers from the past we do not celebrate these religious holidays - only a few crazies believe the christian myths. The media is over-respresented in believers versus rest of population in the majority. You misunderstand, they are not accommodations to some non-existent god for us, they are just DAYS OFF from slavery or school. that's it.  We do not believe in any abrahamic ruler over us because those things are just lies by the powerful over others. You must become secular become good neighbors keep your crazy beliefs to yourself or at least OUT OF SCHOOL! We demand that as secularists in order to not go to war as e have for centuries over these things. Keep it away from school muslim, christian jewish zoroastrian whatever so we can have peace. Your position Fuad is simply warfare against the rest of us. You must submit to secularism in this country. We all do or we face war internally and eternally.
Having as many children as Allah (Peace be upon him) allows is paramount in Islam. It augments the size of ummah (community) which is a source of pride and strength,  It is admirable you offer to sponsors girls but you will need to educate them that a large ummah causing poverty and hunger is evil thought.
Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders ought to push for a similar probe.     Mayor John Tory would certainly support the Chief's leadership in forming a special task force to address this virulent problem in the city.  Certain white supremacist groups (both white and black racists) are ramping up hate crimes especially towards Muslims, setting them up for allegations of jihadist radicalization and violent activities.  It has nothing to do with Trump's presidency, which is being used by them as a convenient cover for their own racist activism that have been gaining momentum.
We welcome muslims to our country. But instead of getting a heart-felt thank, we get a non-stop stream of demands. We want this, we want that, and now we want Friday prayers. Yes, we like to accommodate your demands. But every demand you have made would cost taxpayers' money.
So, the take away message is that the far right, the far left and the muslims of France almost equally dislike jews.
When it comes to matters of sexual freedom, reproductive rights and gender equality, religion needs to be kept well clear of the law making process. I have no problem with religions practicing their rights within a specific framework, ie: if a particular church refuses to marry a same sex couple because it goes against their teachings, that's OK, as long as the couple CAN get married in court and enjoy the same LEGAL benefits as any other married couple; if a christian woman falls pregnant and chooses not to have an abortion, because she is pro-life, fine. However, you cannot deny others the right to make such a choice due to your beliefs (are you listening, ACDP?) and if a muslim woman chooses to wear a burka and not go out in public unaccompanied by a male relative, great. But she should be able to do the opposite too, without falling foul of the law. Of course, secular laws should also not be used to discriminate against religions, as France has done with its hijab and burka bans.
A few more tips on Islamic Sharia Law & how it is happily practiced globally.. http://www.billionbibles.org/sharia/sharia-law.html  (c)According to Sharia law: • Theft is punishable by amputation of the right hand (above) • Criticizing or denying any part of the Quran is punishable by death. • Criticizing Muhammad or denying that he is a prophet is punishable by death. • Criticizing or denying Allah is punishable by death (Allah moon god) • A Muslim who becomes a non-Muslim is punishable by death (compulsion in religion) • A non-Muslim who leads a Muslim away from Islam is punishable by death. • A non-Muslim man who marries a Muslim woman is punishable by death. • A man can marry an infant girl and consummate the marriage when she is 9 years old • Girls' clitoris should be cut (Muhammad's words, Book 41, Kitab Al-Adab, Hadith 5251 • A woman can have 1 husband, who can have up to 4 wives; Muhammad can have more. • A man can beat his wife for insubordination.  This is Sharia Law, friend.
No religion has been shown to be a religion of peace and love, because religions aren't capable of being peaceful or loving. They're just religions.  There are many peaceful and loving religious adherents--Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, and more--because people can be peaceful and loving. They can also be hateful and violent.
Doesn't Don the Con, realize that Pakistan is Muslim?
Face covering is a custom and not a religious one. Many good Muslims who do not follow it can attest to that. Many other customs acceptable in other countries are not allowed here. Having multiple spouses is the obvious one which comes to mind.
It has been in the news all day that the transcripts were redacted as directed by Loretta Lynch.  ISIS, Muslim, and Islam were removed from the transcripts.  .  Where is that in this story?
They can barley teach English and Math anymore. Secular should mean secular period. Our values should be made clear so we don't find ourselves in these situation. People need to stop being to politically correct and clearly state the expectations when moving to Canada, the pandering must end !!!  My greatest fear is we are going to find ourselves fighting off SHARI, it has become prevalent in Muslim held community's in Europe and has NO place in secular Canada.
it 's a sad ending for a Hindu Liberal loyalist. She should been anointed by the PM if she 's converted to Muslim. Hindu Canadians should remember this when they cast their votes on April 3rd & Ontario provincial election in 2018 and federal election in 2019.
LOL, for once I'm in agreement with the Muslim world.
The Muslim community actively engages with school board officials to find ways to accommodate them.  What I don't understand is why they are criticized for that.  If other religious communities want accommodation then they should do the same.  I would assume if a school board accommodates one religious community and not others who ask for similar treatment there would be grounds for legal action.
@diverdave, the election is water under the bridge.  I wish the Trump folks would get over it.  My interest in the "Russian Connection" is about what the future holds.  But, hey, this thread is about the Muslim ban and A.G. Chin's good efforts to protect the Constitution.
Don't mention the prayer book the Muslim students will be praying from or what it contains.  Your comment will be blackballed.  For how long will the politically correct go on trying to ignore the Prophet's exhortations regarding infidels that are contained in that prayer book (the Quran)?  It's there.  Ignoring it won't make it go away.
there is a difference between anti-Muslim hate and concern regarding the cultural spread of Islamic thought.  There are large numbers of Catholic and Jewish cemeteries in Canada. Denying a Muslim the simple comfort of the burial custom of their religious affiliation, seems simply motivated by animus.  Being wary regarding the spread of Islam however is not so simply characterized. The Islamic world had achieved cultural and technological competitiveness with the west by the 13th century, yet since, having never undergone a Renaissance or Enlightenment, it has never been forced to confront its theocratic assumptions as Christianity was forced to do under the West's expansion and gradual tolerance of  pure science, philosophy, political theory technological innovation, and secularization... where are the Islamic world's da Vinci, Galileo, Kant, Voltaire, Smith, Marx, Watt or even Coco Chanel, its Oxfords, or MITs, or its simple recognition of the separation of church and state ?
I'm with the "No" side on this one.  The people living adjacent to the proposed cemetery site don't want a cemetery there.  They don't want a Catholic cemetery there, they don't want a Jewish cemetery there, they don't want a Chinese cemetery there, and they don''t want a Muslim cemetery there.   What's so hard to understand about that?    They are talking now about a Human Rights challenge?  Hey - its not a 'human right' to have a burial site any old place you feel like it.  It always seems to be the same with a certain community - they have to impose their will on others.    Quebec is a huge province with a vast land area.  Find someplace for your cemetery that complies with local zoning bylaws and has the support of surrounding land owners.
What you've done here is essentially cede any semblance of argument to me, simply by way of refusing to use the intellectual tools necessary to form a legitimate rebuttal.  By resorting to logical fallacy (attempting to impugn my character and appealing to the masses of xenophobes who, for some outlandish reason, think that 'Muslims are bad'), you have admitted that you cannot make a real counterpoint.  While this may be "civil" in that you are not making an attack in an outright manner, it lacks the basic linguistic insight needed in order to make for any meaningful dialog.  What's more, you post such a pseudo-reply with an avatar that is of a fringe cult icon (the so-called "Bob" Dobbs)!  Frankly, I'd trust anyone who believes in The Most High God over cultists any day, but that's my constitutionally protected freedom of religion at work.  You can make accusations as you wish, but until you abandon the vitriol with which you have littered these comments, there will only be discord.
Discussions about Islam and Islamophobia go on all the time. I'd care to venture it is the most discussed topic on the internet today. In fact, whenever a terror attack takes place for example, the internet is flooded with opinions here and worldwide.   What caused this young man to vent his frustrations about Islam in such a tragic way? Is the government really sure that all Canadians support unfettered immigration? Why is there a perception by some Canadians that Muslims don't want to integrate? Are not some of the criticisms towards Islam valid? What is reasonable accommodation? There’s simply too much misinformation. Surely the people who asks these questions are not all intolerant or racists.    We need an honest and reasonable dialogue. One that isn't automatically perceived as intolerance.
That makes no sense as the USA is not a sinking ship and how are countries wrong to want to maintain their borders?  How many children do these people feel it is okay to have?  And why are they unable to fix their own countries?   In the decades to come there will be failed state after failed state that will lead to a global catastrophe, so where will your sinking ship analogy be when there are millions rushing the border and we have let in advance all of the people that will help them get in?  Would a true leader not start by saying to these countries SLOW down on making babies you cannot support to begin with?   Muslim countries tell their citizens to have as many babies as possible (see president of Turkey).  Africa as well.       Trudeau must go as he is honour bound to live up to his father's ideology of multiculturalism and now with the earth's population almost having doubled since, this needs to stop.   Peace to everyone but these people need to return to their homelands.
So what is one to do now.  It was obvious from the beginning that  the batteries  were a known fire hazard so placing them in baggage presented a serious problem.  The  concern was that the Islamic fundamentalists had devised a way to hide hard to detect back yard concocted  explosives in electronic devices and were planning to smuggle them on a plane hidden in  carry on electronic devices. The bomb could then be exploded by a timer trigger device or even better and more fool proof, a barometric trigger device  which would only activate when the plane reached a preset altitude.  Given the closed and pressurized environment of a plane, any fire even a small one poses a grave threat let alone a bomb.
"The terrorist attack outside the Muslim Welfare House mosque in London’s Finsbury Park in the small hours of Monday morning didn’t happen in a vacuum." ----------------------------------------  Correct, it happened following Islamic inspired attacks of Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge as well as other attacks in Europe. Interestingly, Ms. Aziz neglects to mention the Islamic affiliation, simply using the words "since the Manchester and London terrorist attacks"  The recent attack in Finsbury Park is sad and atrocious, as is the rise of assaults and abuse.  But if we need to talk about Islamophobia, then we need all participants to be open and honest about the context and not disingenuously conceal some words such as Islamic inspired terrorism and promote words like white supremacy.    I am sad to say that while the polemics of individuals like Ms. Aziz inflame those on the right, it simply turns me, a "lefty" or "progressive" off.  Not a good start to conversation Ms. Aziz.
M-103 will bring in a demand for sharia law to protect Muslims from us. Justin can hardly say no.
Islamists are doing this all over the world.
That is "your" (questionable) interpretation of the anti discrimination "law", but it is NOT the prima facie 1st amendment right. A license from a city is only in order for the City to Control sales tax and determine if a business is "legal" (not in violation of state and city health regs, fire regs or engaged in criminal activity). The baker is in business to make cakes and using his artistry. No one FORCES the gays to come into his shop and demand a particular decoration on his cake. A catholic bookstore is not forced to carry atheist books or jewish books or muslim books-why should a baker be forced to decorate any cake for any reason? It is NOT a necessity to have a wedding cake, nor is a wedding cake a necessity of LIFE, HEALTH, nor should/can anyone be forced into a personal services contract. A city or state "business license" does not give government control over the individual owners or their "religious" beliefs or business activities.
Looking forward to tomorrow's highlight on muslim justice.  Lashings for talking to another man is quite reasonable and a necessary accommodation.
We've been doing it for over a century Hedzer. We're pretty good at it. And Muslims have been here for at least 3 generations.
I have to agree that since 9-11 when we were awakened and began our real education and introduction to jihaad....and the Muslim faith - knowing they are  mostly hijacking the faith....and that there were millions of Muslims in the world I have been waiting and waiting and growing more frustrated. Waiting to see and hear things like....Muslim leadership on TV announcing..we will be holding workshops around the world to organize how best to remove the terrorist cancer from our faith, our Mosques our neighborhoods. They cannot continue unchallenged and it is our shared responsibility to remove them from within.   Haven't seen nor heard this yet from the muslim leadership,still waiting! You can do a global cleansing, put one in motion...but you have not, which leads to some unfavorable conclusions.
Grave yards are peaceful . So is Islam.
Charlie Hebdo mocks everything in a brutal fashion. Period. Charlie Hebdo is conflating the Hurricane Harvey disaster with the protests around the South over Confederate statues. Conservatives rallied around Charlie Hebdo when it was mocking Muslims or the Prophet Mohammed, proclaiming "freedom of ideas" and "Je suis Charlie Hebdo". But now that the water-logged shoe is on the other foot, they're appalled and are condemning Charlie Hebdo. I think conservatives' reaction is funny as Hell.
Democrats are in for a rude awakening when their Muslim refugees behead them in public one day for supporting LBGQ, pro-abortion, womens' rights and other highly anti-Islam ideologies! In an odd twist of fate, the Democrats will seal their fate and setting them back to the cave ages! LOL
It has always been a situation that what the Americans do first eventually comes to Canada. Railroads, radio, TV, Elvis, internet....we will get Islamic terrorism soon enough.
All form of hate need to be eliminated racism, homophobia, Islamophobia, Anti-Semitism, discrimination against Transgenders. We must get behind Justin, Obama, Hillary and Premier Wynne and fight Trump and this racist Quebec law!
Ali was a great boxing talent, but he was also a draft dodger, part of a radical anti-American black muslim group,  a back stabbing opportunist who called Joe Frazier an "uncle Tom" despite the fact that Frazier had helped Ali while he was serving his suspension for refusing to serve his country.  Ali also was a proponent of racial separation (like the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazis).  He was one of many excellent boxers but he wasn't a great American... except in the eyes of the progressive radical left wing media.
Marine LePen and the FN fell flat not as you say ...but not for their radical views on Muslims rather... because they offered the leave the Eurozone and the EU. Every one knows that; why twist reality.
And I'm sure most people have no problem with Muslims who don't follow those extremist beliefs, they aren't the problem people are reacting against. But who's to blame for that impression? It is the most conservative that Progressives (for want of a better term) are always defending and presenting as representative of "the Muslim Community", not the more liberal ones fighting against conservatives.. Why is it the Globe for example has two  hijabis writing columns about Muslims, and none of them ever come out clearly about their actual beliefs and behaviors in society, but always to defend the more conservative ones?   As for the "fence", metaphorically speaking, my point is about the difference between strict legalism and insistence on 'rights", vs. the psychology of human relations. Ironically enough, many religions wisely insist on the priority of the latter over the former, in the interests of harmonious social relations...
What we do have so far is a long and sordid track record of false flags where we do have proof they were carried out by the Zionist factions seeking to make any negative disclosures about Israel and their history of genocide against Palestinians and Christians taboo.   The conspiracy theory is that they aren't false flags.   But Jim J...what difference would it really make if there was a mountain of evidence and an ocean of facts? No one would do or say anything bad about Israel because our MSM has been telling us over and over again that criticizing Israel is anti semitic an Israel is our ally ...two absurd ideas if there ever were any. 911 is a perfect example of what I am talking about ...everyone with a working brain and an IQ over 60 knows Israel did it...all of the facts and evidence point at Israel yet the press and the politicians continue to beat the 'it was 19 muslim goatherders with box knives" theory to death as though we are all stupid
When people repeatedly state that their intent is to ban a specific religion from entering the country then don't be shocked when judges make the assumption that their intent is to discriminate. And where do you get this, "if it's said in a campaign, it doesn't matter' meme from? Conservatives didn't explain away Clinton's 'deplorables' Obama's 'cling to guns and religion' remarks as merely campaign rhetoric . They held it up as a window to their souls.   And as far as who exactly who is a threat, refer to the crime statistics. It's looking like white nationalists/sovereign citizens pose a greater risk than Muslim immigrants.
Peace between Islam and Christianity? Highly doubtful. This is a cultural as well as Religious war. There will be tension between the two until one is no more. Islam of course and Christ shall reign supreme. Francis may get an earful from the Coptic Pope. Thank God el Sisi gave the boot to the Muslim Brotherhood, whom Obama supported.
Hypothetical arguments don't really hold much water Chuck. You're still painting this as if veils are some massive Islamist conspiracy. There are hundreds of thousands of moderate, normal, average Muslims in Canada. The fanatics are a rare bunch and, as past experience shows, are typically turned in by moderates when warranted. Calm down, you're seeing extremists everywhere when the reality is that you'll probably never see one in your life. Get a grip.
Trump was the one who campaigned on banning all Muslims, and there by effectively conflated the Islamic world with radical Islamic terrorism.  Trump truly is helping ISIS recruit more fighters.  Of course, it's as much Bannon's ideology as it is Trump's.  Islam is this century's 'communist' for the isolationist paranoid right wing.
Associate Professor Elham Manea, a Swiss-Yemeni citizen and the author of Women and Sharia Law, argues it is naïve — even racist — to regard the wearing of a burka as a sincere act of faith.  "The burka is not Islamic," she told the Religion and Ethics Report.  "It's a tradition that comes from the heart of Saudi Arabia, a region called Nejd."  Dr Manea says the veiled garment was not worn by women outside of Nejd until Saudi Arabia's Wahabi regime came to power in the late 1970s.  "The re-Islamisation of Saudi Arabia according to the Wahabi Salafi fundamentalist principles led to the mainstreaming of the burka," she said.  "With Gulf money you had a promotion of this ideology and a reading of Islam that turned the burka into an 'Islamic' tradition."
Not to mention that Sharia Law is a central tenet of Islam, making it incompatible with our constitution. I'd rather see permanent western military bases over there creating safe zones so they can enjoy their home country rather than trying to subvert ours.
Since you've looked it up, ScottyKnows2 - how does M103 make criticizing Islam illegal in Canada?  Hmm?
Thanks for asking Maya. Please review Layla's post and observe that she makes the error of binary thinking. She claims that since some people in the article - actually only 2 people which is hardly a relevant sample size - are calling this a hate crime against hijab wearing Muslim women, that any other kind of crime against women must therefore NOT be a hate crime.  This is clearly an erroneous and illogical claim as one condition does not make itself exclusive to the exclusion of all others. It's like saying that since black people are subject to racism therefore no other ethnic group can be subject to racism. It's simplistic thinking and serves only to denigrate the impact of attacks on hijab wearing women. It's an attempt to belittle the fact that they are victims. Essentially she is victimizing them a second time.
The banning of Islam is totally Constitutional. The facts are that the Moonies, Mormons, and even our Native "religions" were compelled to end practices that violated "religious protection" standards. For the Moonies, they had to stop "coercion,"  the Mormons, "plural marriages" and the Natives, their "vow of the Sun" ritual that our government deemed as "torture". The Muslims side-stepped exploration of their "practices" by providing huge amounts of monies first to the Clinton that created the "inter-faith office in the White House to $1.5bil in Saudi contracts to Bush and associates after he left office. The USA is not a multicultural nation, but is based upon assimilation into a new form of government versus Islamic ideology that has the goal of replacing secular and Christian value governments with sharia law which makes its followers "domestic enemies". They jump on and use minority issues to cloak their real intent. They should be both banned and deported.
It's foolhardy to get angry about politicians not honoring their election promises. This is a good thing. With Donald Trump coming on stream, Trudeau doesn't have the time right now to overhaul our democratic process, it will be too much to deal with when we know NAFTA is about to be cut open. The drama of the conservatives is just that. All the conservatives have are straws to grab at: Canadians don't care if Trudeau makes money on the side for speeches. Kushner is acting like a ticket taker for Trump right now collecting millions for anyone wanting to see this maniac.   Steven Harper was the one who whipped this country into so much hatred and his mentor was Tom Flanagan.  If the Globe wants Canadians to buy their product, or even take them seriously, they should stop begging the federal government, lose the serial plagiarist and also lose Tom Flanagan who is responsible for helping promoting the anti Muslim sentiment in Canada now.
Yes, Muslims have been killed by non-Muslim terror: the Quebec City Mosque.  And non-Muslims have been killed by Muslims: 9-11; Charlie Hebdo; Bataclan Theatre; Boston Marathon; San Bernardino; Orlando etc.  The authors glibly state that the definition of the meme 'Islamophobia' is simply, "The irrational fear of Muslims." There you have it-- now everybody understands.  But hold on-- you have to unpack that: What does 'irrational' mean? WordBook says it means, ". . . not consistent with using reason." But if you look at the unending, living stream of terror perpetrated by some segment of Islam, a measure of caution toward Islam seems perfectly 'rational'.  Not all Muslims are Islamists, or violent Islamists (Jihadis); but all Jihadis are Muslim.  What you call Islamophobia is often instinctual trepidation to simply watching the news.  Muslims need to start the conversation, not shut it down by obscurantist, suppressing  rhetoric like 'Islamophobia'.
If the KKK asked this guy to bake an anti-black cake and he refused .....how many people would support his refusal? If someone asked this guy to bake to bake a cake that was derogatory of Jews, gays, Muslims, or Christians.....and he refused.....how many people would defend his right to do so? ========== Maybe.....everyone who doesn't support him now?
This is a big step in US Policy and a transformation of Trump from anti-muslim and anti-globalist, to pro Saudi Islam, pro Sunni, and pro-globalist in the Middle East-- this is not the old Trump. He is coming out strongly for the 30 something Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud not widely known in the US except as the Saudi Prince who offered Kanye West $10 Million for one night with Kim Kardashian. He has been supported by US arms and aircraft manufacturers because he wants to modernize the Saudi military with the latest weaponry and aircraft. Obama took steps to arm the Saudi's but this was shot down by Republicans. The rumor (more than fake news) is that Trump will offer a huge arms deal to the Saudi's on his visit. Trump is also expected to support the Saudi war in Yemen where US has already been increasing its support of the Saudi's. Obama launched a large cruise missile attack in Yemen, but not so much to support the Saudi's as to retaliate for Houthi firing on a US ship.
If Islamophobia is perfectly understandable, then so is Mormonophobia, Amishophobia, Buddhistophobia and so on.   The DSM-V says a 'phobia' is a psychological disorder. Does M-103 say what physicians may diagnose Islamophobia?  Islamophobia is a meme constructed to carry forward special consideration, and to silence criticism. If you flip over the Islamophobia card, the other side says "Victim".  Bigotry is bigotry, and is ugly-- regardless of the parties involved.  It is relevant, however, to name the perpetrators, reveal their agenda, detail the facts of the case, and identify the target group.  While targeted groups require our outrage, and our compassion, no special treatment is allotted to any group.
HabFan410, yes, there is a good case to be made that this vote should not have been restricted to the few dozen closest people. And if you've been following the debate in Quebec, you would know the people who've been making it.  Here's the law: if a case can be made that this decision was based on anti-muslim motive, then it can be challenged under the Charter of Rights.  I don't know the extent of it at the time of the vote, but it can't be denied it was there (although many posters here are denying it.)    To challenge it succcessfully would of course take more than a "prospect" or a "suspicion", but that would come out if there were a trial.
Canadians will vote out liberals in next election for their Muslim Vote bank politics
Regarding: ""As followers of Jesus Christ and as Christian ethicists representing a range of denominations and schools of thought, we stand in resolute agreement in firmly condemning racist, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, and neo-Nazi ideology as a sin against God that divides the human family created in God's image," the statement begins. " - This is a good article. - Though the ethicists, and other men and women of good will,  no doubt righteously write in the heat of the moment, let us not forget the gypsyes, the homosexuals, Buddhists, Zorastrians, Christians, and other believers of other religions, all who suffer from those past fascists ideologies, and from those modern excuses for religious persecutions and personal oppression resulting in death, and destruction.
I think this is wrong. Democrats say all the time that they want to support moderate Muslims who oppose ISIS and the Taliban. Nobody says that it's an attack on Islam.
Even the westerners in Alberta voted NDP. And the mayor of Calgary is a Muslim. There is a carbon tax in oil producing Alberta, though none in the auto producing provinces.  At this moment in time, Alberta is politically more left wing than Ontario. Or BC, for that matter.
The Local Japanese during WW2, were not a violent people.  The Local Japanese during WW2, did not have a segment of their religion, that could be interpreted as a violent religion (Sharia Law).  All of the current US Military personnel, returning from Southwest Asia, who have had combat experience, generally speaking, do not have a favorable impression of violent Muslims.
Thank you Ward: that was a wonderful Ali interview! What a great guy, brilliant and funny. What he said, of course, absolutely is true, in its day. Black men walking around with white women were in grave danger in much of this country (still are, in places in the S and W…).  With the destruction of the black race (drugs and incarceration) and identity that took place in the 20th century, a "black is beautiful" message was a wonderful one to focus on. Black Muslims were law-abiding, brooking no criminals in their church. No drinking. You may wish to note that, until very recently, Catholic priests STRONGLY urged catholic boys NOT to propose to non-Catholic girls. Aren't you outraged? Same with Jews: intermarriage is frowned upon, though, unlike Catholics, a woman really can't become a Jew in traditional sense.
She may as well just give ISIS warriors automatic visas to enter Canada for all the good her efforts will achieve. She will not acknowledged that hell fire anti-Semitism is right now the general topic of discussion in mosques across Canada.  What we call radicalization is the essence of Islam,  but Freeland will say nothing lest she offend Muslims. Radicalization is to Islam what missionary charity is to Christianity,  like that good ol' time religion, praise the lord.   Without confronting the radicalization at the core of Islam  no good can come of her.
It a shame that former federal cabinet member and  Conservative Party leadership candidate Chris Alexander could not bring himself to do what Sen John McCain did when a women at one of his rally's called Obama a Muslim from Kenya , McCain stopped her and told her she was wrong and that Obama is a good man and wants the best for America , he just disagrees with him on how to do it.
Saudi Arabia ,Bahrain , Kuwait , Qatar and Oman have not taken any Refugees - they call them Terrorists!  Refugees coming to Canada should be prepared to return home when hostilities cease . Refugees from the middle east that follow Islam will never integrate into our Judeo/Christian society  and therefor would be happier with their own kind . One should look at Europe if you have any doubt .
The Board will do nothing, and neither will the Muslim students or parents.   I was a student at Peel highschools over 20 years ago. We had Friday prayers just fine and dandy without any complaints or objections from the staff, our fellow students and friends, parents, community members, etc. My parents - both devout Muslims - had no complaints to the school administration or the board about the "moral decay" at our schools.   My parents never complained about the "moral decay" that you speak of because it's silly to do so. We live on Earth, where there are people of all kinds. That's why you teach your kids to respect everyone and get along with them, instead of demanding that their rights be stripped from them.   Much ado about nothing.
But many of them will say they are for the death penalty if anyone leaves Islam.  That is the world they want.  They can be pretty and smile, but by wearing that uniform, they are telling you their religion and its code of death what they really value.   They do not value your values.
SenseofPlace - I'm not sure what 'Place' your title refers to but I do have an idea to offer you. A 'place(s)' you could go to verify your illusions about Islam.  Hop on a plane, any plane, and fly to any Muslim country, which by its very ideaology , is governed by Islam under Shariah law.  Then when you get to the Immigration desk tell the guy with the gun behind the desk that you are a refugee from Canada. I would love to see what happens? I doubt if it would be immediate welfare, with the promise you can bring your entire family over to join you.   Please don't reply claiming that the only way to protect the world's oppressed citizenry is by adopting only your dreamy liberal beliefs and that by doing so every immigrant and refugee will be so grateful they will immediately become just like you. Real life doesn't work that way and never has. I have lived and worked in those 'places' and was not too stupid to recognise the total divide  between our beliefs and cultures.
Protesters outside Masjid Toronto mosque call for ban on Islam.
Muslims don't seem to be the ones marrying children.
We can look to the SCOTUSA to deal with this, as it did with Trump's anti Muslim edicts. States sued to overturn the previous Trump Tantrums. Mass. et al already sued the EPA, getting the SCOTUSA to rule that CO2 and other GHGs are pollutants that must be regulated.  Trump has already lost on this one. All States need to do is to get a Court Order to enforce the existing decision.  http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/549/497.html  'Given EPA's failure to dispute the existence of a causal connection between man-made greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, its refusal to regulate such emissions, at a minimum, "contributes" to Massachusetts' injuries.'
I always find it extremely sad when people judge a whole group of people as terrorists based on the actions of a few.  There are over one and a half billion Muslims of every different 'race', (though that term has been proven to be unscientific),  and speaking many languages, living in many countries, and interpreting the Quran in many different ways.
I prefer to call them what they are,..murdering radical Muslim wars by religious extremists wanting to impose stone-age societal laws on people who want no part of it.   They are not America`s wars Kutcher.  They are the world`s war on illiteracy and lack of education and the conflicts that leads to, between the old and new in the world.
Can you point any post out that justifies the killing of this young women?  Or any post that fuels hatred towards Muslims?  All posts even remotely critical of Islamic dogma are immediately reported and censored by Alceste, Allan Ross or guantanamo, so I highly doubt that any posts actually fueling hate or celebrating this brutal death could make it past the attacks on free speech.
If you are a talented,  ambitious and profit-driven workers or small business owners, it 's time to think about moving to Australia or US who will welcome you, your family & wealth with open arms. Otherwise, this socialist & pro-Muslim government tax you & your hard earn money from work & smart investment to death to fulfil their socialist agenda.
India has Sunday as a holiday, because their Christian colonizers imposed that on them. Ditto for the Chinese. Muslim countries have Friday as the weekend holiday.  My point is that there are several explicitly Christian traditions, which people think have no religious origin. It is hard to point a finger at the Muslims and say they are asking for special favours. Christianity is treated as special religion (all religions are equal, but some are more equal than others).
Then why assume Muslim women do too?
Dec 22, 2016 - Obama Administration Officially Deletes Muslim Registry Since 9/11, Ending Muslim Vetting Program. Registry used to track Arabs and Muslims dismantled by Obama ... https://www.theguardian.com › US News › Obama administration There is a lot of articles on it. Since you are still whining due to your defeat I will give you a couple pacifiers here. There are many more as you will see you were wrong yet again. You may need to wipe the continually flowing shower of defeat tears to read it though.
What do you do though, when your scared of spiders? You scream when you see them or react in disgust. Worse, you kill them. This is what this article is trying to say. Its fine if you are unable to distinguishe between what Islam is and what some cultures who happen to be majorely Muslim do, or between Islam and how some nutsos choose to interpret it to justify their actions. Thats fine. Your opinion is yours to form. What this article is trying to say is that you are allowed to your opinion and you should not be labelled islamophobic for having a bad opinion of muslims. The point is that your opinion should not affect those muslims. Your actions towards them should not show defference. Thats when it would change from being your personal opinion to a sociale and a safety concern. What I would object to, is that one day you would speak to me and treat me no differently than any other, to then do a 180 degree in attitude when you learn of my faith.
"Would be Americans"? These people are applying to get into the USA to escape the hardened belief systems and over-population of their warring homelands.  The article refers to American allies in the Middle East, such as Jordan a top recipient of U.S. foreign aid.  The west cannot remake the Middle East. Nations there must take a hard look at the theocracies that drive war there ... where factions of the same belief system are fighting each other even though they share culture and language.  When these types of unreasonable wars were fought in Ireland, no one was afraid to call the warring Catholics and Protestants unreasonable.  The Irish problems at the time were limited education, over-population (families with too many children born into desperate circumstances) and a complete exaggeration  of their 'differences' though they shared culture and language -- in other words, imaginary differences.  Middle East 'allies' should assist their Muslim neighbours -- the West can send funds.
You mean the model where muslim parents take their kids out of music classes? Or the one where non muslim kids have to change the way they eat and dress so muslim kids can be integrated.  This model works well. There were never attacks by jihadis in Canada. We do not alienate our jihadis.
While I agree with the general sentiment of the article, I take issue with Wente's repeated references to Muslims being 'newcomers' There are lots of 2nd and 3rd generation Muslims in Canada, as well as converts to the faith whose ancestors came to the country centuries ago.
Right, because when you lead with "Islamic State" in the headline, no one ever makes the connection to terrorism do they?
This whole thing smelled of fake news at first read.  Regardless, there are plenty of people who want what Jones wants who aren't Muslim but who are being persecuted for those beliefs.
Actually, Islam has Abraham in their Koran. They believe Jesus was a prophet. So no they are not anti-christ.  I've seen some evangelists that seem pretty anti-christ to me.
Trump apparently took advise and visited the CIA on very first day. Here's why: 1. On his inauguration speech he declared war on many fronts. One is he will relaunch GW Bush holy war on 'radical' Islam, radical defined as he see fit. This American war is now 15 years old and will surely go 2 decades. History tells us that wars of religion last centuries. Trump need the CIA to fight his new holy war. 2. He needs the CIA, at least with his chosen head, on side. He knows can cannot win a CIA fight. He knows what happened to JFK. 3. To preserve his health. It is not smart to downsize the CIA because they will downsize him first.   So right away Trump swims in the swamp kissing the crocs.
I'm not sure what right-wing blog has been pushing the concept that 'Islamophobia is an invention of the Organization of Islamic Countries- - I've read it several times in the last couple of days - but it's just wrong.  You say "But I believe it will lead to laws that criminalize speech/writing even when it tells the truth. "  Two questions: 1. What form do you think these laws will take?  2. Do you think that the strict limits put on hate speech legislation by the Supreme Court of Canada will be an impediment to it? So far it has said that laws that go beyond those strict limits are unconstitutional.
Wiliki? Paddock acted alone. If he sold guns, law men would know about it. Paddock was not muslim.  Millions of security cameras, not one shows your "mystery" man. Stop.
All newcomers to Canada learn that it takes more than a year to integrate, including find a job in your line of business. I was one 50 years ago. I would say three years with some higher education retraining and in between a fair bit of hardship and uncertainty. I am amazed at the level of entitlement often displayed by the new generation of migrants. In the case of Syrians, I believe that job hunting may also be slowed down by prevailing public attitudes and opinions, not favourably predisposed towards muslims.
I don't know how well you have studied history. Hitler was democratically elected with a minority government. Trump received a minority of the popular vote. Hitler was given dictatorial powers as a "temporary measure" due to crisis and the rest was history. While there are obvious differences of degree the similarities are striking: the use of propaganda, the rule by decree. the claim of conspiracies against the dictator and the scapegoating of minority groups. When businesses act based on strong-arm decrees from the dictator rather than by market forces that is fascism at work.  The manipulation by the dictator (together with allied media propaganda outlets) of hysteria of the public about "terrorists" and Muslims is a perfect example of fascism at work. Your post is quite naive. The judiciary is stacked by the president in power. The only people who can run for office are the wealthy elite or those backed by hundreds of millions of dollars.
That's precisely why police shouldn't be wearing that garb. They're in Canada now.   What about when the judge rules against you or the cop says "go home, forget about it"? How do you know they would say the same thing if you weren't Jewish and they weren't Muslim, and vice versa, and every other combination?
Trudeau has zero interest in the military, it's not a millennial thing, so expect nothing here.  In my town on his "church basement" tour he's going nowhere near a church, he going to the community centre in an area heavily-populated by Muslims.
Great point! Not enough questions are being asked regarding mass Muslim immigration in Europe or Canada.   - Muslim religion vis-à-vis LGBT - Muslim religion vis-à-vis woman rights. - Muslim religion vis-à-vis feminism.  - Muslim religion vis-à-vis freedom of expression. - Muslim religion vis-à-vis freedom of religion. - Muslim religion vis-à-vis freedom from religion. - Muslim religion vis-à-vis honor killings - Muslim religion vis-à-vis forced marriages.   This list goes on, but no one is asking questions!
So.........you're trying to say that Democrats are a part of the President's base? You have described Democrats to a "T" with your labeling and name calling. Let's see; "Racist"---started a civil war to maintain slavery as an institution, founded the KKK as their paramilitary wing to kill blacks and Republicans, established Jim Crow and segregation, and founded the welfare state to ruin the black family structure and buy black votes through slavery to Democrat government handouts; check.  "Misogynist"---see the treatment of Sarah Palin, Condoleezza Rice (could also be filed under "racism"), Betsy Devoss, Nancy Reagan, Melania Trump, etc. "Islamophobic"---A word without meaning, unless you are speaking of the fear that Democrats have towards the truth of Sharia law and the teachings of the Koran actually seeing the light of day and being read and understood by the non-Muslim world.  "Homophobic"---See the fear Democrats show towards Milo Yiannopolis.
Yes, really.  I know that you haven't the faintest idea by comparing your statements (which parrot tired alt-right talking points) with my own experience at universities.  You don't have a clue about the hard work that goes on there.  My experience suggests that the young people in college today are mostly curious about the world and eager to learn how it works.    UH is certainly not the den of rapists and criminals you imagine (hey, you're not stealing Trump's line about Mexicans and applying it to UH students, are you?).  Next thing, you'll be putting students in the "enemy combatant" bin, along with the grandparents and grandchildren of your Muslim neighbors.
"When have the leaders of PLO and now, Hamas, ever refused to speak with the Israelis?"  For last 8 years or more they refused face to face negotiations...remember it was Abass not Netanyahu who walked away from the Obama brokered negotiations even after Netanyahu meet all of the negotiation preconditions like release of PLO prisoners and freeze on building of new settlements.  And Israel is a "The Jewish State" right now and despite that there are around 20% Muslem Arab citizens in it, plus other minorities of other religions. Palestinian plan all along has been to turn Israel into a Muslim state, and then to rename it, right after ethnically cleansing it of the Jews.
Or maybe if he is a Muslim he is just following the Koran: Do not take Infidels as friends.
Of course lost of comments about Islam have gotten through so your claims are as misguided as your fear about M-103.
The Muslims in my work place are told to pray on their own time, that means at home !!! Do the restaurants in Toronto who employee large amounts of Muslim minority's   have prayer rooms, of course not.
Trump campaigned again and again about the need for greater security against terrorist attacks.  Hillary didn't (who knows what she stood for).   And we know the election results.  It pleases me that progressives still can't bring themselves to condemn acts of terrorism by Muslim extremists.    So out of touch, it's truly is hard to believe.
You are naive. Recently in a Texas town, there was an attempt by the city council to ban any foreign laws, not just Sharia law, from being implemented or followed in the city. It created a furor because a large number of Muslims protested this new law. Now if Muslims are truly against Sharia, why the protest? Not saying that Sharia will happen, but why deny the possibility?
No I haven't. I  lived 6 months in the middle east and south asia and have a pretty good understanding of Islam, thanks.   Have you read the debates in the Ontario legislature that this article is about?  Have you even read the full text of the motion?  I do notice you've read your own post, since you've already 'liked' it.
The woman reports that she has a life-threatening allergy to dogs but has no documentation to prove it. It's the last flight of the day and she allegedly has to be on that flight.  Her solution...kick the other passengers and their dogs off the plane or have the airline provide her with an Epi-pen.  When told that neither is an option, she becomes belligerent and refuses requests from the flight crew to leave.  Police are called.  She resists, disobeys and has to be dragged off the plane.  Another snowflake whose rights and feelings are more important.  That she doubles down by being a professor (she is a socio-cultural anthropologist in the Humanistic Studies department at Maryland Institute College of Art and was a Visiting Assistant Professor of Women’s Studies and Islamic Studies at Harvard Divinity School) just adds to it.
Replace "Mennonites" with "Muslims" and then try saying the same things about them.
This does seem the tendency. Amplify the acts by foreigners, minimize the acts by white guys. My unscientific survey says Breitbart covers a Islamic shooter for much longer than a white shooter even if the latter caused more death.
The NDP is never getting into power in this country. They want to force islam down your throats. They do not tell you Saudi Arabia has 3 million empty, air-conditioned tents to take in refugees but refuse to take them in. The top by population Muslim countries ARE NOT BANNED FROM ENTRY TO USA. That is the truth. Anything else like saying it is a muslim ban versus country ban, is a lie. Check it out yourself. Those countries the risk is too big right now so that is all.
I’m trying to remember what Trump told the whole world (via his lovely Twitter) last time, when his first attempt at a Muslim ban was struck down by the courts ..... oh, yeah: “See you in court !” (LOL!) He then completely turtled and abandoned any such notion. So, you know, who the heck knows if he really means it this time, or if he’s just going to go home again, with his tail between his legs (once again). Time will tell / I'll believe things only once I see them, with this mensch. (Gotta be careful about crying “wolf” all the time; at some point people just don’t believe you any more.)
Fundamentalist Muslims are a PEACE loving culture though....  i mean Their holy book teaches them not to love they neighbor but to convert that neighbor and impose the medieval system of oppression known as sharia law.    when they do the most heinous acts you could ever imagine - Raping, murdering, kidnapping, cutting peoples heads off, crucifying them in public squares, putting them into a cage, setting them on fire its all in the name of religion!     schmucks  Did everyone see the left wing fanatics defending the attack as if it wasnt a "terrorist"
A LIBTURD APOLOGIST HIMSELF DALLAIRE  .HOW MUCH DOES ONE GET TO TAKE A FEW MUSLIMS DOWN  FOR FUN  MUST BE WORTH $25 M
Not only will he walk, Fat Donny will appoint him Director of Muslim American Relations.
You are permitted to mention Islam, as long as it is within the term Islamophobia and is discussed within the context of Bill 103. Otherwise the contract moderators have been instructed to pull your post.
If the author of this article had done better research, she would have discovered that a  publisher of diverse literature, Mawenzi House Publishers, has been in existence for more than 30 years in Canada. Mawenzi House has published books by authors from many different backgrounds, not only Muslim or South Asian. Such an oversight, in an article privileging a multinational's rather late initiative, is surely part of the problem that needs to be addressed. The initiatives mentioned in this article should in fact be seen in light of the Canada Council for the Arts' strong recent incentives for encouraging diversity in publishing. Unfortunately, it is also true, that a clamour for diversity can lead to the promotion of mediocrity.
If the deli doesn't already have ham on the menu, then no they shouldn't be able to.  In this case, the guy already makes wedding cakes.  As for the clown in Kansas, my bet is that most gay bars would serve them, but the customers would probably make them pretty uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, your analogy falls flat, as ones like this always do.  One that would make more sense is a Muslim guy walking in to a Kosher deli, and the deli owner refusing to serve him on the grounds that he is Muslim.  That however also doesn't work, because even the ultra-orthodox Jews aren't that self righteous.
I love how the I'm one of the only people on this thread that sees how wrong this is and I happen to be commenting while sitting in a high school science class. I can't wait until my generation is in charge so we can attempt to undue and fix the problems the current generation is creating for us. Does anyone else on this thread even know anyone who is Muslim?
I would also like to add that the people of Calgary should be proud of electing a visible minority Muslim as mayor whether or not they voted for him. Sure there may be some rascists in Clagary, rascists can be found everywhere, even in countries full of visible minorities who are the majority. As an Edmontonian and an Albertan, I have been teased by Torontonians (and other Canadians) for living in "red neck" country (is that also coded language?). Imagine my delight to see Calgary hold up the torch for Canadian inclusiveness in a world where we were disgraced by the antics of a mayor elected by Torontonians. Okay, enough with the proud of Calgarians commentary from an Edmontonian, time to put on my Edmontonian persona: "Go Esks, Go!!!"
When many Muslim parents objected to her sex education program, Wynne called those people homophobic. Does that make her an Islamophobe?
Your article is based on the false assumption that  the positions taken by Trump are, in themselves, "anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and racist". I'm not sure what "anti-immigrant" means. How can anyone be anti-immigrant  No one to my knowledge is categorically anti-immigrant. Yes there are those who are anti-illegal immigrants or anti-criminal immigrants or anti-unfettered massive immigration. But these represent legitimate positions. Trumps positions are not anti-anything. His positions reflect concerns for the safety and welfare of the American people. His positions merely argue in favor of restoring  the rule of law and a rational approach to immigration issues.   Your claims that advocating  a new rational approach to immigration and illegal immigrants is anti-muslim and racist is unfounded and slanderous.
Over the past 15 years, fireworks in the USA have killed an average of between 4 and 10 people a year, depending which study you look at.  In contrast, over the past 15 years, Islamist terrorists have killed an average of about 200 Americans a year, in America.  So it is hard to call fireworks the Greater Scourge, at least in America.
I guess you are trying to be clever by changing the subject.  That's an old trick of Lefties.  Short attention span.  Can't stay on topic.  Lack of focus.  They don't fight Islamic terrorism.  They complain about  Islamaphobia.
"Aga Kahn a muslim imam connected to isis"  Any proof of this ridiculous assertion?
Criticism of Muslim behaviour and Islam itself does not equate with hate.  If one looks very closely at the behaviour of Muslims and the critics of Islam it becomes very clear who is raping hundreds of thousands children, shooting people, blowing up buildings, overthrowing nations, destabilizing society, and otherwise spreading terror.
"but the homeowner's vote on this was based primarily on their views of what it would do to their property values"  1. How do you know this "common sense reality"? 2.  Do you have information not available to the mayors of Saint-Apollinaire and Quebec City and the premier of Quebec - who all think anti-muslim sentiment played a major part? 3. Do you think the leadership role played by the anti-muslim group La Meute (the Wolf Pack) had no influence?
Germany is ahead of us.  Globe and Mail yesterday re Germany banning the  burqa:-  More than a million migrants, many of them Muslims from the Middle East, have arrived in Germany over the last two years, and concerns about integration are widespread.  "Integration also means that we should make clear and impart our values and where the boundaries of our tolerance towards other cultures lie," German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said. "The draft law we have agreed on makes an important contribution to that."   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I agree that our public schools should not be turned into places of worship for any religion. In fact I think it's ridiculous. It's provocative.
This law represents the will of a huge majority of Quebecers, including women, not just "old white men".  The better question is, how do a handful of imams get to dictate what some Muslim women feel they must wear to be pleasing to Allah?
I didn't know we had a Muslim governor?
Do Sunni and Shia Muslims pray together in the Muslim prayer rooms in our Ontario public schools?  Are women and girls treated the same way as the men and boys in the Muslim prayer rooms in Ontario public schools? Can the women and girls mix with the men and boys to pray in the Muslim prayer rooms in our Ontario public schools?
I am surprised this post hasn't been deleted yet. It goes against the standard Muslims-only-as-victims narrative so widely held by the government/media. - you spoke to soon? I see a deleted post - < this comment did not meet civility standards > Is that the one you refer to?
You mean like the president being born in Kenya and being a muslim.
The issue of prayer rooms in schools began  because  young Muslim guys who went to Friday prayers the local mosque (two blocks away) at noon didn't return. It was about truancy, because they skipped the rest of the school day. What should have been a parental matter became embroiled in an “accommodation”' battle.
I haven't seen any reference in this thread to abandoning Saturday and Sunday. Random comments in here are hardly indicative of anything significant and you should take everything said with a grain of salt. At no point did I say or allude to it being shameful that our culture has a strong Christian basis. I do maintain that it is ironic and somewhat hypocritical to talk about our society being secular when so much of it has a religious origin. And there is nothing at all in this discussion about Christmas and Easter being "offensive to some tiny minority". You're reading far more into this than is actually there and it certainly has nothing to do with letting students use an empty classroom. Stay focused.  You're completely off base if you think having Muslims students pray in school is in anyway similar to the state sanctioned and enforced Christianity of previous decades. Your description of Islam as "aggressive" is quite telling.
Keillor is a notorious hate-monger.  He seems to think that people who live in this one small town in Wisconsin are just there to amuse elitists like him.  I've heard him say--on the radio!--things critical of his Lutheran upbringing. That tells you the low opinion he has of Christians. He's been divorced twice--that tells you his morals stink--and he lived briefly in Sweden, which tells you he hates America.  Why, I read on Breitbart (soon to be the official White House website!) that over 60% of the regular weekly listeners to Prairie Home Companion were blacks, Mexicans, Muslims, or queers.  Most of them didn't even speak English! That's who's been backing this creep all these years!
Police don't suspect a wider plot? It's called Islamic Jihad. No wonder the terrorists will continue to attack London and Europe.
Some said the same about a Jews in the 1930s and look where that got us. You do understand that Muslim and terrorist are not synonymous, right?
To compare the French Council of the Muslim faith to Stalin shows the depth of your irrational hatred, Martel.
Incredible, Trump temporary immigration ban of 6 arab nations hostile to American lives, brought a doomsday scenario from the usual left, "the dark ages, a blow against science, a blow against islam, a blow against high tech., -Silicone Valley-" Now, Dooms day all over again, every one repent!. Really? Trump just saved trillions of dollars, in the long run, to hardworking american taxpayers,  that otherwise they would've had to pay under the Obama- Hillary team, had they won. Man made Climate change is a terrible scam, Trump is right.
The vote count. The "millions of people who voted illegally. The "thousands of Muslims that cheered on 9/11 in NYC". That the election was "rigged". That Hillary Clinton is  "a bigot" and "the devil". That "I alone can fix it". That Ted Cruz's father helped assassinate JFK. That John McCain wasn't a war hero. That Mexico is sending "rapists" and "murderers". That he saved 1,000 jobs at Carrier. That he "never met Putin"/is " a personal friend" of Putin. That he didn't know who David Duke is. That he's going to "Lock her UP". That "that was only to get elected, We don't need that now". That he's worth $10 billion. That he, himself, is not a racist. That he never groped women.  If I keep typing out the list, I'll run out of characters.  Either you're forgetting or ignoring his untold lies or you're just not keeping up.   Hint: Breitbart and StormFront are NOT your friends.
This is why there are no irrational fears when it comes to Islam.  More bullying by liberalism.
We didn't have these problems before islam got here.
Yes, after over 2 Decades (since 1982) of having to deal with Muslims' Culture (don't say "Religion"), there is no comparison to Americans, U.S. Citizens of Japanese Ancestry (not Japanese Americans according to those that served with the 442th Regimental Combat Team, or the 100th Battalion as "U.S. Citizen First, Japanese Ancestry as the Past", that volunteered to escape the U.S. Concentration Camps ("Interment Camps" modeled after Hitler's Concentration Camps at NAZI Germany of 1933), most Nisei would even not learn Japanese and completely abandoned Japanese Culture, broke any or all ties to their immediate Relatives at Japan (Uncles, Aunties, Cousins, Grand Parents)).  Like I said before, Muslims by Islamic Laws cannot Assimilate into other Cultures like the Japanese did, and must by Islamic Laws change that other Nation's Culture into the Muslim Culture, by any means possible.
There are two factions within the FBI and CIA the Good agents who Really want to fight and Stop terrorism and the Bad who enable the terrorist's because more Powerful forces up the food chain need terrorist's like this one for their Own nefarious reasons. Good agents acted on tips and brought him in,but Higher up in the FBI wanted him Out on the streets. Why did Hillary Clinton's state dept Shut down an investigation that likely would have shut down the Mosque that Radicalized this young man and who knows how Many others? She said it was because it was Offensive/Insensitive to target Muslim's and Islam, yet look at the results-Dead American's! How many More Dead American's Will Hillary Clinton Need Before we take a Harder/Stricter approach to stopping this kind of Radical Islamic teaching and then Terrorism? In yesterday's ADN there was a story on the front page about how this killer "Fell through the Cracks" those were Not cracks but mile wide Chasms! They had him 2X and let him go 2X
Keep trying Allan. So much typing yet you are still wrong. You DO understand what the RCIA/RCIC program is right? Or did you just copy/paste without actually reading it? The fact that there IS opportunity for non-Catholics to attend Allan, yes, it IS welcoming. The fact that there are guidelines for doing so doesn't make it inaccessible. I do believe I pointed that out previously. Again, your bells & whistles was alot of wasted typing. I cannot & will not argue further about the tax ALLOCATION (an amount or portion of a resource assigned to a particular recipient). Public schools have made it quite clear that religion does not belong in the school. So, again I ask you, why should Muslims get preferential accommodation? Is that not clearly an indication of hypocrisy? Yes or no? What I find most curious about you is your determination to defend Muslims & their 'right' to practice religion within a school system that denies it to others? What is it about Islam that has you so infatuated?
This was cynical politics.  We didn't "ban" people en masse from specific countries after the 9/11 attacks when there was an actual reason to be fearful.  There has been no terrorist attacks so there was no need for these restrictions.  It is a thinly veiled ploy by the alt-right to begin restricting Muslim immigration and to give Trump's racist and uneducated hardcore supporters the scapegoat and two minute hate that they want.
National Socialist sympathizers still deny the extermination of 12,000,000 + non combatants in their extermination camps (half being Jewish with 500,000 Roman not even included in the Nuremberg calculations) Dachau etc.,  The Germans kept very good records ...easier to trace ones relatives in their records.  Communist sympathizer still deny the Holomodor, the Gulag, Norilsk, Kolyma etc. 10,000,000 + killed   The Soviets kept very poor records ( reasonable only between '34-'43) 7,000,000 Ukrainian, , 2,000,000 Muslim Chechens, Ingush, Tartars, Bashkirs , Kazakhs ....then million + of Russians, Don Cossacks, Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanians, Poles....very poor ability to trace one's relatives there ...the window opened slightly during the Soviet collapse but quickly closed.

It is a good thing there are only 4 Liberals form Alberta in the liberal government. Clearly this government based in Ontario and Quebec looks south for future work opportunities instead of East-West and North. Junior Trudeau is not like the father, at least he wanted more for Quebec, while JT wants more for Quebec, and Ontario to support himself at the cost of the Rest Of Canada. We in the Atlantic now have a recovering alcoholic, and a couple of French friends from Moncton, but we also import 600,000 barrels of Saudi oil everyday to pay for the jeeps and support the Muslim civil war. At the same time we see our FEW government jobs leaving as fast as the government blinks, with not a word from the 40 shut out liberal we have in Ottawa. To assume the Atlantic provinces will vote Liberal again is nuts, maybe one or two friends, one a recovering alcoholic. This government needs to go and in the next election they will be lucky to get any more than a couple of seats.
But it gives everyone clear insight as to where Mr. Photo Op's head really is!  It is with islam and special interest billionaires, not with Canada or the Middle Class as he claims!  Canadians have every right to know who is really controlling Canada's prime minister!
Say goodbye to a quality learning week at Peel schools. Teachers before would introduce material on Mondays and test by Fridays so kids wouldn't forget over the weekends. Now, testing is out on Fridays and masses of kids who may or may not be in classrooms roam the halls.  Do you think Islamic prayer is like Christian prayer? No simply bowing the heads. No, it's carpets to pray on and special bathrooms to wash in. Totally taking over the school bathroom and storage facilities. I really pity the poor kids who is transgender or gay in all of this. Where does a transgender kid even sit in sex segregated areas of a public school?  And do you think only 1 prayer area will suffice? Of course not, Sunnis kill Shias all over the world. They both kill Ahmadiyas. One prayer room will not be enough. They can't pray together.  Thanks, Wynne. You've driven public education into the ground.
they are just following their prophet's example.  Don't be islamophobic.  Child marriage is an Islamic value.
And why would we need little chapels, temples or mosques within the public schools? Have you thought this through? Accommodation has to do with religious obligations occuring during the regular school day. This rarely applies to Christians as our society has been set up on the Christian calendar. But there are Jewish high holidays and Muslim prayer schedules that sometimes clash with the school calendar. School administrators can give permission to be absent or, as is the case in Peel, try to accommodate a group on school property.  Why would activists ask for chapels, temples or mosques? No one has done that or will do that. You seem to be one of those slippery slopers. But the slope is never as slippery as the one arguing the point. Most religious practices take place off school grounds. But we live in a country with a diverse population. Some exceptions apply. The NO RELIGION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS doctrine isn't being broken by providing space for private worship if necessary.
"What you ignore is that it was kept secret ..the public was not informed, ..."  That's complete nonsense.  Decisions by school boards are matters of public record.  I know that this has gone on for years, and I don't even live in Peel Region.  I've heard discussion of it on the news many times. In fact, while I'm at it, the Lord's Prayer is not "banned" in schools.  Many schools have Christian clubs (ISCF, Pathfinders, etc.), and on club time, they can pray their teen-aged faces off.  It's simply that the Lord's Prayer is not used in 'official' activities.  The Muslim prayer accommodations are no different.  Muslim students, like Christian students, have the right to gather for prayer any time they want.
"No doubt will include an attempt to fly into North Korean airspace. Is this negotiation?"  Do you know how ridiculous your comment is.  If that happens, Kim Jong Un will just claim those aircraft are Democratic Republic of North Korea's Secret New Aircraft.   Anybody that says otherwise will be sent to the Democrat's Prison Camps including their Families.  These U.S. Actions are only going to give Kim Jong Un more leverage to demand that the Democrats of the Democratic Republic of North Korea to sacrifice more, to increase production of Democratic Republic of North Korea's ICBMs, MRBMs, IRBMs, and 10 Mega Ton Nuclear Warheads.  Same thing different Nation, just like what happened with the Muslim Nation of Iran.  Obama's Actions only resulted in the Muslim Nation of Iran getting the Centuries of High Grade Iraqis Oil after Obama got the U.S. Kicked Out of Iraq, Iran then used the Iraqis Oil to Buy 21st Century Technology to Upgrade the Iranian Military, and increase production.
Just a heads up to any would-be commentator, words about Islam like Jihad and Fatwa are Verboten. Used them in comment, comment deleted.
According to Trump voters, this interstate compact agreement is a no-no. Think Aurora theater shooter and the Muslim sex offender named as a suspect in Clement's murder. Of course, the rules and law (rule of law) only matter when it favors their agenda.
Twenty years ago there was no issue with Islam because Islam had a very low profile, was not seen as a threat to society, and Muslims made no loud demands for "accommodations" on the threat of feeling "alienated" from society if not accommodated.  The situation has changed markedly since then.
and the USCCB will find they have made some very questionable friends in the evangelical right wing folks.  most of them want to see the Catholics out of the picture as much as they do the LGBT and the Muslims.   they are not friends of Catholics.
I knew the world went mad when my employer, SNC-Lavalin, cancelled our Christmas party bar service when 4-Muslims complained the event wasn't inclusive.  I guess that means I can insist on a buffet during Ramadan?
Huh.  As long as Hebdo was reviling Muslims and their beliefs, they were some kinda holy martyr.  Malign Texas flood victims, they magically become the devil.  This is called a "double-standard", boys and girls.
Every time there is a terrorist attack and you report it as news (!), the comments section is closed.  This was the case each time there was an Islamist terrorist attack in Britain, in the last three months.  When you publish an article on the attacks, that has a pro-Muslim or an anti-Trump angle, the comments section is always open.  This is a clear example of how "the national newspaper of Canada" is trying to control free speech: you do not want your readers to express their outrage towards the perpetrators of terrorism but you encourage the politically correct apologists to "explain" their actions!  The G&M seems to have engaged in publishing views that it endorses and supresses all dissenting opinions by not publishing them.  In the interest of balanced journalism, I encourage the G&M to be fair and balanced in not only what feedback from the readers it publishes, but also scrutinizes the content of its articles as they are heavily leaning to the leftist liberal , pc discourse.
One could argue that type of paranoia isn't without warrant.  Chattanooga, San Bernardino, Orlando, Ohio State (the full list is long)....the media often reports that individuals who knew these Muslim terrorists thought they were normal, nice people.  So one could make a case that this type of paranoia is actually informed, rather than ignorant--if one wished to do so.
I'm sorry, but I don't buy into the notion of religion as being terribly important in contests between the Middle East and the West. Perhaps due the fact that the Greeks were at war with Persians five hundreds years before anybody heard of Christ.  Your perception of an Islamic Invasion in Spain is not entirely accurate. Few contemporary accounts exist. The nation we know as Spain today was the domain of the, by then, collapsed Roman Empire. Some historians propose that a civil war was being waged in Spain, to which the Muslims were invited by one of the many Germanic tribes contesting for control of the region.  You really have no idea what is going on in the world if you are comparing Middle Eastern refugees fleeing a civil war with Islamic Berbers from Africa launching a military conquest of parts of Spain. The notions are so far removed from one another as to be laughable.
Aaaaaaah...the difference is I have nearly all of my life LIVED in predominantly black and brown neighborhoods, whereas you probably couldn't FIND one.  That means I will value my own experience over your hysteria.  Sorry, that's just how it is.  PS: Palestinian buddy of mine runs a restaurant right next door to a tea-shop catering to "gay" clientele.  Within walking distance of UNM at Albuquerque.  His food is good and he does a brisk business with an overwhelmingly Muslim clientele.  I once asked him about the tea-shop next door.  His reply was to shrug his shoulders and say, "between them and Allah".  But same question to you: how to the sled-necks in the Matsu react to those "socially different"?  We got an eyeful of that when Amy Dumbitchsky initiated a hate-campaign against an African-American Muslim neighbor.  Another embarrassing black eye for Alaska.  As if Palin and Young weren't enough.
Yes, Fox News made the same claim and was forced to make this 2015 apology:   "A correction now: Over the course of this last week we have made some regrettable errors on air regarding the Muslim population in Europe, particularly with regard to England and France. Now, this applies especially to discussions of so-called ‘no-go zones,’ areas where non-Muslims allegedly aren’t allowed in and police supposedly won’t go.   "To be clear, there is no formal designation of these zones in either country and no credible information to support the assertion there are specific areas in these countries that exclude individuals based solely on their religion.   "There are certainly areas of high crime in Europe as there are in the United States and other countries — where police and visitors enter with caution. We deeply regret the errors and apologize to any and all who may have taken offense, including the people of France and England."
You do realise that the Nobel committee is a Northern European organisation, run overwhelmingly by practicing Christians? Nobel himself was a devout Lutheran. Over 80% of Nobel winners are Christian and most of the Jewish winners were secular. Muslim winners are mostly from this century - hardly surprising when you know the roots of the Nobel organisation.
Hey, isn't that Trudeau on the billboard, right upper corner? Oh right, he has a Dutch doppelganger...but not as fit. . Other than that, nothing out of the ordinary... just a Muslim woman on a bicycle, passing by a windmill - the first thing that comes to mind when you thing of the Netherlands. . Why stereotype with an image of a  tulip, or a wooden shoe...
The only troll is Amira herself, trolling for Islam and for western civilization's submission to the Koran. Her hijab is the sign she handed her fate to Allah. Giving up free will is just one thing Muslims ar expected to sacrifice for their religion.  5th posting
Boy, it sure looks like certain refugees and immigrants, mostly uppity muslims, are creating a real $ hit storm in Canada, especially in the Toronto area and within the school boards. They certainly are not assimilating into Canadian society very peacefully, are they? Should we tolerate their demands or drum them out of town? And how does any of this bad behavior actually benefit Canada?   I was under the impression that religion was something that was supposed to be practised at the home and place of worship. Why is religion still being allowed in public circles? It's a private matter, not one for the public to be exposed to.  This IS a direct result of the same can of worms that Bill Davis opened up in 1968 and these problems can be directly linked to his decision. Promotion of a separate catholic school board. WORST decision EVER!! It simply opened the flood gates. Just look at the $ hit it has caused. Shame on you Bill Davis, where-ever you are, you are the master of this disaster.
Regarding: "It acknowledged that the bishops "strongly disagree" with the ban on refugees from several Muslim countries." - The article makes several good points. - What will truly be telling is for each bishop in each local church to make a clear statement about Trump's anti-life moves and to list the diocesan agencies and parishes that are acting for the immigrant. - Bringing this information into a mega-list will be more telling than any statement from an outfit, USCCB, that has proven itself to be more lobby group.
M-103 was put forward before the cowardly attack in Quebec. The attack in Quebec was a disgusting attack on Canada, specifically the freedom to practice religion in peace without persecution. M-103 is about shutting down any debate or critical analysis of Islam under the guise of fighting "Islamaphobia". First of all, the Charter protects Canadians against religious persecution; secondly, why do the liberals explicitly mention "Islamaphobia" and not anti-semitism? Acts of anti-semitism are more common in Canada. The Liberals are pushing a narrative that Islam deserves more "sensitivity" than other religions under some misguided progressive double standard. No religion is beyond reproach in liberal secular societies.
Actually, we have a long tradition of not establishing a forced national religion. And that includes not promoting any religion in a secular government and it's funded entities. We sometimes fail. But there is nothing that says that the personal religious leanings of a Catholic or a Muslim or a Buddhist should preempt them from serving publicly. There is so much hypocrisy here on both "sides". Dems have zero issues with known secular ideologues being on the bench, and Repubs would be asking the same questions of a Muslim candidate, you just know it. And be VERY careful about taxing churches- that whole "separation" concept goes both ways, and "No Taxation Without Representation". Do we want true religious parties being able to legislate? I don't. No, Dems are out of line on this questioning, they just want their OWN pulpit and biases to rule the day. I would say the same about Repubs and Muslims. And we could talk about this globalist pope all day. The left is OK with that. Politics.
"ElChapo" was definitely her hero. Americas drug/mental health/crime and subsequent violence has absolutely nothing to do with Muslims. Much of it, is straight imported "friends down south" now invaded, what used to be America.
Why, we need to stop out people from dying in the streets and start to feed the poor already hear before we spend any of our treasury propping up the US and hence Trump. I am sure a very large percent of the referees are caused by the Muslim civil war and are probably muslins so I think they will be happier in a Muslim country and we all know the Arab and Persian tribe leaders have sell lots of oil and have lots of money, I think Saudi Arabia, maybe Iran should lead the global response, not Canada.
There should be no travel ban, but a very stringent vetting process to ensure immigrants applying for entry to the U.S. don't have ties to Islamic terrorists, or share their ideology.
What do Iceland, Japan and Panama have in common? Few to no mosques and little to no incidences of Islamic terrorism. Do the math.
Why should her "opinion" affect women's healthcare? Funny how conservative men are okay with anti-choice, but then rail against Muslim control over women. Same thing, bro.
"There are over 4 billion Muslims in the world today."   No, there are about 1.6 billion Muslims in the world today, about 23% of Earth's human population. In fact, they do rise up against terrorists. 99% of Muslims live in peace with their neighbors, similar to citizens of the United States.  Not only are they "able" to speak out against terrorism, they "do" speak out against terrorism, and condemn it. So do the vast majority of their Imams, their spiritual leaders.  This is an ignorant and bigoted letter from start to finish. No wonder American Muslims are uneasy, with people like the author of this letter unjustly attacking them.
The verse above,  Qur'an Sura 9:39, is in direct conflict with Canadian values.   Support  moderate reformist Muslims such as  Imam Tawhidi and  Canadian Muslim  Raheel Raza, along with Ayaan Hirsi Ali in their efforts towards the peaceful reformation of Islam.
A country has no right to decide how its citizens are allowed to practise their religion and worship their God. Although face coverings can be used to represent oppression of women in some places they are also freely and gladly worn by many women as a way to show their dedication to their God. The practise of women covering their faces has and still is a wildly accepted norm. Would you ban a Christain nun from wearing their traditional wear? It's scary for me to see the world turning against each other for such meaningless things like this. I have many Canadian friends who want to wear their own hijab or other covering but have chosen not to not based on their own beliefs but in order to try and avoid the ridicule that comes with wearing any sort of facial coverings. It's time to be honest with ourselves and realise that bans in facial coverings are not "bans on masks" but rather a ban of the Muslim religion and its traditions.
I agree, this is something that should be discussed more openly and honestly, they live here but seem to not want anything to do with us. What is their honest opinion about Christians, you hear a lot of stories but what is the truth?In one headline i read about the terrible scene at a Toronto school board office and then another about thousands of Muslims rioting in Jakarta because an elected leader was Christian. I think a vast majority of Canadians want to know how those entering Canada truly feel, their leaders(Muslim) are saying nothing!
Last I looked it was Christians demanding the end of Halloween as a pagan or Satanist celebration. Christmas and Easter are legal holidays. No school then. And if you want to pray at school, go ahead and ask for a room. You'll be accommodated. Just don't ask for the Lord's Prayer to be broadcast over the PA while everyone is told to stand.  No one is asking you to attend Muslim prayer. No one is asking for Eid to be made a legal holiday. If you're envious that others have holidays when you don't, get over it. You are not the centre of the universe.
I'm only going to link to this which I easily found from a Google search:  http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/statements/  There are more lists if you choose to Google it yourself. Not to mention the number of in-depth articles deconstructing his falsehoods and misleading statements.  But just recently since he was elected off the top of my head: Lying about the size of his inauguration crowd. Lying about crime rates across the country. Lying about millions of illegal immigrants voting for Clinton. Lying about reporting coverage of terrorist attacks (not to mention leaving attacks against Muslims out of his list which easily outnumbers the amount of terror attacks against non-Muslims).  You could count him saying the ban isn't a 'Muslim ban' a lie because he said he would do as much during the campaign, and you have this: https://youtu.be/aGOwEOTYfuE?t=175 Which I'll remind you is blatantly unconstitutional. His second statement about imposed danger is baseless.
Richard, In 1996, the Palestinian Authority banned the sale of Arab and Muslim property to Jews.  The Palestinian Authority announced it would enforce the law in 1997. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_Palestinian_territories  Regarding:  "What defines apartheid is when a MINORITY group, backed by the power of the state and its laws, systematically disadvantage a group that would otherwise hold a democratic majority"  Palestinians are not the majority in Israel.  Israel is not the government of Palestine, it is a foreign occupier.  And it will remain so until the Palestinian leadership agree to keep the area demilitarized.  Have a look at the security plan suggested by U.S. General John Allen.  Hope you have a nice day, Cheers
Not to mention the Criminal Code (see Sections 318 and 319 regarding the foundation beliefs of Islam).
I personally know and work with Muslims. None of them cover their faces.
Since Globe comments are restricted in length, let me just address one of your claims, Mathias.  Section 714.1 of the Criminal Code is the section providing the possibility of giving evidence by video links, etc.  Nothing in it restricts it to sexual assault cases.    A quick search reveals it has been used for some trials, including trials, impaired driving charges, and acharge of providing false material information to an insurer.  I found reference to it being used in one sexual assault case in the arctic, but it had not been followed in other cases.  Maybe you know another one that wasn't reported?  It seems unlikely, given the recent decision that a muslim witness could wear a niqab while giving evidence in some types of cases, but not in the sexual assault case where she was a complainant.  I think you can lower your anxiety level about the criminal burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt being removed for trials of sexual assault.
If those three young men had been Muslims shouting "Death to Jews Death to Israel" nothing would be said, printed or done.  As happened in Calgary, leftists defend it as constitutional free speech and nobody says anything about it
It's imperative that all Canadians both Muslim and non-Muslim read this book concerning Islamic reform:  "Heretic  Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now by Ayaan Hirsi Ali"  Go to your local library and borrow it.   It's not a book about bigotry, its a book that dissects Islam explaining why its the way it is and how it must go through a reformation.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali makes a powerful case that a religious Reformation is the only way to end the terrorism, sectarian warfare, and repression of women and minorities that each year claim thousands of lives throughout the Muslim world. With bracing candor, the brilliant, charismatic, and uncompromising author of the bestselling Infidel and Nomad argues that it is foolish to insist, as our leaders habitually do, that the violent acts of Islamic extremists can be divorced from the religious doctrine that inspires them. Instead we must confront the fact that they are driven by a political ideology embedded in Islam itself.  Fed. MP's must read it.
Therefore stressing my typing "Israel" seems much ado about nothing.  Seriously (and without rancor).  (1) OK. (2) I will only speak for myself: whomever sincerely declares "Laa illaha il Allah, Muhammadar Rasuulullah [there is no God but THE God" (of Abraham) "and Muhammad is His Messenger]" is my countryman, until by word or deed they indicate they don't wish to be.  I've never hidden being Shi'a and have always gotten along with my Sunni brethren in Anchorage.  Beyond that I'm unwilling to discuss the local Muslim community with you. (3) The Zionist entity, Egypt and Turkey are probably the only mid-eastern states that tolerate public drunkenness.  Your point?  As for the Baha'i, they got in trouble with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary government for having sided with the Shah.  Understandable.  Shah Pah'lavi via his murderous Savak secret police murdered 1.3 million Iranians during his 26 year, US-sponsored reign of terror.  Actions (and alliances) have consequences.  Next question.
Yep, there's crime all over the world.  What I said at the beginning and will say again is that saying "France has 150 no go zones where sharia is the law of the land and islam controls all things except the welfare cheques"  is a contemptible lie.
The equivalence between 'anti-Semitism' and 'Islamophobia' is very rough indeed.   Pseudo-scientific theories concerning race, civilization, and "progress" were widespread in 19th C Europe. The terms  'anti-Semitism' was coined as the name of racial doctrine whose aim was the derogation of  Jews as a race; in other words, self-described anti-Semites professed hostility towards Jews for racial reasons not on grounds of religious prejudice. The proponents of this doctrine used 'Jewish' and 'Semitic' interchangeably.   I agree with P. Galt that the term is a misnomer, but not for the reason he gives. There are indeed lots of Semitic languages, and one might speak of Semitic peoples as those who speak such languages. But the idea that there is a Semitic race, of any kind, strikes me as preposterous. (There are lots of Indo-European languages, but speakers of those languages do not constitute a race.)
If the US had no immigration and decided it wanted to start a program, what would recommend Muslim countries as a desirable source for immigrants?
I've read the quote CEO and successful presidential candidate Mr. Trump said about the Muslim speakers at the democratic convention and then heard the quote on TV.  Maybe I'm missing something here, but he did not appear to say anything offensive toward the fallen american soldier who is a hero, and Trump referred to him as a hero.  He was just asking a reasonable question about the silence of the mother of the soldier, knowing that the Islamic religion forbids women to speak, and that the subjugation of women is something the militant Islamics wish to impose on america's women.   It is religious legalism, which is the foundation of Islam, that has no empathy towards women.   I could also see Mr. Trump's genuine empathy when responding to their own attacks  Only when pressed to do so did the muslim parents denounce terrorism.  They are mistaken.  Religion can produce the same denial as alcoholism:  80 million muslims support radical Islam because their core beliefs support it.
Timothy McVeigh wasn't a Muslim.
Canada has no values outside of maple syrup,Mounties,Bettman bully boy hockey and other cliches.The shiny pony entourage would have you believe selling out to Communist China and radical Islam is a Canadian 'value'. Unfortunately, the current boy wonder has all the 'charm' of the Hillary, the bag lady, and her 'Democrat 'cohort of pointy hat and parked broomsticks south of the border. Tragic, that as Canada's 150 birthday unfolds everything of true value is ignored,sold out,or rehashed as tired old cliches.
Yes, work on elimination all deaths caused by Muslims while they turn a blind eye to the tens of thousands of deaths caused by gun violence.
Amazing. Candidate Trump promised to ban Muslims and now President Trump swears up and down this isn't a Muslim ban while Mr. Jenkins squints his eyes hard to see this as Trump keeping his promise. The fact is the  promise was not kept yet through the magic  of  "alternative facts" it was.........
A well written article which I feel is an accurate opinion.   I would like to point out that the MSM media including the Globe report murderous acts and the murderers differently depending on whether they are Muslims or others sympathetic to Muslims  killing non-Muslims  or secular Canadians killing Muslims.      The Quebecois  killer they refer to here as  " a deranged loner ".   The attacker  of Parliament Hill was equally a loner and deranged but the MSM and the Globe refused to consider him such.   Only the NDP asserted that that was the case.  He was universally labeled a terrorist.  Perhaps I missed it with the Quebec attack but I have not seen the Mosque attack labeled as terrorism, which , had it been a Muslim attacking a church or Synagogue , it certainly would have been .
So funny how many commenters on this article seem to think Trump's ill-conceived, ill-planned and ill-fated executive order was somehow an improvement on the present immigration situation.  Countless American companies that employ workers from the Islamic 7 were suddenly without any of their expertise, knowledge and work-product.  So much for making America rich again!  Details are now spilling out about Trump's failure to consult any of the hearalded leaders and experts he was supposedly going to bring to the table to help make America great again.  Instead he used sycophantic interns to draft the order behind the backs of the very people he nominated and agreed to work with! Oh well!  Soon enough he'll try to seed his authority to his Moscow-based puppet master and we may not have a nation to ban immigrants from, lol!
Uhuh.  Bannon will make it A. even more impossible than it is now for Muslims to come here on visas or as refugees, which will mean an actual "ban" even if it isn't technically a ban and B. the complete "ban" will likely be extended beyond the 90 Day window.  Bannon wanted to block green card holders from this country, which suggests motives other than terrorism are at play.  (Hint the correct word for the Muslim Ban's motive begins with the letter b.)
No, Mr. Trump is not diverse. A single individual can't be diverse. Diversity is about collections or groups of people, the more diverse when they include more genders, types, backgrounds, ages, etc., and the less diverse when they are more uniform in the same factors.   And I'll help you out with why the "honor diversity" crowd doesn't like Trump. I honor diversity and I really object to what Mr. Trump has said in public about Mexicans, Muslims, women, blacks, handicapped, and so on. I don't hate him, but I do seriously object to his candidacy for president of this country. I can't speak for others.   Furthermore, hating an individual can't be bigotry. Bigotry is about hating groups and collections of people for their characteristics, gender, background, color, religion, preferences, age, etc. Disliking a person, even hating that person, for what he or she says, believes, or does, rather than that person's classification, is not bigotry.
I'll bet their son would have agreed with Trump to keep the muslim terrorists out of the country,  I bet he'd rather have fought the terrorists over there than over here......And I bet he would have agreed with Trump that muslim refugees and need to be cleared BEFORE they enter the U.S.  Their son died in 2004 in Iraq, and I bet he wouldn't have liked Clinton exploiting his name and his parents that way.
Your other reasons were irrelevant. The public school system isn't a secular system. It's an All Inclusive system. Anyone with a religious need can be accommodated. Most Christian and Jewish holidays are already taken care of. Offering space for Muslim children to pray briefly on a Friday afternoon is no burden on the system. It disturbs no other students. It's you who has to come up with some reason why accommodation is a burden to the state. And saying that safety is a concern is ludicrous as it's the haters who are creating the threat.
Nope.   - Is it not that you have no cause nor reason to brand my post  ---- (But the New York Times is not immune to publishing "fake news" or "fake narrative" or "False Narrative because of 3 links that used the words "fake news", "fake narrative" and "false narrative")---- as "juvenile"? - Is it not that the source of 3 words I used - "fake news, fake narrative, and false narrative" came from the 3 links (** http://theduran.com/new-york-times-forced-to-admit-17-us-intelligence-agencies-narrative-is-fake-news/  **https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2017/02/02/first-fake-news-now-fake-narrative-new-york-times-misrepresents-centers-views-on-islam-muslims/ ** http://wallstreetonparade.com/2017/03/preet-bharara-new-york-times-promotes-a-false-narrative/) - So, LesterP, you believe I am Mexican is it not?  Is it not that that is the reason why you insulted me by branding my post as "juvenile", is it not? -
You're quite right, person of Middle Eastern "appearance" or Muslim religion are being profiled....as are Latinos.  Black Lives Matter was formed in the Black community in reaction to police killings of Black citizens.  It's not surprising that it focuses on the Black community.  I don't "ignore" what has happened to other minories....not hardly.  However, I certainly understand why Black communities concentrate on police/citizen violence in Black communities.  Gary Crum
Because that would be factually inaccurate. The Green's in Austria are an open and progressive party. It is hard to get farther than that from being 'Pro Islamic.' You should look at their actual policies.
So Mr. Nenshi serves as a precedent to electing a Sikh leader of the federal NDP. Nenshi was pretty popular, as Gary says, in spite of the level of phobia about Muslims.  There's no rule that regious minorities can't do well as political leaders.
I agree with the sentiments expressed in most of the comments. Most immigrants to the west immigrate because of better economic opportunities, higher standard of living, taxpayer funded social benefits and freedom from oppression. Yet Muslim communities seem ignorant to the fact that what underpin all of these benefits is the Western liberal tradition. Muslim communities seem to shun this liberal tradition and wish for its stifling, sharia based view of the world to enjoy recognition if not dominance. I acknowledge that my statements are generalised and subjective, but it is unfortunately the impression created by the treatment of women and the constant hateful bile directed at Jewish people and Gay people by the bulk of the Muslim community. I continue to find it puzzling that "progressives" like the author continue to support the Muslim cause, while most Muslims reject social progressive views on issues like the rights of women and the LGBT community, secularism and the death penalty
I am not a Trump fan: he is a buffoon.   But it is the West that is leaving the USA and abandoning Western values: C-16, Islamophiliac Trudeau, insane Merkel, Sweden becoming Muslim, etc... etc....    We are no longer standing for the values and principles that made us great. We are consumed by guilt and uncertainty.  The Americans, despite all their misgivings, are still standing for Western values of liberty and free speech.   We are disappearing.
I respectfully disagree.  I work with many individuals that are Muslim and are not impacted by this executive order.  If you interpret this as banning Muslims, tell us how it prevents all Muslims from entering the US.   If ANY...  If they are coming here from one of those countries, if you are ANY religion from one of these countries, you are impacted.   Tell the truth and stop trying to brainwash your readers...
Trudeau stood up for Muslims and others during the election when xenophobia was being exploited and encouraged by politicians.  Mulcair , who was courting the nationalist vote in Quebec at the time, said nothing other than taking cheap shots at Trudeau .  Mulcair loves to grandstand when there is no  political cost to him..
Amira is herself a troll for Islam, and promotes Canada's   submission to Islam.  "Islam" means submission and she will not will be happy with anything  less than the shahada oath said by every Canadians every day.  She is against your right to say "No" to Islam. She hates trolls because trolls  resist Islam. and that is what they call Islamophobia. To end Islamophobia requires the end of resistance.  Trolls and infidels exercising free speech are the same thing to Islamic supremacists  like herself.
You have to love it that all of you repubs are missing a key factor in this story...  Saipov was "radicalized domestically" in the US, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday morning. "The evidence shows -- and again, it's only several hours, and the investigation is ongoing -- but that after he came to the United States is when he started to become informed about ISIS and radical Islamic tactics," Cuomo said.  http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/01/us/new-york-attack/index.html
The protests in relation to the prayer services are certainly not spontaneous and are sponsored by a larger power that be.  The paradox is that the West is attacking muslim countries under some ostensibly pretext, to create refugees.  These refugees are then, as opposed to being accommodated temporarily in a neighbouring country, compelled to migrate permanently to the West.  This migration of refugees has to stop.  However, once in Canada they must have full rights to practice their faith. As to the protesters, I say you are misguided dupes, manipulated for nefarious purposes - to perpetuate a narrative of a "clash of civilizatons".
If anyone had any learned articles about the progressive/islam symbiosis that they want to share , it would be interesting to see any possible explanations.
Anyone who sympathizes with ISIS is a threat to national security and should be detained and/or deported. Wahhabi/Salafi fundamentalism is a cancer that needs to be confronted head on without the token politically correct puffery. Every country in the world where Islamist fundamentalism is common (without exception) is highlighted by social regression, misogyny, and violence. Demands for cultural accommodations under the guise religious freedoms has resulted in segregation and societal division - gender equality is not a function of cultural relativism, it is a function of advanced civilizations vs. regressive tribalism.  Political Islam (or Islamism) is a scourge to progress, it is fundamentally incompatible with advanced secular societies, not because it is different but because it is hostile to western freedoms (expression, gender, sexual orientation, association, etc)  - Erdogan has demonstrated as much over the last 8 years in Turkey with the Islamist AKP.
I am so glad this is over, but I can't help thinking of how differently this would have unfolded if the occupiers were African American men with guns, or Muslim men with guns or anarchists with piercings and guns....  The white male privilege combined with their careful use of words to frame what they were doing as patriotic, let them have sympathy from the press and determined patience from the FBI.  Thank goodness their fantasies about being able to leave without being arrested were not allowed to come true.  This is a country of laws and the laws should be applied equally to all.
Good article - but: "...The Manchester Arena bomber may be an anomaly in many ways,.."  I will suggest he is not an anomaly but representative of Islamic culture.  My experience as a teen age immigrant - your family's culture emigrates with you and all immigrants seek to live in association and/or near others of similar experience. Thus we have " Little Italy ", " China Town ", Germans, Ukrainians, Swedes ... living together and trying to maintain their culture, language, food .... religion, staying within their confort zone.   Religion does play a significant part ... and it is a question of what the religion values. Eastern beliefs tend to be philosophical, less theocratic. Christianity separates Church and State, whereas Islam is specific about the state and Islam being one, under Sharia law. There are of course many sectarian variations - but Islam is an unstable mix of petro-dollars,  madrassa education and Wahabbism by way of an extreme example,   What could possibly go wrong  !
Trump, like most reasonable people, have no problem with Islam, it's those who espoused the radical Islamist ideology where we have an issue.  The RIT already want to kill anyone who gets in their way or don't convert to their radical ideology in the name of religion.   Just look at the atrocities they commit in the name of their religion to their own people and you don't think it is prudent to review the current vetting procedures by putting a PAUSE on letting people from those 7 countries in to the US?  I suggest that you reexamine your position to see if there is another way to approach immigration that would be different from the broken system we currently to one that everyone can live with.  Just a suggestion.
Iraq didn't even exist 100 years ago. Non-muslim Ottomans were there...
Trump wants something from Saudi Arabia just as we want something from them. Trump is not going to insult people he is trying to get something from. Look at Presidents Bush and Obama-- they did the same thing-- both took a respectful view and Bush did this right after 9-11. Our military treats Muslims with respect and does not refer to "radical Islamic terrorists"-- that is what Generals Mattis and McMaster have been trying to get Trump to stop even before this trip. Saudi Arabia is home to Wahhabism a radical from of Islam and so calling them radical islamic terrorists would be wrong and insulting.
You forgot the Muslims!
One million is hyperbolic. Historians, Algerian and French, estimate the losses in human lives to be around 300,000 Algerians; made of FLN combatants and civilians. 300,000 Algerians died to free Algeria from French occupation, not a trivial number.   On the other hand why constantly remind people of people, in your posting it was Muslims, killed by Westerners. Throwing arguments like this can be interpreted as justification of terrorism perpetrated by Islamists against Westerners.  For many years Westerners were on the receiving ends, invasion of Spain and Portugal, pirates from the Barbary Coast terrorizing the coasts of Spain, Italy and France, Ottomans subjugating eastern Europe and the Balkans, Greece under Turkish occupation for 400 years.   How do you explain, despite the cruel war for Algerian independence, there are now some two or three million French Algerians, the descendants of people who left Algeria, before and after independence, to settle in France?
Remind me again why Muslim countries are banning Muslim immigrants. Is it because they are Hitler?
not really, fact is atheist dont reproduce and radical muslims, Jews, Hindus  and christians do. More religious u are the more u reproduce just look at Israeli and Saudi Arabia compared to secular non religious Denmark............
"Harun Khan, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, condemned the attacks in his home city in the strongest terms. "That this should happen in this month of Ramadan, when many Muslims were praying and fasting only goes to show that these people respect neither life nor faith," he said."  Thank you, NCR, for reporting on those Muslims who oppose violence.  Too often the only Muslims we hear about in the mainstream media are the violent fringe elements.
"Then came last weekend."  To the untrained eye he seems to be referring to the largest mass murder of Muslims in North American history  that occurred in his country 48 hours earlier. The writer keeps us in suspense for only a short while as he reveals his real upset is the U.S. border policy review.  Realizing that he must acknowledge the Quebec tragedy at the risk of appearing to be a super-hypocrite,   Linwood leads us to a dark place where the mention of the horror at the hands of the deranged Canadian is blamed on Donald Trump.   Overall I would have liked to have read more about some of his past  experiences in Arizona but as far as this contribution to the G&M is concerned, for the sheer ridiculousness of it, I give it 2 thumbs up.  Linwood has another career waiting for him as a straight man in a comedy duo.
You don't know why the Khans spoke at the DNC? You haven't heard of all the anti-Muslim rhetoric of trump? They were there defending their family, their faith and their right to be treated like the citizens they are. What I wonder is why trump put the poor women who lost her son in Benghazi on the stage. It was terribly sad to watch her.
Why exactly do Muslims need to accept criticism of the Prophet to be viewed favorably by you?  Do you think no other religion/culture is intolerant?  Do Jewish people accept criticism of their religion, or more importantly, any negative commentary regarding the holocaust?  Of course not.  And yet your double standards don't seem to apply to that.
Actually MacDonald makes no such claim. He says that Bissonette was "Probably a Christian, judging from his name." and that Canadian mass murderers are "usually white and Christian". Both of these points are in regards to claims that the attack was Muslim on Muslim violence and that an immigration ban would be effective at stopping this.  Seriously sky, you've made a few valid points in other posts but try actually reading the material you reference for a change..
Funny how comments are closed when a Quebec Muslim man  accused of wounding a police officer while shouting the Islamic phase “Allahu Akbar” (God is great) in an airport in Flint, Mich., Are his actions a hate crime? If so no mention of that.  Should the Globe's journalistic standards not allow comments if on the Michigan story if they allow them on this one? https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-premier-couillard-in-change-of-tone-ties-michigan-attack-to-islam/article35441387/
Tulsi is  a strong supporter of India's PM Modi, who is a Hindu nationalist (with distressing human rights violations in India as a consequence). She spoke at an event for Adelson,  the radical right Jewish casino magnate who rejects a two-state solution, and who promised to raise $100 million for Trump.  http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/las-vegas-billionaire-sheldon-adelson-pledges-100m-for-trump-presidential-campaign/2016/05/15/  Her outrage at Phillipinos being typecast as terrorists does not extend to other countries with Muslim populations who have been similarly vilified by irresponsible politicians, of whom she is one.   Her record on support of common sense gun control laws is zero.  Tulsi's penchant and skill for self-promotion (and her sizable war chest) make this race a long-shot -- mahalo to Shay Chan Hodges for at least jarring some of our starry-eyed collective approbation of an ideological candidate far right of her democratic garb.
Although the Freedom Report is described in this article as an "online publication" it would be more accurate to describe it as an online hate site, with an endless collection of diatribes about Muslims. Oh yes, and a weird attack on a garage door company... Proof that any angry person can set up a website.
Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Immigration has already stated categorically that he will not open Canada's doors to Christians. That would be religion faith based immigration policy and against our secular moral standards. He said just a couple of weeks ago that Christians don't face the same dangers as other legitimate refugees. He will however welcome all Muslims fleeing Trump's persecution in the US.
Trump’s executive order is an egregious assault on peace, harmony, equality, and the US Constitution because that is the first step he is taking toward attaining his promise of banning all Muslims from entering the US.  Individuals and should do what is within their power to oppose the executive order -- and they are.    Thousands protested across the nation.  Apple, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter, and 90 other companies filed a court motion declaring that Trump’s executive order violates the immigration laws and the Constitution.  Hawaii AG Doug Chin has joined 17 other state AGs to oppose Trump’s executive order, and the State of Hawaii has filed a lawsuit seeking to block the implementation of the executive order.
Um, doesn't work that way.  If it did, then it'd be one religion.  There are differences in their definition of their "god".  And, there sure as heck wouldn't be wars between them because of their belief (e.g., Muslims and Christians or Muslims and Judaists).
The letter received by the family states that their son was killed in "Raqqa." This seems unlikely as Raqqa is the headquarters of Islamic State, and a fair distance from the front line.
The answer you get would depend on which Muslim scholar you asked. The same applies to Christians; the answer you get on contentious points of theology depends on which theologian you ask, and which sect he adheres to.
Okay, with your theory, Trump's presidency should be annulled because some voters were driven by "anti-muslim prejudice".
The same State Dept that couldn't find a way to rescue a few Americans at Benghazi, now says it will rescue 200,000 Muslims.  That ain't right.
According to the article: "Cemeteries, local resident Sunny Létourneau said as she went door-to-door collecting signatures to force the public vote, are a reflection of society as a whole. Ms. Létourneau insisted neither she nor others opposed to the new cemetery were motivated by anti-Muslim animus."  To assess her comment, these two facts:  1. Ms Létourneau was a member of the anti-muslim group La Meute (the Wolf Pack). (confirmed by La Meute itself)  2. She was also the spokesperson for the  local Comité de l’alternative citoyenne (the 'no' committee), although not eligible to vote.
The usual apologists get right at their job every time innocents are slaughtered by Jihadists.   Like clockwork, the story about murdering Islamists is gone off the front page after just one day.
In a world full of crazy religious notions, this one seems minor. The Holy Lands. Really? Mecca, sacred to Muslims, off limits to non-Muslims? Mount Kailas in Tibet? A few days ago, Australia declared Uluru, formerly Ayers Rock, off limits to climbers because certain natives consider it sacred. But, good on our Supreme Court. It is usually not that sensible.
I need and answer from Muslim's ? In my lifetime at age 56 I've met numerous individuals of the Islamic faith in everyday life.  I've never had a negative experience with them and can guarantee none were terrorists .  Of the million of Muslims around the world and North America a percentage ( not sure what that number is ) are considered to be terrorists.  Question : Why do I not see Muslims gathering in millions to protest against these group of people that are giving their religion a bad name ?? Wouldn't that be an opportunity especially with whats going on in the world today to uphold the fact that the majority of Muslims are in fact good and decent people . You see them protesting when they are discriminated against which is rightfully so but would they send a stronger message to the world by outright condemning Islamic terrorists and doing it in crowds of millions or more to show the world that they are in fact in solidarity with the majority of people in the world.
We're talking today. That's what the article is about. You can comment about the past if you want to but I note that you have provided no particulars or details, just a blanket assertion without specifics. Besides, here in Canada and the US and in the West are not concerned with alleged "interventions of the West in the Middle East" insofar as unlike Islam the West does not engage in terrorist acts, i.e. the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians, on a regular basis.
Hey Imaginarary Jesus, you are hilarious. I guess you haven't studied history, Islam occupied Spain, Portugal, Italy for Centuries and several times throughout history it nearly Conquered the Whole of Europe.  Here's a Link to a Video which shows the Aggression from Muslim Nations into Europe for the last 1400 Years.  For those of you who are unaware of real history, this is a must watch.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7y2LRcf4kc
It's ok. The guy wasn't Muslim, so no big deal.
Trump denounced the support. You'll say differently. Tell me when was the last Xtreme Christian terror by the KKK. I think the Gov. have them in check. TODAY we have the Hate of the President of the United States from the Liberals/Democrats, it's a REAL problem even if only talk of the Liberals. It incites violence just as much as ISIS getting into the heads of wannabe Islamic Terrorists, I can't differentiate between the two because of the hate they spew.
Sky You say (not because the US "attacked Muslims", but because some Muslims interpret the world in those terms,) Evidence please. It seems reasonable to expect that if someone attacks me, I would attack back. (it isn't "attacking Muslims", it is attacking certain factions.). Not necessarily from the point of view of the people being attacked  You agree that (it was about retaliation). I have never seen that in the media except when I said it.  So the public are left with the impression that the US was attacked for no reasonable reason.
Why come here if they muslims hate white people so much? Funny how everyone wants to come to White nations though isn't it! I mean Mexico for Mexicans, India for Indians, China for Chinese, Japan for Japanese, ME for Arabs but White Nations for everyone?? Your anti white hatred shows? Why come here if you don't like music, pork, beer seeing women dressed normal, dogs? There is lots of room in the ME for you. Oh I know why they come here, it's for the welfare! I do miss the old days of European migrants who worked their butts off and made this country great! Built this country, defended this country against that dictator you seem to associate us with. You are anti white, please leave you aren't good enough for Canadian values, why don't we let smart hardworking Latino's or Asians in ?
Not one word about where he is from? Is he a citizen of the United States? Or not? We know he's a Muslim, but is he an American Muslim? A previous article said he was 18 and from Somalia and that he had permanent status but was not a citizen. Is that the case?
The Crusades. The attempt to reclaim Christian lands from Islamic invaders. What is your point about Islamic Invasions?
Don't post anything that could be construed as anti Muslim or you will get a < this comment did not meet civility standards >
Dial back?  Sure.  He only used the words "terrorism" or "Islamic terrorism" 31 times (in contrast to Obama's use of terrorism in his beta male speech in Cairo ZERO times).  This article is an example of fake news.
The problem (I think) is the word Islamophobia. The problem is not that there should be a statement condemning anti-Muslim bigotry. I fully support the motion explicitly condemning anti-Muslim bigotry.  Umpteen times in these comments and on discussion threads appearing on my Facebook I have been called Islamophobic for (for example) supporting the kind of full-face veil and burqa ban in public sector employment that many countries have adopted, including Muslim-majority countries.  So, I feel that including the term Islamophobia in M-103 is basically condemning me, and lumping me in with racists, bigots, and anti-Muslim bigots in particular. I resent that.
So listening to this corporate rag reprint they try to scare you, just like screaming terrorist or Muslim.  The fact is it is a movement similar to the Bernie movement here that has been repressed and under reported but was so overwhelming they couldn't cheat it away, although "new" news says they "needed" a larger percentage to turn out to polls, even though for sure in excess of 75% turned out, it is a sham.  It is the powers that be scared sh_tless about the vote.... even Cameron put in resignation..... personally I would be kicking him out to save all the file deletions and shredding so we can prove the depths of collusion with the US.  People are standing up around the world to the empire of the global elite and pushed by their minions, OUR government.  Time to stand up as others are doing and be the strong types we tend to pride ourselves on.... England, France, South America.... US Forced Capitalism is dying and coming unwound.... time to help it.  Educate, SOLIDARITY!
When Harper came into power, he wiped out the Long gun Registry, and wouldn't even give Quebec its portion of it to start a Quebec-only registry.  So now Obama is wiping out the Muslim registry. What's good for the Right is good for the Left.
What's your point? Is it that you want to eliminate the Muslims you fear are endlessly conspiring against you? Can't we make a more general statement about this issue in the abstract without making it about that narrow and specific obsession?
Of course we all know that 50 years ago Lebanon was 80 % Christian, and very safe place to be. The window opened again after the muslin civil war 10 years back.  But today there is leas than 10% christians there who would like to stay but as they get drawn into the muslim civil war it is just not a good place to be. The country has divided itself in a form to have Shia on one side of the road and Sunnie on the other side and it is not clear where her family was, may have been legacy Christian living in the mountains. My only suggestion to this women is Muslims caused all the trouble, will continue and as a Canadian Passport holder I can only trust you have the good sense to stay home. Since my return to Canada a couple years ago ... We DONOT travel to Muslim countries, they are not safe and all Canadians need to get to the same place.
If there wasn't an anti-religion movement in the West, most of the western world would be the same as the Islamic world.   The Islamic world was its apogee when it made fun of its mullahs. It fell when the mullahs took over. The western world went through its dark ages when the priests had massive power (remember Copernicus being executed for discovering the Earth revolves around the sun?). Enlightenment began when the priests lost power.
"People who know history and hate racism and fascism need to prepare by obtaining firearms for personal protection and then need to organize a resistance to Trump's future pogroms against Americans of color, Americans of the Muslim faith, and LGBTQ Americans."  The simple fact is Hillary lost and yet one more piece of evidence of just how unhinged unfounded paranoid hysteria is being spread within the Democrat Party.
The crusade began in 624AD and according to the teachings of islam, it will not stop until this is an islamic planet.  They have wiped out most of the infidels in the ME.    It will be 10 years before Iran has a nuke and they will make good on their promise to wipe Israel off the map. It will be around that same time when they have sufficient numbers in the west to get the crusade in full swing.
This article is very troubling to me, as we know from the Shafia family tragedy  that some young muslim girls in Canada do wish to be free to interact with young men in a more modern western fashion.  Dating boys was exactly why the three Shafia sisters were murdered.  I would have liked to see a more balanced story which also discussed young women who no longer wanted to be bound by ancient traditions while living in a modern society. I found that this account tried to normalize the fact that young muslim women, even in Canada, cannot be trusted to conduct themselves appropriately.
Absolute nonsense.  Where do you get this stuff? Trump has as much to do with White Supremacy  as Obama with radical Islamic terrorists.
I see that this discourse has degenerated into the usual fight.  Not surprising, given our current culture.  As I have said many times before, get used to these events.  It is too late to do anything about it.  While tragedy brings out a sense of community ("they are in our hearts and prayers") it quickly dissipates and we re-establish our steady state--that of individual rights that "trump" those of the community.  If a muslim commits an act of religiously-fueled terror, politicians demand action--registries, bans, etc. But if a crazy white guy kills dozens.... just because he can... we offer our "condolences and prayers." They are silent about bump stocks, assault rifles and large clips.  Silent.  So we will wring our hands, think about "how awful" it is, set-up and contribute to the "go-fund-me" accounts...  and then return to our football games, TV programs and Netflix. Pass the popcorn.  It is too late. It will happen again.  Get used to the world we have made.
Their intent is admirable and reflective of some of the good to be found in any institution.  Unfortunately, this christian institution was founded on mythology and pieced together from the other religions known in the Middle East/Asia by a Pope 300 years after the supposed birth of its namesake.  Combining the new religion with the existing, one god religion of Judaism to eliminate the multiple gods of Roman/Greek religion to simulate the Roman Emperor, one man rule.  All performed at the behest of a Roman Emperor to aid in quelling uprisings within the empire.  The U.S. was formed by deists rejecting christian religion ruling Europe at the time.  Humanity has suffered from the religious dictatorship wielded by tyrants since the establishment of collective societies.  Christian, Islam, Judaism, et. all. their purpose is to for small groups to control the larger groups for the small group dominance.  All of the good works could be done without religion.
No, skyofblue, you called Pence's approach a "personal philosophy". Having been called on it, you now admit it came from his church. It was, in your words, his church's teaching about how society should be organized.  And it's met with almost complete silence from the same people who spend hours criticizing muslims.
Actually, the homicide rate in Christian countries (mainly in USA, Latin America and Africa) is much higher than in Muslim countries. Your chances of being killed are much higher in a Christian country.   I am excluding countries at war.
In terms of mass murder, Christianity scores well above Islam.  As long as you accept that, you can hate Islam all you want. You obviously have the freedom to do that.
‘There are lots of 2nd and 3rd generation Muslims in Canada, as well as converts to the faith whose ancestors came to the country centuries ago.’ This would be less than a significant number. Islam is a newcomer to Canadian society.
Checken separatists ?.....or using other terminology....Muslims.
Just returned from a month in India and that's exactly what's happening there. It's religious identity politics, and the BJP is essentially a fundamentalist Hindu party. One of their other goals is to ban eating meat. On the other hand, Kerala is  a majority Muslim state with a communist government. In Kerala, they'd like to ban alcohol.
If they don't like going to university-leave. Maybe Ms Kahn should go to a muslim nation where she can feel at home.
LOL@Alceste - are you actually thinking you can prove that a person's reasoning for voting against the re-zoning is because it was based on 'anti-muslim reason'  and not simply 'anti-cemetery reason'  Didn't they make a Tom Cruise movie about that very thing?
Boo hoo.  Cry me a river.  For every 'anti-Christian' comment there are ten anti-Muslim ones.
Stick to your original script - ISIS came "to the for front after Obama got us out of Iraq".  Wrong on both points.  Want to try again?  Then you claim Obama is a Muslim sympathizer.  Wrong again.  So please, don't try changing the subject.  ISIS formed in areas of Iraq that were devoid of Iraqi military in 2006.  I assume you are familiar with the 9/11 Report?  What did it say about al Qaeda presence in Iraq prior to 2003?  Go back to the history books, not Breitbart or Rush, and find out what really happened in the Middle East.  Dang, my grand niece and nephew are two up on a conservative.
Hello Margaret :  Media may agree that Kevin O"Leary is appalling but  the very fact that  "most of the time he lives in Boston" might be what gives him a perspective which has been eluding us crazy canucks!  He sounded politically sagacious on NewsTalk 1010 yesterday, with a wry humour (depth of character).  While we have been in a tizzy over Black Lives Matter, for instance, he would immediately view them for what they essentially are; that is, offshoots of the extreme Islamic Fundamentalist Black Power Movement that had terrorized, murdered and robbed their way to notoriety in America.  The BLM are radicalized-criminalized  elements who do the hauling for organized crime networks trafficking  drugs, pederasty, and illegal migrants.  While the authentic Syrian refugees are being isolated in hostels, the BLM are dominating city-blocks in and around the designated high-priority neighbourhoods, such as Jane/Finch corridor.
As usual no truth or facts here. The U.S. "True" budget figures, for example state that Defense spending is 16.2%, while Social Security+ ACA = 53.3% of the budget( and we only spend, as a separate item 4% on Veterans!!). In addition when I was in the USAF, in 1970, we were flying B-52s. We are still flying them...do the math for how old these are(not to mention that against modern military systems they're equivalent to us entering WWII with Bi-planes) and according to some military experts our ballistic missiles are so old we're not sure all of them would fire in time of need. We are sorely in need of Military upgrades in light of radical Islam(Nuclear IRAN) advanced China and Russia.
"We need to talk about Islamophobia, white supremacy and far-right terrorism."  Another day.  Today, "we need to talk about integrating our newcomers and addressing the threat of radical Islam."
When and where was this utopian world you speak of, Mary Schultz. I know people who were asked if they were Catholic or Protestant when they moved into town. Jews were looked on with great suspicion. And, of course, Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims, and Buddhists were to be avoided. It would help if you didn't mention mainstream churches of the UK. And the United Church of Canada was created by a union of Methodist, Congregationalist, and Presbyterian churches. I'd say you led a rather sheltered life.
Wow, read this part of Clinton's speech in today's setting and think about it.  She saw it the whole time.  "I know there are only 60 days left to make our case -- and don't get complacent, don't see the latest outrageous, offensive, inappropriate comment and think, well, he's done this time. We are living in a volatile political environment. You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic -- you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people -- now 11 million. He tweets and retweets their offensive hateful mean-spirited rhetoric. Now, some of those folks -- they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America."
My daughter received an email with a video attachment. She forwarded it to me and asked if I'd care to comment. The video came from a hate site and featured a very attractive young woman staring directly at the camera who spent 11 minutes in hate and scare mongering about Muslims. The video ended with her declaring that Europe was being invaded and that the invasion of Europe was part of a Muslim conspiracy to take over the world. "I just want people to wake up! What will you tell your grandchildren when Europe is an Islamic state? That at least you weren't called a racist?"  I checked the origin of the hate site and found it was an extreme right wing site dedicated to spreading fear and hatred against Muslims. All the claims made by the young woman found their origins in many other hate sites.  This is dangerous. Islamophobes are circulating these hate sites among themselves; their hatred is being validated and fueled by false claims. Thus the shooting in Quebec, the loud rallies.
The only troll is Amira herself, trolling for Islam and for western civilization's submission to the Koran. Her hijab is the sign she handed her fate to Allah. Giving up free will is just one thing Muslims ar expected to sacrifice for their religion. 9
Of course, any acts of violence must be condemned but one can understand the outrage.  Christians' Christmas and the Lord's prayer are banished from schools.  Muslims are given prayer rooms.  Give your heads a shake Trustees.  On second thought, don't.  The rattling will be too loud.
" lack of evidence justifying the ban" ?? Have you been to Cologne Germany for New Years ?? Have you been to the Muslim quarters in Paris ?? Charlie Hedbo  ???
I have great sympathy for ANY CIVILIAN human being who is suffering through war and hunger on a daily basis; for those whose children are being traumatized by bombs falling all around them, through no fault of their own.  Offering such people 'refuge' is the RIGHT thing to do.    However, having said that, I have experienced some very alienating/troubling behavior from a number of Muslim Immigrants who have moved  into my neighborhood.  They seem to have little, or NO respect for us Canadians; nor do they have respect for our way of life.  Many REFUSE to integrate; and, actually ACTIVELY REJECT our societal rules & laws ... even DEMANDING that we accommodate their Islamic rules for 'Prayer Rooms' EVERYWHERE.  Some even seem to be VERY UNSATISFIED with, and even outright UNGRATEFUL for  the housing  they've been provided -- AT OUR EXPENSE!  I constantly hear how much they want to OWN THEIR OWN HOMES.  I've struggled my whole life, and I STILL CAN'T AFFORD A HOME OF MY OWN!
And there would be some merit to that belief if all Nazis claimed to be acting in the name and spirit of Germany, and the German "code" encouraged Nazism, and ordinary Germans did not strongly and publicly disavow them.  Jihadists --- terrorists --- almost always act in the name of Islam, are encouraged by Sharia law, and ordinary Muslims do not strongly and publicly disavow them.  Have you ever seen a Muslim protest on the scale of, say, a BLM march, against Islamic terrorism?  Why should we not believe that when push comes to shove, the believers in Sharia will not side with the jihadists?  And terrorism IS the point at which push comes to shove.
Well, the Christians  spent almost 500 years in the Crusades against the Muslims,  and it wasn't until after that that Martin Luther started questioning the Catholic Church.    The "protestants'  have split so many times since then that there are too many little groups to have a good war.  Of course, the Jews have always been a good target for all unhappy 'Christians' but they are alos too dispersed to make a good war.  And socio-political movements like those in Northern Ireland have always liked to hang their desire for power on a religious hook.  I believe that is also part of the actual meaning of the Sunni-Shi'a conflicts over the centuries including the present day.
If someone repeatedly posts notes saying people like me should be wiped out, I'd like to know who it is, so that I can avoid him and inform my friends to do so too. It can be a matter of life and death.   Its not just exposing someone who posted a stupid video of Trump.  Its someone who has repeatedly expressed some pretty vile thoughts, and we have no way of knowing how serious he is about them, or how much they influence others to take action.  Please don't make out its only about the video. Its not.  He also posted pictures of all of CNN's jewish staff, with stars of david.   He demanded extermination of muslims.  He demeaned blacks. This was not merely someone who wasn't nice -- it was someone many of us would avoid in real life, if we knew who he was, and we'd do so for fear of our own safety.
"Because you simply don't get it. If it was you or yours you would be howling like a mad dog but because it was some Muslim kid you think its okay. Well its not."  No you clearly don't get it.  ME & MINE do not enlist our battle ready teenage offspring to journey halfway around the world into a volatile war zone in order to SPECIFICALLY wage an insane holy crusade against Canadian men & women and our US allies.   That my friend is called treason and at the very least should be punishable by deportation.
Islam is a religion, practiced by millions peacefully. Salafism is a dangerous Saudi ideological export, and is behind 99% of these incidents. Notably, that ideology was mostly absent from secular Syria (where Christians and Muslims lived in peace and relative tolerance) before Hillary stuck her nose into the region supporting the Salafi agenda.
Repressing the majority culture is not a healthy way to promote multicuturalism, it is counterproductive.  I would suggest encouraging everyone to celebrate everyone else's fun holidays if invited to do so, instead. I've joined in celebrating Eid here and Holi in India, visited Mosques and Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist and Shinto temples and joined in the appropriate rituals. It did not turn me into a Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist or Shintoist.  As long as no one asks me to fast or self-flagellate or recite proclamations of faith, I'll be glad to join in any celebrations from other cultures. That to me is true celebration of our cultural diversity.  Let the grouches and bigots stay in their own little closed worlds if they wish, but do not let them silence the rest of us.
Now now, not all the best programmers that are Indian are Hindu. There are Christians, Sikhs, and Muslim students at UW/UW alumni that are either immigrants from, or descendants of immigrants from India that can program very well too.
Then you don't know Islam.
The city of Eugene does not hate Trump anymore than the city of Springfield loves him. Have a little perspective. Many in Eugene and in Springfield distrust Trump. Many people thought Obama was a Muslim from Kenya.  As when Obama was elected, there is just a lot of fear based on what Trump has said.
Once a week where everyone can see which girl is on their natural cycle and also girls must pray at the back (ask why). And what about the stigma for liberal muslims who decide they don't have to pray on Friday or cover their hair in order to be pious?
Reporting on the victimization of Muslims is in vogue these days. This heavily biased report ignores the role the Islamists play in this whole drama. Like seasoned violinists, these terrorists are able to manipulate the media and certain politicians to suit their own ends.
This has not been shown to have had anything to do with religion.   Radical islam has as much to do with islam as the KKK has to do with christianity.   Think.
You should check out www.thereligionofpeace.com They keep up to date on all of the attacks in the name of Islam. They also show passages that are used to justify murders in the name of Islam. Muhammed himself beheaded hundreds of people for simply denying the faith. After you do that research, I hope it helps you realize that your neighborhood is filled with people who probably aren't true Muslims or are planting themselves for an attack. Also, another thing to point out is all of your false equivalences.. Timothy mcveigh didn't do the bombing in the name of Christianity, he more or less was doing it as an anti government attack. Compare that to the attacks in Orlando, where he was following the teachings of his religion to kill people for being gay. You do realize that he pledged to ISIS before the attack, right?
In order to define Islamophobia, we must also define "Taqiyya".  Taqiyya is the Islamic practice of deception for the protection and defence of Islam.  Taqiyya translates as " concealment  omission, dissimulation" .  The Ten Commandments tell Christians and Jew they must not "bear false witness" or to lie.  Taqiyya is the Fifth Column of Islam and  tells Muslims they may  tell infidels like us half truths (omission) and  even blame it all on the infidels themselves (concealment) as this writer is doing right now, to defend Islam.   Many westerners have a hard time to accept that such a thing is real.   That's why so much about M103 ( and other Liberal policies) makes Canadians of good-will stop and say "Hey wait a minute ". They can see for themselves the wool is being pulled over their eyes.   She exonerates Islam and M103, and blames non Muslim Canadians  of Islamophobia to defend Islam.
The liberal left in this country will automatically label you a hate monger if you question or challenge anything Muslim.  Muslim's, push the limits of Canada's social fabric and use the left to do their bidding.  There are 1.7 billion Muslim's on planet Earth, it is the fastest growing religion through birth rate in the world, 50 nations have a Muslim majority and there is only one country where Canadian's have say.  I'd like to keep it that way and so should all of you...
Not gonna speak on all appointments but I do think Sarah could fill all the shoes needed to keep us fighting till the next barage of political mailers and ads return to dull any regained sensbiliites.   Put her as the head of Interior and it would make the righties pleased and jazz the left for the next election.   She could eliminate Obamas Muslim refugee issue by granting them a hundred mile swath off of some ranging river north of the Brooks in a take it or leave it offering under a revitalized Homestead act.   Might force a reopening of pebble so the fed haters have enough copper and gold to kiss "just jellin" goodbye.  Pair her with Charles Barkley on a trade mission to Red Korea.  Could write model letters of resignation for the thousands of DCers that are going to get canned anyways for "ethixs" issues.   Take a million illegal gang banging  kids from LA out to Bristol Bay on a "fish for free day" so they wont be swimming in some run down barrio lit by burning US flags.
why don't the so called moderate muslims speak up.......I don't get it.  Their silence puzzles me.
"RCMP accused of racial profiling over ‘interview guide’ targeting Muslim border crossers" . Racial profiling is not an unusual practice in Canada as concluded  last month by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination  of the UN: . "The Committee is concerned at reports that racial profiling by the police, security agencies and border agents continues on a daily basis in the State party, with a harmful impact on indigenous peoples, as well as on ethnic minority Muslims, African-Canadians, and other ethnic minority groups." . If you focused more on Canadian news and less on American news you might have read this in your own news media rather than have a non-Canadian tell you this.
also they believe following in the footsteps of Abraham and Ishmael wrong the children of Abraham and Ishmael were Christian Bedouins, not Muslims who believe in murdering when the Muslim revolution began in the seventh century so there not following in Abraham and Ismael footsteps.
George and Athelene, the negative comments about this vote from the mayors of Saint-Apollinaire and Quebec City, and the premier ministre of Quebec were based on the participation of a far-right anti-muslim group in the campaign - not so much on legal considerations.  That same fact also provides a good argument that this decision violates the Charter of Rights - as Quebec constitutional expert (no quotation marks) Julius Grey says.
Well said!  For once it would be nice to have a gay muslim, in this case the author of this column, stand up and say I am tired of my religion persecuting gays.  BLM is a non-entity, but at least they are not throwing gays of buildings.  Spend your time exposing the homophobia that makes it ok in Islam to throw gay men off of buildings.  You should do a column on that, but I bet you won't.
Skyofblue... Precisely the point!  When people can appreciate the contributions of others, respect grows. If all kids see is Muslims are bad people, Muslims do not fit in, etc. or to "Make American Great Again" they have to ban all Muslims, then that is what will be embedded in their minds. We have to be fair, truthful and inclusive. There are many inventions/contributions that Islam has made to the world. Why is this not reflected in the public school system books, resources?
And yet German Christians were allowed to immigrate freely, before and after the wars where they killed more Canadians than anyone else in history.  My point was that Buddhists weren't treated fairly. Due to their race. I am sure a blonde blue eyed Muslim also gets a lot better treatment at airports. Due to his race.
Erdogan is a power hungry maggot whose explosive unwarranted diatribe is not only distasteful it is libel and as such the EU should start a civil suit ...hard to cry Islamaphobia with 4.5 million muslims securing refuge in an already crowded land base....oh that has enforced laws and relatively little violence. The turkish pundits dreams of returning to the days of the Ottoman empire should be shattered by the right thinking nations of the world ,like an egg shell trodden under foot
AlanSpector has difficulty handling the truth about Israel's atrocities toward the Palestinian people. I would be embarrassed, too, if I was a supporter of Israel. But the issue should be widely discussed because of the misguided support given to ISRAEL by Hawaiis Congressional members. The claim that the US  and Israel are " strong allies"  lacks substance.. The " alliance" consists of the American Gov. Giving billions of dollars and weaponry to ISRAEL, dying in wars for ISRAEL and suffering hostility because of our misguided support of ISRAEL. In return the Israeli Gov. Insults US Prsidents, ignores official requests and policies, steals our technology, often then selling it to others, and regularly spied on our government. ISRAEL was created through a war of violent ethnic cleansing, continues to confiscate still more land belonging to the indigenous Arabs, CHRISTIAN & Muslim. People of Hawaii & AMERICA should be clammering for a cease of this immoral relationship with ISRAEL.
Sorry, Trump calls it a Muslim ban.
Yes, it actually does. By using a vague word for anything anti-Islam it is not at all clear how the M103 will be used, but it will certainly chill discussion and debate about Islam, and may effectively squelch our right to think and speak freely. This may not remove the rights, but it will bring them into question.
Just tell Qatar to call the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals - they will rule in Qatar's favour against this rude Islamophobia by those 4 Arab States!  Oh, wait....
Why doesn't this Radical American Terrorist scare Trump and his Trumpers the way that Radical Islamic Terrorist do...#MAGA
Of course, a law is only  a 'good' one when it fits your narrative... . But to Butt's "commentary" - he conveniently set the premise of this being a 'religious' issue, it is not. It is a tribal custom (and a barbaric one)  enforced on women. By men. And not the only one. . The Globe and CBC tout their 'progressiveness', but scurry away from an open debate regarding any of these issues.  . Where is the commentary from the progressive Muslims - they do oppose the burqa?   Why are they shut out by the media?
For example, CNN and MSNBC keep propagating the notion that the Trump executive order is a permanent Muslim ban - which is fake news because the order is (1) temporary (2) affects both Muslims and Non-Muslims from only 7 and only 7 countries  (3) does not ban on the basis of religion. There are several other aspects concerning security in Trump's 7-nation ban which both CNN and MSNBC deliberately ignores.
EVERYONE must respect progressive values of equality for women, gays & LGBT that we have worked so hard to achieve; ....................... especially conservatives and Muslims.
We can put victims of far right terrorism next to victims of muslim terrorism.  The numbers won't be in your favour.  Just this Ramadan has seen thousands killed thanks to muslim terrorists.  This makes 1 victim of far right terrorism.  Remove the plank from your own eye before talking about splinters in others.
As I commented yesterday the G&M needs to frame the subject as a small part of Aleppo where the rebels are dug in has been liberated by government forces. I would like to know where the armed Sunnie rebels are going, with there weapons, I truly hope Canadian passport carrying muslims who are there are not getting back into Canada.  The behaviour of tyrants in this part of the world is typical and people know this as they live in this situation. Think of Bahrain when the Shia protested for some freedoms and the Saudie army in Canada made Jeeps rolled across the bridge, shot a bunch of protesters and arrested all the rest including Dr's that had treated protesters. After due process they were put in jail forever, nothing was dome by anybody,  After living and working there for 6 years it is my view that Canada must stay out, sure you think you have a leg to stand on but as I learned there is the story one side tells, and the story the other side tells and the truth does not exist.
Thanks for that, zuglo. The issue is not that Muslims can't be buried in Quebec. They can. The issue is that some Muslims want a dedicated Muslim cemetery. They certainly have that right, but changing zoning by-laws is a frustrating business as any developer will tell you.  They will find a site but it will need persistence and patience. Punishing citizens who vote against a cemetery next door by labelling them as bigots does not help the situation.
Drug overdose deaths in the US equal car and gun deaths combined. according to today's column by Nicholas Kristof, which we may see soon in the R-G, the US has 312 drug-related deaths per million, compared to Portugal, which has legalized all drugs and treats addicts as a medical, not criminal, problem, and has 6 deaths annually per million. Sweden has 100 dpm, England 60, Netherlands 16. Our criminalizing of drugs has got us nowhere.  Europe in general is secular, while the US is drowning in religious conservatism, much like many Muslim bastions with their religious strictures on all aspects of private behavior. This is costing us lives. Addiction is a medical affliction, not a sin, and the sooner we start treating addicts like a medical problem rather than shooting them dead (they often accomplish that on their own) the better off we will be.  Thomas Laird Twyford II (his friends call him Stinky) has no idea whether this dead dealer's customers have died, or not.
China has plenty of trouble with their own Muslims...
I certainly do not wish to imply anything adverse about Jewish religious practice but it strikes me as a liitle unhinged to be singling out Islam for its treatment of women when women in synagogues are required to sit apart, Roman Catholics require priests to be male,  Fundamentalist Christians place males as the head of the household, etc.  Remember that Charity is one of the Five Pillars of Islam given a more prominent place than in any other religion - and be more charitable.
Shapiro isn't a reporter.  The NYC incident was horrific, but people like Shapiro use it to demonize American (and by extension Canadian) muslims.  And the link also, of course, includes the hateful comments posted below the youtube video - comments clearly contrary to Globe guidelines.
To blame Rubio is to find a scapegoat. Trump is a product of many angry, mostly white Americans who now believe their low pay is the result of immigrants, the Chinese, the Mexican government, with a dash of corporate influence. And let's not forget Muslims, who perpetrated what the media dubbed "the greatest terrorist attack since 9/11 - 14 people killed. No one should rejoice over deaths, the largest attack in 15 years killing 14 shows little threat. Before Trump, Republicans riled over immigration, foreign threats and government control. Spawning a child that ate their mother, the Tea Party came to see Republicans as part of establishment politics. Compromise = bad. This message was spread throughout the land via hate-talk radio and hundreds of right wing wacko web sites (we take Visa) that still spew lies, i.e. our Muslim President, hate for liberals and RINOS. The Heritage Foundation and CATO institute helped craft these arguments Then came Trump who spoke "lies we can believe in".
Did you mean "the Crusades" (which was the reaction to Muslims invading Christian lands)?
Jane. let me ask you. How do you feel about how women are treated in the Mideast? Does it bother you they are treated less than their male counterparts in the Muslim World? You don't right, The Islam/Muslim Religion doesn't affect you personally so you don't care? Give me a BREAK.
I haven't seen the show but I did grow up in Northern Ontario (and get back often) and can attest to the fact that there are many doctors up north wearing head coverings. If you look up a directory of physicians and surgeons working in Canada's hinterland, you'll see lots of Islamic names. The fact that there would be a practicing Muslim woman training in Northern Ontario is pretty typical. As for the second point, was it a snowblower accident, by any chance? Any Canadian emerg physician who's worked in the snowbelt can tell you stories about men who have lost their fingers trying to clear snow from the blades of their snowblower, often after a few drinks. Because it's northern Canada, the men will usually be white. Nothing atypical about that.
Wrong again, Marty E.  Herr Hitler, like Herr tRump, blamed his nation's problems on those he considered unfit for his nation.  Hitler blamed Jews, homosexuals, Gypsies, leftists, and, in the end, anyone who opposed him.  Trump blames immigrants, Muslims, leftists, and anyone who opposes him.
Your hyperbolic misrepresentations of Trump are the kind of thing that helped him win.  Samples: "What Trump campaigned on was putting her in jail without cause. " "anti-Mexican rants" "pledge to inventory and evict Muslims"  As for your faith in the media, it's counter-factual.  As for targeting minorities, attributing Harper' deeds to Trump seems inappropriate, and Trump only wants to deport ILLEGAL migrants.
Those who decry 15 minutes of Muslim prayer yet have no problem taking Good Friday and Christmas Day off work.
They should be worried. The liberalism in Europe has allowed for the emergence of another fascist ideology - political Islam. People have every right to be worried and the only party willing to talk about this issue is the right wing.
OK, but everything has its 'limits'.  And one such limit is muslim 'Sharia Law'. Its absolute, unbendable, uncompromising, medieval and totally incompatible with basic Canadian  human rights and Law. To pretend otherwise is unadulterated foolish fantasy.
Interesting that you should identify the "efforts on illegal immigration, taxation, Obamacare, and cabinet selection. " Let's look at the actual track record on these files:  The Muslim ban was stopped by the courts because the Tangerine Tsar doesn't seem to understand that there are THREE branches of government. And the other two are not "Trump hotels" and "The Trump Organization".  This regime hasn't done a damn thing about "taxes". There are no indications of any cohesive and coherent plan to do so  The Republicans, despite years of pouting about the Affordable Care Act, have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in the pipe to replace it.   On the cabinet selection front, we've seen DeVos barely confirmed in a historic vote requiring Pence to break the tie. Puzder has withdrawn as Labour nominee. The State department is in complete disarray because most senior management positions are yet to be filled. .
Ataturk implemented strict rules of secularism at the founding of modern Turkey, which included no head coverings in public and lasted almost 70 years. The reason was because Islamists do not stop until they have absolute control over the state, which is relevant in the context of Turkey's regression over the last 10 years under the Islamist AKP. Islamism, or the idea of society governed by Islamic law is fundamentally incompatible with liberal secular democracies but in Canada, we are increasingly asked to "accommodate" cultural symbols of political Islamists under the guise of religious freedom and M-103 is the beginning of criminalizing any criticism of Islam. Europe is on the verge of widespread civil unrest, cultural segregation and no go zones are very real social issues. Why do "progressives" think Canada will be different? "Progressives" defend the niqab (which is only common in regressive societies) but fall silent when liberal Muslims are shunned for not covering their heads.
Is this news, commentary or an opinion piece?  It seems to me it's just another piece of nothing in the series of articles in your anti-Trump, leftist wing, elitist efforts of undermining a legitimately elected administration because it does not conform with the misguided view of the world that the media is favouring.  None of the reports is based on evidence of racism and discrimination: just self-serving innuendo.  There has been no substantiated evidence of any systematic, official anti-Muslim actions or campaigns in the USA: only allegations of it.  This type of journalism is a disgrace: you are harming racial and inter-faith harmony by your biased allegations under the guise of what you seem to think is responsible journalism.  Shame on you G&M!
UPDATE from BBC: "More than $600,000 (£468,000) has been raised for the families of the three US men attacked while defending a Muslim teenager and her friend on a train. Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche and Ricky John Best were killed and Micah David-Cole Fletcher was severely injured in Portland, Oregon on Friday. They all intervened after a man launched into a verbal tirade against the teens, one wearing a hijab. The suspect, Jeremy Joseph Christian, was later arrested."  There are many more good than bad people, lets' not let the bad dominate the news.
Apologies is if I misread your comment.  It has been removed by an overzealous censor, but it looked to me like you painted sexual orientation as a choice.  I don't see sexual preference (involving consenting adults) or gender dysphoria as a disorder, and while Sharia law is certainly a problem in some Muslim nations, I sincerely doubt that it will be become a factor in either our educational or judicial systems.  We have somehow managed to keep Church and State separate for nearly 150 years.  I think we will be able to muddle along for a bit longer.
What?  No whining from Hawaii's Muslim community and their AG Chin?  The current ban is for flights from Muslim dominant countries.  Is Chin acknowledging that there is more danger from these Muslim countries than other countries in the world?  Or, is Chin waiting for another State to say something before he sticks his chin out?
>>On the other hand, the world's largest Muslim countries, like Indonesia and Bangladesh, have public holidays for Buddhist, Hindu and Christian festivals. . Yes Indonesia - celebrating multiple religious holidays ... and where being an atheist is a dangerous proposition.  Can I write "God doesn't exist"? Blasphemy, no doubt, punishable how - please elaborate Her Muslim?
Your comment has some basis in reality, but then adds a bunch of conspiracy theories into the mix. Al-Sisi is not Jewish. That was a rumour spread by the Muslim Brotherhood to de-legitimise him. They also tried to spread the rumour that Sisi's president, Adly Mansour was Jewish (a Seventh Day Adventist Jew). And the Syrian civil war went on for years before the west ever got involved. And it's kind of deluded to say that the action in Syria was solely due to the wishes of the Sauds, when there was considerable domestic pressure to take action, especially after the grotesque rights abuses committed by Assad
Please let me know how reporting facts based on news stories fails to meet civility standards.  The Iraqi army has banned the use of burqas in Mosul after Islamic State used the garment to carry out deadly attacks in the city.  Senegal has banned burqas out of fear of terrorism, concerned that extremists will use the garment to hide their identities. It joins a growing list of countries with similar bans, both in and out of Africa. Several countries in Europe and the Middle East have also banned the garment. Though the common denominator between them is fear, each country has its own unique relationship with Islam.  Senegalese Interior Minister Dbdoulaye Daouda claims that it's not an anti-Islamic law, but a matter of national security.
Christianity, Judaism and Islam are the same religion.  They have no leaders, they passed 2000 years ago.   People who follow their one book do not have a spiritual advisor to guide them.
Actually, if you really look at it, kindness towards them caused their attacks. There is something really wrong with the Islamic mindset. We are kind enough to allow them to live with us in our society and they just can't fit in. So much for kindness.
According to the Gun Violence Archive, the USA have seen 273 mass shootings from January 1 to October 3 2017 in the USA which averages to 7.5 mass shootings a week. But do you hear much from the politicians? After nearly 60 deaths in Las Vegas by an American, have you seen much action from the government?  But when a Muslim extremist is involved in a mass murder then and only then do you see politicians speak of taking action.
There are 750 ZUS in France which are Zone Urbain Sensitive.  These are simply areas with higher unemployment and poverty rates, much like priority neighbourhoods in any big Canadian city.  Many wrongly equate these as being predominately Muslim (most are predominately white) and as being unsafe for police so like many statements there is a grain of truth but slanted.  Same with the rape epidemic in Sweden, Rape has skyrocketed since 2005 due to the change in definition which is much broader than before or elsewhere not Muslim immigration.
The dialogue is not cheapened by its existent, but by the fact that a man who is by all accounts a living Saint, the Aga Khan, is by proximity being suggested as doing wrong.   So cynical to believe that he would engage in inappropriate chatter, and the suggestion that he was involved in something incorrect, is unforgivable.   I understand that pundits will argue optics, sure, but it only matters if you neither know who the Aga Khan is or you don't respect him. The latter, lets be honest can only be birthed in complete ignorance.  Trudeau couldn't have felt more honored, then as a guest in his presence.   Charm is not going to get Trudeau out of this, I suspect honesty will.  nb. If it matters, I am not Ismaili nor am I a Muslim.
Yes, but God is also the foundation of the Jewish faith, the Muslim faith, the Zoroastrian faith, the Baha'i faith, the Sikh faith, the Mandaeist faith. It is belief in the Resurrection of Jesus Christ that distinguishes us from other good people.
Focus Prog. This is about Muslims students using an empty classroom for 15 minutes on a Friday not about whatever fantastical hyperbolic fantasy you've made up.
These gruesome acts are horrific and terrifying indeed........  Oh wait ... why did the US, the UK and their allies commit (directly and indirectly) many thousands of acts many times more terrifying than these in the various muslim countries (Iran, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan etc) over the last number of decades? Do we remember the lies that gave rise to these invasions and occupations? How many people got killed, wounded, their lived destroyed?  I agree, theses horrific acts by the west in these muslim countries do not justify such reaction but do you really expect these people to sit on their hands and do nothing in response? Really....?
The TDSB Guidebook was developed by Nazerah Shaikh and Haniya Sheikh, with support from the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), go figure.  But the overly broad definition in the TDSB Guidebook was an accident, right...
the Armenia holocaust of 1 million Christians by peaceful muslims and that six million number has been officially revised by the Holocaust authorities themselves. Let's talk about the Jihad against Indians shall we, Koenard Elst in Negationism in India gives an estimate of 80 million Hindus killed in the total jihad against India and let's not forget why the Crusades happened! It was because of 400 years of islamic barbarism, Can we forget how Mohammed thanked the Jews who helped him in Medina? He killed them, chopped off their heads. Some prophet, killing God's chosen and those Nazi's weren't Christians! It is also estimated that Over 110 Million Blacks were killed by Islam. So Christians can hardly be considered the biggest mass murderers, it isn't any surprise who really are the biggest mass murderers in history, estimated at a whopping 250 million and that is muslims.
From the rebel  therebel.media/81035/save-the-christians  It is apparent Trudeau prefers muslims over the dominate Christians in this country like the G&M and CBC.  How much are they paying Trudeau to do this to Canada?
>>... clearly amounts to finger pointing accusations by the author.  'Disservice' is too mild a word. It is blatant one sided coverage. . There are Muslims writers in Canada (writing on the subject), who for 'some' reason don't get published in this paper, instead we have this author and  the likes .. .. They always write following a simple template - "we condemn terrorism ( when perpetrated by Islamist).. but it is YOUR fault",  and "it is YOUR fault again" ( when a nut job gets pushed over the edge and  goes out for revenge). ... The important thing is to repeat "Islamophobia", "Islamophobia", "Islamophobia" ... and drive the agenda.
Bear in mind that the Muslim students will be praying from the Quran, in which the Prophet exhorts his followers to hunt down and exterminate any and all who refuse to adopt and follow his way when presented with it.  I'm not sure if that's important or not; just thought I'd throw that fact in for consideration.
Islamaphobia is just an excuse to shut down free speech and prevent rational and critical debate about Islam. How come people who quote from the Quran are censored, despite the fact that they are quoting from the definitive text on Islamic belief?
David, your question, "wn, again Targets, why would Islamic State claim responsibility". In case you have not realized it, ISIS will attempt to take credit for almost anything if they can. I'm surprised you don't see that.
Sure we're evaluating the intelligence, sure we are.  What's really happening is just the requisite delay to allow the  government carry on the fiction about not being beholden to the US intelligence apparatus, as well as a weighing of the political cost of imposing these bans on flights from Muslim run airports while at the same time we are doing backflips to try to minimize any sense of danger from Islamists as the immigration floodgates remain off their hinges.
Muslims protested the law not because they support Sharia Law, but because they viewed it as an attempt to intimidate and sow fear among the Muslim community.
More from Stormfront:  Story Breaking: a suspect has been arrested for reportedly stabbing two persons to death on a Portland train, the suspect was said to have confronted two muslims with bias " hate speech", then other passengers intervened, a fight ensued resulting in two deaths.  RONA RENAGADE writes: "Sounds like a case of National, racial and self defense, thanks on behalf of a grateful Nation."  Maybe he wasn't shouting, maybe he was just talking normally.  After all, if you know languages other than English, you can regularly hear what others think of white people on London transport !  And perhaps, he was just defending himself when three other men decided to attack him.  Because, if he really was inclined towards violence, wouldn't he have attacked those women..   I don't suppose anyone happen to film the incident to give a better idea of what happened.
The "protester" who was knocked to the ground was none other than Grant Chisholm, who was harassing and threatening some of the female protesters.  So no I really don't feel bad for him.  When you tease a pit bull.   And the Muslim ban is bigotry and anyone who defends Trump and his hateful policies at this point has to explain why it isn't.
I find it interesting that my comment yesterday about the Globe being excessively careful about not revealing the background of the perpetrator was removed, but now they go on to publish the details for all and sundry, plus allow numerous critical comments about his islamic background. I call this what it is: hypocrisy.
Very unfortunate secular progressives are no longer making people feel safe in their own country.  The same people attacking students on university campuses.  First they went after Christians and Catholics, then the Jewish, now Muslims.  Unfortunately your situation is far from unique.
As near as I can figure, there are a few inter-sectional purposes to this march.    The first is a general need for catharsis and release because the Democratic candidate lost in spectacular fashion.  This emotional release is much-needed by some to get closure, deal with their grief and begin the healing process from the trauma.  Part 2 is to come together and address the fears these women all have about a Trump presidency.  There's the 'GHBTP' comment and associated rape culture fears.  There's the fear that Trump will make abortions illegal (he  just wants to leave it up to each state).  The fear of prosecution of Muslims, LGBTQI people and other minorities because they think he's LITERALLY HITLER..  Then there's the repeal of Affordable Care Act and free birth control.  Then there is a general fear of rolling back whatever progress women have made in the last 60 years regarding wages, education, right to work.  That's as near as I can figure it.
Oh well. Muslims doing what Muslims do.  Why do they hate each other so?
They're good at using our freedom of speech to suit their ends; past masters at playing the victim and complaining about human rights. Human rights is an alien concept in most Muslim countries.
It's always utterly bizarre to see an American make a statement like this. I would like to think that Tillerson is evoking a sense of irony, but I fear that his incredible sense of American entitlement really is this brash, unironic, and incredibly dense. Mr. Tillerson, the Iranians are home - at the least, they are in their own backyard and welcomed by the majority of their fellow Shi'ite Muslims in Iraq. It is you and the US who are the intruders, who are playing around in places where you should not be and don't belong. All the US has ever done in the Middle East is make a mess. It's time for you to leave.
People who commit acts of terror can call themselves Nobel Prize winners but it doesn't make them so.  In the same way, those who commit acts of terror can call themselves Christian, Muslim or Jew, but it doesn't make them so.  To be a Muslim, Jew or Christian one must worship the God of Abraham, and that precludes the murder of innocent people.  'By their fruits you shall know them' and terrorism is the fruit of evil, not of worshipping and serving God.
Trump Asks, "What About The Al-Left? Here's The Answer  "But overall, far-right extremist plots have been far more deadly than far-left plots (and Islamist plots eclipsed both) in the past 25 years, according to a breakdown of two terrorism databases by Alex Nowrasteh, an analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. White nationalists; militia movements; anti-Muslim attackers; I.R.S. building and abortion clinic bombers; and other right-wing groups were responsible for 12 times as many fatalities and 36 times as many injuries as communists; socialists; animal rights and environmental activists; anti-white- and Black Lives Matter-inspired attackers; and other left-wing groups...."  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/trump-alt-left-fact-check.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share  So yeah, the right is FAR more violent than the left.
There are those accross the globe who are in greater dire need than those Chechen homosexuals living in Russian safe havens, at greater personal risk...yet the Canadian government is not swooping in to save them and bring them into Canada.  If homosexuality and LGBT are the essential factors, there are 72 countries where they are illegal,  is the Canadian government sweeping into Saudi Arabia , Iraq, Iran, Honduras, Uganda, Egypt to rescue them as well?  It should be noted that, of all the followers of belief systems,  Muslims seem to be the most homosexual phobic.
Well, Karter, for one..banned all iranians (an islamic state, and well known sponsor of terrorism).  The ban isn't based on "religion".  It's based on either a lack of a functioning government IN that country (which means we have absolutely no way of properly vetting the people wanting into the US), OR, the functioning government IN that country is a State sponsoring terrorism worldwide!   The fact that the terrorists are moslems is immaterial to the ban. Since ALL people from that country, regardless of religion, are banned.   The moslem religion is BASED on their "god" telling them they should rule the world.  And there is 1400 years of terrorist history to back up the concerns!  It's been said before, the Constitution is NOT a suicide pact.  You apparently want to apply our Constitution to every country in the world!  Our Republic is the EXCEPTION in the the world of governance.  Most of us would like to keep it a bit longer before it's "fundamentally transformed."
The Conservatives hate Muslims. Their 2015 campaign was based on thinly disguised anti-Muslim promises.
So I assume the authors would favor taxpayers funding of Muslim madrasas that teach Sharia law?
Yes, a "grass-roots meeting of citizens" that Rise Canada just happened to show up to with camera in tow. Rise Canada is not "alternative media", it's not any kind of media.  It's a hate group, one of whose tactics is to blow on the cinders of historical hindu-muslim antagonisms from South Asia.  And then you bring it here, to an article on the Dutch election.
I think the increase in race and religion based harassment can be traced directly to President Trump. He spent his whole campaign mainstreaming hate, and making it acceptable. That's why the white nationalists endorsed him.  It it had been a Muslim on that train harassing young women, then killing people who stepped in, I guarantee Trump would have called it something stronger than "unacceptable. "
No wall, no repeal,no infrastructure, no Hilary in jail, no NAFTA repeal, no abandoning Iran nuclear treaty, no end to the prosecution of Guantanamo prisoners on American soil, no Muslim travel ban, no shutdown, no control of North Korea, Why even have rallies if no one listens? He is at least allowing the prosecution that nasty woman who laughed at Jeff Sessions, so that is something ...
"Once again Americans mourn the destruction of lives wrought by a twisted ideologue beholden to fantastically evil interpretations of Islam."  "No God of consequence enough to be called great that we know of would approve of such a hateful and cowardly sin against humanity."  ============== The Denver Post editorial staff should actually read (1) the Qu'ran (Koran) (2) a biography of Mohammed as found in my copy of the Koran. - If The Denver Post editorial staff did both of those things, they might be further enlightened as to both the teachings of Allah and how Mohammed actually put those teachings to work.
What don't you get about this, Birgitta?  <<“This was a win for jihadists and other anti-U.S. forces,” said Richer, the deputy chief of the agency’s Operations Directorate during the George W. Bush administration. “It fuels the belief out there that Americans are anti-Islam. Otherwise, it accomplishes nothing, because the ones we are most concerned about can still get to the United States.”>>  Heckuva job, Trump voters!
Why is it that everything in the Middle East has to be about oil and gas? As a Canadian living in Qatar I can attest that this could not be further from the truth. It's about power, Qatar being ever so slightly more bold, its progressive media outlet - Al Jazeera, Qatar's ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and the fact that Saudi can't control this little peninsula the way it wants to. It's hilarious listening to all the "experts" chime in.
I suppose less terrifying than running with the bulls in another part of Spain.  PD was stretching for an article in describing his middle class excursion.? Twice he counsels, "It is hard. If you possibly can, you should walk it too." Not something the poor do for a diversion from their  daily life, only for people of means and leisure.  At least another walk, the via cruces, you don't have to travel to Palestine to do it but in many simulated spaces where it is depicted.  Less expensive, more green! He speaks of starting the excursion with torn ligaments in his knee.  Yet he proceeds!?  Masochistic?  Some RC ritual has favored such like Shite Muslims flailing themselves.  With a privileged position at the altar he surveys the scene, "I thought of all the people who had worshipped in that space, mostly poor and unknown, the great unwashed." A nod to those who may never have been in the cathedral or on the el camino.   Meanwhile in Haiti, Sudan, Syria, et ... no faux excursion.
The land actually legally already belonged to Israel in the first place, it was captured in 1967 war from Jordan who occupied it illegally for about 17 years. During that time they ethnically cleansed West Bank of all jews, through expulsions and massacres, They also destroyed many ancient Jewish temples and other historical sites.  Jews could not even enter Jerusalem at that time. After 1967 under Israeli control Christians, Jews and Muslims all live and pray in Jerusalem in peace and security.
The problem (I think) is the word Islamophobia. The problem is not that there should be a statement condemning anti-Muslim bigotry. I fully support the motion explicitly condemning anti-Muslim bigotry.  Umpteen times in these comments and on discussion threads appearing on my Facebook I have been called Islamophobic for (for example) supporting the kind of full-face veil and burqa ban in public sector employment that many countries have adopted, including Muslim-majority countries.  So, I feel that including the term Islamophobia in M-103 is basically condemning me and lumping me in with racists, bigots and anti-Muslim bigots in particular. I resent that.
Correct. However, Niqab and repression of women has nothing to do with Islam. These rather unfortunate practice and FGM predate Islam, and regrettably Islamic scholars, who are almost entirely men,  are very silent on this subject giving idea that that religion has incorporated these as part of the religion.    'You' want to see everyone  but others should not see you.  Face display  is a must and it is not a sexual display.  It is unfathomable why immigrants have to carry and maintain so many baggage when coming to a  new country. Bring only the good things not the ones that does not fit the  new society. It's a crime intentionally not to become as  part of the big Canadian family.   Quebec  must copy Europe, with notwithstanding if required. Charter has given a lot positive, and significant hindrance due to religion to create a new society. Must remove religion from the Charter.
I bet I have been to more Muslim countries than you brother Frederick. And I find that the most radicalized muslims I have ever come across are all in western countries. Why? Because our two ways are incompatible my friend. According to your sermon, what is happening to Christians under the "Aegis of the Islamic Nation"  in Palestine? Iraq and Iran? Sudan? Nigeria? Southern Thailand? Borneo? Mindanao? Kurdistan? Lebanon? Well they are being driven out at a minimum and slaughtered in the extreme.   It is only a religion of peace if you submit.   You may have the liberals fooled, but not the other 98% of American counties who voted in this last election.
"Weighting" is completely discretionary.  Some sort of weighting is necessary to derive conclusions from data beyond the very elementary.  Cautious, well-informed weighting can bring out interesting relationships in data. But weighting, being fundamentally a kind of bias, can also skew the meaning of data wildly.    Your idea that the "QUALITY" of crimes by Muslims is somehow different is a perfect example of a choice of bias: to you, crimes by Muslims are different from, say, crimes by drunk evangelicals or crimes by Alaska Natives or crimes by mentally disturbed people.  (And note the potential for crossover there.)  It's not that your choice of bias is wrong, per se--it's that you don't realize that you're talking in pseudo-statistical language.  Trista Crass's comment is, from a statistical point of view, just as sound as yours.  You simply object to her choice of bias, preferring your own.
terror attacks in russia are infrequent/non existant......wanna know why?...russia controls its borders and doesn't allow Islam to spread like wildfire
Great news to see a real President about to enter the Oval office! Of course, the embassy should be moved to Jerusalem to show our support for the ONLY democracy and country that respects the rights of ALL its' citizens! Israel has been the only shining beacon in the region, as the world and our own country reel under Muslim extremism and misguided policies of shiny ponies,the selfie crowd.Never mind the corrupt politicians and little potatoes of the world that sell out to Communist China!
Really? How do you reconcile the Saudis (the ruling class) supporting overt and subversive methods to promote their brand of Islam? The Qataris likewise.  Certainly the Muslims who live in the West for decades are not under an authoritarian government and yet a significant majority of them spit on your premise. Even a portion of native born Muslim have also spit on your premise.  I guess the siren call of their culture and religious beliefs are too strong, eh?
The problem jimetjules is that you see all Muslims as a single monolithic group rather than as individual people. You fail to recognize not only that Islam has distinct groups of believers just as Christianity does but also that the extremists are as far removed from ordinary Muslims as someone like Anders Brevik is from an ordinary Canadian.
pioneer27, glad you think that aspect of orthodox judaism is inappropriate.  I'm not fond of it, either.  Did you criticize Harper and his Conservative backbenchers for praying there?  If not, how do you explain the difference between that day and today?  Do you think I'm here to answer every question you ask?  I'm not.  That said, I have no idea if girls are allowed to lead the muslim school prayers.  If not, they should be able to.  I'm glad we're both feminists together.  I'm not in favour of women wearing burqas, either.  But - and this is the key to it - if a religion's members are willing to have it that way, they have that right.
Absolutely. The fundamental problem is alienation of our youth. They look for a culture with no self-doubt.   The wishy-washy ideology of multiculturalism, where everyone is better than us, creates alienation.   Islam does not say that everyone is just as good as them. I abhors the "others". It reinforces a sense of belonging.   People will keep to convert into it until we stop being spineless and teach European pride to our children. Do not hold your breath.
Theology, doctrine and religion are all designed for the sole purpose of controlling other people by those who espouse and define those terms.     Some choose to apply them internally to their organization; some choose to force them onto other people either verbally or violently, depending on the egos and desires of their leaders.    That is true for all brands of 'Christians', 'Muslims' Scientologists, etc.   "Faith" is the only decent concept from any of those belief systems.    Everything else is designed to get power over others.  Jim Jones, Howard Koresh, the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Episcopalian Bishops, Baptist Conference leaders; it doesn't matter.  They all agree that they are only doing it in the name of their theologically-defined deity and with the best of motives.
Let me be clear . No, I do not want to live in a Muslim dominated nation. You would not mind? Quite frankly, I think that is insane.  All of the liberties  we enjoy would be in peril.   You want to believe otherwise, as I said to the other responder, find me a Muslim nation that enjoys the liberties we have. They do not exist. And until there is a revolution in the Islamic world, similar to what Europe underwent in the Renaissance, that will not change.  Islam is a medieval religion, and where it is the majority, the church IS the state.   You have given your anecdotal evidence of Muslim family size, so here is some more from me: 3 muslim engineers working in a consulting firm in Calgary: children - 5,4 and 4.  For the record between 1991 and 2011, the relative percentage of Muslims in Canada has more than tripled, almost a 6% annual growth rate.  Unless that slows, Muslims will be the majority within this century.    Will it slow?   Why would it?
Not all Muslims are intolerant and you don't fight intolerance with more intolerance.
Khan writes: “The arc of XENOPHOBIC terror – whether ‘inspired’ by the Islamic State or white supremacists – has recently increased in frequency and breadth.” (My emphasis.) However five of the seven places that she names were victimized by radical Islamists, although she doesn’t say so. Alexandria saw a socialist launching a violent assault on Republican legislators; call it Republicanophobia, not xenophobia. Only the Portland outrage could even generously be considered as an act of xenophobic terror. It is obvious that Khan uses words not to analyze events , but to deform and distort them. Why does the Globe give her a podium?
That statement appears nowhere in al-Qur'an.  There are a lot of bizarre things written in Muslim literature that have no connection whatsoever to the original sahih ('reliable') source material.  I'm Shi'a and we take the position that the only truly sahih text is al-Qur'an itself.  Everything else is word of man and therefore open to question.  The hadith ('accounts') come in three flavors: true, we're not really sure, and outright fabricated.  And what I said was "May the Peace, Mercy of God and His Blessings be on you."
"Extreme vetting" is a meaningless and inflammatory statement Trump makes all the time.  However not once has he ever explained how his "extreme vetting" would be ANY different than what we already do.  This belief by the Right that we are just allowing random people into our country without any screening process is absurd.  Also, no amount of screening can weed out people who are already living her legally, but become radicalized.  None of the mass shootings/killings that have occurred in our country and have been considered acts of terrorist could have been prevented through a tougher vetting process.  Its a false sense of security for those already scared to leave their homes because they constantly fear that Muslims are going to kill them or turn this country into Sharia Law.
>>Duke Charles Martel >>Are you a muslim Alceste? . To that question, Alceste has a canned answer - "Are you a White Supremacist?".. or "At least I am not a White Supremacist?" Either way - it is pretty telling how he feels about himself. And what does he equates being Muslim with. Now, to the apprentice who would be given the task of "censoring" this post - read twice.. Just because there are some words in it that may scare you into censorship, there is nothing offensive, or false in it, it is based on actual posts ( go search your database).
"For us, the Jews are an authentic religion of the book, and if they are not too entangled with Israel, they are most welcome in Iran, and it would be a tragedy for us if they left." In contrast, "the Baha'i's are not a genuine religion, and have no place in Iran."  Al-Imam Ruh'hullah al-Khomeini (radi'Allahu an'hu).  Having said that, the group responsible for persecuting the Baha'i was the 'Hojjatieh Society', which was banned five years after the Imam's return.  You'll note they weren't pardoned, nor was the cleric who led them elected prime minister, nor did the Islamic Republic name a military award after them.  As for reaction against the Baha'i for supporting the Shah, what you overlook in your 'Nazi comparison' is that the Shah murdered 1.3 million of his own people.  How many Germans did the Ashkenaziim kill (admittedly one is tempted to answer "not nearly enough", but I'm looking for a number here...)?
I think the problem here is a lot of Muslims themselves don't see eye to eye with terrorists groups like ISIS or Al-Qaeda.  ISIS or Al-Qaeda may or may not claim they are Muslims. Either way their ideology is warped. So I don't think banning Muslims will help. I think what will help is keep dropping them MOAB's on their compounds. As for the terrorist suicide bombings and stuff it's hard to prevent that. There are nut heads in every country. A lot may or may not be Muslims. They can be your everyday citizens in your own country.
Just a question....do the Muslims in Canada really think this motion is about bigotry OR do they think its about banning any criticism of Islam and its religion and reintroducing blasphemy laws in Canada. Does the MP behind the motion feel that criticism of Islam and its prophet is acceptable? I think we know the answer.   In every Muslim country the penalty for blasphemy is very serious including death. you simply can't criticize the religion or the prophet Mohamed no matter what. This includes violent passages in the Koran and Hadith, the punishment for non-believers (including the extermination of Jews as we found out recently with the Mosque in Toronto), nor any mention of the immorality of the Prophet Mohamed....and his child bride.  For muslims coming to Canada in greater numbers this is their reality. No freedom of speech.   Blasphemy is what this is really about.   The G&M lives in a vacuum unconnected to the collective reality of the Muslim world and its beliefs.
takin the side of muslims and against the second amendment. still doing that in 2017? check. tammany hall and identity politics and wrong side of history.
There were death threats against Jewish places of worship, and calls for the full and utter destruction of Israel by countless Islamic countries under the Obama Administration-- given that much of those threats went unanswered by Obama, and given that Israel didn't support Obama and unequivocally supports our President Trump-- where is your evidence to show this recent bomb threat has anything to do with our President or his advisers?
RonsterG: I agree that all three "desert" religions are equally misogynous.  I am not sufficiently knowledgeable about other religions to make that claim.  Interesting that you specifically note Catholicism and fundamental Judaism to make your point.  Was that just to add a counterpoint to the constant drumbeat about the treatment of women in Muslim societies?
Rik, Despite your phony questionable so-called substantiations, I would always trust Obama's motives and never trust anything Trumpet says or promises. "I will build a great wall on day one and Mexico will pay for it.  I will stop all Muslims from entering the USA. I will abolish the Iran nuclear treaty on day one. Bla, bla, bla.  Flynn is a patriotic soldier. Comey is a nut case. Obama tapped my phones. Bla, bla, bla" I've got more if you want more.
Why don’t they protest on street corners?  Same reason robbers target banks: It's where the money is.  We agree on the role of protesting. Just don't do it at a Trump rally.  Or be Muslim. You'll get punched. And the Convention?
Islam means "submission". Muslim parents want to their daughters to marry within the faith, so forced marriages are happening in Toronto, Montreal , and everywhere to prevent girls from going astray.  A girl must submit her father, just as a wife must submit to her husband. We only pretend they are free to make their choices in life in Canada, because honour killing is still a very real fact of life for many women. The Shafia women died alone and abandoned. Not even Margret Atwood will talk about it because that would put her at odds with Islam.  Same for the Globe playing "let's pretend they are just like us".
I did ask that question ... and answered it in my very next sentence:  "There are lots of places you can have a debate about Islam. It happens on almost every article on terrorism. I'm not a big fan of Islam myself, but I tend to stay away from those discussions online because of the displays of bigotry, intolerance and hatred (already mentioned) they attract."  And, uh ... you *were* the one who used the word 'racist.'  And then you snapped off a one-liner "as if Islam is a race."  It's like you're insulting yourself.  Lol.
I would rather people choose science over religion too.  However, as long as Christians and Jews are given their days of prayer off completely, it's only fair that Muslims are accommodated during break time on Fridays.
Anything against Muslims and Islam is automatically denounced as bigotry especially by apologist left radical media.and shuts down any adult discussions. So much for free speech.
Thank you, Campbell Clark for this important article.  Our Prime Minister and government must make a much stronger statement, and Aung San Suu Kyi must do more.  The Rohingya community has been disenfranchised and persecuted and murdered in Myanmar for decades and the current crisis is fueling much misery and pain, and will also surely lead to a rise in Muslim extremism in that country.  I have been doing my best to raise the profile of this tragedy on my FB and Twitter for a very long time.  Thank you for ensuring that people across Canada have an opportunity to understand and take action. We can only hope.
Mocks disabled people ?  Who did he mock ? Wasn't it a reporter who did a story claiming Muslims cheered as the towers came down in New York , and then denied the story when Trump cited it as proof of his claim saying the same thing ? That reporter deserved more than being mocked.  The writer worries about what Trump might do to keep us safe , yet says nothing about how Clinton directly put America at risk using her cell phone .  Four men lost their lives defending us and she lies to the parents saying they died over a video . Then months later boasts " what does it matter now ? "   The authors anger is directed at the wrong person. She should be outraged at Hillary Clinton's actions , not what Trump might do .  If a America is facing a threat , waterboarding should be used for starters , to save American lives .
"Case in point: the person who equated a scarf-wearing muslim woman to a terrorist." And who did that?
"in the decades since, and including merged companies and adjustments for inflation to arrive at consistent dollar figures, about $4.1-billion (Canadian) has been granted, lent or "invested" by the federal government"   Well, that's 4.1 billion in 40 years. Hell, the Alberta oil  corporations get that in 2 years   Anyway, year after year the three levels of government in Canada dish out over 32 BILLION dollars in corporate subsidies/ tax-breaks. Why? Because the corporations/Markets insist on it, that's why, just as they insist on basically cutting their taxes to a big fat zero while insisting on paying their executives with/by stock options which are of course taxed at 15% (and less)    Meaning, we as a nation (and the industrialized/civilized world) are facing two clear and present dangers. Not the ISIL/Muslim extremist, not China, not Russia, not little green men from Mars, but rather;  The growing power of corporations and the far-right. Period
You really are too much.  You claimed earlier to have been raised a Christian yet you lecture me about not knowing what it means to be a Muslim.  You do?  You accuse me of bigotry because you disagree with my comment and then you dismiss the Quran as "ancient writings".  Is that what present day Muslims in Peel think of the Quran?  Ancient writings?
The only Muslim country that has nuclear weapons is Pakistan, and those nukes can't reach anywhere outside Asia (they have no ICBMs, no space program, not air-to-air refueling capabilities for bombers.  And the Islamic world will get poorer. Syria has lost more than 50 percent of its GDP in the last 6 years. 40 years ago they could have a war with Israel, and lose. Today they lose battles to ragtag militias.  To be a major world power, economics is key. The countries that are more likely to get there are the BRICS. No Islamic country has the economy to be in the top 5 for the next 50 years.
Are not Muslim women required to worship separately, are they allowed to lead men in any thing?   Why in predominately Muslim countries are they denied rights that women in predominately Christian countries (or what used to be predominately Christian nations) take for granted?   That is why we assume Muslim women do.
Good points. That very thing is happening with Muslim immigrants and refugees to Canada. Instead of the fears of some Canadians that newcomers will change Canadian society, the exact opposite is happening. Immigrants to Canada are becoming "Canadian" to the point of contributing financially, culturally, and socially to the richness of our country.
A billion Muslims would beg to differ!
Does the Canadian Muslim Forum have any connection or affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood?  G&M should be looking into that.
With Alt-right Steve Bannon as his chief strategist to advice (influence?) him, Trump might not stop at banning all Muslims from entering the US. He might even ban all returning US citizens who are Muslim or were born in Muslim countries from entering the US. The last step could be taking away their citizenship and expelling them with the acquience of the conservatives on the Supreme Court.
Will the Muslim MPs also  condemn these passages from the Qur'an that are taught to their children?   -Kill then wherever ye find them- Qur'an 2:191 -Make war on the disbelievers... living in your neighbourhood 9:123 -Slay the idolaters and take them captive 9:5 -Any religion other than Islam is not accepted 3:85 -The Jews and Christians are perverse in their beliefs 9:30 -...those who disbelieve... as for the thief.. both male and female... cut off their hands 5:36-38 -...the believers and disbelievers are two opponents 22:19 -...the disbelievers are a folk without intelligence 8:65 -...take not a disbeliever as your friend 3:28 -...smite the necks and each finger (of those who disbelieve) 8:12-13 Mohammed Marmaduke Pickthall Translation, 2009   Clearly, one could argue that the phobia goes both ways-- and regarding the purveyor of  this motion, "The lady doth protest too much, methinks." Hamlet, William Shakespeare
There are 1.6 BILLION Muslims on this planet, and this number is going exponentially. Their religion is strongly based on the need for justice.  What do you think would be the impact of a severe injustice being confirmed against the Palestinians. The only positive impact would be for those who stand to benefit from conflict, the security and military industries. The rest of us will pay for it in blood and treasure.
“It’s absurd to suggest they’re (Muslims) all responsible for this one person.” Yet that is exactly what we do by blaming all of Western civilization, it's history and politicians, for the murder, say, of teenaged girls at a concert.
Oh, sorry, I was just thinking of Lee Rigby, the British soldier hacked to death by muslims using knives. I just was thinking of the knife angle. Sorry if I implied that she was Muslim, I just wanted to know if she said anything while the was hacking up the driver.
So Don, Dan, and Lisa don't agree with Trump on trade, barring Muslims, NATO, and Judge Curiel, but they are going to vote for him anyway.   I wonder how they feel about the wall with Mexico?
Not a soul in memory has left the world in such turmoil as the fanatical community organizer. To the right he will surely go down as the most despised President ever.  The stage is set in the middle east for a conflagration such as the world has never seen.  With the hatred of Muslims and the intransigence of the Jews  the introduction of an amateurish fanatic in the White House was just the catalyst needed to bring the world to the precipice of all out war.  The right or wrong of Israel's policies hardly seem to matter any longer. The left will loudly disagree but it now remains to be seen if Trump can once again pull  a rabbit out of the proverbial hat.  Coupled with very tenuous relations now with Russia I know there has never been a more dangerous period in my lifetime.  Elections do indeed have consequences.
I believe there was a proposal from a Quebec City cemetery to share space, made in early July, a couple of weeks before the actual referendum.  The Islamic Centre had started negotiating with the local funeral parlour that owns the land in Saint-Apollinaire in mid-2016.  It was hardly intolerant to turn it down in those circumstances.
Yes. More help. More money that we do not have - more welfare, more free education with no mixed phys-ed, with no music, art or sex-ed and preferably not in the company of Infidel children, more segregated Sharia compliant communities, and more leftist "progressive" institutions where the refugees can air their complaints and choke up the progressive lovies with their victimization narratives. And maybe that little more help in adapting might include information on why its important to stand for the national anthem at Peel District school board meetings. And on the big picture, on the issue of adaptation, have a look at the literature coming out of the UK. There is no adaptation when it comes to Islam. It just doesn't happen. A little more help will amount to nothing. Not even a lot of help will help. Ask the Equities Czar in the UK.
It's the one thing Muslims have right.
He was shouting Allah Akbar and ISIS takes credit. Gee, its a good thing he wasn't Muslim.
Is this another example of lying by the MSM to cover up Islamic radicalism?  This story claims that Farid Ikken, the terrorist screaming: "This is for Syria,"  while trying to kill police at one Christianity's most-celebrated cathedrals, Notre Dame, was really just a nice chap: a medical student, a journalist, who liked red wine and was well-liked by friends and relatives who (Gee!) could just not understand how such a nice person could have done such a thing.  France 24, the Daily Mail, et al have reported, by contrast, that Ikken told police he was a "Daesh warrior" and a video of Ikken pledging allegiance to Daesh had been found in his apartment.  Also, these outlets claim that Ikken did not drink alcohol.  Isn't this just another example of the lying progressive MSM promoting Fake News in an effort to promote their false narrative   that violent atrocities like the one which just took place at a holy site, Notre Dame Cathedral, are not really the result of Muslim extremism?
She should've converted to Islam.  The ACLU would be filing charges against HSI for violating her "civil rights," Doug Chin would be representing her pro bono in the civil suit and David Ige would probably bestow upon her an immigrant feminist heroism award for showing courage in the face of discrimination and prejudice.  And if Obama were still president, she'd get a cabinet appointment and maybe even a Nobel?
Here ya' go "deplorables" ...  A federal judge in Brooklyn issued an emergency stay Saturday night against President Donald Trump's executive order banning immigration from certain predominantly Muslim countries, temporarily allowing people who have landed in the United States with a valid visa to remain.  The ruling—a stunning defeat for Trump at the end of his first week in office—protects from deportation refugees or visa holders who were detained at American airports since the signing of so-called "Muslim ban." It also protects those in transit when the emergency ruling was filed.  Now let' get on with a ban on psycho killers as presidents!
Those who are in denial of facts because it is too unpleasant for them to admit to them.. In this case those who claim this was not Islamic terrorism. because they would rather it did  not exist despite the evidence. and so pretend and explain it a something else that is totally fake.
Thanks @Ruben Reyes, but please remember that you are looking for a Trump quote that says he's given up his earlier promise of a Muslim ban.    I know that Katrina Pierson says the media mis-reported, but Trump's earlier press release is clear about a Muslim ban, so I suspect she was complaining about the press calling the EO a Muslim ban.  You (and Katrina) are right that the EO, now blocked by the federal court on First Amendment grounds, is not an "all-out ban on Muslims."  However, the point @John Kawamoto and I tried to make is that the EO is one step on the path to an all-out ban on Muslims.  At any rate, the link you provided doesn't indicate Trump repudiated the unconstitutional promise to ban Muslims, which is what you'll need to find.  Otherwise, your theory that the promise of an all-out ban is inoperative (which I'd like to believe) is just a theory without any supporting facts.
Actually, the Japanese soldiers in WWII did a lot of hideous things to Korean women and prisoners in WWII.  Stuff I cannot post here.  No beheadings, or dousing in gasoline, but pretty darn close.    Big difference between Muslims and the Japanese in the WWII era was the Japanese in America supported their new homeland.  Muslims of today cry racism when they don't get their way in converting Americans.
Actually the headline is accurate as the Muslim students were caught citing hate speech prayers.
If you really think that a ban religious attire is the same as an employer's dress code, you must have completely glossed over the entire point of the editorial. Allow me to spell it out:  Banning the niqab serves to reinforce bigoted hatred, because it normalizes anti-Muslim prejudice, and leads to more abuse and assaults against Muslims. So it doesn't reinforce secularism, it reinforces hate.
Many years' worth of lazy, cynical, right-wing contrarian tripe from the likes of Wente helped pave the way for Trump by helping to generate a base level of unending outrage (elites! progressives! Muslims! liberals! universities!) and systematically undermining trust in both the media and experts of all types. [For example, Wente, possessing only an MA in English Literature and lacking even the least scrap of science, has long been publicly 'skeptical' of the world's climate scientists.] It's the tiniest crumb of consolation to now watch them scramble to evade responsibility for their actions.  On the other hand, Wente is shameless and likely incapable of learning from her mistakes. An early cheerleader for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, seven years later she tried to blame that bloody debacle, the consequences of which are still unfolding today, on "liberal interventionists."
Freedom is not free. It comes at the price of vigilance and a willingness to fight for it.  People who will not fight for freedom for others dont deserve freedom for themselves.  Islam means 'submission" the contrary of freedom.
Those who are willing to do anything to gain power are capable of using anything, including religion, as a pretext for brutality. History is filled with examples of people claiming to be faithful followers of various religions, including Christianity, doing horrible things in the name of their faith.   Today the perpetrators are radicalized Muslims, but Islam itself is not the issue. Until we understand that we'll never understand the real problem, which is the social and political situation in the Middle East, of which Islam is one -- but by no means the only -- factor.   When that kind of instability exists, those who would exploit it for their own political ends take advantage of the situation. It's been that way throughout history and it's no different today.
Sad.   Like Bush and Obama before him, Trump came to power on a promise to disengage and focus on the economy. All three have been dragged into war not out of choice but because a rabid media , entrenched lobbying at the highest levels and a war machine that drives the economy won't stop until they get what they want.   For Bush it was Iraq and Afghanistan , for Obama  - Libya, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Ukraine (plus 6 more  he targeted  with  drones and covert armed support ranging from Pakistan to Sudan).  For Trump , america's rabid war machine won't stop until he submits  What must he submit to? No peace with Russia until it is broken into many pieces, no peace in the Middle east until Iran is driven into the sea and Israel is numero uno, no peace in Africa until muslim insurgents are lying in their graves, no peace in Asia until N. Korea operates  a McDonalds in Pyongyang  so it is written so it shall be done
"NSDAP & Fascism differ." Nazism and fascism differ? That's your answer?  Uh, OK. I suppose such meticulousness is par for the course in the battle against "Zionist revisionism."  <<I'm extremely concerned about US foreign policy.>>  That explains why you voted for Trump and his puppetmasters' glorious vision of a Judeo-Christian war on Islam as well as the touching consummation of the fossil fuels industry with Russian oligarchs.  My hairy eyeball is on you.
Martel was simply defending his country from invasion. Martel never started any war against muslims. It was the other way round. Inconvenient for you isn't it. You really shouldn't believe everything they teach in a madrassa
Islamophobia and Antisemitism are not going away - for another 13 centuries.  Mohammed, with Christian help, defeats Big Business, Bankers; sets up a secular Socratic republic in Medina with rights for all, especially women. Anti-Christian Kaliphate just after him reverses all progressive gains - was anti-poor, anti-women, anti-peace, anti-trade.  Kaliphate, sitting smack on East-West Silk Road, lived on Tariffs (Arabic word of Kaliphate origin) for easy life of languid pleasure for few at the top. 100 famines in Europe straddling 1300 AD. Christians, malnourished, prone to plague, population fell to 40%.  Kaliphate fells Constantinople 1453, blocks routes altogether, starving over-populated Christians further. Desperate Christians find new routes and new lands, destroying 3 Empires - Spain, Ottoman, Mughal.  Jews were allies in Kaliphate's nefarious entreprise. Finally, Christians find a Silver Bullet - Israel to pit them against each other. No war in Europe since then. Lord is Just.
So, the Lord's Prayer has been unlawful for decades.  Saying the word 'Christmas' is forbidden. But Muslim prayers are accommodated ?  Our schools are either secular or they aren't. " defn, 'Secular': denoting attitudes, activities, or other things that have no religious or spiritual basis."
It does not matter what your excuse is, we do not want religion in public schools. Period. Adapt to our ways. or leave for a place that is more religious and thus suitable for you. The powers that be are being nice to you because they represent the aspirations of corporate christianity - Anglicism, Catholicism who have always sought more and more footprint into the public sphere.  We will never accede to your demands. STOP IT! Stop forcing your religion on others by holding services and practices in public schools. Using the police is a sick and twisted policy that will only create more hatred against muslims. Stop doing it. Keep religion private, period. We won;t roll over for religious fascism which is what your DEMANDS represent.
5) Refreshing the CBC’s mandate with the new senior executive team to be appointed next year.  Yo can be sure there will be a diverse team of transsexuals, Muslims, women and natives but no conservatives and certainly no  white men. They  still won't create one TV show that Canadians in general will find amusing. Diversity of skin colour is our strength, but singularity of social and political opinion is the law. No...the CBC is not refreshing at all.
Here are "Five Faith Facts" about Roy Moore, extracted from an article on Religion News Service: 1. Moore is a Christian nationalist. 2. He’s best-known for twice being removed as chief justice of the state Supreme Court after conflicts arose between his religious convictions and the law. 3. Moore and his wife, Kayla, are Southern Baptists. 4. Moore said Islam is a false religion. 5. Moore denies the theory of evolution.

I love the FBI. I have many old time agent friends. But let me recall. The FBI investigated the shooter twice, and found nothing to charge. The FBI runs the firearm background checks. They approved  the shooters purchase. One gun shop refused to a sell high grade vest and large amount of ammunition but failed to get his name and vehicle ID. Now Loretta Lynch claims she does not know where the wife who helped the shooter is, so does that also include the FBI?"  And we have a white house that orders all reference to Jihad, Islam, Muslim  terrorist removed from all Federal officer manuals (including the FBI) and Loretta threatened to charge anyone in law enforcement who used disparaging language like "terrorist" Islamic Terrorist" Muslim and such until some news person reminded this AG about the first amendment.  So remind me who is working against the safety and security of America? The white house or the NRA
Israel has continued building settlements in land annexed through war from Palestinians in defiance of international approbation and common sense- repeatedly poking fair minded folks - including Muslims- in the eye and triggering the continuing and now growing radicalization of otherwise very likely fair minded youth in the area and increasingly around the world. George Bush senior stationed troops in Saudi Arabia which  led directly to the birth of AlQaeda. W proudly blew Iraq back to the stone age, destabilizing everything in the neighborhood and  justifiably giving a big boost to radical recruitment. And yes- the surgical strikes by drone killed but at least the US no longer has 100 K troops in the area engaged in combat. And was it Obama that made an enemy of Russia- or Putin that made an enemy of the West? There is that old saying- what goes around, comes around- so ask yourself- just what do you see going around now under Trump?
Believing that we should ensure the freedom  from, more than of, religion,  hostile to all forms of fundamentalism, as much Christian, (born again and Catholic integrist) and Jewish (ulta-Orthodoxy) as well as Islamic fundamentalism (Salafism or Wahhabism), and attached to the right to blaspheme, I am very worried about the consequences of the passing of M-103.  In a recent book, "Un racism imaginaire, islamophobie et culpabilité", Pascal Bruckner expresses his fear that the notion of islamophobia could be used to silence any criticism of Islam itself.  While the personal security of Muslims should be ensured, so should that of people who subscribe to Voltaire's statement that Moses, Christ and Muhammad were three imposters.  Is one who would encourage Muslims to approach their sacred text the way that Thomas Römer dissects the Hebrew Bible at the Collège de France, and who criticises Muslims who refuse to do so, engaged in an Islamophobic act?
India had a woman Prime Minister much before Canada thought about it. The President of India's largest political party is a woman, born in Italy, Catholic (in Hindu dominent India). Imagine Canada gets a Prime Minister, who is Muslim, Woman, Black and not born in Canada. Tell me who needs to learn from whom about diversity and tolerance.
There's a huge difference between "prayer" and preaching. You can pray all you want anywhere you want as long as you do it unobtrusively. Muslims require a separate space to do that in. It's a tiny concession as long as an Imam isn't calling to prayer over a loudspeaker from a portable minaret outside the school.  We also must be careful not to equate concern with hatred. That's a far greater problem.
I'd like to to revise my previous comment to the following:  RangerMC cites a news story about a planned attack in Malaysia by Yemenis on Saudis to justify Trump's executive order that supposedly would reduce terrorism in the US by Muslim immigrants on Americans. Fear is the basis of his support of the executive order -- not logic and reason.
Why are you equating "muslims" in general with islamist extremists in the case of the niqab, when I'm sure you insist on making the distinction in the case of terrorists?  In both cases, these are not representative of "Muslims" in general, just of extremist, islamist interpretations.  Many Islamic countries ban it in different circumstances. It is banned during the Hajj.   Please stop defending extremists by equating them with "Muslims" in general. It is only worn by an extremist fringe that gives ordinary Muslims a bad name.
Yup, your reply clearly shows how uncaring you are about the thousands of people in Hawaii who earn their living in the tourist industry.  Your blasé attitude reflects many who live in the expensive neighborhoods who make Marie Antoinette look like a Norma Rae.  Your predatory statement assuming Japanese owned real estate would be put on a fire sale shows your predatory nature like Donald Trump.  May your Muslim neighbor greet you with a hale and hearty greeting of "Allahu Akbar" the next time you see them!
this fight is 1366 years old ( not 5 years).    There will not be any peace or reconcilliation. According to the muslim cookbook they will fight until this is an islamic planet.  Once one side of the cult is wiped out ( shia or sunni)  they will focus on the infidel
They already go thru extreme vetting, thanks to Obama who removed those nations from the Visa waiver program. They already have an extended waiting period. Trump has failed to explain whats wrong with the current system and how he would fix it. That is why the courts keep ruling it is just a ban on Muslims in disguise.
Read the story of the Edmonton muslim man who was kicked out, changed his name back in Pakistan, grew a moustache,  and then popped back in. Went right back to work at the same Edmonton restaurant as before. Of course the Muslim restaurant owner knew nothing about this fraud, until a dispute arose then his Islamic conscience caused him to turn on his employee.  While not a terrorist, it shows how porous Canadian immigration is. We know nothing of these people, their real names, nothing.  We need more of them for sure.
Allie, it is the terrorists that we are trying to stop from entering our country. Just because the majority of these middle eastern countries are muslim have nothing to do with it. The problem is the original wording of the ban was not drawn up correctly, and now that the proper jargon is used, it is too late as the judges now are looking too deeply into the false intent of the original document. Oh, btw, IS claimed it's responsibility and the dude had traveled into these "other" countries to bring back the essentials to produce the bomb. The judges are reaching based on the original wording and are not dismissing the original translation of the ban while not recognizing the changes to the ban. btw, exactly what "US CONSTITUTIONAL" rights do people from other countries have? If you were to go to Syria (and I wish you would) what Syrian rights would YOU have?
Why the racist and religous bigotry? Criticise him if you like but what does his religon or ethnicity have to do with it. By the way, Rahm Emmanuel is not Muslim. He is Jewish. The first Jewish Mayor of Chicago.
Islamophobia was defined as "unfounded hostility towards Islam, and therefore fear or dislike of all or most Muslims."  Why am I compelled to like Muslims, or a more refined question would be why should I feel compelled to like Islamic culture? The above definition is interpreted as any criticism, such as expression of dislike, is unfounded. Its notable, that articles on the favourable aspects of Islamic culture are conspicuous in their absence.  So if I point out that Islamic culture is misogynist, evidenced by the poor showing of Islamic countries in the Global Gender Gap Report, does that make me Islamaphobic?   There is nothing uncivil in this post, however, some may not like to deal with difficult questions and facts. Let's see.
Not much is being enforced by city, state or feds.  Look at our beach access for one, letting rich people dictate.  And allowing foreigners to build luxury unaffordable housing. And so much more.  I totally agree with this article.  Trump himself side the bad guys ... and this is not a Muslim country.
The fourth paragraph of the story pretty much summarizes what happened.  Guy smoked too much marijuana, was subsequently hospitalized for a psychotic break, then converted to islam.
I condemn hatred toward any identifiable group.  But the motion is doing more  harm than good.  First, it is a waste of our lawmaker's time.  If the motion is non-binding, why introduce it?  And if it is a good idea, should Parliament spend a good percentage of its sitting tiime condemning hate in all its forms?  With all due respect to our Muslim community, I think they have bigger fish to fry.  Jobs and the environment come to mind.  Second, it has done more than any boneheaded alt-right pronouncement to cement distrust of Muslims.  Many perceive it as preferential treatment and proof of their misguided fears that Islam will become the predominant religion in Canada.  Why polarize an incendiary lot?    Finally....Barbaric Cultural Practices was meant to protect women from such things as polygamy, female circumsion, and honour killings.  Maybe the statute wasn't perfect, but I can't imagine any thinking person defending these practices.
its all politics , as long as the arab nation controls most of the oil reservs of the world , the un will pass all anti isareli resolutions ,simple as that , just to show you how ipocrate the world is just today a muslim terrorist shot a cop in italy , an airplane was kidnapped by muslims , a palestinian entered a jewish city and stab a 50 year old man , there will never be peace , since the start of the israel state which by the way was a 2 state country with a majority to the palestinians , all they wanted was all , like they say in the palestinian street from the dead sea to the mediterrain palestine will be free, meaninig no israel
Before the election Robert Kagan wrote an article titled "This Is How Fascism Comes to America"  that sums up  Trump's  very flawed character:       "His  incoherent and contradictory utterances have one thing in common: They provoke and play on feelings of resentment and disdain, intermingled with bits of fear, hatred and anger. His public discourse consists of attacking or ridiculing a wide range of “others” — Muslims, Hispanics, women, Chinese, Mexicans, Europeans, Arabs, immigrants, refugees — whom he depicts either as threats or as objects of derision. His program, such as it is, consists chiefly of promises to get tough with foreigners and people of nonwhite complexion. He will deport them, bar them, get them to knuckle under, make them pay up or make them shut up."  Trump's  use of vulgarity (sons of bitches)  and  calls  for  punishment (fire them) directed against black athletes is in  keeping with  his racist character.
Before Donald Trump and/or any of his supporters start making excuses that if he loses the election it will be the result of a world wide conspiracy, please consider the following; he has alienated himself from so many groups, Blacks, Hispanics, women, people with disabilities (who did I miss?), oh yes, POW's and Muslims...he said that he wasn't going prep for the first debate and suffers the consequences. Possibly, just possibly, if Donald Trump loses the election it will be because fewer people people voted for him than any other candidate and he will have no one to blame but himself.
Another paying customer treated badly by an airline. I ask you, where is the outrage on Facebook for poor Mr. Uskanil? Just because he wanted to change seats, he ends up duct taped to his chair. Profiled for being (in hushed voice) from a Muslim country. On top of that, no doubt he was handled roughly by the FBI upon his departure from the plane. And "re-accommodated" to a Federal detention center. Oh, the humanity of it all!
Really? One group? Ever heard of a group called "Nazis"? They've got quite a rep for being anti-Semitic. Plenty of red-blooded American white boys don't like dem Jews much neither!  In fact, anti-Jewish hate crimes still lead the pack in North America and they're not generally perpetrated by Muslims.  The primary target of Islamists is Western culture led by the US.
I am curious: was Joshua Boyle a convert to Islam?  He was married to Omar Khadr's sister.  It is obvious that she was from a devout Muslim family and Muslims do not marry non Muslims.    A picture originally posted on many media sites showed Mr. Boyle with Caitlin prior to his journey to Central Asia having an Islamic style beard.  An answer to my question could explain why Joshua felt comfortable in bringing  his second wife to Afghanistan and give an important context to his story.
It was a person of the Muslim faith that shot up that night club Kristi, Try and remember that.  If the gays think dealing with these "Christians" is bad, just wait until all the Islamic fundamentalists that Obama is importing start working against them. They still behead people for homosexuality.
I, for one, did not immigrate and escape a totalitarian state (Iraq) to arrive to a country that is slowly becoming so.  Instead of hiding in your small corner of the world, I suggest you take a different stance by stopping the self-labelling, the political correctness and the isolationist attitude that have brought the community to where it is now. YOU DO NOT SPEAK FOR CANADIAN MUSLIMS AND I DO NOT FEEL OPPRESSED.
"and it is up to moderate Muslims to clarify this to "my Canada" So far they are not doing a good job"  Lol - first, it's up to Muslims to do the job you just told them to do? Amazing, what exactly is the source of this privilege that lets you issue orders to an entire religion?  Second - they're not doing it? What you mean is that YOU AREN'T LISTENING.
Has anyone read Tarek Fatah"s opinion column in a competing Toronto newspaper? The headline: "It is OK to say Western civilization is superior" From a devout Muslim.
Canada apparently needs to step up the effort to protect both peace-loving Muslims as well as non-Muslims from terrorists. With this Prime Minister, that will never happen as he'll get bogged down and paralyzed by his own confusion, ideologies and hysterical supporters.
I would define Islamophobia as the irrational fear of Islam, the operative word being "irrational".  I'm as opposed to racism as anyone, believing that it is the greatest evil that ever beset the human race. However, a close second would be terrorism. The natural fear and anger that results is very much rational. The answer to reducing racist "thinking" is not government mind control. Rather it involves the sanctioning of behaviours that produce this thinking. These behaviours include all actions that deny basic human rights. This is where there is role for the government. For example, in the case of terrorist activity, why does Canada not have a law that makes it a crime to belong to or support a terrorist organization, so the crime can be prevented rather than just reacted to ? This is the kind of government intervention we need, not more naïve legislation to control our thoughts.
RD, wrong again.  Obama's was an effort to revet people from a country known to have terrorists.  Trump's is a ban on people from countries that just happen to be Muslim and where Trump has no business dealings.
So Indonesia, most other predominately Muslim countries and the word "Muslim" aren't on the ban list, right?
Once again the Brotherhood of peace aka the seventh century death cult known as Islam are at it again.
NCL, before you accuse others....  Your post of 2 hours ago suggested a massive conspiracy to hide muslim 'second attacker' - "Mohamed Khadir". Try doing a minute's search on Mohamed Belkhadir to find the news that's been out two days.  Here's one:  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mohamed-belkhadir-quebec-shooting_us_588fc0bbe4b0c90efeff7ba0
continued from above  President Obama's Support (U.S. Funding) of Muslim Terrorists of the Muslim Brotherhood, Al Quada's Ansar Al Shariah, 30 Million Kurdistanis aka Kurds of Al Quada's Ansar Al Islam.  2009 President Obama gave Iran's Hamas $900 Million, Clinton $400 Million of U.S. Citizens money, Hamas then bought more Weapons, Ammunition, Bomb Making Materials to murder U.S. and Israelis.  2011 President Obama got the U.S. Kicked Out of Iraq by the Allies of Iran, the Shia of Iraq (Millions of Iranians that fled to Iraq after the 1979 Fall of U.S. Ally Shah of Iran).  This Obama loss of the Centuries of Iraqis Oil to the Muslim Nation of Iran, Iran then bought 21st Century Technology to Upgrade the Iranian Military (21st Century Nuclear Centrifuges, Weapons, Stealth, ABMs, ICBMs), Russian Federation then sold the Iraqis Oil to the U.S. European Allies making Europe in Debt to the Russian Federation.  Thanks Democrats for f--king up the U.S. and U.S. Allies.
Ok you let wing democrat loons. Wipe the foam off your mouth and think for a minute, even if it hurts. We sold them 12 billion for a few F-15 fighters. Does anyone thing they will be used as terror attacks? So we win in a couple ways, more good paying jobs in the h US. Massive amount of taxes paid to local, state and federal governments. And one more thing, even if Qatar is sending money to  Muslim terrorism that is 12 billion that won't. ALso when we provide military equipment we have pull over the use in the future . Iran had a very hard time keeping their US Built  build F-4 and F-14 flying after the Islam revolution
Lol, never heard of a Filipinas giving up 100k to ANYONE including their husband. But in any account all goo sucking trumpies want a brown skin Muslim to blame their woos on and deflect from a second amendment ,white senior citizen who was a flag flying American.
hahaha - I made a very tame, very calm comment re: this article an hour ago, and it has already been BANISHED! And I even opened my comment by stating that I am happy to see more light shed on the exploitation of Africa!  Hilarious! - Pernicious Censorship at its finest right here folks!  The jist of my BANISHED comment: If we want to be honest about the damage done to Africa by evoking the rampant historic slave trade there, we cannot reduce it to a monopolistic onus on white Christians -- this will leave readers grossly misinformed and only FUEL the 'racial' divisiveness more and more apparent in our day.  If we are to bring up white Christian slave trading, we must - as honest brokers of historic 'fact' - also mention the centuries long incidents of Muslim slave holders and traders, trading and holding black Africans... as slaves!  Or is the truth about -ONE- particular faith and culture now off limits, while we can tar another to high heaven?
Go ahead and tap dance around THE issue, which is immigration.  But it just delays the inevitable day of reckoning.   The day when the Netherlands, and eventually Canada, must accept a Muslim majority. Or not.  Numbers do not lie. Yes, numbers change. But they do not lie.  Small nations, like the Netherlands, and even Canada, will have majority Muslim populations within this century -  if immigration and natural growth patterns do not change.  Of course we can always rely on the great liberal hope, secularization, as a shield against living in a Muslim theocracy. Because, as we all know, secularization is sweeping through the Muslim world, right?  Gender equality - gone. Separation of church and state - gone. Freedom of expression and freedom of the press - gone. A thousand years of hard-won progress - gone.  But yes, let us be afraid of the wrong type of populism. We need to embrace the correct type, the type where numbers are relative and trends exist in a proof-vacuum.
Fastest growing religion in the world is the Islam faith and fastest growing religion in Canada is the Moslem faith. According to the 1966 census Canada had less then 1000 Moslems in all of Canada. In 2017 it is approaching 2 million people and growing.
Gov Ige is such a mix of good and bad.  He's out of his depth (so to speak) when it comes to protecting the ocean and protecting us from invasive species.  He doesn't have the will to take the hard positions.  And yet on other issues that are more technical or cerebral  (electric grid, muslim ban, not turning over voter records) he's very good.
Why not include religious bigotry against women, homosexuals and Atheists? Why pander to Muslims, who are guilty of most of the violence against Muslims they consider Infidels? Are the Liberals going to investigate Canadian Muslims accused of attacking other Muslims? http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/luckily-i-escaped-man-accused-of-role-in-pakistan-mosque-attack-tells-of-his-return-to-canada
Actually the vast majority of Canadians think 300k per year IS excessive and way too much, like 90% too much now.  So yes those coming over the border, IT IS A CRISIS for us. Our poor and middle class are suffering greatly. Our compassion is being used to destroy our quality of life and give crazy religious people control over our culture, the power the Catholic and Anglican churches lost and now jealously want back, using violent islam to assert religion dominance over society.  We all see it. Our ancestors all sacrificed to be here but the past 12 years we've seen an exponential growth in those who feel they are entitled and deserve more than our ancestors did when they moved here.  This is not building a strong society, it is atomizing us, dividing us, creating the strife-torn conditions that exist in Europe and Asia today.  Madness.
People do get that this guy is Wikipedia User "Sherurcij", right? -- the most prolific defender of Islamist terrorists on Wikipedia
I, and I am sure millions of others, knew Trump policies will draw blood. Big blood. But never in my imagination would I see:                                                                          Trump first blood is in Canada  Canada did not experience religious-hate mass murders, not even after 9/11. Not even after many such mass murders in the U.S. But within 10 days of Trump in power we had one. A biggie. Done by a 'kid' whose mind already filled with religious hatred, pushed up a notch and did the most insane thing. Without Trump this would not happen. Religions insanity goes both ways in holy wars. The current holy war on Muslims was started by America's Pivot to Middle Policy in 1990 once the USSR collapsed, thus allowed the U.S. to roam free in the area and do its plundering.   I urge PM Trudeau not to invite Trump to visit Canada, for any reasons. Canada cannot permit the root cause of our damage to cross border.   As for me I will no longer visit the U.S., for any reason.
No, I don't. It's elementary and self-evident. You, however, do need to better understand and take responsibility for the ideological underpinnings of your religious doctrine. It's up to you to attempt to excuse and justify the wrongful culturally- and spiritually-oppressive excesses of extreme paternalistic religious ideology, doctrine, and practice if they are present. It's baked right in, unless your church's sect explicitly excises it from the doctrine as a liturgical position. Some sects of Christianity share in the wrongful paternalistic gender-inequitable excesses of Abrahamic tradition with Islam and still others. Let us now fully scrutinize all the memes of your belief and practice systems in order to better ensure that you do not believe or promote anything that could be reasonably construed as a wrongful or a hateful or an intolerant or a sociopathic denigration of any class of individuals on the basis of gender, even when they are non-cisgender individuals. God is female.
Trump banning immigrants from Muslim countries, there goes your future standup comedians, the women with their faces covered, they were the funniest. Too bad.
skyblue has been sounding this note of 'blame the government for taking in refugees' for a few days now.  For her and  a few others it's preferable to admitting that demonizing ordinary Canadian muslims has had its logical longterm effect.  It's no different from blaming the killing of 14 women École Polytechnique students on feminists.
Thank you for the link to what you were referring to.  In a conversation with Giuliani, he asked how it should be done to keep the terrorist who are muslims out.  Giuliani explained you can't use a religious test but to have a mechanism to keep America safe, to use the 7 countries of origin - just like Obama did.   Is it a "Muslim ban"? No because it does not call for a ban on the majority of Muslims in the world.  In order to be consistent with past American policy, he choose those 7 countries.
I disagree with the previous comment.  The article stated that one of MAPS-AMEN's goals is to make a positive impact on Muslim youth to prevent them becoming radicalized.  I also agreed with the young woman who said we are stronger together.  As a non-muslim, I care about my neighbors and about keeping our community hate-free.  Looking out for each other is how you combat extremism of all forms.
or take for instance ...there are no female imams, muslim women are relegated to different areas of the mosque,  and if a women, jew or a dog walks in front of a muslim man while praying he has to stop and start the prayer session all over again.
since you asked...  Sean Spicer (press secretary who lies about things like inauguration crowd size and whose office is full of leaks and who tried to stop the leaks by confiscating his staffers' cel phones but it didn't work as someone leaked the story about the cel phone confiscations not long after it happened), Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon (rushed the race-motivated muslim ban EO that was shot down by the courts for being unconstitutional within a week), Kellyanne Conway (so caught up in lying to diffuse any criticism of trump that she publicly contradicted facts and embarrassed herself and the president and was taken off the TV news circuit for a few weeks), and anyone and everyone on his staff who are allowing trump to hold high-level meetings at Mar-a-Lago and planning failed SEAL raids at the dinner table and letting club members do things like take selfies with the nuclear football.  There are probably a lot more to mention but I don't know their names.
Alceste. You arrived! Thanks for replying. You may well be correct that an anti-muslim group was involved and may have put pressure on the 36 individuals whose property was affected. There was also plenty pressure from Muslim groups and politicians who naturally wanted the zone change to go ahead. Outside pressure comes along with every decision at the municipal level. But you still haven't answered my question. Did the residents of Saint-Apollinaire have the legal right to make this decision?
Note to self - While in Saudi Arabia, not a good idea to insult Islam on your blog.
Its not against Muslims, Annie. Saudi Arabian people can still get in. You know that country whose planes were the only ones to be allowed to fly out of the US after 9/11. The country where the murderers all came from. Its just a ban on some Muslims.
Sorry to question your assertion pard, but... We indeed have non-Muslim terrorists amongst us. Consider: the white Christian who killed all those people in a black church, all the school killers who were young whites (eg. Columbine, Sandy Hook), the white Christians who have bombed abortion clinics and killed abortion providers, the KKK, the redneck whites that took over the Oregon wildlife refuge, the Unibomber, the IRA in Britain and the list goes on and on. If by ignorant public policy we alienate or make enemies of the billions of Muslims in the world, including allied countries around the world, what then? How can law enforcement and our intelligence agencies gain the confidence and help of Muslims in this country and around the world to fight terrorism when Trump and his cronies practice xenophobia? I agree with many who assert that Trump is playing right into the hands of radical Islamist terrorists.
The question was about a Kosher or Halal deli being sued for not serving pork, SOMETHING THEY DO NOT GENERALLY SERVE.  As for a Muslim baker turning away a gay couple asking for a wedding cake, something they do make, I have just as much a problem with that as I do with the guy in Lakewood.  If a gay couple were to be turned away and sue, I say, go for it.
Thank you.  As I recall two of the biggest Shi'a Masajid ("mosques") in east Asia are in Tokyo and in Seoul.  When I made Hajj ('pilgrimage') to Mecca, one of the fellow Hajjis in my party was a Japanese Muslim sister.  She came down with the flu (frequently happens when large numbers of folks from around the world congregate--just like happens in Dutch Harbor during Pollock season), and I stoned the Ja'mra'at (the three pillars representing satan) for her as she was incapacitated.  She gave me a beautiful tas'bih (string of Muslim rosary beads) in gratitude for performing the ritual for her.  And thank you again for causing me to recall that memory.
Please...we all saw the videos with our own eyes and heard the words with our own ears.  It's all documented, it's part of the record in the most heinous campaign in modern time.  Mexican immigrants weren't denigrated?  Muslims as a discrete group weren't made an object of fear and loathing?  Women weren't graded and classed according to their attractiveness?  A disabled reporter wasn't mocked?  The media wasn't lambasted for doing its job?    We saw it happen LIVE.  Coulter and Kellyanne can't spin the reality of what we saw happen.

President Trump is not suspending visas from countries his team selected, they are simply suspending visa approval from countries President Obama selected.  Additionally, Trump is suspending ALL visa applications from those countries – nothing to do with Muslim applications.  In 2013 President Obama suspended refugees from Iraq for six months. In 2015 Congress passed, and Obama signed, a law restricting visas from states of concern; and in 2016 Obama’s DHS, Jeh Johnson, expanded those restrictions.  All President Trump is doing is taking the same action as Obama 2013, and applying Visa restrictions to the nation states Obama selected in 2015 and 2016.  https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1187  https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/visa-waiver-program/visa-waiver-program-improvement-and-terrorist-travel-prevention-act-faq  https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/02/18/dhs-announces-further-travel-restrictions-visa-waiver-program
Almost all of my dealings with "immigrants" (in America) is dealing with illegals.  I've NEVER met an illegal immigrant in another country, other countries have "tight" rules, I wonder why. The legal immigrants I've met were all honest, hardworking, respectful people. I love them. They WORK and pay taxes. Like me. On another note, the Mullahs are not Trump. They are all Muslims. They all practice Taqiyya. If you don't know what that is, look it up. It's why you CANNOT trust Muslims.  Believe me M, they consider you and I to be infidels, worthy only of death. Sure, while they are here, they are outnumbered, and Taqiyya tells them to be kind, polite, nice, generous and all the good stuff. And its all a devious method to make us believe they are kind and gentle people.  But as soon as they outnumber us, they will drop the hammer and make us convert to Islam, or be executed.  And if you don't believe me, I feel for ya.
Dear Rogue Chimp  - you asked who had their free speech denied - your answer . Strategies for eliminating intellectual debate on campus are manifold. . "Amongst them: disinviting guests, such as Brandeis’ 2014 commencement dis-invitation to the heroic Ayaan Hirsi Ali because her views on Islam offend some Muslims, . or disrupting the speech of politically incorrect speakers (conservatives, pro-life activists, ...and pro-Israel speakers often need tough security on campuses ... . ... punish “offensive” language to women and minorities; . and hiring according to ideology and group identity rather than academic accreditation." . Excerpts from: Universities are teaching students what to think, not how to think - Barbara Kay - March 11, 2015
1.  He's not 'my vaunted PM.'  I'm not a Liberal.  2. He didn't label anyone as suffering a mental disorder because the broader meaning of islamophobia is "hostility or prejudice towards Muslims"  3. The funny way of English in question here is the way meanings change from their Latin or Greek roots.  It's been going on for centuries.  4. Yes, a single word that takes in islamophobia, anti-semitism and others is bigotry.
The Toronto Star and Globe commentators seem to think North America is immune to atrocities as to those in Europe, caused by islamic extremists. They celebrate the appeals court rule against Trump, like sailors hating the captain of their boat and feeling  happy the boat has a hole at the bottom, that will take care of the captain they think. Not much difference really.
Richard Roskell, Muslim parents generally speaking have concerns about morality such as  homosexuality gay marriage pre-marital sex even sex education  modesty as in covering of hair, clothing, dating between opposite sex etc.  their moral standards may clash with those of the school board (more secular, more permissive, more lax)

More news outlets are deleting their commentary sites; the great liberal bastion the Toronto Star and CNN dropped theirs ages ago as they could not take criticism. Other outlets increasingly  only allow comments on safe topics. Others censor or ban anyone who upsets the apple cart by talking about sacred cows or elephants in the room: such as homosexuals and aids, or black crime, or overpaid civil servants,  Canadian Jews and Israel, or anything deemed politically incorrect. Of course it is okay to bash white Anglo saxon men or Muslims. But it is not okay to point out the  striking similarities between Orthodox Jews and Muslims and how they treat their women, or how a lot of Muslim men chase Christian and Jewish girls but we cant go near their girls. And it is not okay to talk about how only lower middle class Christian boys fight and die for Canada in te middle east wars while so many others hide out in elite schools. I wish some academics would address these issues objectively.
You can blame our media who are hand in hand with this socialist ideology and pro-Muslim stance.
Saunders implies that for more than a century France has been multicultural with Jews and Muslims. Significant Muslim immigration only started in the 1960s.  Her argument that the Vichy round-up of Jews was not done by France is the same argument used by Mitterand to defend this. The argument is that the real France was represented by de Gaulle in London. Le Pen is only repeating the evasions of one of the biggest liars in French history.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LhMVdCmZiQ
The Aga Khan's personal weath does NOT come from his followers at all. He has stated and explained this on countless occasions. You can see everything he has explained about it here:  http://www.nanowisdoms.org/nwblog/wp-content/uploads/facebook/2013.08.25---excerpts-his-highness-the-aga-khan-on-the-tithes-(dasond)-given-to-him-by-ismailis.pdf   The tithing practice for Ismailis is not forced, it is voluntary and the Aga Khan does not enforce it in any way - similar to the Catholic's Peter's pence. Those who give a percentage of their income do it out of love. All Muslims are required by the Quran to give a portion of their wealth to the less fortunate. For  the Ismailis, the Aga Khan is the trustee of these funds and he uses the tithes EXCLUSIVELY for the Ismaili Community and the AKDN's $600 million budget that he funds.  Aga Khan does not claim to be God, he claims to possess religious authority inherited from Prophet Muhammad in direct lineal descent as history bears witness.
the majority of KKK in Colorado back in the 20s was GOP.  And that matches up with what our state was back in the 20s; GOP controlled.  Are you Christian/Jewish/Muslim? DO you go to Church/temple/mosque? Have you ever met ppl that joined just to pretend? Perhaps you have met some that converted just so that they could marry somebody? Many of them are NOT true believers.  And based on what I see of today's churches and groups like the GOP, there are few true followers. Many so-called Christian have more in common with the devil, then with Christ. And finding a TRUE REPUBLICAN in the GOP at one of their meetings? Good Luck.
First of all, it was the Runnymede report that devised "closed" and "open" view of Islam - not me. Second, I disagreed with that, by saying that this is problematic.  Muslims - like Christians and Jews - read their holy book at different levels;many do not read it at all; some who do, do not understand the original Arabic.  And,  their understanding differ widely.  For those of us living in Western, liberal democracies - yes - there are passages that some struggle to reconcile.  Other faith groups go through the same thing.  It is the blanket condemnation on ALL Muslims that is problematic.  And in fact, we should not issue blanket condemnation of people of faith, but instead, arrive at a common understanding of how we are to live together, in peace, without infringing on the rights of others.  Sheema
After living in 4 Muslim countries, I probably have a better understanding than you think, of these issues.
https://youtu.be/xONYrtJ6ZlM   Hear it from the top Muslim in Canada. Your Son Should Be Afraid , We ALL need to reflect on EXACTLY what this man is saying. Play it more than once if your sad Liberal Mind Doesn't hear it. EVERY Friday Prayer is preceded by a prayer asking for the defeat of the infidels at the hands of the Muslims , and I stand By it Sir and that prayer has been going on for fourteen hundred years. Senate Hearing on threats facing Canada for you Liberals that Cant Read. Tell me , Who do we Tar and Feather for allowing this VERY REAL THREAT to exist in Canada in the first place ? Were The Catholic Crusades just a joke ? Did everyone think Nawww they wont go out and kill people. What are we seeing now ?
Trump insulted a Muslim Gold Star family for the crime of being Muslim.  Trump suffered no great loss, yet he is the one who got all cranky.
reading comprehension much? "Christian"? "super patriot"?  im an atheist. i.e.; non-believer. that means i don't believe in your cult or cult hero's, not the muslim ones or the christian ones.  where did i accuse you of treason or threaten kill you?  that comment is straight delusional. and you just lost this discourse handily.  your one dimensional arguments don't pertain to me.  ...but they're all you have. sigh  your book is full of embarrassing antiquated patriarchal backward quotes and beliefs. it is no wonder generations of modern muslims have re-interpreted those evil prose to fit modernity. (and failing miserably)  this is fun, lets keep doing it.
What I would like to know  is, would  Islam accommodate Christian students in their Middle East countries, allow them to have a Christian prayer in a separate large gymnasium, and have one of their opinion national  media writters blindly support Christian values through out the Arab countries. Mm?
What exactly do you disagree with? The comparison of Jesus to Mohammed? The comparison of Islam to Christian doctrines?
Canada is considered a medium size country and of course one of the wealthiest. There is no reason  that this has to be an American story while you sit up there and throw shix balls and act like you are superior in any way shape or form.  Take your own poll. It's considered normal to poll your own issues rather than use some other nation's polling to make yourself look good.  Muslims are far safer in the U.S. than in Canada and your hate crime rate is twice that of the U.S. And you're perfectly happy to dwell in ignorance for no other reason than it makes you feel good.
The US had been interfering in the Middle East since WW2, primarily funding the takeover of land in Palestine. Yet the 9/11 commission did not consider retaliation as a reason for 9/11. In fact the media seems reluctant to use "retaliation" as the cause of "terrorist" attacks by Muslims.  So a 9/11 style investigation would be useless.
Maybe we should focus on our many issues here in the United States and stop spending money we don't have to help people that don't want our help.   In many cases in the Middle East the fact is the leaders just don't like Americans messing with their way of life and the teachings of Islam. Maybe if they followed the teaching of Jesus more then Mohammed they would have more peace then war? Maybe we should send them a million Bibles and not a trillion dollars and countless American lives and then produce more of our own oil and gas and stop buy oil from them.  John McCain,  if you want to fight a bloodless war then fight to balance the budget and pay our 20 trillion dollar debt and bring prosperity back to our nation with more high paying jobs and much more oil and gas production here in Alaska and all over America!  We need Peace not War, they have fought for two thousand years and they will keep fighting, we need to stay out of the Middle East Wars when we have so much oil and gas here!
There exists a horrible problem of extremism in the Muslim world at present. What is routinely overlooked by those who want to blame all of Islam and all Muslims is that the vast majority of victims of Islamic extremism - well over 99% of them - are Muslims. We only hear about bombings when the happen in the West. To say that Islam is at fault and that all Muslims are terrorists is to say that Muslims enjoy and support having their own children blown to pieces in acts of terrorism. This is absurd on the face of it.  I've traveled in Islamic regions as well, and I too have experienced overwhelming goodness from the people. The same goes for Muslims I know here in the States. I will no more judge them by the acts of a few then I will judge all white Catholics by, say, the actions of the Irish Republican Army (and I'm old enough to remember when some Americans did this). I do not oppose security standards for those entering our country, but I do oppose applying them unequally.
So your point is what?  We have to be equal opportunity advocates to terrorism, and thus we should open the borders to every nation that has Muslim extremists?  The better idea is to prevent extremism wherever we can.  There is lots of Muslim extremism that isn't tied to Twitter comments, but actual bombs going off.  http://www.religionofpeace.com  That being so, it's better to not allow those terrorists into this nation.
This really has nothing to do with left-wing/right-wing extremists because both are nothing more than mouse facts. It's about freedom of speech. You may not like what she said (and I'm NOT defending her statements- so all you liberals can just save taxing your brains trying to come up with a suitable insult) but she has as much right to say it as a Muslim would have to spout nonsense about an anti-muslim conspiracy. Y'all need to back away from the keyboard and actually DO something productive. Start a recall petition if you want. But quit being crybabies. And make sure you give the same treatment to a Muslim (or anyone else) politician who uses their "faith" or ethnicity to bash others over the head.
"Authentic Muslim"? Who would that be? The one who adheres to the literal meaning of the Qur'an, as it is written, since it is "THE" revelation?  Or the one who interprets the Qur'an and is considered by the first group as lax, and not good Muslim?   With all due respect, I don't think you actually understand what you are talking about. Really.  And you certainly did not get any of my point you are trying to respond to ... or you decided simply to ignore them. Either way, it does not look good on you.
The old adage about "walking a mile in another's shoes" hit home for me a couple of weeks ago when the DPRK and DJT were rattling their nuclear sabers.  I know it wouldn't be an even fight between our countries, but it wasn't hard to imagine millions of refugees in both countries seeking aid, shelter and comfort should the unthinkable occur.  Trump's almost-closed door policy toward refugees and those seeking immigration from primarily Muslim countries has to be the worst among his many reprehensibly heartless policies.  We as a nation are so removed by privilege, proximity and even truthful knowledge of those in the Middle East and Africa who have literally nothing, including basic shelter and food.  I suspect those who prefer to feel safe and protected from refugees, rather than welcoming and serving them, are also among those who claim to be followers of Jesus.   I wonder what Jesus thinks?
Muslim or not, these parents lost their son. What is the matter with Trump, he could win by a landslide if he were a little more presidential and a lot less confrontational.
While Muslims excoriate us about supposed Islamophobia, we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched homophobia, misogyny, Judeophobia, Christiophbia, Buddahphobia Europhobia, Americanophibia, democratiophobia, Bibliophobia, iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other.
A fundamentalist Muslim refusing service to a woman (or her "complicit" husband) because she is not wearing a burqa could say he/she is upholding a matter of principle that effects the whole human race.
this is a major reason why we need to be welcoming refugees by the boatloads, many of them are are skilled techies with brain power far above millions of those residing in the US who are crying for brainless Muslim bans, bogus $Trillion walls, and destructive deportation.
Let's not rush to judgement.  It could just as likely have been a disgruntled Obamacare opponent or a pro-lifer or a conservative republican or an evangelical Christian or maybe even a Trump supporter.  There's no evidence, or historical or otherwise, the shooter was a Muslim.   Islam as we all know is the religion of peace.  And I wouldn't be so quick to classify it as terrorism.  It's more likely workplace violence.
I agree, the silence is deafening. Even the American Muslim community has not condemned this terrorist act against children.  It only goes to fuel the fear that many Muslims, while not terrorists themselves are sympathetic to terrorists and condone their actions.
Wrong.   The party line ---- " Muslim Ban- Moot Build Wall- Moot Mexico Pays For Wall- Moot Send 11 Million Mexicans Home Day One- Moot Repeal Obamacare- Moot Balance Budget- Moot"  reduced Clinton and the Democrats to making "Make America Great" hats.
As the Monty Python school of theology underscored "Every sperm is sacred" there is no way the RCC will accept gay relationships as equal to hetero. The sperm will never connect with an egg, unless in in vitro fertilization which for the RCC is a no-no. This anti-gay position is ironic given the RCC is the last & largest closet of gay members left in western society.  The RCC & Islam are ecumenical with one another in the being anti-gay, and maintaining hierarchy of male clergy.  How many female imams? This article pleads for inclusion politely.  Politeness is not a convincing argument, nor reason with the RCC.  It's a power ideology that is the MO imperative. No matter how polite this article wouldn't see the light of day in the other NCR!
First Greece then Italy thats just common sense, regarding India and Pakistan these are the facts on wikepedia n 711 CE, when the Umayyad dynasty sent a Muslim Arab army led by Muhammad bin Qasim against the ruler of Sindh, Raja Dahir. Following the birth of Islam in Arabia in the early 7th century, the Muslim Arabs rose to power and replaced the Zoroastrian Persian Empire as the major power west of India in the mid 7th century. In 711–713 AD, Arab armies from the Umayyad caliphate of Damascus conquered Sind and advanced into the present-day southern Punjab, gaining control of Multan, which was later to become a center of the Ismaili sect of Islam. All references Arabs not Afgans.
Layla4, I have invited you more than once to make the mildest form of comment against anti-muslim bigotry, and you have never once taken me up on it.  I'd still like to see you do it.
I am bothered by the segregated mind set found in the religion he loves. Most are devoted to the religion over all else as Linda Sarsure let slip at a recent ISNA event attended by all Muslims. I would be interested to know if he supports Linda and her Islamic ideas such as not to assimilate and your devotion must be to Allah first and utmost. We must live with and contend with the reality and not the fantasy view of him or his devotions.
If you find one under your bed, don't kick her out or the cbc will run a headline, Canadian kicked out an innocent muslim for quietly sleeping under a Canadian's bed. Have Canadian's become so unsympethetic?
A couple of thoughts.  "a suggestion that a book featuring a black Canadian would not be of interest to anyone who was not black." Not dissimilar to the constant refrain on television news from newscasters who feel the need to announce, "Stay tuned, and we will tell you how this next story might impact YOU!" As if no one would be interested in any news that doesn't directly impact THEM! Apparently enough to make it necessary...  Second. An illustrated children's book depicting Muslims is a great idea...but somewhat self-contradictory. Isn't a tenet of the faith that one should not represent people...?
I am not in favour of this process because IMHO this is a matter for the provinces to address but it is not just happening in the USA.  Perhaps you missed the  mass shooting that occurred on the evening of January 29, 2017, at the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec City, a mosque in the Sainte-Foy neighbourhood of Quebec City, Canada. Six people were killed and nineteen others injured when a lone gunman (alleged to be Alexandre Bissonnette who had expressed far-right, white nationalist, and anti-Muslim views) opened fire shortly after the end of evening prayers.
That's just it...he may not be richer than his Dad was...his Dad's final estate valued at close to $100 million in tangible negotiable assets...and he never went bankrupt, and though reputed to be a racist and an SOB, was never sued for non-payment or f-ing over his employees or contractors....  There are lots of people down here that go to Penn, that are rich and well-connected who are total rednecks...I had a senior VP from a big telecom company come and speak to a management class and he is ALL for Trump...and all for sending African-Americans back to Africa, Muslims back to wherever they come from (he wasn't really sure where the Muslims belong), and the Jews back to Palestine (except his banker)... . If your point is that Trump has broad appeal across class lines, he doesn't...he appeals to those with NO class at all (or as one of my students said, "the ones that have class with a capital 'K'")
"You are not in a muslim country."  I see Alceste disagrees.
I ask you Liberal Democrats: How can the Muslims/Isalamist live side by side with Larry.
Truck attack and not Islamic terrorist?
Once again another follower of the Region of Peace shows us just how peaceful Islam REALLY is...
Yes, like a large truck used by the Death Cult of Islam - that killed 84 and wounded about 150.  Or a knife used by a murder in Japan - that killed 19 and wounded about 25.
Ever since the start of planned agriculture  10,000 years ago, there has always been sufficient food for any existing population. A crop failure in one place can be alleviated  by food distribution from another.  All famines are political, happening when food is actually withheld from those who need it. The Irish Potato famine, the Ukraine famine, Bangladesh were all man made disasters. This is no different. So what are all the liberals and socialists going to do about all of these disasters in failed Islamic states? What are all these big hearted liberals going to do to actually solve this famine? Absolute nothing, except blame Trump for doing nothing, or doing too much, or doing the wrong thing or doing it at the wrong time. Trump wants to stop the reason suffer and is hated for it.
I get it. Our disagreement here, you're now calling me "racist". This is the "you're the one talking about race, so you must be the racist" angle. Here's the thing: racial inequality and white supremacy are as American as apple pie and millions of Muslims who were born in or became citizens of the United States. (See what I did there.) People like you, this subject matter makes you uncomfortable. And if nothing changed about death rates of unarmed non-whites, you'd be fine with the idea, your main "issue" is that people talk about it. So here you are, trying to shout me down. And you are failing. Philando Castile's murder proved that a black man can't legally own a firearm.
Maybe Canadians need reassurance from "moderate muslims", that they don't really support sharia and eventual Islamic supremacy,and an explanation how things here will turn out differently than they are turning out in Europe.
Well, people also have every right to say no to any cemetery at their backyard, whether it's Muslim or not.
There are many more different varieties of Christianity than there are of Islam, they have been evolving and splitting off  into branches for 2000 years, which should make it more difficult to  generalize, but that doesn't prevent all those people concerned about "post-fact" impressions from depending on their impressions of some US Evangelicals today to claim that is what "Christianity" is...
The far left .... that's communism and frankly I don't see that anywhere in this country. What I see is a left leaning group that supports rights for women and all people. One that treats all people in society with dignity not just the well healed. I see a left that still has both poor and wealthy citizens but just not as extreme as what resides in the dreamscape of the American right like those of the Tea Party wacko's and most of the GOP.  That left also supports religious freedom from not only Christians but Muslims or Buddhists.  Only a narrow minded person would think there is some sort of far left movement here. You need to get outside of Breitbart news more often.
The flow of illegal Muslims from the US is continuing but ever obedient media CBC, CTV, and Globe simply aren't reporting it any more. The cross border has increased over the summer,  and is now treated as a legitimate way to come to Canada. Illegal is the new normal.
Oh goody, Germany and France as well as Canada will get another few million Muslims refugees to take care of.    Let's all put on sack cloth and ashes to atone for our lack of compassion.
And which Muslim nation is it that has a veto?
Let's have Mexico take in a million displaced Muslims and then let's see how welcoming Mexicans remain.
Teachers already are..more so when O started his student singing his songs...water pistol shooting POTUS Trump on the blackboard...Pledge of Allegiance going going gone...Muslim religion replacing GOD....transgender restroom/shower/locker rooms is acceptable...PC running amok over common sense etc etc..."liberal indoctrination".
Liberals believe  Islamophobia is never be acceptable in Canada.  Therefore throwing gays from buildings, or hanging them 10 at a time in the town square is  Islamic justice we should accept if we Canadians are to be tolerant and non judgemental towards immigrants.   Otherwise we are as bad as Trump who doesn't want the sort of thing in the US .
Actually it's just the opposite.  Why are there so many terrorist attacks across the World?  Who are the terrorists?  People with no pride or connection to their country.    "Many young Muslims see no opportunities for themselves and do not feel they have control over their lives or a stake in their nation's future. Such pessimism leads to disengagement. We risk losing a generation of young Muslims to apathy and extremism." Najib Razak
Anti-Muslim feeling in Canada can be explained by the actions of the media. In reporting on attacks by Muslim "terrorists", the media NEVER mentions that Muslims have been attacked prior to the Muslim attack. For example NATO countries attacked Afghanistan. Then Canada, France, Germany and Britain were attacked. Further no matter how justified NATO's action was, and I believe it was not, countries attacking should expect retaliation.   The media provides no background. Muslims are simply attacking the west, killing innocent people. No mention of the Muslims killed by invasions of Muslim countries.
I can't but help thinking about past immigrants such as the Chinese and East Indians. They marinated parts of their culture but generally integrated into the Canadian society. The muslims seem to be quite different in that regard. Perhaps too demanding.
People all over the world are nervous about Muslims and Canada is no different. Hatred is a strong word but we cannot pretend Canada's public welcomes them with open arms.
I'm on DT Jr.s side...and not with London Muslim Mayor and UK's PC liberal ideology.
What? No Indonesia...the most populace Muslim country on Earth??
Actually, Erdogan is muslim and his intent is an islamic state.
MSW, I did as you advised and replaced "sharia law" with 'canon law".  The result is nonsensical.    "Moreover, many tenets of sharia law (canon law) directly contradict the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Sharia law (canon law) permits cruel and unusual punishments; the open-ended sharia blasphemy laws (canon blasphemy laws) makes free speech highly problematic; and the apostasy and dhimmitude laws more or less cancel out religious freedom."  There is no comparison of canon law, which is for how Catholics should act as part of their religion, with sharia law, which is how Muslims and every Dhimmi in their countries must act in all aspects of their private and public life or face prosecution and death.
Your reasons for not voting for Hillary are sound.  Your reasons for not voting for Trump are ALL LIES. Either the "concern" is a hoax, as with the Global Warming Hoax, or the "threatened" Trump actions ARE NOT IMMORAL. I.e., there's nothing immoral about stopping Muslim immigration. There's nothing immoral about deporting illegal aliens. There's nothing immoral about settling Syrian refugees in safe zones outside the U.S. There's nothing immoral about reducing job-killing exorbitant marginal tax rates, even if they are tendentiously called "tax breaks for the rich." There's nothing immoral about South Korea's building nuclear weapons.  So, the reasons for refusing to vote for Hillary are sound, and real, while all the reasons given for not voting for Trump are fantasies.  This is, sadly, typical of the Catholic Left.
There's plenty of muslim murder from which to choose--why limit it to just one attack?  It was the home to one of the 9/11 terrorists.  Besides, the London Bridge attack was not even the latest muslim attack.
lol .... you misunderstood. Is the connection to their murderous religion ideas. if your religion keeps brainwashing 2 and 3 year olds telling them that other believes are insulting to islam and those people are not humans .... you will have radicals. Is been connected to the religion not "disconnected" the problem !!!.
"What part of Public Education do Muslims not understand."  More to the point, what part of the constitutional "freedom of religion and conscience" and the legal duty of reasonable accommodation do YOU not understand?  Here's the good thing about this kind of reasonable accommodation, no matter what religion it affects: it keeps kids in the public system, rather than forcing parents to have their own schools.  Public education is the single best way of introducing Canadian values to new Canadians.
"While the rest of the world was raining (rightful) condemnation on President Donald Trump for his Muslim ban..."   Muslim ban? What Muslim ban. Dozens of Muslim majority countries are not subject to the temporary travel restrictions. The 7 countries subject to the proposed restrictions are the ones that the Obama administration identified as being subject to special scrutiny. Why these countries? Because there is no central authority who can provide information to help vet the travel applicants.   This is not a Muslim ban and the writer knows it. But somehow it has become de rigueur to parade this type of moral exhibitionism, and fake outrage. Why are these writers never called out for "fake news" or "alternative facts"?
Trump's Muslim ban has never been about security or it would have included Saudi Arabia. Saudis made up the majority of 911 terrorist attackers and killed thousands of Americans. Trump does business with the Saudi government (if you call Theocratic Royal Family Dictators a government). For that matter the USA has protected the Saudis for years because of OIL. Even while the Saudis paid for thousands of Religious schools for poor boys to attend, which drilled into these boys anti-American hatred. We continue to look the other way while the Saudi "government" suppresses free speech, women, freedom of religion, religious police that harass citizens, and public execution by sword. America's hypocrisy knows no bounds!
"99% of Islamists are peaceful"   As are the vast majority of firearms owners in this country, however that doesn't stop many from calling for either adjustments to their rights, or bundling them into the crimes committed by those that would misuse guns.
Well,  the fact is that he is only the 20th Muslim to be arrested in American on terrorism charges, since 911.  That is out of 3.5 MILLION Muslims in our nation.  This is just a small, vocal, and dangerous minority within Islam.  They seek attention and publicity with their acts of terror and murder.  While there may be many Muslims that share their ultra conservative religious beliefs, they are not dangerous people.  It is just as equally wrong for the tiny minority of people that are in white supremacy groups in our nation, to be used to then paint all conservative white Americans as being racists.   They hold their offensive demonstrations to gain attention and publicity too.  Many Conservatives and Liberals in our nation, both unfortunately like to engage in such unfair and biased stereotyping, which is very un-American in nature.   There is guilt across the political spectrum in our society.   But most are so blinded by their ideology, that they don't see it applying to them.
There are sections in existing cemeteries allotted for different faiths. Muslims cry all the time that they are not integrated and that they suffer from "islamophobia". Maybe if they stopped demanding special treatments and using the Charter for their own benefit, would the communities feel less resentfull towards them and more incline to integrate them. As it is, they simply don't want to be integrated and they profit from their 'victims' position.
"...the coalition is training allied rebels."? This is pretty close to a contradiction in terms. Are these 'allied rebels' not Islamic fundamentalists? Isn't the U.S. guilty of training and arming the Syrian version of the Afghanistan Mujahedin? What do the Americans do with all these extremist fighters once final victory is presumably achieved? Shoot them? If so it would have an example in the Soviet N.K.V.D. after the war which shot all the Polish, Czech, Ukrainian, etc. partisans they could find, even if they were good Communists.
Prayer rug. Maybe they thought the Muslim Obumbler was still in the WH.
Their argument is here: "The continual debasing of Muslims... is precisely why it is important for Muslims to see their leaders (in Ottawa) express solidarity with them."  I disagree with the dependency model of government that the columnists are invoking.  They describe the Liberal government in Ottawa as the leaders of Canadian Muslims.  Um, what?  I do not recognize ANY government in Ottawa, Tory or Liberal, to be leaders of me and my family and friends.  I do ABSOLUTELY recognize government in Ottawa as the proper, rightful leader of Canada as a NATION. And so, for example, if there were a war that required my draft into the army, I would accept that law as a dutiful citizen. But I would do so NOT IN RECOGNITION of Parliament being the leader of myself or my family or friends, but merely as leaders of Canada, being the appropriate policy makers for this nation's course.   Pleases stop inflating the expected role of the federal government. We are not a tribe, we are a modern nation.
The Arabic calligraphy on the homepage of the exhibit appears to be the Basmalah, the first verse of the first chapter of the Qur'an: "Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim", "In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate"--a sentiment both Muslims and Christians can get behind.
Gary,: . Al Jazeera World News recently featured "The legacy of the Crusades in contemporary Muslim world, the conflict between the West and the Arab and Islamic worlds is at its core political." . The title alone violated your guideline.  Perhaps you should get your "news" from Twitter.
Muslims and Christians co-existed historically more than Germans and the French. Europe has had continuous wars from the 1st century to the mid 20th century. The peace we see now in in the EU is the longest period of peace in the last 2000 years.
Recall that the Trump administration's claim with the initial executive order attempting to ban travel for citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries was that it needed 90 days to "improve vetting procedures". That was 119 days ago.  It would have been interesting, had the court not rejected the government's appeal based on the transparently discriminatory rationale behind the ban, for it to have requested a progress report on this from the Department of Justice.
I don't think her article acknowledges right wing terrorism as so much as saying that the incident by this sad, and apparently mentally ill man, is the same as pre-meditatied, planned, and coordinated bloodbaths that have taken place at London Bridge and in Manchester.  I think most people realize hate groups occur on both the left and the right.  What she is trying to do is to convince readers that these lone and random acts of violence by some old white dude is the same as mass murder campaigns by Islamic thugs.  If this is the case, then mafia hits are just another random crime.  And they aren't and neither are these barbaric islamic terrorists.  I hope I was able to clear this up for you.
Thomas Friedman, whose writings are far above you, said that if the Jews were living in Muslim countries in the 1930s, there would be 6 more million Jews alive today.  There is a reason that many Jews get dual citizenship of Israel. They are never sure when their gentile neighbours will turn against them.
Christianity, the Lord's Prayer and Christmas are banned from schools. But the Muslim's get to practise their religion, at the same school, in their own room dedicated to them.  I don't get it. No wonder people are outraged. This country and this school board are saps and are being walked on all over. You would even think that the Muslims would feel,this was unfair, but of course they don't.
The Anchorage Assembly does have the authority to do something about Demboski's inexcusable radio rant about the Joneses and the Muslim boogymen in Alaska.  How about if the Assembly members require that Demboski wear a veil over her head and face until next election?
I have a better plan: Let's tax fearful thoughts and impose a 15% tax on all non-Islamic persons to make up for the nasty thoughts.   Of course, members of the Liberal Party will be exempt as they pure as driven snow.
The headline should be changed, since the election dealt a welcome blow to the re-emergent far-right, not “populism”.  “firebrand populism”   All this really refers to is the empty rhetoric of the re-emergent far-right, paying lip service to the public's concerns in order to empower itself.   The far-right can't be called 'populist' because it does nothing to empower the disenfranchised, and quite the opposite, it exploits the fear and anger at the many daunting crises facing us, largely caused by the right's monopoly on power, to win support, but then it redirects that anger from those deserving of it, and onto the usual scapegoats; minorities, immigrants, Muslims, and of course those they've deemed liberals, progressive, and the left - those who pose the only real threat to the status quo.
Your critique of Atwood's glory is weakened by your self-defensive desire to see Islam punished in her literature, not Christianity. Atwood's views have nothing to do with either Christianity or with Islam. She's a feminist, period, and her villains are men, not men's 'religions'. She distorts her own message with the silly stuff about enslaving women in middle-America. All this can be confusing, because religious fundies (like yourself, I suppose) are not going to "enslave" women soon, or perhaps ever. But you will restrict their access to birth control, and some, like Mike Pence, will promote a kind of subservience to men and glorify the Abuser-in-Chief, Trump. Atwood's "dystopia" would have been set in a Buddhist society if she had been an Asian, not a middle-class Anglo from Ontario (where there are more crosses on the horizon than crescents). Your own agenda can be met by writing an anti-Islamic dystopia, which you should do. You really have missed the mark here.
Ah yes, the imaginary right wing war on Christianity. ASD has been doing this for years, although before this year it was always for the Jewish holiday, but now that there’s a Muslim holiday there, all of a sudden people are triggered. I’ll admit it is strange Anchorage is the only district in Alaska doing this but it’s whatever. It’s Alaska High School football. If they wanted to play all their games on Thursdays I’m sure the parents and few students who attend would be ok with it and the public would be none the wiser.
Sounds Stuart Chambesa that you dont know any better!  Why try to attack heros who have understood the threat of Islam?  Sorry that you live in your little bubble with little exposure to the truth of what's happening in the world.
"There are more Muslims in the Israeli Knesset than there are Jews in all Islamic state governments combined" I fail to see the relevancy of that statement.  Are you comparing (so-called) democratic governments only (Israel is often labelled the only democracy in the Middle East)?  Taking into account the percentage of Jewish/Muslim populations in each country?  Who is allowed a vote in each country (are you aware that Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza aren't allowed to vote in Israeli elections but Jewish illegal settlers can)?  What other countries do/allow has no relevancy, IMO.
Europeans have an extremely low birthrate. They need immigrants from Africa, Middle east. Africa and Middle East, parts of Asia have a surplus of people. Europe needs to be more welcoming and less hostile. If you look at England in question the most common baby name is a Moslem name (first name) This problem if not corrected will grow every  year.
For someone using "logic" you post is sadly lacking on it.  YOUR premise is that all Muslims (immigrants) are/were jihadists. The correct analogy would be all former jihadists, not all Muslims, which is not what Ascalepius posted...
http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/01/times-banned-immigrants-170128183528941.html  "Six other times the US has banned immigrants                    Donald Trump's 'Muslim ban' is not the first time specific groups or nationalities have been blocked from the US."
Ecole Politechnique in Montreal was Islamic inspired as well, but we are not supposed to know it.
Is there any evidence in countries that ban religious headgear, e.g., France, that there have been more attacks on muslims as a result?  I would be interested in seeing that data, if any exists.
Come on AP what other groups you mean like the Muslim brotherhoods front like CAIR and other Muslim fanatical groups controlled by the brotherhood since 1982 when all these groups infiltrated our colleges across the U.S.A.
The only troll is Amira herself, trolling for Islam and for western civilization's submission to the Koran. Her hijab is the sign she handed her fate to Allah. Giving up free will is just one thing Muslims ar expected to sacrifice for their religion.  6th posting
Probably about 90+% of Canadians cheer for the courage the Quebec government had to ban this instrument of torture and humiliation (niquab). The few who support it are a very, very small minority of super-ultra-bigoted Muslims and a few do-gooders (?) who are so clueless to believe that a woman can wear such an abomination out of free will.
We're used to being told there are problems with systemic racism and sexism in our society. What Couillard was saying, and what a great many people think, is that there are systemic problems with intolerance in Islam.  The evidence for that is very clear: witness the attitude towards other religions in Islamic countries--the very term "Islamic country" pretty much says it all. So no one is saying that most Muslims are supporters of terrorism, or that they condone terrorism. No one is saying there are more bad Muslims than bad Christians or Jews. What is being suggested is that Muslim community leaders and religious officials in Canada and elsewhere look at what passes for legitimate discourse in their circles—including what they teach youngsters in their schools and what is preached in their mosques—and take responsibility for purging it of whatever bigotry they find.
Orthodox Jews and Muslims also believe in the imminent return of a saviour,  blessings for the goodly and punishment for the wicked.    Who that saviour is, what constitutes punishment - these things vary.  No way you could get 41-48% of Americans or Canadians believing in that as the numbers of believers in orthodox Islam or Judaism are simply not there.  Fringe would be secondary in that consideration.  Funny, I thought it was a pretty standard comparison and readily understood belief (rapture).  But then I live in Alberta.
“It’s a hard blow for the opposition, no doubt about it,”   The opposition are largely islamists - the less of the better. i won't shed a tear for any of them.
"Without naming the Conservatives, he (Trudeau,) said the motion proves there are still people “uncomfortable” with condemning Islamophobia, or discrimination against Muslims."  What nonsense.  Conservatives are not in any way uncomfortable condemning Islamophobia . . . if it was at least in some way defined.     To be a successful and inclusive motion, M103 must condemn hate speech against all, and not single out one religion, while remaining silent on all others.  Remove the reference to Islamophobia and focus on hate speech, regardless of whoever it affects, and this motion will be on the right track.
On Jan. 17, the same Saturday that Iran freed the American prisoners, Obama delivered $400 million in unmarked cash.  He says it's a coincidence.   Hillary wiped her server clean as a whistle before she left her job as Secretary of State.  She says she was dusting around the house that day.  Hillary said she had permission to keep the server in the basement.  Director Comey and the State Department said she never asked and never was given permission for her unsecured server.  The State Department said if she would have asked, she would have been denied.    The United States jailed the director/producer of the Muslim disrespectful video.  Hillary and Susan Rice concocted their lie to hide the fact that a preplanned Islamic terrorist attack killed our men in Benghazi and she failed to properly secure and defend the Benghazi installation.   "What difference does it make?" asks Hillary
Countering Buddhist extremism?   Catholic extremism?   Amish extremism?  If only there was a list of extremist violence from those religions -- but there's not.  However, the same cannot be said of Muslim extremism.  http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/attacks/attacks.aspx?Yr=Last30  One way to look at the victims of these violent attacks is that they are martyrs.  To ignore their deaths is to suggest they died in vain.  That so many are shown the gigantic amount of evidence of Muslim extremism and respond by saying it doesn't exist, and those who say it exists are "bigots"......it's quite a strange phenomena of our times.
Speaking of fake narratives readers should look behind the National Council of Muslims. The innocent title may hide ties to unsavoury organizations ....eg Hamas. That is suggested in the following article Ihttp://pointdebasculecanada.ca/harper-s-director-of-communications-sharper-s-director-of-communications-nccm-cair-can-documented-ties-to-a-terrorist-organization-such-as-hamas/
Your last paragraph perfectly encapsulates the effect on OTHERS from Muslims and the Koran...the whole world is topsy turvy.  M103 should never have been.  My Ukrainian grandparents were treated with prejudice.  They persevered and helped build this country.
"Honestly we've always planned to have a family of 5, 10, 12 children ... We're Irish, haha," he wrote in an e-mail.  He's is also Muslim. That little fact is  judiciously avoided in all reportage.
Or muslim.
There is no special interest privileging in the motion. It's calling for government to study the kind of hatred that seems to be consuming American discourse and to see that it doesn't happen here. Of course it upsets Conservatives who don't want to be labeled as bigots or racists as xenophobic hysteria is about the only "trump" card their leadership hopefuls have that gets them any press.  There's not thought policing. And the only Orwellian thing is the two minutes of hate people like Kellie Leitch seem to advocate every time they speak. And I don't know why you'd call Islamophobia a "tendentious neologism". The word is about a century old, so is getting a bit long in the tooth. And it's only tendentious if you think we should fear Muslims.
There are more Muslims in the Israeli Knesset than there are Jews in all Islamic state governments combined.
Doesn't matter about trump not serving,bill Clinton dodged the draft but is held up as a great president,that is invalid not a lot of presidents served but are patriotic,my point about kaepernick is he was abandoned by his black parents and adopted by white people who loved and nurtured him,and now he begins a protest,which nobody has a problem with just the manner to do it in,yes the USA have done stuff that were wrong,but have stopped it,problems will exists that need to be addressed,the method was wrong and offended a lot of people by it,he offended a lot of black people also,see the comments by Jim brown and others,there is a time and place he picked the wrong one,with his pig socks and Che tshirt,kind of think he has been brainwashed,by his Muslim girlfriend,who knows,the protests will not get anywhere just finger pointing.
This fact finding mission is nothing but a ploy by the Trudeau government to bring more Muslim refugees to Canada once Bob Rae reports to the world that conditions are terrible. The math is easy. 25,000 Syrians to Canada, 25,000 new Liberal voters. 100,000 Muslims from Myanmar, 100,000 new Liberal voters.
The media keeps calling it a "Muslim Ban" as oppose to "Terror-Prone countries" ban.  Could it be the media is biased against Trump and is still trying to paint him as a racist after that MLK bust story didn't catch on and was proven to be false?
It is off-the-cuff inasmuch as it is an executive order rather than a considered piece of policy flowing from legislation vetted through proper legislative channels.   The enemies of the US are galvanized by arbitrary and discriminatory actions against Muslims in that these actions feed the narrative pushed by extremists that the US is at war with Islam.  It is bigotry pure and simple to discriminate against people based on their religion.
"Their [sic] is a law on the books outlawing Muslims from even being in this country ..." I'm relatively certain that's not true, but I'll ask anyway: what law is that?
The Bank of Canada and the IMF predict economic growth will peak this year and decline in 2018 with a further decline in 2019.  For the first time since Papa Pierre, there are self inflicted deficits as far as the eye can see for no good reason and these will strangle growth if they continue and/or if interest rates rise above their current historical low.  These realities plus a litany of broken promises and three attempts already to rig the electoral system and emasculate parliament plus cash for access and other unseemly and borderline corrupt practices do not sit well with many Canadians not just Conservatives, Larry.  Add shameless pandering to Chinese communists- billionaires and to fake refugees illegally crossing the border of whom half have criminal records while Mounties are reduced to carrying their bags and the attempt to give special status to the Muslim religion and community and a lot of people are concerned.   But nice lipstick on that pig, Larry.  Don't ever change.
It looks like the moderators of this site are well aware of how muslim integration is going in Europe. The Globe should be ashamed of themselves. All they are doing is spreading a lie
But what is the intent behind the law? Are there really that many people wearing the niqab, which is uncommon even in most of the Islamic world? When I lived in the Middle East, it was either Saudi women or much older Arab women who normally wore it.
In fact if you were to go back to class you would find out that islam attempted to take Europe first - but then again most folks are always looking to excuse islam and nail Christianity to the cross - no pun intended. Apologists abound.
Let me get this straight, WesternPatriot: are you saying you now agree that: "France has 150 no go zones where sharia is the law of the land and islam controls all things except the welfare cheques" is a contemptible lie?
Nothing!!!!!!!!!!!...He wants everyone to be afraid of the Muslim Terrorist...He's even convinced some Trumpers on this board to hope for an attack...Sad, you're more likely to die from that Big Mac and cigarette than you are of Terrorist...You think you have control over the Big Mac and cigarette, and not of the Terrorist, and that's the ONLY difference...#MAGA
I'd like to see that scholar's quote.  But during the 30's the likes of Neville Chamerlain, Charles Lindbergh, Walter Guinness, Henry Ford, Hermann Schwinn, Maurice Papon, Sir Oswald Mosley, all stalwarts of the political right, were open admirers of and sympathizers with Hitler and Mussolini.  Many of them readily identified themselves as 'fascists.'  I'm sure you can come up with a list of Communists/Socialists from the same period who openly sympathized with Stalin (or if on the outs with his regime, Trotsky).  My point is, again, that they were not the same, and as political movements were as inimical to each other as the Union and the Confederacy.  The "reds"/"leftists" were one side, the "fascists"/"rightists", the other.  Believe me, I'm not taking sides.  Stalin slaughtered Muslims in Crimea and Chechnya.  Hitler slaughtered Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  If you said the former was a leftist, I'd agree.  But if you said that the latter was, I wouldn't.  MaSalaam, my friend...
File lawsuit after lawsuit against him through the ACLU.  That's working, by the way.    How's his Muslim ban working out for you?  Tired of winning yet?
Snakes in the grass, extremist hide in the crowd, right under our noses. Why are the 'moderate' muslims            not exposing them, because they support them.
Your definition is no more proper than that you decry.  Muslims believe in the Christ (alayhis-Salaam); in fact we won't refer to him by name or title without expressing our reverence via the honorific "upon him he (God's) Peace."  But we're not 'Christians.'  There is no shortage of bloodthirsty fanatics claiming either faith--and each and every one of them egregiously violates the authentic tenets of both.  You Christians have the Army of God, Christian Identity Movement, KKK, Lord's Resistance Army, Anders B. Breivik, Anti-Balaka, Phineas Priesthood, Maronite Phalange, Sirhan-Sirhan etc...  And of course we're afflicted with the Wahabbis and their foul outgrowths--al-Qa'eda, Boko Haram, the Taliban and the Da'esh (wrongly called "Islamic State").  And too many of my Muslim brethren are murdered for denouncing and opposing them.  But you never hear about that in the news.  Because your media is owned by the same corporate criminals who armed and financed al-Qa'eda and the Da'esh.
Rogue Chimp:  Your characterization of Demento's comments as "tribalism" is irony at its finest.  What is any religion but tribalism dressed up in supernatural garb?    As for the substance your comments, is it not possible that those who are worried about the effect of Islam on Canada are not exhibiting an irrational fear, but some caution?  Think about the majority of the news we receive about predominantly Muslim countries.  We see beheadings, hear about unacceptable treatment of women, read about treatment of other religions and terrible suicide bombings.  This is almost certainly not the whole story of the Muslim world, but it is the main story we receive in Canada.  Almost all of these items are antithetical to Canadians, including, I agree, the vast majority of Muslims.  Still, given this diet, is the reaction of many Canadians surprising?  Just a thought...
I was living in Australia when the Imam at the Lakemba Mosque was excusing the rape of Aussie girls by Muslim gangs by claiming that women who dress immodestly were asking for it. Meanwhile, Muslim taxi drivers were refusing to take passengers with service dogs or customers who were carrying alcohol
OAN yesterday reported that Khizr Khan is engaged in bringing Muslims into the US illegally and has written articles defending Sharia Law.  His writings reference Muslim Brotherhood leaders.  Why doesn't the MSM and ADN tell it like it is?  Also take a look at cities where Muslims have overtaken the city councils and established Sharia Law right here in the US.  Also what about the states that have passed laws to outlaw this practice?  There is an abundance of activities by Muslims implementing their will over Americans in communities where they dominate the population, but MSM avoids reporting this.
Can you please expand on what the muslims have done since 624AD??   And what about what has been done by the Christians????
Nothing wrong with Leitch wanting to filter out the fundamental anti-pluralistic Wahhabi Salafist brand of Muslim immigration applicants.   But this is not a high priority for most Conservative Party members.
But in Islam it is.
I dislike Trump but it is true that it was a Northern-ancestry white woman killed in the Charlottesville, not anyone from the Global South.    By contrast, in 2017, 13+ killed by this Islamic truck in Spain just yesterday, 3 killed in the Islamic truck attack near Parliament in Britain (and 22 (mostly teenage girls) killed in Manchester by Islamic shrapnel), 4 killed by Islamic truck in Stockholm, and in 2016, 12 killed by Islamic truck in Berlin and 86 killed by Islamic truck in Nice.   You can see how the way this looks by contrast to one death in Charlottesville by Northerner car attack (which killed a Northern white woman, not anyone from the Global South) is going to fuel the Trumpsters.
The world is desperately in need of prayers and caring thoughts...from Christians, Muslims, and those good people simply seeking the truth with sincere hearts without any religious affiliation! Who on earth opposes anyone who wants to pray, especially for those sad, misguided souls who are intent on being hurtful, even threatening to burn down a mosque! We need to be nurturing kindness, not resentment.
As a woman, I am scared witless of Islam mass immigration, thanks to people like torontoguy and Sher-al-Hindustan and others on these boards who keep telling us western society is evil, we deserve to have our culture destroyed because of our past "sins", Muslim societies are better. Who dismiss criticism of the treatment of women in Islam as "racism" and "bigotry".  Because they make me realize how fragile the freedoms I take for granted as a western woman, really are, and how easily they can be reversed when there are enough people like them to really influence our society.  There are plenty of Muslim women who appreciate the west for the sanctuary it provides them from the extremists who have taken over their religion and countries, and those should be welcomed. But no, I do not want the extremists to be welcome here. Call me a spoiled, selfish western female, who cares about retaining the freedoms to which she has unreasonably become accustomed...
The one thing Obama will defend............Islam.
How many members are in the Muslim Association of Hawaii versus how many Pacific Islanders in our state that are in need of representation by our State AG  in defense of their Federal rights and resources? Probably like 5 versus thousands. Is this the proper utilization of our State AG office??  Why is our state government letting Mr Chin get away with this???
If people are fearful that is not Trump's fault. It is the fault of the Dems that have allowed the chaos at the borders to continue. It is the Dems who have allowed criminals to come into this country and stay here. If fear is behind the support that Trump has received it is because people have very good reasons to be fearful.   I'm glad to hear that you are concerned with safety. Then you should realize that to be concerned for safety has nothing to do with being a racist or anti-muslim or anti-immigrant.   You have to define your terms. What do you mean by "Fascist"? The one's stirring up fear are the leftists who control the main stream media and the Dems.  When someone asserts a falsehood against another, without having any proof to support his assertion, he is committing slander.   Don't you think that your reference to Our Lord is a bit self-righteous. It is the Secular Liberals, the Progressives and the Democrats that represent totalitarians, not Trump.
I'm not really surprised that a large percentage of Muslims express negative views about homosexuality as this aligns with views in many other conservative religious communities. A 2015 Pew Research Center study of attitudes among American Christians  indicated that despite increasing tolerance only 54% believe homosexuality should be accepted by society. However, support levels are lower in some faith communities, including members of historically black Protestant congregations (51%), Evangelical Protestants (36%), Mormons (36%) and Jehovah's Witnesses (16%). Acceptance is highest among Roman Catholics (70%) and mainline Protestants (66%). Given the Pew Research Center results, it seems to me that the real challenge to tolerance arises within the broader context of organized religion, and particularly among those who hold fundamentalist beliefs.   http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/12/18/most-u-s-christian-groups-grow-more-accepting-of-homosexuality/
Cooper does not imply that executive orders cannot be reviewed by the courts.  An executive order to round up American citizens who are Muslim and imprison them could and should have been overturned by the courts since the constitution guarantees due process to American citizens.  However, existing legislation and the constitution are entirely consistent with a president controlling immigration policy.  That is the over reach.  The courts require existing law or the constitution on which to base their decisions.  The courts no longer hold themselves to that standard and feel free to legislate.
Try and remember that "Christians" have also been behind terrorist attacks on U.S. soil (Sikh Temple, Charleston, Oklahoma City...).  You will find one common thread with all terror acts committed under the banner of religion - a perverse ideology that is not accepted by the majority of the members of whatever faith they profess.  Fundamentalist ideologies are the problem - not the religions themselves.  All of my Muslim friends are horrified by the atrocities committed by Islamic fundamentalists.    As a Christian, are you horrified by the Dylann Roofs and Timothy McVeighs of the world?  Moreover, should the blame be laid to all of Christianity for these unholy acts of terror?  Your logic seems to imply so - and I hope I'm wrong.
What was that line from "Blowing in the Wind"? "Frankly, I don't give damn". Look them up yourself  Trump is a like the guy who brings all the goodies to the party and he's still reviled and despised. He "regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."  "One of the most disgusting aspects of intellectual dishonesty is when anyone of  "any stripe" lets their ideology blind them to the truth." Boy Howdy.
Interesting that almost every comment supporting the minority position cites Muslims.  While last year’s influx was predominantly Muslim (thanks to the West’s ineffectiveness in curtailing Bashar al-Assad’s barbarism), who is to say that all future refugees will be Muslim?  Political strife can easily occur under any religion…..or none at all.  Just look at the Iron Curtain countries of a couple of decades ago.
Islam is not a malevolent ideology, it's a religion, just as Christianity is.
Since this girls team was not from one of Trump’s condemmed nations, I can’t help but wonder what is so frightening about their presence in America.  That they are female?  Muslim? Or is it the science/technology thing?  Three strikes…you’re out!
My fear, and it is well founded, is that it won't  be the law that is taught, but the radical feminist view of men.  (see Christie Blatchford's columns on family law and how it is highly discriminatory towards men).  Note that the teaching for "social justice" has turned members of  Law Society of Ontario into pile of non-thinking Christianaphobes  to the point where they refuse to even consider allowing graduates of  Christian law schools from applying to become members of the bar.  Yet, they have no issue with graduates from foeign Islamic Schools writing the bar exams.
The fastest growing religion in the world is the Muslim faith. Fastest growing religion in Canada is the Muslim faith. According to stats Canada census 1966 Muslims made up less then 1000 people. Fast track to 2017 and its pushing 2 million and growing. Issues like today will become more common in the future. This comment will be deleted if published.............
tweet away president trump - instead of submitting to aholes like the Associated Press to "interpret" and "define" what you want. As for the old school legal hierarchy, this whole legal system is showing itself as useless in the digital age. Remember the Arab spring? How do you think those thousands of Egyptians gathered at _______ square to show support for getting rid of the muslim bhood. Tweet away, Mr President.....
Your limited perspective is not based on "facts."  ..."a large number of Islamic extremists?" The Syrian refugees are not the extremists - they're victims seeking an escape from extremism.
I didn't know that we had that many Muslims from the six countries that visit or attend school in Hawaii that will adversely affect Hawaii's economy.  Lets face it, this is nothing more than liberal politics at its worst.
Decorum (?) cops need to lighten up.  In this regard, they are v. ecumencial w. some Muslims.
I think you're completely off base with your interpretation of that article. MacDonald's point is that in contrast to the paranoia and fear mongering about Muslims terrorists, the reality is that mass murders in Canada are far more likely to be committed by white, Christian males, not by olive skinned Muslims. As has been pointed out by others, we don't know the motivation for Bissonette's attack so we don't know if it was religiously motivated or not.  Therefore we can easily compare him to other mass murders since motivation is not a factor in the comparisons. Not only is it irrelevant as you say but it;s deliberately irrelevant so there's no point in your trying to make it something out of it.  You're reading far too much into alleged motives behind MacDonald's article with your confusion about religion vs ethnicity. You're looking for something that is simply not there. Maybe pull back from your paranoia and self-victimization and take it as written.
Over the next few days queue up the 101 articles in the Globe telling us how muslims have enriched Canadian life, come here at great peril to themselves, how their right to practice their religion is enshrined in the constitution, etc.
The Semites are a linguistic group that includes several races living in the ME and North Africa, that have many belief systems including Judaism and Islam.  Islam is a belief system held by many in the ME, South Asia and South Eastern Asia.
I don't use code words TD Magoo.   I say outright that a Muslim majority would be a disaster for this nation's liberties.  You think immersion in Canada will change Islam? Good luck with that fantasy.   The historical footnote may well be our thousand year march to liberty.  But hey, just because a British survey of 100,000 Brit Muslims indicated widespread support for adoption of Sharia law, including amongst younger Muslims, that's nothing to be concerned about. They'll mellow. And be absorbed into the fabric of democracy.  Sure they will.
Last I checked, Islam wasn't a race.  But feel free to obfuscate...
When you're dead you're dead ..so live with! No point in having religious based cemeteries. Just another push by the muslim community for special accommodation. Why do we never hear anything from the Hindu, Buddhist or other religious groups...maybe muslims could keep quiet for a bit and just settle down and try to fit into Canadian society.
Goodale is using Islamic terrorism to hide what they are truly up to. The left is trying to round up as many right wing voters so they don't need to worry about getting voted out. It's called big brother and if you don't obey jr's castro side shows up and his SS removes  you.
Or Pakistan with the persecution of Ahmadi Muslims by the majority Muslims (Sunni?)
Maybe Hillary is happy the Democrats are taking over the Trump administration.  According to far right publications that supported Trump, General Mattis is a liberal Democrat who is appointing to his staff. Gerald Kushner (Democrat) has led this effort to get rid of Bannon and strengthen those with Democratic ties. Mattis worked with Obama and supported Clinton. General McMaster is a friend of Islam (he told Trump not to say "radical islami". Everyone in the cabinet who is from Goldman Sachs is democrat, inducing Gary Cohn, a Democrat opposed to Trump's trade policies, and wants more regulation of banks-- not less. Cabinet folks are leaking information to Roger Stone and Joe Scarbough for their shows. Dina Powell is a Democrat and a friend of Hillary (she hired Huma Abudin). These Democrats are pushing their policies-- regulate banks, free trade, Glass Steagall Bank Regulation,. Trump has watered down his orders on trade and NAFTA as a result.
Having as many children as Allah (Peace be upon him) allows is paramount in Islam. It augments the size of ummah (community) which is a source of pride and strength, It is admirable you offer to sponsors girls but you will need to educate them that a large ummah causing poverty and hunger is evil thought.
What is MAPS doing to fight Muslim extremism?    I don't believe there is much Islamophobia, but if people are fearful, then you have a responsibility to calm their fears and not politicize this.  (And that Islamophobia web site was blatantly political.  Center for American Progress showing the money trails of groups they don't like, and not one hate crime.)    Instead of shaming everybody because your presidential candidate lost, why don't you tell us how you are working against the radical Muslims that want to kill us?    With the recent radical Muslim attacks, people fear that these murderers are being harbored and not exposed.    Transparency and honesty work a lot better than accusations, as can be seen by the Wikileaks of the DNC, where their corruption and duplicity were exposed.
This article makes the Rohingya--or Muslims--appear like the victims. That's hardly the case. They left Bangladesh, went to Myanmar--or Burma, killed the Burmese people, and stole their land. How do you think they got so many villages?! Why do you think the Myanmar got stripped the Muslims of their civil rights?! They wanted to get rid  of them. Do you really blame them? I don't.
Ironic that comments are closed under a column arguing:  "One wrong way forward would be to shut down or discourage discussions of Muslim accommodation on the grounds that such talk feeds racism. This is what has happened in much of Europe, where a populist backlash now threatens the entire political order. The Muslim situation in Canada is far different. Yet, somewhere, between the false extremes of “Islam is an existential threat to the world” and “Islam is a religion of peace,” we need to carve out a place to talk."  I guess the Globe editors disagree with you, Margaret.
The problem about the confusion between 'islam the religion' and 'islam the political militant ideology' is that they are existentially inseparable.
All principles are general and can be open to interpretation.  On property rights, that essentially means one has the right to own, buy and sell property based on contract law and there are laws protecting it, but it does not mean one can do whatever they want with their property.  If one's actions harm others than that is definitely a reasonable restriction on property rights and that applies to all rights.  As for religious garb, I generally think women should be allowed to wear what they want where appropriate (A burqa in airport security or a bank is not appropriate), but at the same time some like the niqab and the burqa isolate one from society and more importantly Islam does not require women to wear them, only they dress modestly.  In fact during the Hajj, burqa and niqab are forbidden so its more cultural than religious.  In most majority Muslim countries you never see the burqa or niqab only is it common in a handful of them.
Typically, if the names are not released, they are muslim names.
This is really getting ridiculous, Ebes. You state that there is no reason for studying the NT if one is not a Christian, and I attempt to invite you to a broader viewpoint by flipping the topic to non-Muslims studying the Quoran. That is, I tried to argue by analogy: non-Muslims studying the Quoran is analogous to non-Christians studying the NT.   And your mind, missing the analogy entirely, leaps to trumpeting you lack of faith in the Quoran as inspired and in Judaism after the resurrection? I posited by analogy in the form of questions, for often inviting someone to wrap their mind around questions assists understanding. If you don't get the analogy, and you refuse my questions designed to help you see the analogy, I fail to see any intellectual way forward.
you have only tired, worn out arguments that i doubt even you believe anymore. sad and funny at the same time. ill try to keep a straight face as i watch you continually succeed in driving a wedge between islam and non-muslims.  you keep doing you Fred, with friends like you islam needs no enemies...
Another attempt to deflect--I knew this comment was by you even before I checked the name.  None of the information you include disprove that immigration from Muslim countries is leading to an increase in violence.
Do you think that you help to reform something by fearing it? Religions are about empowering people who have no power, and so, when they know the world is afraid of them, then what incentive do they have to reform?  I do believe that Islam and all religions do need to call to account those of their adherents who practice the religion violently, but Islam is no different from Judaism and Christianity in that regard.
Unprovoked violence toward any individual or group is reprehensible, and we have laws to deal with that.  Criticism, however, is another matter: Islam is just an idea, and is subject to criticism (even ridicule)-- as is any other idea. That's Free Speech-- which comes in many forms-- including the spoken word, the written word, and the cartoon drawing.  Criticism is part of normal conversation, and conversation is the mechanism of growth and reform. 'Islamophobia' is a word designed to stop criticism and conversation.
Jerusalem\ Judea was a client state of Rome from 37 BC. The Muslims invaded the Roman Empire in 639 AD. About 700 years that the propagandists keep forgetting. I encourage you to refrain from recollecting and doing actual research. This is the source of left wing amnesia.
No, they contradict as well. Both (well, all three) are projections in the sense of 'God', hence God's changing demeanor. Christianity was a reaction to the hypocritical rule-crazy Judaism, and sums 'The Law' up into the 'Golden Rule'; whereas Islam, clearly created by a con artist who mooched off a rich widow and hung out in a cave all day, it isn't simply a change in demeanor, but it doubles down on Judaisms folly while somehow not grasping Christianity's consolidation of it, and almost everything Mohammed does goes against all that was established, and then he just says, "Oh, wait, Allah said its ok" (a difference between the Judeo-Christian and Islam God is that in the prior he tends to come forth with a challenge, whereas Islam he comes after the action. Even Ayesha recognized his con when she said "Allah moves hastily to please you"
Your fingers must be trembling with fear as you type this comment -- fear from the hoards ("hundreds or thousands of phony refugees from the Muslim world," "half with criminal records") and "potential jihadists". Reality check for last decade:  Canadians killed by jihadists (Cpl. Nathan Cirillo and Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent).......................................................................2 Muslims killed by Canadian (shot in  back while praying at mosque)...........................................................................6
I notice that that the Trump crowd are trying to co-opt the term 'fake news' to describe anything they disagree with (generally the modern world). Sorry guys, fake news is the spewing of Breibart and The National Inquirer.   But then you believe the headlines in the latter about Muslim spies in the Obama White House.
2.2 million Orthodox Jews who are indeed Orthodox around globe. 1.6 billion Muslims.
Germany and parts of Europe and possibly sections of North America will face the long gradual decline due to Islamification. Persia had a glorious history and great culture: http://www.persepolis.nu/  The first declaration of human rights is credited to Cyrus the Great: http://www.humanrights.com/what-are-human-rights/brief-history/  Arab culture was lively until good ole Mo showed up. How many Nobel Prize winners have Muslim countries produced? You know that Spain has produced more peer reviewed and cited articles in science in the past five years than all the Muslim countries combined. Sad.  Canada. Suckers. Too bad. So sad.
Really good point about heterogenity and economic prosperity and well-being. Japan has stayed cutting edge in its technology and society while also having  a very high standard of living and human health. The US, on the other hand, could be said to be the most racially diverse country on earth, but also one with a terrible social situation and deteriorating human health.   We are told 'diversity is strength' yet the evidence just does not show that when it comes to human health and well-being. The Nordic countries achieved extraordinary social and economic advancement while have very undiverse societies. They are only now starting to falter since the mass migration of Africans and Muslims since 2014.
My wife and I both work in the health field and so, consequently, we have a social circle that includes Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus, and representatives of many east Asian countries. We have many Muslim work acquaintances: we've been to their houses at Christmas, and at least one of them set up a Christmas tree to make her non-Muslim friends feel welcome. I often have Muslim friends wish me a Merry Christmas: as far as I can tell, they haven't been in trouble with their communities for doing so. They also love Canada. Because many of them obtained medical degrees from other countries, they had to take jobs in isolated parts of Canada desperate for physicians while learning how to pass Canadian board exams. Meanwhile, many of our relatives fear our friends. when we discuss it with them, they cite things they've seen on television or heard on the radio. They're convinced that what they've seen and heard must be true and that my wife and I are being set up and fooled by our friends. Go figure.
The biggest scandal is how ethnic candidates move in to take over riding associations just before election time. You won't find the media mentioning THAT overmuch. It's something everyone steps very delicately around. Most riding associations have a small core of active members who do all the work in between elections. A newcomer, who plunks down ten bucks, can run for candidate just like anyone else. And if he happens to be a member of some ethnic organization where he can go to his temple or community hall and say "come and vote for me so one of ours is MP" then suddenly dozens or even hundreds of people are showing up to buy memberships (often with money they've been given for that purpose) and vote for him as the candidate. Most have no commitment to the party, or any kind of political viewpoints, and their only interest is electing one of THEIRS to the House. Those from the Indian subcontinent are especially good at this but middle east Muslims are catching up in places.
M-103 is only intended to lay the foundation for  new laws to protect Islam.   What ever they study about Islamophobia will be used as a pretext to implement draconian laws against anybody with alternate opinions about Islam. .  It may even have a recommendations for Sharia law as the only viable  solution to the egregious sufferings of Muslims in Canada. M103 is only a tool to wring  concessions and privileges out of the rest of society, to build a separate and unaccountable Islamic power in Canada.   As the Ms Gultch  said:  "These things must be handled delicately".  One step at a time my dear. "All in good time".
How many politicians who voted for this motion would live in an Islamic country under sharia law?
But, how many does twelve percent of India equal? I.34 Billion people live in India. I believe that means about 150 million are Muslims using your figure. You got to get up earlier in the morning to catch me, sir.
So Nazis are Christians now? And a correction: it was Christians who bombed Serbian Christians to protect Bosnian Muslims.
I blame guns. How many of 16,000 murders were committed by Americans? Is this a "fake" stat?  Please dont blame illegals or muslims.
Unless you can provide a good reason for forcing Muslims to change their long established religious practices concerning prayer times...
That said, I agree with the 9th Circuit's decision up to a point.  The ban should not have extended to those who already have visas, or to anyone else who was lawfully in the United States before they left.  Due process requires they they be allowed free travel.  Whether they can be subjected to "extreme vetting" when they return is an interesting question.  Another point is that those who obviously pose no threat of terrorism --- the very young and the very old --- should not be subjected to extreme vetting.   Through all of this, don't forget that since 9/11, 72 individuals from the seven mostly Muslim countries covered by Trump's executive order have been convicted of terrorism.  If Southern Baptists had that kind of record --- church bombings, say --- the Southern Poverty Law Center would be all over Southern Baptists.  You know it's true.  Tell the truth.  You'd be all over the Southern Baptists, too.
Let me say how proud we are not. Just think maybe in the next 6 months or a years we will have the poor refugee's sitting in our homes, not eating our food since it is now Muslim food, wondering where are young sons and daughters are not since they are no longer permitted to go outside for fear of being abused by our wonderful new neighbors or maybe by now our sons and daughters have been raped by our "guests". Can't find the dog, Islam does not allow any type of animals except horses and goats so get rid of you dog. Just imagine taking your new neighbors down to the beach. That won't last long since the more of them we bring over the closer we get to shiriah law, can't wait for that one and in 5 or 6 years there will only be Muslims on our beaches. Don't believe this read the German, French news papers, All the swimming pools in Germany have been closed because of the refugee men abusing the young men and women in the pools  Good luck to all of you  INSHALLA
Most of these countries have radical Islamic terrorist groups within their borders who have pledged  allegiance to ISIL.
"When his supporters start to be disillusioned, Rodrik fears Trump may react to any criticism by intensifying his identity politics. "  Of course he will. That's what fascist leaders always do when things go awry - scapegoat some unpopular group: Muslims, Mexicans, gays, you name it - whatever works. That way the (white) rubes who foolishly believed that Trump would save them from the "evils" that a Hillary Clinton presidency would bring won't have to look in the mirror and blame themselves when blaming an unpopular group is so much easier. Hitler had the Jews, Trump will have, well, we'll just have to wait and see. But mark my word, there will be scapegoats one way or another. Anything to avoid confronting the real truth: that the GOP is all about propping up the 1% at everyone else's expense and Trump is all about lining his own pockets with as much gold as he can possibly stuff inside them. The rubes were played for fools and we'll all have to suffer for it, some more than others.
So should we do away with Fire & Police chaplains....why is the Government paying them ?  All those crosses out on base...at the cemetery,  what are those doing on Gov. land?... and the Stars of David...the Islamic Crescent Moons...why do I have to see these "Government paid for" eyesores every time I visit on Memorial Day?....the religious symbols at the MOA owned cemetery on 9th ...tear them out...let those families bury their dead at private religious cemeteries  St. Francis House...Providence Hospital....any Gov. $ in those institutions ?....get rid of them...they're not Alaskan...they are Religious !  And these Names!!....St. Mathew Island...St. Paul...St. George...Priest Rock ( Dutch Harbor)!...St Elias Nat. Park...a travesty....Not Alaskan!  I hope my grandkids Never have to see or hear any evidence of the Religious people that came before them...it's obscene...as were our founding Fathers...Washington, Jefferson, Franklin all supporters of civic prayer...idiots all !
reply to gtm: Thanks for this.  Wikipedia says that:  "... he is unique among the richest royals as he does not rule over a geographic territory." Rather he is a religious leader. His followers are:  "estimated 25 million adherents (about 20% of the world's Shia Muslim population)"  With all that responsibility, makes you wonder how he can find so much time for yacht racing?
It was for security purposes and  the Japanese fought for our country to show true citizenship . The Muslims on the other hand are radicals and should be put in a sucurity type of camp. Trust is a big issue especially with their religion.
As a devout muslim, he is enjoying his just deserts.
How about a story on how Afghanistan, and our constant capitulation with Islamic Terrorists and the Kharzai regime to keep oil flowing and opium on the fast track to Europe and the U.S. is the best kept "not secret" in the 1st world.   Our military and government might as well be importing Heroin on U.S. Air Force aircraft.  That's how corrupt and involved our government is in this joke of a situation.   Get ready for "Plan Columbia".  The Conservatives have been planning a takeover of the cocaine cartels for decades, and the Trump Administration is feeling out a major action right now.  So get ready for bowls of cocaine and a coups to take over central American and Northern South American oil fields t o get them under control".    It's all just fun and games for the psycho' at the top of the heap. They are trained to suppress their conscience, or are alcohol babies.  Same result.
Canada needs to stop the influx of refugees, look after the interests of Canadians first and cooperate with the United States of America and its president.  It is in our own best interests to ensure that Canada does not become a haven for terrorists and a springboard for terrorist attacks on the United States. President Trump is taking steps that should have been taken long ago. It's too bad if the appeasers don't like it. If the professional protesters feel that we should have open borders and let in hundreds of thousands of un-vetted 'migrants' and 'refugees', let them go to live in the Muslim world for a while so that they can get a better understanding of why we need better-defended borders and more restrictive immigration policies. The protesters should also protest anything and everything that they don't like while they are living amongst their Muslim friends. They would be lucky to return here alive.
Why Allan, the one word I changed in my post was "Christian". And it kept getting censored, yet when I changed it to Muslim or Islam, the post wasn't censored. Isn't that amazing?  This post censored 5x already....why is "christian" a dirty word to the progressive left?
There is no "intra-cult squabbling within the larger Abrahamic context.." There is no "larger Abrahamic context". Islam is NOT Abrahamic regardless of the bogus claim of mo hammed that Abraham was the 1st muslim...islam did not exist even in mo's fevered psychotic mind until approx 700 yrs AFTER the spread of Christianity. Any intra cult squabbling is among muslims (there are many cults within)who kill each other over it.
Differences "within the range" are not the problem, and "Extreme Christians can be more radical than any Muslims that I know"? You only know more moderate ones then. Funny, no Christians I know or even have heard of have more extreme beliefs than conservative Muslims.  Which extreme Christians believe adultery should be punishable by death, and that "modest" women should not  go out in public with uncovered faces?
Muslim is a religion. No there are no tribes or races. The top countries that have the most Muslim-practicing population are actually not on the suspension list.
The extremists of many ideologies are, by definition, prone to extreme emotions like "hatred" against those who disagree with them. And although they are a small minority, the bigger the group of adherents to a given ideology, the bigger that small minority will be.  Luckily it is a small number of hotheads in Canada spewing those extreme anti-Muslim sentiments. Most people can disapprove of certain government policies and certain religious beliefs, without falling into "hatred". Although the best way to tip  moderates into extremism is by trying to repress them and calling them names like "Islamophobic" instead of convincing them rationally that their fears are misplaced.
No, it's not a "christian program", but it is a christian thing to do (not to kick them out).  Guess some people may think it's a 'Muslim Program' because of the haters to it's creator -- Obama.  BTW, there is nothing wrong with being a hater of Trump -- I don't like him either.  Neither was there anything wrong with haters of Obama.  We all have the liberty to decide.  It's 'fake news' like Pizzagate (Comet Pizza) that's wrong.
Sorry, warbirds, this is a CATHOLIC school board. The kids there pray every day- and have special masses, etc- not to mention Christian holidays. They are extending the same to their Muslim students. I am not at all religious- but I surely like to see them getting along with one another.
This bomb was strictly a move to boost Trump's low popularity numbers and undercut criticism from the media.   Mission accomplished on both counts.    And speaking of "counts", how could anybody possibly do a body count when obviously there were no bodies to count in a tunnel where anybody would have been blown to smithereens?   Furthermore, 36 ISIS fighters killed in a war where ISIS has thousands of fighters in many countries throughout the region is a mere pin prick being blown out of all real proportion.   More important,, the Afghanistan War was declared unwinnable years ago. That was before ISIS and other terrorist groups moved in. Since then the Taliban has reclaimed a lot of territory, Afghans have become resigned to Taliban rule, people have gone back to Islamic ways, the poppy industry is booming, corruption in government is extensive, and most Afghans want foreign armies out of their country.     The end of the war must be negotiated with the Taliban as part of government.
So you're telling us that Muslims in Christian countries don't preach and commit murder?  I was also unaware that countries like Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon actually published their murder/violence statistics
BS, the pro-ISIS media group behind a recent string of threats against the 2018 World Cup lauded the Manhattan truck attack and warned of more bloodshed to come in posters distributed to online supporters today. "O worshippers of the cross in USA," the poster states. "Our lone wolves will come to you from where you do not know and we will terrorize you wherever you are and we will show you multitudes of terror and pain that you showed to the Muslims, and what is coming is more bitter and greater." https://pjmedia.com/homeland-security/isis-group-behind-world-cup-threats-vows-bitter-greater-manhattan-attacks/ ISIS is in effect saying the "lone wolf" is one of many of its "lone wolves."
>>The murder of 6 innocent muslims in Quebec City (and wounding of 19 others) in early 2017 didn't come out of nowhere.  Where did it come from? Do you have an insight into the perpetrators persons brain?   If what you claim (or rather promote) is true, you would have seen multiple such incidents.  Considering the terror plots that unfolded, or were prevented, in Canada -  by using your argument  one can arrive at the opposite side of your 'argument'.
As far as I know, there has not been a single fatality ever happening in Canada from a terrorist act commited by a muslim migrant or refugee. So I suggest to the scared ones to ask your mother to kiss your forehead if your anxiety prevents you from falling asleep. I remember it did wonders for me when I was a little boy.
Name Good point. However I would add Muslims who have seen their people attacked by Canada. That is the case in every  attack by Muslims. The US Britain Canada Spain Germany...
Wow. This is the best news item I've seen in a long time. And the forum immediately devolves into charges of "lefties" and "Islam lovers."   No wonder we're in trouble.
He purposely murdered people because of their race, because he hated their race, and he wanted to start a larger conflict based on race.  Sounds exactly the same as "religious" terrorism with just one word changed.  So he did it for "Whites" instead of "Allah".  Equally abstract justification, equally wrong, equally terrorism, and he's a home-grown, non-Muslim terrorist.  Explain to us why his form of terror is better because he didn't claim to do it for Allah, and didn't twist a faith to do so.   There is no justification to murder a group of innocents simply because they are not like you.  Period.
Enough Political Correctness. He is a victim for sure. But before Canada to take blame, It is his upbringing and his father who is committed child abuse. Kids at the age of 15 and much younger are victims of many Islamic terror groups to stand in front of the fire. We see these terrible tactics in all of the wars involving Muslim Fighters. Hizballah were shooting rockets from civilian roofs at Israel in the 80's, The Hamas is hiding weapons and rockets in schools and hospitals, and launching rockets from a civilian populated houses, many pictures of their fighters actually hiding behind a child. ISIS is doing the same thing, Al Kayda, the Taliban. This is how they fight and we are here in the west flabbergasted every time, and don't understand that this is how they fight. Yes he is a Canadian Citizen, but if you go and strap a vast around yourself and blow yourself up in a busy market in the middle east, am I responsible to pay for your funeral coasts? FYI this happened before Harper!
Nobody but socialists, Liberals,  Democrats and people in the news media believe  Muslims.
Why would anyone have brought vans of Syrian refugees to Whidbey when the idea of sanctuary, for illegal immigrants from ANY country, is what this is all about?  It is my understanding that the Syrians who came to Whidbey are legally in this country, not here illegally.  So pouring fuel on the question of 'sanctuary' boils down to a false display vans of people here legally, rather than illegally.  And what gives with the 'sanctuary' apparently only for Muslims?  How ridiculous and misleading, as well as incredibly insensitive to the people they brought in the vans, as if they were zoo animals on display.  Don't feed the bears, don't hug the Syrians?  This group not only lacks common sense, they also lack basic manners.   I feel very sorry for the Syrian sideshow in this Langley circus, and very embarrassed by this sanctuary circus show.  Where is your big tent and your flim-flam hucksters?
You are looking at only one aspect of the situation--campaign contributions. Additionally, you are judging Trump by a standard that applied from before he was the president. The Democratic party's policies benefit average people more than do Republican policies. Healthcare is only one example but it's an important one--Democrats originated the policy of healthcare coverage for all Americans and Republicans loathed the idea from the minute it passed up to the present. They don't want poor Americans to have ANYTHING, no food stamps, no healthcare coverage, nothing.  Worse, in Trump they are promoting hate crimes against people of color and especially immigrants and Muslims. Let's be frank. The Republican party is un-American, that is, to the extent that America stands for equality before the law and democratic values, Republicans are against these values and prove it through their policies and rhetoric. The Republicans are pro-Putin, pro-oligarchy, and anti-democratic like him.
Dear Muslims;  Welcome to the community of progressive left wing religious intolerance. You are joining a group of Christians, Catholics and Jewish who for decades have been shunned, scorned, ridiculed, mocked and marginalized by the secular progressive community in Canada.  These leftwing progressives have worked very hard to shut down religion and religious practice in public spaces and public institutions. So this act of inclusion, by joining this prestigious club of the hated, will help support your struggle that so many religions in Canada have experienced before you.   Pay no attention to our social justice leaders, who are using tragedies to ram though pet personal agendas that seek to further divide through inequality and prioritizing which religions are more important then others.  Stay strong, be of good courage and you will succeed beyond the hate.  Thank You;  Freedom of Religion
Let me tell you imagines Obama saying "nothing to do with my...um I meant their peaceful religion"  Because the 'Obama is a secret muslim' bit was such a success in its day.
The Lord's prayer doesn't mention Christianity; nonetheless, it is a Christian prayer, although I think Jews and Muslims could recite it unchanged without running afoul of their religious doctrines. On the other hand, atheists, agnostics, and followers of all non-Abrahamic religions could not.
Islam is as much a political movement as it is a religion. Like global warming.
Protesting is democracy in action.  Elections are the side shows.  Where democracy is "rule by the people" citizens must have opportunities beyond the voting booth to express their views. That is what is happening.  I recall that any gathering of Trump supporters was regularly viewed by many as a legitimate expression of the public will. So why is opposition to a Trumpian policy "undemocratic far left"?  Oh, and I can't recall when Obama did the same thing. . . e.g. refuse entry to all citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries including refugees from ongoing wars in those countries. But maybe I missed something. . .
I suppose this makes it okay for the Muslims, Jews and all others to leave their icons on top of the mountain.  They all served our country, too.
We must understand this for what it is...a form of social coercion. It is forcing Muslim children to join in a group to distinguish themselves from the Infidels. What Muslim child is going to tell their parents or their Imam that they don't want to join? Freedom of religion also means freedom FROM religion...there must be someplace in a secular society for a child to be free from religion and develop their own conscience.
Best line from the NY Times article: "They [Bannon and Burke] saw Islam as threatening to overrun a prostrate West weakened by the erosion of traditional Christian values, and viewed themselves as unjustly ostracized by out-of-touch political elites."  So the thrice-married, thrice-divorced, white nationalist sympathizer who has been accused of domestic violence and antisemitism is now the champion of Christian values? Good to know. I wonder if the good Cardinal presented Mr. Bannon with a copy of his book "Remaining in the Truth of Christ: Marriage and Communion in the Catholic Church."
The school board is entirely correct, and the uproar they're getting runs counter to Canadian values. They should not refuse to accommodate the request on the grounds that some people don't like Muslims and can be encouraged to act on their bigotry by public figures pushing a political agenda.
You missed my point-- the point is the SCOTUS is looking at protecting the rights of US citizens under their decision to allow Trump's ban with limits. That means protecting the rights of US Citizens or legal residents under the US constitution. Non citizens and non legal residents do not have constitutional rights (except possibly under very rare circumstances). The constitutional rights of a citizen or legal resident could include hiring immigrants without unconstitutional bars such as religion (a US Citizen could have a constitutional right to hire a Muslim), or for a US Citizen to have their spouse immigrate to the US even if they are Muslims, or to have your child immigrate free of discrimination (assuming they are not in violation of other laws or rules-- immigration fraud, criminal violations, being a terrorist, etc.). Therefore, the SCOTUS order striking down Trump's ban had this "connection" provision to protect US Citizens and legal residents.
Re.: "immodest" clothing, again it is a continuum, and there is no question whatsoever that the face veil is as extreme as one can get in one's conception of "modesty", the "cover all except face and hands" a step better, but still a far cry from what has been accepted as normal female clothing for the last century in the west. And while until the second wave feminist movement there was still some "she was asking for it" sentiment, that has pretty much disappeared even among most so-called "conservatives", and our legal system has made clear that is not acceptable.  As for groping by Muslim Presidents, you must be joking! The society there makes it pretty much impossible for a woman to get close enough contact with any male for him to even talk to her, but if one did, how would we ever know what he would have done  to her? After all, if she is "immodest" enough to let herself be put in such a position, we know it is her fault according to Muslim teaching.
what do they feel they have achieved killing innocent Christians (children no less)?  I think it would be very important for the Muslim leaders of the world to take a united stand against these murderers.
Many muslim customs are actually similar to jewish customs as with the washing of the body - not unique.
How do Zionists justify the murder of far greater numbers of innocent Palestinian Christians and Muslims? How do they live with themselves? Why do Zionists care about no one and nothing, other than the members of their own tribe?  An American Jew who has previously never been outside of certain neighbourhoods in Brooklyn is  free to emigrate and become an Israeli citizen, while Palestinians who lived on the land for generations have their villages destroyed, even their cemeteries, to make room for Zionist settlers to steal more Palestinian land.   All men are created equal... except Zionists are more equal than others.
Wahhabism from Saudi Arabia. It is the most intolerant form of Islam. ISIS gets a lot of its financial funding from supporters in Saudi Arabia.
How did Democrats lose to Trump, and will continue to lose for the foreseeable future?  Look no further than Schiff and other Democrats who don't share the outrage over Muslim terror.
The Parliament Hill shooter, and the one who carried out the ramming attack a couple days previously, were both Muslim converts.
Nonsense. What this does is it forces Muslims to conform to their Muslim  peer group. It sets them apart from the rest of the students and emphasizes their desire to remain distinct and separate. Children shouldn't be divided by religion in public schools.
There is no reason to continue to use Incirlik. Probably there is some money in it for Turkey to continue pretending to mutual acceptance of NATO membership. Turkey is no longer a secular state, it has been overtaken by Erdogan's muslim superstructure. There is only danger in keeping nukes there . Move 'em out  !
It is good to see the ordinary citizens of Texas helping each other out. Kudos to you all! There is another side to the story the media are avoiding like; the contribution of climate change, the fact that Texas had another flood last year and had many plans for mitigating floods in the future but the money never came through, there is a disgusting cartoon in the French magazine Charlie Hebdo (remember"Je suis Charlie" when it focussed on muslims, but this cartoon shows a bunch of Nazis drowning in Houston... maybe not so many people will sympathise now?)and the dept. of immigration maintained road blocks/searches on roads out of the flooded areas that may have contributed to those who may not have the right papers staying in the flood zone.Again, mostly poor neighborhoods flooded, lets hope they get help.
Technically the bar was not against Jews since Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists would have also been prevented from taking the oath  But somehow this particular argument has been conflated to a bar just against Jews  As Canadians we were all required to say the Lord's prayer in public school right until the 80s (85 to be exact)  People could choose not to participate if they so wished so this whole "equivalent to" argument gets you nowhere since opting out is always an option  The real issue is whether a person who graduates from this school can uphold the law without recrimination or prejudice Assuming they have passed the bar ..... a lawyer is a lawyer  is a lawyer  Whether they are christian, muslim, jewish or atheist
No... Shhh don't tell anyone.. Promise?? Ok.. Here's the story. I know he admitted to being born in Kenya in his book jacket. Get past that. He was only lying .. He moved to Indonesia and was allowed into school as he was a Muslim, don't worry, he lied to them too. He moved to America and scored all A's in college... You've seen the transcripts haven't you?? Oh that's right ... There also classified as he was a foreign student. Forget that last part, anyway I have more proof. I have to keep on the down low... Contact me later
AHHA maybe you could vote for Jill Stein for president. She is also a Jew Hater. The Hebrews have learned to cultivate the desert. And given the technology away. As with their cutting edge IT and medicine advances. Not once since the rebirth of their nation have they tried nation building. Every Muslim country around them anticipates their destruction. At least we know where you stand though. That's cool. Everyone needs a villian.
Please explain. In my opinion, 9/11 wouldn't have happened if the US hadn't messed around in so many Muslim countries and if it had reined in Israel just a little bit in its abuse of Palestinians.
It is indeed shocking how this administration is caving in to the demands of the Islamists in this country. During the Ottoman Empire and Islamic expansion, western countries then took very seriously the threat posed by the Islamists. Now the threat has been whitewashed under the guise of multiculturalism and religious tolerance.
It appears no one has to sabotage Trump. He has such poor reading (and listening and seeing) comprehension that any innocuous news or casual conversation can turn into a fantastic theory in his mind. He watched a Fox News bit on how Sweden allowed refugees into their country, then interpreted that to mean there was a "terrorist attack last night."  In this case, he probably saw a B-movie on cable TV, then imagined the Muslim ex-POTUS from Kenya was out to get him.  Imagine if Donald watches a movie about cigarettes being smuggled into the US from a foreign country. That could naturally be interpreted in his mind that North Korea just deployed nuclear missiles at the White House. In that case, we can all duck for cover under a chair, bend over, and kiss our butts goodbye!
Yo!   ^umb^uts!  What Trump’s followers want is a President who - - unlike his America hating predecessor - - will take as his primary duty the national security interests of this country according to his oath he took to protect, preserve and defend the Constitution.  PRESIDENT Trump is calling attention to the fact that the ultra-permissive, feel good policies of those in the UK like the politically correct Mayor of London are actually INVITING these Islamic terror attacks.  Doubt that?  Three attacks in three months ain’t no [obscene gerund redacted] accident, Skippy.  Fortunately of the UK, their Prime Minister “gets it”.
Well, first off, Black Lives Matter is a hate group out to stir up trouble.  There are real problems with race in this (and in other countries), yet this group just does nothing to stir the pot.  As for who owns Pride, I thought it was for the gay community and our allies.  It is designed to be an inclusive event.  If you are LGBT or an ally, then this Parade is for you.  It doesn't matter to me if you are conservative, liberal, black, white, Christian, Muslim, rich or poor.  This is for us - people who are OK with being who we are.  Black Lives Matter is a hate group and is trying to splinter Pride.  If there are issues, and there very well may be with regard to race, then Pride needs to address it, but we don't need agitators to do so.
Assad is being portrayed as a monster.  These gas attacks never happened before. He never gassed his people. Christians were allowed to live peacefully in Syria, and Christians were in his government. People coming out of Syria appear educated and able to speak english.  Then everything changed when a teenager scrawled the message..."Syria, you're next".   When I see the chaos in the middle east associated with Islam and all the different branches, it must be almost impossible for the head of any of those countries to keep the lid on all the warring ideologies that have been fighting each other for 1600 years.  Islam rebels have tried to take over...this is when we started to hear about gassing. They hid among the population, using them as human shields.
We must make sure that any Muslims from North America or Europe who went to Syria to join ISIS, in full knowledge of ISIS's violent Islamist ideology and of the multiple atrocities they committed, DO NOT get to come back to North America or Europe except to enter a jail-cell for a considerable length of time.  More than 70 years after the end of WW2 we are still searching for, and jailing Nazis. We must have the same determination with regard to ISIS's (and other Islamist terrorist groups) followers.
As we watch yet again the frothing left slobbering with frothing spittle on all of us,  I have a question that never gets asked nor will it ever get answered.  You want anti Muslim people ( who have aright to be what they want to be and believe what they want to believe under our constitution - lets not forget this) haters (your word) hunted like criminals.  Yet you never bring this up The Muslim culture and their religion Islam are like barbarians.  They stone women like the middle ages They mercy kill women for some twisted belief that they have the right to They genital mutilate girls They refuse to admit that Islam is really a totalitarian political system with a small group of dictators running it) Iran, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc. They make women cover themselves and walk 15 feet behind men.  Reconcile that Tell us why you condone this? Don't twist it - answer it
they only need to ask if they are muslims
Anyone listening to the muslims that say they do not want this? For some of the same reasons us bigoted racist Islamophobes don't want this. Its dangerous, its one sided it protects no one else but muslims. Muslims will have free rein to spew their hate without consequence. And they do in many mosques every week they are encouraged to kill the non believers, to kill the jews.  This motion also had input from MAC which is part of the Muslim Brotherhood. MB is a known terrorist group, and is recognized by countries as such. In fact the MB came up with the word Islamophobia. Why is a terrorist group having any say in Canada's free speech?
We are not talking about the Bible we are talking about sharia law as enshrined in the Koran. No comparison is being made here between the Bible and the Koran so why introduce it?
What do you think was worse - Hitler or Islamofascism?
If Omar has the slightest bit of human decency, if he has in fact repented of being a terrorist, if he has repudiated the radical Islam of his father, he can show it by giving the settlement to the American widow and the wounded soldier.
Since I don't want to live under Sharia law I am an Islamophobic? I am not a racist. I am a non practicing christian middle class business person who has every right to fear Islam and Christianity.  It is expanding into the West and is undermining our way of life.  Islam's record of murder, torture, terror, genital mutilation, misogyny, hate, etc. is without question.  Yet Islamists and liberals tell us we are evil for telling it like it is...... I will never back down, this group of people are threat. Period.  This constant barrage from the Islamists and liberals that to fear Islam is racist is utter BS.  Islam is a religion of control, terror, fear and expansion. Just like Christianity was.  But it grew out of the Dark Ages and became civilized,  Islam didn't. It hasn't evolved nor has its people. Any women who would be subjugated and accepts it clearly is backward. Any man who subjugates a women is also stunted and backward.
Since Gallup found in 2016 that 73.4% of Americans claim to be "Christians" of one kind or another, that's a fair argument that we are indeed "a Christian nation".     The figures from the PEW researchers only put it at 70.2% in 2014 but that's still a pretty fair majority.    Only 18.2% are agnostic, atheist or none of the above.  The rest believe some body else is turning the crank.    Worldwide:  33% are 'Christians', 21% are Muslims, 14% are Hindu and only 16% are non-religious--and that includes the 'deists'.      http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html
Don't forget...a non-Muslim can not testify against a Muslim. http://www.answering-islam.org/NonMuslims/rights.htm
Interesting...I think you misunderstand the position of feminists and leftists.  Just speaking for myself, I stand with human rights.  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a mediaeval, regressive state that oppresses everyone who's not a Sunni male (and undoubtedly many of them, too).  That doesn't mean we in the west should regulate what Moslem women wear here.  That's actually pretty consistent.
After Mr. Trump cancelled a planned appearance in Saudi Arabia and referred to “Islamic extremism” instead of “Islamist extremism” in a speech, an aide confessed that the President was “just an exhausted guy.” ------ oh please Ibbitson, most Liberals and liberals could not tell the difference either between  “Islamic extremism” instead of “Islamist extremism”  -
Has anybody heard condemnation coming from the "Muslim World" of 1.6 billion members for the Manchester murders? The silence is deafening.
Northern Europeans had the lowest crime rates before Muslim immigration.
President Obama will be leaving President Trump with the most powerful Presidential Powers in world history.  President Trump will have at his disposal an automated drone program with the authority to kill whoever, whenever, and wherever they are (including U.S. citizens), an NSA domestic spying program that can collect information on literally any person for any reason without a warrant or probable cause (and then almost certainly use it for political purposes, but you can never prove it because it's classified), the ability to pass laws through Executive Order that Congress specifically says they don't want ("Congress refuses to Act!").  As a precedent, Obama has prosecuted more whistleblowers than all previous presidents combined.  With Obama as a role model, I wonder how President Trump will treat whistleblowers who leak dirt on his administration?    He can wage war without the consent of Congress like Obama did with Libya.  Wealthiest African nation to cesspool of radical Islam.
Garbage - The calls for violence in the OT are for "Just Wars" (if there is such a thing) for the preservation of the Jewish race during a specific period of time...I said show one verse in the NEW TESTAMENT where Christ orders his followers to kill anybody. Your bias and bigotry is blatant and recognized by all.  Not all Muslims advocate violence but the book does - you are a piece of work...Go ahead -we are all waiting for those verses. Yeah, just what I thought. No I don't remember the Pastor who said that because there is no Biblical command for violence, so it is just him spouting his rhetoric. Your evidence is a joke and anecdotal, and also ignores the numerous times I have asked you for Christs commands  of violence, I know you won't respond because their aren't any.
Yes.  It means nothing.  Muhammad 'Ali repented of his association with the heretical so-called "Nation of Islam", and he became Sunni Muslim.  Before he died even the founder of the Nation of Islam, Elijah Muhammad (named Elijah Poole at birth) modified his views to where he said: "Call no man a devil unless he does the work of the devil."  By that standard one might conclude that, since reviling a dead man seems to be the best you can contribute to this discussion that you therefore qualify.  Above my pay grade, not my call.  Because in His Qur'an Allah says: "Forgive them--do you not desire Allah to forgive you?"  I do indeed.  And freely admit that since today is the first day of the month of Ramadhan, I'm responding to you more kindly than I otherwise might have, and probably more kindly than you deserve.  Ramadhan Mubarak.
None.  Those shooters were just as sinister and dangerous even though they were not Islamic.
Let's see, angry and apparently disturbed sociopathic man uses violence to kill.  Will there be a rush to point out that this is a failure of society for not properly providing sufficient mental health care services?  Well, that depends on who the killer was.  Was the killer shouting "Allahu Akbar" and spouting allegiance with Islamist extremism?  If yes, then many making comments will draw attention to our failure in society to provide sufficient mental health care services, and no posts will blame leaders and organizations the killer admires.  Was the killer shouting anti-Islamic screed, spewing bigotry towards Muslims?  If yes, then NO comments will draw attention to our failure in society to provide sufficient mental health care service, and blame for the attack WILL be placed at the feet of leaders and organizations the killer admires.  We live in a strange world...
So how many black jobs, Native American jobs, Hispanic jobs, Muslim jobs, female jobs, Lesbian jobs, gay jobs or transgender jobs per industry?  Would an employer get 'extra credit' for a Lesbian,  multi-racial, Muslim?    Since Oregon only has about 1.5% black population, will the employers in Bend be penalized if they can't get any black concrete workers to work on a bridge or spread hot asphalt?  What will the penalty be?
So you think all Muslims support ISIS? That is like saying all white people support a certain cross-burning organization in the South.  You have to be tough on terrorism. To do that,you have to get support and cooperation from the Muslim community. In India, which has very few ISIS members despite having 180 million Muslims (the second or third largest number of Muslims in the world), the police work hard with parents to prevent kids from joining ISIS. Blaming and punishing a whole community only creates a civil war like situation.
No, there are terrorist groups and individuals who are not Muslims. You're misinformed.
How does being against an ideology of hate that's attempting to spread across the West equate to being far-right? The only extremist here is Alceste, the guy perpetuating the advancement of Islam and all other communist leftist ideals.
Theophobia would be a better term....wonder why the political class avoided using it....but it doesn’t quite fit the script.  Sufferers are usually those who were raised in strict religious environments, exhibiting  avoidance behaviour, avoiding spiritual activities , avoiding interaction with others who believe in the particular religious belief system...however they still believe in the deity in question,  “ fear the wrath of god” if they do anything wrong according to the religion in question....a severe anxiety disorder/ panic attack.   Atheists cannot be theophobics by definition, since they do not believe in the very concept of a deity....however it is intrinsic in the Islamic belief system to have a fear of Allah (“Fear Allah wherever you are “), in a way that the other members of the Abrahamic tradition don’t seem to fear their god to the same extent, one would expect more cases of theophobias in their ranks.
Interesting and applicable to be sure, though Trump isn't as disciplined as Adolf, speaks extemporaneously, and is caught with his pants down too often to carry out the Big Lie quite as effectively as his predecessor. And he said nice things about Obama following their first meeting. ;-) He also doesn't have the terrifying obsession that Hitler did with one group of people. I do not believe Trump's feelings about Muslims are equivalent here.   Trump's great weakness may be the extent of his extroversion: he is sustained by constant contact with what is outside himself (consults other people relentlessly) but is apparently unable to take that bundle of impressions and "input units" and turn them into something cohesive inside his brain. He also doesn't appear to know much history, even recent 20th century history, as shown by his attitude to Putin.  The Trump presidency will be punctuated by riot-inciting moments, to be sure, but his grip will be uneven and he will lose his base too.
I agree with O77.  The issue isn't about immigration per se.  It's about ILLEGAL immigration at our southern border  and throwing down the welcome mat to unvetted young male Muslims from Syria.
Let's not mince words here. It's a Muslim only ban from these countries. For example, persecuted Christians from Syria will be welcomed according to Donald Trump in an interview.  The repercussions for a permanent ban will be ongoing for years with unpleasant consequences for the United States. Iran has struck a deal with Boeing to purchase 20 billion dollars of new commercial planes. With a permanent ban, how can Iranian pilots and flight crew travel to the United States for training? Iran will likely cancel the deal and turn to Airbus. There goes thousands of manufacturing jobs.
The travel press and most travel experts are of one mind: They are currently drawing attention to an unintended consequence of the Trump-led efforts to stop many Muslims from coming to the U.S., pointing to a sharp drop in foreign tourism to our nation that imperils jobs and touristic income.
First..David Butt does make some good points, some of which are veiled. Second ..is religion  associated with the creator, God or other? God does not interfere and I doubt that the God or other that we 'seemingly' know would want women's beautiful faces covered up. Who said that women's faces should be covered up? Burka's are not fashion statements. This is a religious freedom issue  in disguise. This is a man made creation to suppress women. Quebec is on the right track IMHO.  I note that when women travel, visit Muslim countries they have to wear scarves to cover their heads. They do so mainly because of the  laws in those Islamic  countries. Many of those scarves are very attractive I might add.  http://www.traveller.com.au/burqa-ban-what-should-female-tourists-wear-in-islamic-countries-10qpzk Catholics, Protestants and Jews in Canada and in many other countries eventually got it right. We live in harmony.  Tear  down that heavily veiled wall of female suppression Mr. David Butt.
"Blame Iran, Blame Iran"  It does get tiring.   How about this: " the roots and spread of violent Sunni jihad lead back to Saudi Arabia and its Wahhabi-centered clerical establishment.  The Saudi kingdom’s inseparability from the Wahhabi form of Sunni Islam, first espoused in 1744 and the fundamental creed of Saudi Arabia since its modern founding in 1932, has ensured that fundamentalism shapes domestic and foreign policies."
Just to be factual, yes, 126 democrats in the house voted against the resolution and 21 democrats in the senate voted against it as well. 82 democrats in the house voted for the resolution and 29 democrats in the senate also voted for it, including Hillary. These votes were done after seeing the same intel that Bush had. Trumps position to restrict Muslim refugees until it can be better determined their possible ties to radical groups due to ample evidence of ISIS infiltrating the refugee population is a hateful position? Interesting
"...given discriminatory gender practices in some Muslim cultures." Some?
And Muslims have been here for at least 3 generations. ------- Allan, do you mean And  A MINORITY OF Muslims have been here for at least 3 generations.
There are no prayer rooms for any faith (one male, one female) in any Arab country I have worked or visited, can somebody explain why we need them here. Churches are generally not allowed either. Muslims can time shift the prayers times to the home or some other space, the timing is not exact, matter of fact it is my experience lots of the Muslims do not even bother with prayers. Just not right that we have to change our culture to allow this at the expense of taxpayers. Some bleeding liberal thought it was a good idea, but not so,  remove the prayer rooms or call them something else and the whole mess would not have started.
It’s all part of the Taqiyya doctrine of ends justifying the means. There’s great shock value obviously in targeting kids. So those determined to establish an Islamic caliphate, would whole heartedly employ that tactic, should they believe this would bring them ever closer to their goal.
Envelopes were made to be pushed. I cite all comments as ‘good’ and ‘civil’ because I refuse to be an unpaid censor for ADN.  But my point was that, considering how routinely the so-called ‘liberal’ media excoriates and demonizes Muslims, it’s kinda hard to take seriously your hints that there’s some kind of insidious ‘pro-Muslim' bias encouraging Shannon’s criticism of Senator Kelly’s self-righteous hypocrisy while giving Muslims a pass on everything.  US political and media pundits routinely talk about us the way Herr Goebbels used to talk about European Jews.  Sorry for any big words.
Nationalists and right-wing terrorists were found to be the second deadliest group — after terrorism committed by Islamists — committing 219 murders in that time period, while left-wing terrorists killed 23.
Or we could just not import millions of Muslims in the first place.   Liberals want to spend billions importing and paying for them. But that's not all - then Liberals want to spend billions more on 'programs' to prevent extremism. It makes no sense.   Just don't bring them here in the first place!
Much to disagree with here.   First, Ms. Khalid was anything but eloquent, and has never responded to, or even acknowledged, the reasonable and non-life-threatening responses she has received to her motion.  Regarding the common claim that Islam suppresses women’s rights, Ms. Khan is happy to concede that  “Such a critical view is understandable, given discriminatory gender practices in some Muslim cultures”. But she artfully avoids the actual, and far more pointed, criticism that the basis for gender inequality is the Quran itself, not "some Muslim cultures".  Ms. Khan offers that “Questions and criticism about Islam are not Islamophobia. In fact, Muslims themselves engage in robust debates about modernity and Islamic practice. The cruel irony is that such debates are banned in countries that need it most.” Well.. no! The truly cruel irony is that any and all serious reformers are tarred by islamists and their apologist enablers as .... wait for it... islamophobes.
They keep saying Muslims are not a monolithic culture but this proves they  are.
"Study what happens in most if not all Muslim majority nations and see what happens over time."  Case in point: Egypt.   The problem is that Western people have no sense or adequate knowledge of history. In the culture of instant gratification and where historical consciousness is limited to four-year elections cycles, historical facts are just another Disney World construct.   People who have no past, have no future.   Similarities between Western Liberal Democracy and the Late Roam Antiquity are astonishing. We all know how the Roman Empire ended. We are well on our way to the same ending.
Hmm we allow an a Orthodox commenter, a Protestant commentator, we've had a Jewish commenter, I'm sure folks would welcome a Muslim commenter, but a sedevacantist commentator is just a bridge too far. So much for dialogue.
I couldn't even finish reading this tripe.   Gerry is cementing his communist credentials with the usual anti-white western pap. He, of course, fails to mention that Europeans did not invent slavery and did not bring slavery to Africa.   While there is evidence that there was a difference in the type of slavery within Africa (indentured based on debt) no such difference existed when the Moslems in North Africa bought and sold Africans for profit.  He also failed to mention that African tribes captured people from other African tribes to be sold to the European slave traders.
GBA - My ancestors have been here in the New World since 1633.  I am tempted to convert to Islam just to p**s you off.
“Trump on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, saying the moves would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks.” --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Yeah, because he wouldn’t want “terrorists” to distract native-born Americans from exercising their God-given right to carry firearms and kill each other at the rate of 16,000 per year.
Such use of technology will find a role in business as well. I could have use it during my recent business trip. I had business interactions with a few women of Muslim faith. Although most spoke some English they would not talk directly to me, never looked at me in the eye. If I have to pass a sample to them it had to go thru a middleman.
Actually they may not have overstepped their authority since intent matters and the stated intent of Donald was to exclude Muslims from immigrating. Then Guliani confirmed this intent in his Fox interview. Loose lips sink ships.  Even if the President has the authority to do something, if he states that his intent is to discriminate based on religion the courts will put a wrench in his gears.
"Religious discrimination existed in the 19th century, but it was not part of our official immigration policy. And it has no place in our immigration policy today — either explicitly or implicitly."  Agreed.  But, really, do you think Trump is enough of a religionist to give a tinker's damm about the religion of those he seeks to temporarily exclude?  Which is more likely?  That Trump is such a rabid Christian that he refuses to have Muslims come here?  Or that religion has nothing to do with the temporary exclusion, and that Trump's true concern is that those from certain Muslim countries known to harbor terrorists not be admitted without added assurance that they will not harm us?  If religion were the basis of exclusion, why make it merely temporary?  And why only for some Muslim countries where terrorism runs high?    Finally, it's to be hoped that NCR's readers understand the difference between   cont'd
Sorry, your sense of umbrage isn't bigger than mine.  And this isn't a 'news' article.  It's an opinion piece.  And don't worry, we Muslims have opinions.  If you forget, I'll remind you the next time I express one.
The fact that any criticisms of Khan's claims or those of her co-apologists on the Globe are immediately censored would seem to run counter to her claims of Islam being under siege in Canada. In fact, it strongly points to the opposite.  Here's an example of Khan's whitewashing apologist nonsense:  "Yet 56 per cent believe that "Islam suppresses women's rights." Are they Islamophobic? Of course not. They are entitled to their opinion. Such a critical view is understandable, given discriminatory gender practices in some Muslim cultures..."   Yes, "some" Muslim cultures. A few. Maybe a couple.  How about "Most" or even "All" Sheema?
They wouldn't want to admit both sides might have some bad elements. not the politically correct in all cases Liberals. They just want to spend all your tax dollars bringing in new Muslim Liberal voters who only care about Jihad and all the perks they can get in Canada to reelect them. Half the Liberal party should be imprisoned for treason. Half the Ontario Liberals for economic crimes.
Young men radicalized. A radical Mormon will leave you a book. A radical Buddhist will meditate on universal harmony A Radical Catholic will pray for you soul A radical Protestant won't talk to you A radical Hindu will burn incense A racial Muslim will...well just read any newspaper on earth. .
Just because it's mentioned specifically doesn't mean it has special treatment, Layla. Perhaps you're being a bit over sensitive? Or are you suggesting that the Feb 2015 vote against anti-Semitism is also special treatment? After all, it excluded all other types of discrimination didn't it?  On the other hand, give the current vilification of Muslims due to the actions of the Islamists, perhaps being specific about Islamophobia when addressing discrimination in all forms is also required. I'm sure you've noticed that there are people who can't seem to tell the difference between a Muslim and an Islamist.
I urge everyone Christian, Muslim and all other religions to read the book  "Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now" by Ayaan Hirsi Ali.  It will clear up a lot of misconceptions of Islam and gives a solid base to build  mutual understanding and respect between the West  and Islam.
Is Griffen guilty of Islamic Cultural appropriation?
Why the push to bury Muslims?
Wrong again brutha Frederic. The stamps are in my passports. And typical you didn't answer my main argument and again chose to attack my credibility. The 19 student pilots from Saudi Arabia in 2000 also had no priors. That is what makes them great recruits. I don't get your point. Not talking about lynch mobs, we're talking about common sense. We are talking about the fact that cultures and religions are not interchangeable. You are a muslim in the US and already you are bashing the 'US' when it is the foreign policy of the government that is to blame not the US as a whole.   Our lord has set aside each our own nations to go our seperate ways. As to the hadith above I wish your people practised what they preached. Because there is very little evidence of it in the real world.
well we know she is a liberal and embraces islam
The ball field shooter was described as a normal Democrat, not a Democrat in quotes. Two die in Portland, a Muslim girl was beaten to death in VA, a black soldier murdered in Maryland. And Fox and Radio pump out fear? While you side is pumping of fear that the Russians interfered with the election, but no votes were affected.  What was said on Am radio or Fox that led to these killings?   If what Jones, Coulter or Nugent is responsible, then CNN, CNBC, ABC,NBC,ABC, The Washington Post and The Time are equally responsible.
this is how republicans should have acted with Obama..Benghazi, Guns for Drug Dealers, Money to Iran, Supporting Islamic terror through Muslim Brotherhood, Getting soldiers killed with Rules of Engagement..THIS is how Republicans should have reacted to the traitor and lawbreaker Obama..
People should be free to criticize ALL political systems, religious beliefs and ways of life. Islam is a political system, a religious system AND a way of life all wrapped in one.
None of the Muslims I know subscribe to extremism, but positioning Islam as a religion of peace is a tough sell if they continue to open prayers with a call to victory over Christians, Jews etc.  Such has been reported by multiple sources, with one link posted below.   Worth a read.    http://www.torontosun.com/2015/01/13/muslims-shouldnt-pray-to-defeat-non-muslims
Oh my..we have hysteria running amok...people get a hold of your senses and intellect...i.e., how you gather and process information. To quote from this post..."Donald Trumps Muslim Ban".  Now pay close attention...there is NO ban on Muslims. There is no reference nor mention of Religion in the temporary ban order, nor any mention of Muslims. It simply is not there. Muslims are not banned from travel nor access to the US. Here is what it does say and why. After Bin Laden's death and the reshuffling of power to ISIS/ Radical Islam - those who have hi-jacked the Muslim religion, 7 Countries have emerged as  training grounds and recruitment centers for the Jihadist soldiers to kill the infidel's  (us). These are "Danger Countries". The FBI reports more indepth vetting is needed for screening. The 3 month ban/delay is to allow the updated vetting to process the individuals wanting entry from these 7 countries who allow jihadist training to kill us. There is no Muslim ban!
"You told me I can read from the suit a rally."  It appears Trump was quoting from a press release at the rally, as you mentioned earlier.  Thanks for pointing out where the Hawaii suit refers to the press release in paragraph 38.  Trump's words are the same.  You claim that Trump "made a pivot from banning all Muslims".  Is this your way of saying you believe he won't carry out his campaign promise of a "complete and total shutdown"?  @John Kawamoto and I still believe the promise Trump made during the campaign.  We understand that the current EO isn't a "complete and total shutdown".  However, we also understand that history often works in small steps.  That is, we see the EO as an incremental step toward the goal of a "complete and total shutdown", which was the campaign promise Trump made, and which we still believe.  I'm curious.  If you don't believe what Trump promised during the campaign, why do you now believe he "made a pivot"?
to continue...  Now that you've been schooled in Ontario's education funding, and I assume you're in Ontario although you could be in another province which has done away with religion based school boards. It's actually quite easy to do despite the handwringing about section 93 of the BNA act, let's move on to your comments about Muslims shall we?  Firstly, public schools aren't "denied" religion. What was denied was an entirely state sponsored program of exclusively Christian prayer and the exclusive observation of Christian religious holidays. Any religious group can ask for some accommodation for their religious observances. After all, Christmas and Easter are already days off so what's the big deal about Muslims using a room one afternoon a week? Especially since Christians already have Sunday's off to attend their churches. The mere fact that you put the word "them" in quotes in your earlier post underlines that you're not thinking rationally.
Yes let's call it terrorism but let's not assume that all Muslims are terrorists.
I am so sorry that something like this happened in Anchorage.  I am straight but not narrow, and there are many people here like me, allies.  In fact I think most people are allies, the few haters are just louder than us. The event was peaceful and happy when I was there, about 2-3 pm. All you folks saying don't judge Christians by the actions of these so-called Christians:  now you know how Muslims feel about the few weirdos who call themselves Muslims and wreak havoc.  I speak for my Muslim friends when I write this. Peace.
I just came across an informative article I hadn't seen before, but it was in the Globe and Mail on July 16/16  ("Let's face it: The world has an Islamic problem"). It was written by Felix Marquardt, a Muslim who lives in Paris.  "There is a common thread between despicable acts of violence committed around the world these days. And that common thread is that the people who commit them think of themselves as Muslims. In other words, no, there is no intrinsic "problem" with Islam, but yes, hell yes, there is a contemporary degenerescence of our religion that is threatening its very existence and future. If we, as Muslims, cannot agree on this, then we must brace ourselves, for Islam will disintegrate completely before our eyes in the coming years. To address a problem, one must first admit that there is a problem."
"condemning him for refusing to use the words “radical Islamic terrorism” in identifying the enemy."  Why can't he say those words?  Because it would be viewed unfavorably by Saudi Arabia?  Because it would be viewed unfavorably by Iran?  The two competing homes of  the Sunni and Shi'a sects?    Saudi Arabia, home of the infamous Wahabi sect responsible for  thousands of  extreme madrasas (schools) throughout the Middle East?  Iran, his signature Nuclear Deal partner for his 'Presidential Legacy'?  Both of these theocratic regimes are supporting different sides in the Syria/Iraq/ISIL conflicts.
I would agree, Milo represented free speak even if some found it distressful.   The discussion around M103 has served as something of a catalyst. It's opened a Pandora’s box of broader questions and concerns about Islam in Canada that can’t be neatly put back together.  If the mainstream refuses to be a responsible conduit for the discussion, it’ll keep being had on social media or in the fringes of alternative news forums where there are few moderating voices to steer it on the right path. In the mean time, people’s trust in traditional voices will only erode further.
- as Catholics, it defies the natural law and is intrinsically disordered  - for most other Americans - Christian, Jewish, and Muslim -  it is immoral behavior  - it weakens our nation's moral consensus  - it makes it difficult to raise children who are morally straight  - it weakens the family as the cornerstone of society  There are lot of folks with family members, friends, and co-workers who have same attractions who are not "homophobes" who oppose same sex marriage.  That your name-calling doesn't make the grade of civil intelligent discourse has been pointed out to you numerous times.
.  "Like the two versions before it, President Trump's latest travel ban is still a Muslim ban at its core.  And like the two before it, this one is going down to defeat in the courts," said ACLU lawyer Omar Jadwat."  --  Another FAIL for the Moron-In-Chief.  Are the Trumpenproletariat "sick and tired of winning" yet?
99% of Muslims are peaceful nice people ...  only1% are violent jihadists (its actually higher)  see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_attitudes_toward_terrorism  .01 x 1.6Billion = SIXTEEN MILLION  I'm a racist bigot right?   I have Muslim friends and they agree with me sooo
My father was a devout Catholic and an avowed secularist. His primary identity was Canadian. I suspect that this is the case for the vast majority of Canadians who identify with Christian religions. Their primary identity is rooted in their attachment to Canada or, as is the case for many Francophones, Quebec. More recently, however, there's been a shift as Canada has seen a growth in immigrants (and their offspring) from other religions, often from regions and/or communities where religion is synonymous with personal identity. One study, for instance, indicated that over 60 percent of Muslims in Canada identify primarily as Muslims rather than as Canadians. For many Canadians this is a troubling trend. As my now-deceased father used to note, the most positive social development he witnessed in his lifetime was the decline in sectarian religious chauvinism in the aftermath of WWII. This is a development a lot of Canadians don't want to see reversed.
"Work to get gay marriage recognized."  Why would anyone need to do that again? Marriage equality has already been recognized for many years, and that's been encoded into the law for some time now. This was settled  long ago by the good citizens who don't engage in such hatred, intolerance, and/or division for illegitimate fascistic political gain. That is a closed and settled matter. Only the people who reject liberty and equality believe that marriage equality, ending the war on drug users, ending the war on Muslims, or ending the war on culture are somehow now up for renegotiation. They continue to have this predilection to dig up old historical now-settled civil unrest and unleash them anew upon the world like zombie platoons. They refuse to live in the 21st century, they reject liberty and equality, they hate freedom unless it's their freedom to dominate the meek and impose their artless and corrosive Talibanesque feudalistic and artless will to power upon the entire world.
Worlds population is exploding and this is just the beginning. Population is out of control in Africa, Muslim world and the sub-continent of India.
Two more who believe that islamist terrorism justifies hate and violence against innocent Canadian muslims.
I've never understood the attack on Jews. I work with Jews, I have Jewish neighbors...dated a Jew many years ago. To me, it's like picking on the Lutherans for no reason at all.   But here we are, white supremacists all emboldened and worked up by Trump, putting their ignorance out into the light for all to see. This is the time when the rest of us, Jewish, Muslim, Christians, gay, black, brown, etc., all come together to fight this disease and push it back into the shadows.
Catholics have their own entire school system. Allowing Muslim kids to pray in an empty classroom seems like a far smaller concession.
A rogue state according to the definition that fits the narrative of rogue states like Libya,  Algeria, Russia , North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan - really any Muslim state, communist state, dictatorship etc.   Israel is a constitutional democracy - perhaps one of the very few states in the world where those accustomed to western style freedoms would ever live in. Of course, it's definitely not a place for people who hate Jews, or those that try to equate it with real rogue states in an effort to lend legitimacy to their  evident anti-semitism.
Saudi Arabia is going to execute a man for being an atheist.  We don't need more 'Muslim values' like these here in Canada.
Once upon a time Canada was divided by English and French what united these cultures was hockey. English and French both celebrated Christmas, Easter, Halloween and minor differences on Dominion Day. Presently hockey is not popular with Islam, Chinese, Hindus, Blacks, Phillipinos and Jews. In another 25 years hockey will be a minor sport. Basketball, soccer and cricket being the most popular. Just look at the current TV ratings. Christmas has been changed to the Holidays to welcome varies groups. Christmas Tree is the holiday Tree etc. Diversity does not unite but separates the country...........
The liberal media hate Trump and we see their nastiness. Go Trump ! The Libs and Dems  are clueless about the economy,jobs,and the threat of  Islam. With the Libs it's all about them and keeping them in power with their political BS correctness.
Gruhcho, your last several comments didn't contain anything to respond to, leaving aside the insults.  The article was about hate incidents against muslims, and I think I'm on pretty safe ground to point to them as examples of bigotry and intolerance.  The only time I used the word 'racist' I was quoting you.  Funny, that.
Yes there are still NAZI and NAZI like people in Europe, however the attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions in France, Belgium, Germany etc have all come from Radical Muslims. Do not know if that is the case here but would not be surprised.
That's quite funny.  Do you mean by comparison, or by prompting? . . . My point was, reflecting on the Burns/Novick Vietnam documentary, that Donald Trump seems to combine the greatest failings of the two "Vietnam" presidents, without having the strengths of either of them. . The Communist Red-Scare of the Cold War lay at the root of the ill-conceived anti-communist crusade in Vietnam. . Now we have Islamophobia. Instead of "reds-under-the-bed", we have "Radical Islamic Terrorists". . Different terminology, same ignorant hysteria and scare-mongering. . America has an extreme demagogic right-wing that is now as irresponsible with Islamophobia today as Joseph McCarthy was irresposible with the Red Scare in the Cold War.  That demagogic nonsense now also emanates from the White House. . Let us hope that in 50 years we will not be watching another 18 hour film on how American political hysteria and ignorance resulted in yet another war that needlessly killed 1.5 million people.
Again, same speech from the same pulpit with no substantiation other than hurt feelings and an appeal to identity politics. Why doesn't the Globe assert itself as a news organization and get on the ground in Quebec, in the small towns, rinks, and coffee shops and ask actual Quebecers what they think. Not give the same bully pulpit to the same people continually, your addiction to giving space to academic elitists or muslim advocacy organizations does nothing to find the truth and in the end nothing to support the thousands upon thousands of actual peaceful and gentle muslims that want to make Canada their home. Do your job
Dismiss it all you want!!!  There are a lot of good, hardworking, law bidding citizens trapped in these neighborhoods, exploited and have to fight just to go to school, work,etc.-FACT!!  What you can't stomach is another FACT!!  99% of them are long time Democr_p strongholds, who have never, ever improved these situations for all the citizens!!  Liberals always come out with the hysteria, the racism, the bigotry, etc, etc, etc, BS PC, cowardly double standards-FACT!!  White supremacists rule nothing; find me the number of neighborhoods that they do compared to black & Hispanic neighborhoods.  Also, there are far to many Muslims neighborhoods where LGBT's would not be welcomed, much less any one else deemed socially different.  Keep your eyes wide shut and listening to the usual rhetoric from the PC left and maybe you'll get a chance to experience, as you put it some of the "hysteria" that others, like Kate Steinly and her family did!!  Clueless!!
"and it is up to moderate Muslims to clarify this to "my Canada""  So you're confused and instead of figuring it out for yourself, like the rest of us have, you expect a billion people to explain it to you? What a liberal :P
I do look at terrorist as the enemy, why would you think otherwise?   I think they are cut throat murderers who justify their action with religious shrouds.  I don't respect or honor that religious interpretation.  I know my Old Testament well enough to know it has been used to justify murder as well by Christians and Jewish tradition.    I know that not all Muslims believe in killing non Christians(and I bet you agree?)  How many Oregonions have been killed in the state by Muslim motivated extremist?  (Last 5 years).  How many Oregonions have been murdered by Oregonions?    Using Trump thinking all Oregonions should get tight screening and subjected to investigation    I think our police, FBI, and other's involved in protecting our shores have done outstanding work in stopping acts of terrorism.  Trump's condemnation 0f there tireless efforts is reprehensible and insults the men and women protecting all of us.
yes perhaps "Christian" liberal politicians so obsessed with Bill 103 and Islamophobia in Canada  would now turn some of their energy to Christian-phobia in Middle east
So you're saying that there is no point in striving for something better Doc? That we should just accept the lowest common denominator of human behaviour as normal? That we shouldn't sand against prejudice, and ignorance, and fear, and hate? Sorry but that's not good enough. We deserve better than that.  It's cute that you seem to think of Saint Apollinaire as some kind of Mayberry lost in time. It conveniently ignores the fact that there are many people in the town who support a Muslim cemetery and it ignores the fact that no reasonable grounds have been given for opposing it. Do you even know where it will be located? Behind an industrial park. Hardly an affront to the fabric of the town. Face it, you're afraid of people who don't look like you. Your whole schtick here is simply another attempt to vilify multiculturalism.   But tell you what - give me a reason to stop the Muslim cemetery. Show me that there is a logical reason it shouldn't be there.
This ban (right or wrong on moral/strategic grounds) ...the left needs to stop their fetishization of Islam.  They will win more often in the USA.
This is nothing but a power grab. Not only in Saudi Arabia itself, but Arabia, including Qatar. MBS has apparently irritated the military. It's not just enough to remove the Prince who was head of the National Guard. The rest of the military are not robots. He has the other 2 ruling clans against him and there is wide discontent within the Saudi military, especially since MBS embarked on a war with the Yemen with no end-game in sight.... a quagmire. Reguly should not make excuses for this guy; economic reform is just a facade. Economics has noting to do with it: he is brash and it is all power and consolidation of power:  local princes, Qatar (supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood) and Lebanon (with Shiite Hezbollah's political coalition with Christians and alliance with Iran) are in the way.   The impetuous MBS will turn out to be a modern day Enver Pasha, who almost single handedly led the demise of the Ottoman Empire.
It is a fact that our political leadership is responsible for the fall of the CDN $. All that had to be done to reverse the loonie fall was to get the 30 billion of pipelines built so our people could get back to work and Canada Oil would get the international price when it is sold. Also we stop oil imports on the east coast. Imagine our trees  in NB consume more carbon than we ever make and now our liberal governments in Ottawa and NB want to tax us with a carbon tax. I can only suggest that  they take a trip to the Persian Gulf and see the carbon damage done there (not to mention funding the Sunnie's in the Muslim civil war) and they may just get a better understand of how stupid they are. It is all self inflicted to save a few manufacturing jobs, please the Indians and environmentalist. It is a fools game, Canada is an exporter  of resources the world needs, our failure is that we do not get the international value for our exports. Time to put  Canada FIRST
A majority of North Americans are against a female leader. Many European countries, Asian countries and Muslim countries have broken that glass ceiling. Sirimavo Bandaranaike was the first female leader in the world, of Sri Lanka. Indira Gandhi was the leader of India in 1966. Margaret Thatcher became the leader of the UK in 1979.
It's not clear to me that elections have usually been decided on the basis of calm, rational consideration of facts, programs, and ideas.  I believe that Trump's victory needs to be seen first and foremost in the context of  the current rise of right-wing populism across the Western democracies.  The fear of Muslim immigration, for example, is not easily countered by appeals to facts (e.g., a British research group found that many Europeans greatly overestimate the number of foreigners who are in their countries).  The willingness to believe "fake news," etc., seems to me to be grounded in powerful emotions that may override whatever ability and willingness human beings have to base our decisions on reality, careful thought, and "the better angels of our nature."
"Remove the plank from your own eye before talking about splinters in others" @Shaista Aziz tell us what your community is doing for not making the same mistake over and over on different subjects such as...  (1) the Montréal Shafia Family’s tragedy/ 3 sisters and 1st wife murders in 2009 were found dead inside a car that was discovered underwater in Kingston, Ontario/ Québécois are Very Drastic & will never let another & do everything that tragedy of Shafia Family happened again !) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpiF35L9tI0  (2) TVA Nouvelles/ Montréal le 26 janvier 2016; Hamza Chaoui  (see Google for info) is one of Québec's best-known radical imams.  He is known by his many controversial statements.   Islam, according to him, is incompatible with democracy, as parliaments may consist "a disbeliever, a homosexual or an atheist who says the lack of Allah." (more to come...if not "censured")
You can rant all you want about this, but the fact remains Trump claims he hasn't changed his mind on the Muslim ban.
Let's try this again:  We already have a prison camp for (radical) Muslims. It's called Gitmo, and progressive hero Obama didn't close it down, despite promising to, despite 8 years, and despite keeping wars going and killing numerous Muslim civilians with drones.  You put up with that, didn't you?
The Globe and Mail. Sharia compliant. Everyday in every way. The Muslim Brotherhood would be proud.
The term 'white supremacy' has a redundancy. There is no need to use 'white' because only whites, European Christian whites, in particular exhibit racist supremacy. No other race in the world has it.   While slavery has been a paramount practice of white Europeans, it is they who turned it into an epic crime of trade - the Slave Trade of the 17th -19th centuries. Millions of black Africans died, millions more shipped to become lifetime slaves of white man in the New World. The profit was most handsome.  This white man holy war on Blacks reflect on today holy war on Islamic lands, the latest round started by America in the 80's. The motive same - money and power (oil, US dollar supremacy, control of Middle East on behalf of Israel).   But there is a difference - there were no retaliation from the black man, or from Africa for the white man's biggest rape of the human race. But this is the 21st century, era of globalization, communications, knowledge. Nobody will take it anymore.
The FakeNews.com finally reported a fact. Melania Trump did not cover her hair as is customary in Muslim countries.  OMG! She  didn't cover her hair?  The big issues of the day.  Oh yeah, neither did Michelle Obama, Chancellor Merkle, Hillary Clinton, Britain's Theresa May among others,  Such a controversy.  Watch and have fun as the fakenews addicts attack Melania.
I note how you take great delight in playing that phone message in your workshops. In third grade we had a teacher who would single-out students who 'got it wrong', and everyone would laugh at that child. Surely there  are better ways to initiate conversation than to ridicule a participant.   You used the abstract adjective 'problematic' twice to criticize others, but failed to unpack that heavyweight term; if something is problematic, the reader immediately asks, "How is it problematic?"  On perception and truth-- "What if citizens are basing their opinions and values purely on their perceptions and feelings, rather than on hard evidence?"   "Let's make certain our New Year's resolutions include a commitment that we acknowledge our perceptions while checking for the facts and the truth."  "Hard evidence . . . the facts and the truth." Indeed; you write in defence of Islam, a religion based upon belief. Belief is an imagined truth-- there are no facts or hard evidence to prove it.
I guess the local Norwegians don't have much faith in SNOPES like you do. The invasion from Muslims continues, and they don't assimilate nor do most work. But they sure stand in line for "free stuff" just like the 47% here in the US. And if you lived in Norway I might buy some of your rebuttal.  I'll go with what my relatives tell the family.
For the fundamental problem is that the majority of otherwise peaceful and law-abiding Muslims are unwilling to acknowledge, much less repudiate, the theological warrant for intolerance and violence embedded in their own religious texts (Qur'an and Hadith).  Five things that are recognized as inherently harmful in Islam and only when they are repudiated and nullified will a true Muslim Reformation have been achieved:   1. Muhammad's semi-divine and infallible status along with the literalist reading of the Qur'an, particularly those parts that were revealed in Medina;  2. The investment in life after death instead of life before death;  3. Sharia, the body of legislation derived from the Qur'an,  the Hadith, and the rest of Islamic jurisprudence;  4. The practice of empowering individuals to enforce Islamic law by commanding right and forbidding wrong;  5. The imperative to wage jihad or holy war
There is no need for this American to come to Canada and agitate Muslims . He should come though and explain about why Islam is such a problematic religion. Muslims do not talk about their own shortcomings.
In Kentucky Muslim students were enrolled into a private Catholic  schorl.  The school  was intially very happy to have the new students. But after about a  year the Muslim students complained about the presence of crucifixes in every room. It offended them. They sued and won over $100,000 for pain and suffering, and the Catholic school had to remove all crucifixes. However the fine forced the school to close.  ------------------ Muslims demand   the removal of crosses a a Catholic university . http://toprightnews.com/muslims-demand-that-offensive-crosses-be-removed-from-catholic-school/ http://allchristiannews.com/muslim-student-sues-catholic-school-because-crosses-were-offensive/
During the eight years of the Obama administration, the world was fighting Islamic terrorism, starvation and diseases and what was the Obama administration doing?  It was fighting for gay marriage, transgenders in the military, and to put men in ladies’ rest rooms.  Democrats are angry at Trump because for the first time in the history of our country we have a president who is working very hard to keep his campaign promises.
Well, but you are omitting a lot of other new evidence that makes your argument here totally fall apart.  The FBI is reporting that the shooter digested a vast amount of Islamic extremist propaganda online recently.  They report that he spent hours watching ISIS executions, including numerous beheadings.  It has also been revealed that his father made appearances on a TV channel known for its support of the Taliban, and for its anti-American remarks.   In fact, the father himself did make statements supportive of the Taliban and their harsh reactionary Sharia rule.  So for you to claim that religion had no part in this tragedy, could not be more incorrect.  No doubt the reactionary religious beliefs of his family & the extremist beliefs of ISIS, were all in direct conflict with his own personal inclinations.   Such a situation could have led to extreme self-loathing on his part.   And the only way he felt he could thus redeem himself was to commit himself to Jihad, and kill infidels.
Obama's catering to the Ayatollahs by facilitating the development of a nuclear bomb in exchange of doing business with Iran will backfire on Americans literally speaking. The 'death to America' Iranian extremism is real and always present. Let Trump do what he has to do with Obama's affinity to Islam and their hatred towards the West and put an end to the outgoing president's terrible policies.
Stephen Paddock was not a "responsible gun owner," he was a mass murderer. Since you brought up death toll, perhaps you already forgot about the Islamic extremist who killed 84 people in Nice, France last year by running them over with a rented truck?
Actually the demographic that is growing in terms of actual numbers in Canada is the "nones", the non-religious.   And many of the children of these Muslim immigrants will be opting for that option so I'm not too worried.
Pope Francis should use his bully pulpit to begin a worldwide discussion of the problem of religious fundamentalism that has infected every religion and is responsible for most of the acts of terrorism we hear about on the news. He can start by plucking the beam out of Catholicism's eye and address fundamentalism in Catholicism before beginning a dialogue with Muslim leaders about their own brand of fundamentalism, which is responsible for most of the terrorist incidents around the world. I think there needs to be a pan-religious network of moderate faith leaders who can begin to confront the problem of religious fundamentalism, because it is only getting worse.
Hello ArtEndsemble,  Wrong, I did not change my thesis. My thesis was about fanciful works of fiction, and I named two: Works by Atwood and Clancy. And when another post writer brought out works of non-fictional material (e.g. assassinating Bin Laden in a Pakistan hideout), I stepped forward to emphasize that my thesis was about fanciful works of fiction. It was pretty clear, though, in my original post, given that I was talking about writers choosing villain types from a menu of possibilities.    Your comment is not compelling, about Clancy's fiction having an authentic feel, since Jurassic Park and Avatar also have authentic feels. Good fiction is like that, grounded in real-world concerns like profit and environmentalism and what have you. The functionally important feature, though, is that as a fiction writer you decide if your environment villain will be an outer space mining company, or a dinosaur genetic engineer industrialist, or a radical Christian, or a radical Muslim.
They are not the same.    Benghazi was a cover up of how a United States Ambassador was killed and how the Obama administration, including Hillary and the Ambassador to the United Nations at the time came up with 'Talking Points' in the middle of a re-election campaign to minimize the political impact.  "The CIA immediately (and correctly) asserted that it was a terrorist attack, so why did the Obama administration tell the American people that it was a protest in response to an utterly obscure YouTube video that was deemed offensive to Muslims?"  This Sessions situation is, at the very best, a lie by a sitting Senator in a confirmation hearing about speaking with a Russian Ambassador.  The two situations are quite different.
It is a Muslim ban.  That is what the policy is.  I am just describing it as what it is.  I am sorry that pointing out it is bigoted is offensive to you.
You see many of the terrorists follow the Muslim religion. That is why their is an inordinate amount of hate crimes against this religion.  So what are they going to do about that?
You just made my argument for me.  I said DEEPLY RELIGIOUS, as in the "holy, devout quran reading muslims" you referred to.  The problem with christian, muslim or any other deeply religious, is with the small percentage that edge over into extremism.  My point is that, combined with the other issues cited, "deeply religious" becomes a red flag.
I posted a few comments about the Muslim religion, Islam. They did not get posted on here and did not last very long on the log in site. They were removed. So much for freedom of speech. Okay then Islam is a wonderful religion of peace. Just look at all the countries where Muslims are the majority. You can look it up on Wikipedia. Oh if you don't believe this and try to state some facts you will be called in Islamophobe or threatened with death.  No other religion would be able to have 300 people praying in there public facilities but don't be an Islamophobe and don't point out any facts to the Globe and Mail or you will be edited. So Islam is the religion of peace and there needs to be total separation of religion and state except for Islam. There G&M may post this.
I honest believe that Obama was planted into the White House and is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Yes, Middle politics is complex, and local. There is no single, united Muslim world, there are only some factions of Muslims fighting against other factions of Muslims (and non-Muslims).  Which is why the recurrent refrain from some quarters blaming terrorist attacks in the west to "the West attacking Muslims, get out of Muslim lands and all will be well" is so laughable.
Islamophobia is an oxymoron.  There's no such thing as unreasonalbe fear of islam.  Every kaffir should be very fearful
's a funny thing to reflect on what a follower of ISIS might reply to your comment, Trid. P'raps something like "Be that as it may, Christianity is a false religion so its law is not from God. It would seem that you place Christianity on a par with Islam"? Is there something to reflect on here? Did Jesus even intend to found a new religion? Is the Kingdom of Heaven really exactly synonymous with the Christian churches? Are all Muslims thought to be excluded from the Kingdom of Heaven? Heaven Forbid!

I have never been fond of the term "Islamophobia" as it implies that hatred of Muslims is a mental disorder, rather than just good old fashioned bigotry. I think it absolves people of responsibility. But for those who believe in the separation of religion and state, equality for women and respect for gay people, we should not shy away from pointing out that a good portion of Western Muslims are in fact opposed to those principles. So it's the dilemma of the (post) modern liberal .
There is a very offensive anti-Muslim ad on this page.  It talks about giving "child marriage" the finger?  I've reported this Islamophobic ad to the editors.  This fundamental tenant of Islam must be tolerated in a tolerant Canada.   Yes?  I fear the M-103 police will not tolerate my opinion.
So if the Muslim hijab or veil or turban makes people feel "uncomfortable", then certainly the School will ban those "symbols" too, right?  Because the First Amendment is limited by what a few loud people say makes them say they are "uncomfortable" hearing, right School District?
I was watching a video from Iraq of Islamic State militants firing furiously on those who are attempting to dislodge them.  What went through my mind was that, as Islamic State in Iraq is not in a position to resupply their fighters, the Islamic State fighters will eventually run out of resources and are facing inevitable defeat.  I am watching the media using all the tricks at their disposal in attempts to discredit Donald Trump and other right of center activists.  I suspect that like Islamic State those opposing “populism” are facing inevitable defeat as they run out of credibility.
Sorry, Christian blood-letting just since WWII is orders of magnitude greater than Muslims', even if we were afflicted by 100 groups like the Da'esh (wrongly called "ISIS").
Well pal, I was raised in the military all over the world, lived and went  to school with all the races, and learned equality as a way of life. I don't have prejudiced bone in my body.  But I also had to learn to be aware of danger, and when to bug out.  AND who to keep my eye on.  There is no other people other than MUSLIMS running around committing suicide and killing hundreds of others just to get to heaven.  Dude, its been happening in the middle east since 900AD (approx.) Now its getting bad in Europe, real bad. And it has come to America. You need to learn what Taqiyya is. And I know, most Muslims don't follow Sharia Law, but they want to, they're being radicals by being secular, ALL good Muslims obey Sharia Law, religiously. All good fundamental Muslim's that is.
I do not believe that Mr. Trump’s agenda is racist or sexist or that he hates Mexicans or even Muslims (peaceful ones, that is). -  Margaret Wente  Who dares contradict  Wente?
Here's a rundown from your favorite newspaper: "Many if not most Americans had never heard of Bannon before this weekend, and for good reason: He has kept a low profile, even after taking over Mr. Trump’s campaign in August. Before that, he worked as the executive chairman of the Breitbart News Network, parent company of the far-right website Breitbart News, which under Mr. Bannon became what the Southern Poverty Law Center has called a “white ethno-nationalist propaganda mill.”  "Mr. Bannon himself seems fine with that description, telling Mother Jones last summer that Breitbart was now “the platform for the alt-right,” a loosely organized group of mostly young men who believe in white supremacy; oppose immigration, feminism and multiculturalism; and delight in harassing Jews, Muslims and other vulnerable groups by spewing shocking insults on social media." https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/opinion/turn-on-the-hate-steve-bannon-at-the-white-house.html?_r=0  Your kind of guy, eh Lars?
Observant Muslims or Jews don't celebrate Christian holidays. The examples mentioned by skyofblue are following their faith as much as a jew who eats bacon.
Here in the Lower Mainland of Vancouver there is a Muslim school for those who wish to attend. But BC is not a perfect democratic, integrated system situation either because our BC government does give 50% of private school costs to private schools, which means the public is paying for many denominations to pray at their funded schools. Religion should not be in schools funded by the tax payers, unless their taxes are going to separate schools as in ON and AB. Bad move for our multicultural society.
Coffee was brought to Europe by Turkish Muslims.   Just saying.
"Stay on subject" Yet, no doubt your okay with it when the subject is current violence done in the name of religion by Muslim extremists, and inevitably someone will bring up what some Christians were doing many centuries ago.
Boozer:  Thank you for your response.  I think some of our disagreements are semantic......I consider myself a liberal (as do virtually all my friends, both fellow liberals and conservatives.. one of my conservative buddies always greets me with "how's my favorite Commie-pinko doing today.")   There are those far to my left......those who would repeal the Second Amendment and those who would "spike" logs at Swanson Bros mill, for example.  On the flip side, those who would bomb abortion clinics and shoot abortion providers or take over federal property with an armed occupation do not, in my opinion, represent Conservative thought.  There are extremists on both ends of the political spectrum.    Re: Muslims... ISIS is a radical terrorist "movement" and will, likely, never be totally defeated and surrender, but will remain a "player" in international affairs.  We will never "get a handle on this" as Mr. Trump suggests in the context of ending Muslim exclusion.    regards and thanks, Gary
when muslims stop throwing gays off buildings, stop treating women like second class citizens, and allow me to live my life the way I want to then we can have this discussion.
Polls are a meg-industry, making a huge part of the campaign expenses for both parties, but they are like weather prognostications - often wrong.  I'm alarmed at the avoidance of discussing the monster of today - islam, & what it has already done & promises to do to all unbelievers. How many muslims now occupy many high governmental positions in spite of islam's vows to eliminate Israel & all non-muslims? Hilary promises more muslims occupying the USA. Globalism, islam & terrorism, insecure borders, the cost of illegals, adverse trade agreements, & corruption in government at all levels &Wall Street should be the top themes of the national debate. American Nationalism should be our top goal. As Barry Goldwater succinctly said,"I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice! And ... & moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue." Trump is an imperfect messenger, but he is the only answer to the dire state of our country today. America First !
IRT Wilfredo Tungol, don’t look now, but the Supreme Court of the United States gave President Trump another victory in the immigration battle when on Tuesday, October 10th, when it tossed out an appeals court ruling that struck down his previous temporary travel ban targeting eight Muslim-majority nations that are known terrorist hotbeds.  This does not bode well for Hawaii’s challenge which has not yet been heard. However, since the arguments used in the tossed out this case are similar to those use in Hawaii’s case, the odds are that it also will be tossed out.  Bottom line:  President Trump has the Constitutional and legislative authority for his travel bans.
Nowhere in this story was there any reporting on cost containment efforts,  large or small.  When I read that the State of Washington,  twice as many people as Oregon,  has half as many attorneys in their Attorney General's employ,  yet successfully stopped the Trump "muslim ban",  and evidently keeps Amazon and Microsoft in line,  the State involved in leasing over a million acres of Common School Land farm and ranch ground,  a huge water,  air and ground transportation effort sorted out,  it dawned on me Oregon is growing government just to grow government because that has become the best job in the State.   Then I read that AG Rosenblum,  along with Gov Brown,  have collected between them,  over $800,000 in campaign funds for the 2018 election from just 42 law firms with State of Oregon contracts to provide legal services.    There is another $2 billion in vendor contracts out there with the State,  and you know those are sending money to the font of their success.  No more taxes.
That same Rasmussen poll also showed that 73% of republicans support a permanent ban on any Muslim immigrants.  Must be afraid of Bannon's scary fables.
Suicide bombers is connected to air travel. Khomeini issued a fatwah saying the annual shia ritual wherein they flagellate themselves---we've all seen the videos on the news---could now be extended to blowing themselves up as a work around to the Islamic no no on suicide and when he did so this changed the equation, making planes easy targets when killing infidels was OK now for muslims. This is the real reason airports should be secure. As for Inouye, I hate him but decided to be positive instead of being annoyed over seeing that guys legacy popping up, when I know personally and professionally what kind of a guy he really was.
No one is justifying the murder of this young woman.  What is being questioned is whether it was intentionally a hate crime against a muslim, versus a random, thoughtless murder.  Only one person knows and that is the perp. Until/unless he explains his actions, this article is speculation.
Oh the arrogance, and ignorance, of the media in this country. Left and Right.  There is an undercurrent of anger in Canada. As there is in Britain. As there is in America.  It is not rooted in racism. It is not rooted in hate.   It is rooted in watching as the hard fought liberties of centuries are eroded by, and ultimately destroyed by, perverted modern  liberalism.  Liberalism was borne of the idea of personal liberty and responsibility. It had as a core ideal the primacy of the individual.   But it became infested with socialist ideals, collectivism and moral relativism.  And has led us to today, where within 60 years, many bastions of western liberal democracy will be gone or unrecognizable.  Replaced by Islamic theocracies or Asian paternal dictatorships.  Yes, this fear has led to a neo-orangutan becoming the most powerful man in the world.  But at least the Brits and Yanks have recognized the shadow that has been creeping across our lands of liberty.
I didn't mean that in a bad way, I'm just saying they're on my side.  Islam (although they have Abe in their corner and admit Jebus was a prophet) deny his death, burial and resurrection.   Muslims deny the very foundation of christianity.  atta a boy, Muslims.
"Skip, the courts banned the Lord's Prayer because it was imposed on ALL students:"  Except that it wasn't.  There were 2 kids in my classes back in the early 80s who were exempted (one was for religious reasons(Jehovah's Witness), the other was just from a family that was simply staunchly secular) and no-one batted an eye, not the students and not the teachers.  This was BEFORE Zylberberg and I grew up IN SUDBURY!  Simple fact is that in the case you referenced, the parents did not want their kids "to be singled out" for not participating in an optional exercise.  Which is different from the case of muslims nowadays who insist that their differences be actively acknowledged and openly displayed.  Nothing to see here but for some bored, busybody, agenda pushing, parents with too much time on their hands.
Harper? Lol. How far will the blame game go?  You can fairly blame this on 1) Trump, 2) excessive media coverage of terrorist attacks, 3) the perpetrators, most likely non-Muslim Canadians feeling isolation in the current political environment, 4) lack of media coverage on the larger pan-Islamic community's genuine efforts to distance itself from extremist groups, and 5) the terrorists themselves.
Yes, but more history than you are willing to acknowledge.  The Left in the sense of social consciousness originated in Christianity, but that was long repudiated in favour of Marxism and the denunciation of religion as "the opium of the masses".  Until Islam, when it became fashionable to defend religion again...
Who's to say he/she isn't afraid of fundamental Christians or the type of American Christians we have in the Republican party? I know I'm afraid of them too.  As a woman, I can say I have definitely been discriminated against several times by Muslims.  I have never discriminated against them. Is it not rational for me to be afraid they will continue to discriminate against me?
What I find terribly upsetting is that the Pope is more worried about illegal immigrants in the US than Christians being slaughtered by Muslims in the Middle East.  After one of his priests was killed in France, during Mass, he still fails to see it.
trump HAS NO CHANCE of winning.  His own party wants NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM.  He's insulted and alienated:  blacks Hispanics women asians muslims jews gays you name it...he's offended them and LOST THEIR VOTE.  He only has the LOON VOTE.
Add this to the list. A serial sexual predator impersonating a POTUS....followed by a rich spoiled frat boy impersonating a POTUS....followed by a closet Muslim and community organizer impersonating a POTUS. None of them are really what we wanted them to be. Donald is not perfect....but his pragmatism will result in a better country.
Just because a cemetery was proposed doesn't mean it was "next to" anyone's property looking at it from a "back window." If that was the issue why would a whole town be invited to vote?  When land use is proposed typically only directly adjacent property owners are consulted. Were there any homes backing onto the property and was any kind of buffer proposed between the lot line and burial area? Did you read about this anywhere? Me thinks there are a lot of excuses being thrown around about not wanting to be "next to" a cemetery by people who wouldn't be living anywhere near it. It's all about Muslim hating Islamophobia.
I have read Ayaan Hirsi Ali's book "Heretic ..."  She presents an insightful analysis of Islam, both in a contemporary and historical context.  Clearly our MP's and MPP's have not read her book - they wouldn't be proposing and passing these kinds of motions if they had.  It bears noting that Ayaan Hirsi Ali was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world today.
With the tribal honor killing last night in Thorncliffe Park, this on top of the sex-ed rebellion and other demands to change the school system to accommodate Muslims rather than adapt to Canadian customs and values Thorncliffe Park will become a "no-go" zone for Christians much like those found in may European countries.
Merkel is leader of refugees.  May be she is a secret Muslim like some other leaders.
Would it change your mind if I quoted another Constitutional lawyer who disagreed with Grey?  I didn't think so...  There is no unequivocal proof that the No voters conspired together to reject the zoning application on the basis of religion.  You are suggesting that mere speculation that the vote might have been influenced by some anti-Muslim sentiment is proof unto itself.     There was no unassailable right from the outset for the vote to be passed.  That the outcome was close suggests the voters had mixed views on the issue, which seems reasonable (posters on this forum are not in full agreement either).    Claiming that the Charter was violated based upon uncorroborated speculation is not a good start.    It takes a lot more than "J'accuse!".    Rather,  it sounds like sour grapes...."If it didn't go my way, it must be a breach of the Charter."...which actually serves to trivialize real Charter breaches when one cries "Wolf" so often.
Obama's mission wasn't to do good for America, but to Muslimize America. He even got on TV & lied through his teeth saying 'Islam Has Been Woven Into the Fabric of Our Country Since Its Founding' - total lie! He even had the Muslim Brotherhood leaders to the White House & tried like hell to avert their ousting in Egypt but had to back off quick after the Arab Spring, or he would've been too transparent. Yet he wasn't at all friendly like Allies should be with Israel. Hard telling what else he & Holder did to sabotage America by diverting tons of money to who knows which 'programs'.  He rode into the presidency on MLK's coattails, yet plunged race relations to a 100 year low, vilifying our heroes in Blue instead of getting it across to his anti-civilization thug-nation brotherhood that EVERYONE must stop & comply or risk dying, & that it's not our right to argue or resist ANYTHING the police say or do! And yet he's hoodwinked the left into believing he was the best prez ever! Ha! WrongO
islam is religion of peace and love
1 - why wouldn't it be accommodated?   2 - of course those devout Catholics could also avail themselves of AN ENTRE SCHOOL SYSTEM designed to support their religion. When you consider that effort and expnse makes the 15 minutes on Friday that Muslims are asking for (and have been getting for 20 years with no problems) seem like a no brainer.
And the muslim prayer rooms serves to create this sort of us and them division within the school.
This line in the article says it all: "The agency did note, however, that in 2015, police services increased outreach to ethnic groups and, in addition, the National Council of Canadian Muslims made efforts to encourage reporting of hate crimes to police." Look up who the National Council of Canadian Muslims used to be called.  Since the Liberals introduced motion M-103 and Iqra Khalid conferred with Muslim groups on the motion, they have decided to ramp up their reporting of 'incidents' to justify the motion. They are now 'examining' the motion, so how long do you think it will take before it becomes a bill then a law? The MB is controlling the narrative!
“almost 50 per cent of the voters in the rest of the country were prepared to vote for Donald Trump”  Actually, most Americans who voted did so for someone else …  “populist stirrings”  All this really refers to is the re-emergent far-right exploiting fear and anger to win support, paying lip service to the public's concerns in order to empower itself.   The far-right can't be called 'populist' because it does nothing to empower the disenfranchised, and quite the opposite, it exploits the fear and anger at the many daunting crises facing us, largely caused by the right's monopoly on power, to win support, but then it redirects that anger from those deserving of it, and onto the usual scapegoats; minorities, immigrants, Muslims, and of course those they've deemed liberals, progressive, and the left, those who pose the only real threat to the status quo.
"Crawford was sentenced Monday to 30 years in federal prison for plotting to build an industrial X-ray machine that would spew lethal doses of radiation powerful enough to kill people from a distance. His plan, according to a federal complaint, was to place the machine inside a truck or a van, park the vehicle outside Muslim institutions and activate it remotely. The goal was for his targets to be dead long before they realize they'd inhaled poison."  Hahahahaha, we have a winner. What else do journalists, or at least this journalist, not understand about electromagnetic radiation?
I agree that there seems to be an unusually high interest in muslim refugees, but I don't agree that this is an anti American reaction as we saw the same behaviour in 2015 prior to the last election in Canada.
Never let a good tragedy go to waste.  Whether it is trump and other anti-muslim fanatics using the bombing in England or any tragedy to grab power for their agenda.  Or a literal grave sight from Pearl Harbor attack from the Japanese. People will always look for ways to exploit a tragic event for their own personal gain.  But it shows the character of people like this who carry themselves in this manner.
None of which are shown to be related to Muslims or Muslim immigration.  And I didn't read the statistics selectively, I compared a block of four adjacent territorial origins, the statistical differences of which are quantitatively insignificant.  To the contrary it is you, choosing to focus on North African immigrants, that is being selective.  Note that none of these statistics mention the religion of any of the studied subjects so the poster Moss Dulet's disgraceful false slur on Muslims remains, in the face of your stats, unproven and baldly bigoted.  Still waiting for Moss Dulet, or you, or anyone else, to provide any evidence that "Muslim men have been committing huge numbers of rapes since Sweden made the mistake of admitting so many members of a 'rape culture' into their country."
Just what is this "coalition" doing about Islamophobia? A couple of integrated churches simply doesn't cut for me. I don't see any concentrated effort by Muslim organisations to explain what Islam is about or any firm attempt to co-exist let alone assimilate into our culture.  What I see is just one more culture demanding that not only do the majority have to conform to their standards, but the government has to pay for doing so.  So, unless the Muslims want to do like the Doukhobors of old and remove themselves to communes to practise their faith, they better get used to the idea that within three generations their descendants will not resemble what we see today. This is the Canadian way. We do not actively force people to become "like us", we simply assimilate them into our culture without a ripple. We did it to the French and the Scots and the Irish and every other immigration wave.  Quebec being here first is the only ones who didn't.
Muslims and Liberals do not want protection of all religions. They want protection for one.
" I’m just telling you you’re dishonest people.”  well he's got that right  anyone dedicated to NOT taking the USA into another war is alright in my books  Obama despite his rhetoric bombed 8 Muslim countries, triggered three civil wars and used drones to kill ordinary citizens who were not enemies of the state
I am surprised this post hasn't been deleted yet.  It goes against the standard Muslims-only-as-victims narrative so widely held by the government/media.  As I knew little about this issue, I checked Wikipedia for a more fulsome explanation.  It was much more complex and nuanced than what Campbell Clark's simplistic article reported.   Perhaps other countries aren't being so quick to take sides because they understand the full context better.
What world do you live in?  . I find it hard to believe that you  could be so naive. I rather believe that you have an agenda, above and beyond what an average persons' affiliations on the subject could be. . It is indeed sad that not a single open discussion, or a debate about Islam (and it's agenda) has taken place in Canada. Ever.   Muslim community has grown by how much in the last 10-20 years? How many Muslim MPs? And yet Canada is now officially 'Islamophobic' - courtesy of the Liberal sell-outs.  Just look how long it is going to take for this post to be deleted.
..with obligatory education in all public schools on Islamic history and  moral values.
The Crimean Tarters kidnapped Ukrainian and Russians and sold them on the slave markets in the Middle East. The Turks kidnapped Christian boys who were brought up from the age of 7 to serve in the Janissaries (infantry units). The slave trade is the reason why there are so many blond and blue eyed people in the Middle East.  Slavery continues in the Middle East to today’s date – although it no longer involves white children. Type into Google the words “slavery Saudi Arabia” or another country and read what appears. The Muslim countries have never apologized for the white slave trade. No compensation has ever been offered to the descendants of the victims. No monument exists on the sites of the slave markets to commemorate the victims.  4. On 3 occasions, Muslims nearly conquered Europe. Twice the Turks reached the gates of Vienna. Muammar Gaddafi, when he was Libyan leader, predicted that Muslims would conquer Europe through numbers and their birth rate.
Utter foolishness and chock full of falsehoods.  First, Heinbecker should always disclose that he is married to a Muslim Turkish woman, which will give you a sense of where he's coming from.  Among other falsehoods, the 2003 Iraq war didn't cause the refugee crisis, rather it was the Syrian civil war (Obama) and the Libyan overthrow (Obama) which caused it.  Syria was quiet until 2011.    Heinbecker actually supports millions of refugees overwhelming Germany and Europe.  Heinbecker is a discredited wrong-century guy.
People of countries, which have sizable Muslim population, are always skeptical about Muslims.  In Western countries, most people don't know about Taqiya.
Since you've asked me this question 3 times in this very same thread, I'll give you the same answer:  No I haven't. I lived 6 months in the middle east and south asia and have a pretty good understanding of Islam, thanks.  Have you read the debates in the Ontario legislature that this article is about? Have you even read the full text of the motion?
Didn't your work as a trooper require you to verify information before you attested it to be true?  If so, you've regressed - you're citing a satire piece as actual evidence (http://www.snopes.com/politics/satire/sharia.asp).  It would be funny if it wasn't tragic.  Here's another helpful link that will help you quantify the Muslim "masses" "invading" Norway: http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-regional-europe/  Just because it's on the Inner Tubes doesn't make it true.
My religious holidays are somewhat different than Catholic's or Jewish (I am not muslim either).Should the whole country take days off when I observe my holidays? There are a lot more faiths in Canada, if we have time off to accommodate every single one we wouldn't get anything done.  Sat/Sun off might have been a Christian thing originally. It is now secular traditions and has nothing to do with Christianity or Jewry. Many (non-practicing) Christians mow their lawns or go to work on Sunday. Church attendance is low. Many Jews don't observe Shabbat.   Religion has no business in schools,workplace, government. Scrap the catholic school systems, let people make arrangements with employers: to go out and pray, to bank time for their own holidays etc.
IOW... western "democracy" is not only inefficient to compete in the global economy, it's obsolete and those proclaiming their fealty to "democracy" are the privileged establishment class and their cadres of unionized public service employees.... (and Ontario will forever have a Liberal government thanks to the unionized public service vote concentrated in the larger urban centres, e.g. GTA!).  When economically competing against China Inc., India, Inc., and Mexico, LLC ..... U.S. "democracy" fails miserably and is on a downward spiral that may be too far gone to rescue....... and as goes the USA, so goes Canada down the drain.  Solution?: Import more muslim refugees, and give them social assistance payments forever.
Leslie - How am I denying anyone  "the ability to live their life the same way everybody else gets to."???   I'm not a Muslim.    And be careful what you say in here because the forum tattle tale..... garycrum .... will write an op-ed for the RG and blab it to the entire galaxy.
Good column. My Canada includes welcoming Muslims to be part of it.   ONLY IF THEY INTEGRATE AND do not ask for more accommodation than other religions?
It would appear that Her Majesties' Loyal Opposition has abdicated! They have joined the Government and have moved this Province down the road to anti-blasphemy laws. We are kafir(non believers)  there is no place in Islam for kafir. We will be forced by this government one day to accept a religion that thinks it is acceptable to kill kafir; we will be forced to accept a religion that believe it is acceptable to beat a woman (chattel property); we will be forced to accept a religion that believes it is acceptable to marry an infant. An Islamophobe is someone who knows more than they are supposed to know about Islam. We need to send a very strong message to these politicians. That being none of them deserves our support or vote!
Since Mohamed went to Medina, Islam has expanded through violent subjugation. Islam has a 1400 year history of violence. This is not a religion of peace.  The religion of Islam says to imitate Mohamed and he's the final messenger of Allah. But Mohamed killed people, had sex slaves, ordered assassinations, married a child, etc... The very nature of Islam is to conduct violent jihad on those who do not practice Islam.  Canadians need to take an unflinching look at the history of Islam and decide if we should allow this historically violent religion in our country.
Wow. Talk about having your head buried in the sand. First of all, proposals have been made regarding the term "Islamophobia". The motions proponent responded that "she would not water it down".Second,the suggestion to clarify it with "irrational fear of Muslims" did not just miss the clarity mark, it misses the truth.   There is a rational basis for fear. Take groups of 10,000 people & categorize them by religion and or race. The Muslim group is the one where you are far more likely to find a terrorist(s) than any other. And further, while factors such as low income & brutal home governments may be a factor, the terrorists and the sociopaths that recruit suicide bombers, have a direct motivation baked into the origin story of Islam: a prophet who led people in a "struggle" or" Jihad" against "others" seen as "oppressors" who encouraged, devised & executed acts of violence in its furtherance. Whatever else appears in the texts & history of Islam re peace, this is the founding exemplar
"The irony is hard to miss: Trump has talked about declaring the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, and now it is a Brotherhood-backed imam who is playing a key role in blocking his executive order on immigration."  http://mobile.wnd.com/2017/03/plaintiff-behind-trump-exec-order-ban-runs-muslim-brotherhood-mosque/  Too funny.  The left is so confusing.
The world is on fire due to Islamic extremism and this writer's concern is the "need to talk about Islamophobia"?  What an amazing lack of introspection on her part. Perhaps this is calculated deflection.
If this were purely an anti-Muslim move.... Why not other countries with predominantly Muslim populations?  India, Pakistan, etc.....
Why today?  How across the nation?  This is the build-up to military action in the Middle East, based on the trumpeting of the Radical Islamic Terrorist threat.   The US is at risk of having Sharia Law imposed???  Really????  The GOP Congress/WH and SCOTUS is that impotent???   Sharia Law has a foothold requiring multiple national location protest?  The Administration is stuck deeply in the scandal mud.  The conservatives need a bump in order to re-start their agenda engines.  Religious intolerance, Xenophobia, racism.  Sparks that run the conservatiive engine.  Now, all that's needed is some good 'ol military action.  Very worried that some legit hero military lives or limbs may be lost to protect some WH aides and egos.  Just pardon your entire campaign staff and move on, Mr. President.  Do not expose and endanger American lives
A few corrections:-  The Partition riots took place in 1947. I am not sure what you think was happening in 1948 and 1949. Perhaps you can enlighten us?  Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs are not different ethnic groups. They are different religious groups. I know your school couldn't teach you the difference.   Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs are not superstitious groups either. I repeat, they are religious groups.
Thanks America. Today epic mess in Afghanistan is the direct result of American invasion and epic mismanagement of occupation.  But why did the U.S. invade Afghanistan? To wipe out the Taliban government and kill bin Laden. But why did bin Laden go there? Well, he was in Sudan but the U.S. launched missile strike on this country, an act of war, but failed to hit him. But why did that? Because U.S. suspected he was complicit in the bombing of its embassies in Africa. Yes, suspicion, no proof of direct link. But why bomb the embassies? Because the U.S. installed massive military forces throughout the Arab region including Somalia. Right smack in the middle of Islamic most holy lands. Yes, a repeat of 12-13th centuries Christian crusader war. There you have it. You hit them, they hit you back.   Oh yes, the last Christian crusader war lasted 200 years. We still have about 180 years to go on this one.
The author is not looking at the big picture.  Most of the banned countries are are in a state of civil war against Islamic extremist terrorists that have summarily murdered many men, women, and children.  Remember how many of them passed as refugees in overwhelming Europe in 2015, and the gruesome results.  It is also important to note that most victims are Muslim.  Iran is a country openly hostile to the U.S. and known financial backer of terrorist organizations. The ban covers both Sunni and Shiia extremism.  The world has known for months of Trump's intentions.  Americans also knew of this and they elected him.  It begins by shoring up defences within the U.S.   The fight against Islamic extremism is about to go full resolve.  Watch both Syria and Mosul.  Battles are about to reach WW2 magnitude.  It is an issue that can no longer wait or be ignored.  ISIL is about to be no more.  To correct the author's biblical reference, it is building the ark for the flood to come.
When someone, especially an elected official uses their power to cause personal unrest to another individual or population by accusing them of being linked to Muslim terrorists, you've lost your right to free speech.  How's it feel to have your pants on backwards?
IRT kuroiwaj...let's see 47 days...that's approximately 6 weekends of playing 5 rounds of golf....hmmm that seems to work out to "almost every weekend" as I stated, so what is there to disagree about?  I agree with you about how many EOs have been signed, which are slowly allowing big business to bypass previous administrations' procedures for checks and balances, a muslim ban that the courts stopped - that was a smooth rollout, huh? NOT!  Remember, it's about quality not quantity.
But its not non-Muslims that are being persecuted , banned and and wrongly labeled as being all terrorists.  The message would be solidarity against Muslim terrorists  by the good ones.  Would that not change the image of Muslims in general if millions were to gather . We're just not see that so in our minds the media have portrayed Muslims as bad in general.
Why Allan, the one word I changed in my post was "Christian". And it kept getting censored, yet when I changed it to Muslim or Islam, the post wasn't censored. Isn't that amazing?  This post censored once already....why is "christian" a dirty word to the progressive left?
You might be right!  But as a minority a different calculus is at work for me.  I would've been happy to pay another $231 in health insurance and not have to worry about living in a nation in which the chief executive is not racist who is fine associating with white supremacists who see America as "the white race's promised land" and want to "curb stomp" all black people, "castrate" all Mexicans and "decapitate" all Muslims. Unfortunately tho, that's almost certainly what will happen in January.  In such an environment it behooves minorities and their allies to consider all measures to protect the safety of people of color from the powerful forces that Trump and co will be able to unleash once he assumes office, measures that include the possibility of exiting the U.S. and forming an independent nation.
In the article’s picture, a young Muslim woman wears a shirt bearing the message, ‘‘Respect existance or expect resistance.’ Does that not sound like a threat? Recent events in Europe have clearly demonstrated what those threats mean.
It is being introduced to establish a foundation upon which they can build an edifice of other bills making it illegal to criticise any aspect of Islam
There is an  underlying and fundamental problem that is always avoided in the name of religious freedom. It is the tolerance by society of  religious texts,  particularly the Koran,  that contain imperatives to kill humans if they don't conform. Eg apostates, Infidels etc. While it is always argued that Islam is a religion of peace and that  these imperatives are not enforced, they  provide a convenient excuse for extremists to do atrocious things.  It is not by accident that "Allah akbar" nearly always features in terrorist attacks.  Any other non religious texts that demand the death of humans because of their beliefs would not be tolerated.  Until the big religions like Islam remove these imperatives from their teachings and indoctrination, they can never distance themselves from extremists who easily interpret them to justify  antisocial behaviour.
The refugees are actually fleeing Islam.  But, wherever Muslims go, Islamic doctrine goes.  And, the so-called "terrorists" are simply practicing their religion.  The problem is, "infidels" think that it isn't politically correct to acknowledge that.
Oh, duh.  Those who have encountered Him know He is real.  No, He wasn't married, or any other hoopla set forth by the Christophobics.  By the way, the encounters are increasing thru dreams and visions, especially in the Muslim world, where the Bible is illegal.  The Word made flesh is revealing Himself to those who seek Him with all their hearts.  And for those who are rabidly afraid of True Christianity:  RELAX.  The triune God will never force Himself on you.  True agape love requires that you choose who you will serve.
1. Religion should form no part of the public school system, other than to perhaps study different forms of religion in a social studies class.  If they want to have religion in school and accommodate everyone, then everyone ought demand accommodation for any inane religious reason they can think of and then we'll see how much gets accomplished at the schools.  It's nonsense.  Religion should be taught and practiced at home and community - unless it's a denominational school.  2.  Did anyone catch the irony of the kids comment? “Mama,” he said, looking me square in the eyes, “if a guy came to our Jummah and started spewing hate and being violent, he would literally have 300 brown and black kids jump at him.”.  Well, that's exactly how these protesters feel..... they feel there are extreme muslims that have come to Canada and are spewing hate and being violent.  Now, it's likely not the kids at school but unfortunately radical muslims aren't always public about where they meet.
If Americans today are less accepting of differences, we can thank Obama.  He insulted people who "cling" to their guns and religion.  When people disagreed with him, he blamed it on the color of his skin.  When the police were just trying to do their jobs, he called them racists.  He allowed his IRS to target conservative individuals and groups. Criticize Islam and Muslims--even though they were blowing up Americans--and he told us not to fear Muslims.   Those who worshipped at Obama's feet bought into all of his prejudices and racism.    Financially successful people were painted as greedy criminals.  All the while, he was becoming richer and richer.  He was our greatest Divider-in-Chief ever.  I'm not so stupid as to be tolerant when danger or lies or stupidity are staring me in the face.
Well I live in Canada and I dont recall that there was any mass murder of muslims in Canada or even Quebec.  If you are attempting to refer to Quebec, it was a love story going bad between a muslim and a native quebecois. But Trudeau the PM made sure that the true story does not come out so he can pursue his agenda of muslim favoritism.
now let's discuss American human rights abuses and Trump's anti-Muslim and anti-Mexican stands.........Black Lives Matter!
So, no link to Trump saying his promise expired, just other people giving their opinions on what he might have meant.   You demanded more of me.  How about we see how Muslim ban 2.0 weathers Hawai`i's challenge and then chat again?
Here's a handy defintion, provided courtesy of the Canadian Parliamentary Coalition to Combat Antisemitism (see page 5).  http://www.cp-cca.ca/pdf/Report%20of%20The%20Inquiry%20Panel-CPCCA.pdf  Just replace all references to Jews with Muslims, and related terminology, and presto!  Instant acceptable definition of Islamophobia.  After all, this was the basis of the February 26, 2015 motion in Parliament to condemn antisemitism, proposed by Irwin Cotler, that passed unanimously.  If this wording  received unanimous acceptance in Parliament, why should it be any different if the same wording was proposed for Islamophobia?  Why all the drama over M-103 when Canadian leaders have already endorsed specific protections to one religion?  If Section 2 of the Charter is our guide, then protections afforded to adherents of one religion from discriminatory criticism and hatred should be applied to all, n'est-ce pas?
A majority of his supporters believe Trump Jr. did NOT take part in the meeting with the Russian lawyer, even though Trump Jr. said he did and produced emails to prove it.  And the media is biased against him?  How can you possibly deal with people like his supporters?  The same ones who believe Obama is a Kenyan Muslim.  This is not a question of bias on the part of anyone.
Attacks on mosques can be kept in check, just as synagogues do with security guards. However - random attacks by Islamists are almost impossible to check. Muslims need to criticize Islam - its martyrdom and jihad teachings. Suggesting that 200  imams refusing to perform a funeral is a remedy compounds the problem.
One should praise Couillard for raising above political correctness and call things the way they actually are. Canada, just like most western countries is facing a growing threat. Terrorism is only one tangible side of this threat, the tip of the iceberg. The whole picture is  lack of integration. This country cannot and should not follow the path of Europeans and allow ghettoeization of Muslims. This will lead to creating a foreign country within this country. Canada needs immigrants, but these like their predecessors need to know that they will have to integrate or call it assimilate if they want to live in Canada. Multiculturalism was a flawed policy; we are now paying the price for decades of political blindness.
I was asking a question, and you don't have to be insulting in your reply. If  "almost half the cemeteries in Toronto are for specific religions", does that mean that half will accept anyone?  Do Muslims specifically want to be buried with other Muslims, or are cemeteries in Quebec run exclusively by religious groups? That might have more bearing on the Muslim cemetery proposal than the situation in Toronto.
islamophobia is a term that was created by the muslim brotherhood to shutdown any and all criticism of islam! That is it's sole purpose.  That term has no place in the Western world!  Canada already has laws on the books for hatred.
Big shocker from Turkey or is it? Erdogan is an unapologetic Islamist and is simply "governing" accordingly. Free press, freedom of association, gender equality - these are simply a reflection of western vice and have no place in Sultan Erdogan's Turkey. Is it any wonder why Islamists were restricted from government in the past? In under 10 years, it has taken the Islamist AKP to roll back 90 years of secularism established by Ataturk.
There are so many Muslim extremists already, that they can continue to afford to lose many more in suicide bombings. David Friedman won't be able to affect their total numbers a whit.
Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Monday testified that some lawyers in her department were told not to inform her about President Donald Trump’s original executive order barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries until it already had been implemented.
The Muslim women went away unhurt by the name calling.   Two are dead and a third is hospitalizedwith serious injuries by worse than "sticks and stones". If this is supposedly a hate crime with racial or religious undertones, it would be interesting to know the race and religion of the attacker and his victims.  BTW, I thought it quite revealing to hear the slurs hurled against the folks who went to hear Trump campaining at Lane County fairgrounds by so called "liberal" protesters.
obamas first out of country speech was to the muslim brotherhood in cairo
Weird how a plank of the GOP platform revolved around "radical Islamic terrorism"; yet, Trump won't explicitly call this out for what it so obviously is. True to form, his apologists completely miss the irony when defending his tepid attempt to address it. Almost as if Trump knows where some of his strongest supporters come from, and he doesn't want to offend...
It only became an issue when mass immigration from Muslim countries made it one.  Women in western society have always participated in social life. Peasant women participated in village life, aristocrats were part of court life, banquets, etc., while Muslim women were restricted to watching the festivities behind screens.  Women wearing niqabs are not "participating" in our society, they are receiving its benefits (services) while refusing to reciprocate.
Oh things like, he is a fascist, racist, sexist, homophobe, islamaphobe, that he is going to send all immigrants out of the country, that he is going to build a database of all muslims, that he is going to abolish abortion.....tons and tons a untrue statements that could have easily been verified if they talked to Trump instead of just reporting on what they think Trump is going to do.
Polish people can think for themselves:  "A majority of Poles would be ready to give up their generous financial aid from the European Union or leave the bloc altogether to ensure the country can shut its borders to Muslim refugees, a poll showed."  They favor their own people over foreigners with dissimilar values and customs, as is healthy and natural.
Hasn't it dawned on you that Canadian society includes Muslims, along with Jews, Born Again Christians, Doukhobors, atheists, Hindus...?
So I can see that Trump has appealed to your need for short and simple chants to express your frustration with whatever condition you feel is oppressing you. Have the immigrants come to get you? Has a brown immigrant personally done you wrong at some point? Does that mean all immigrants are to blame for your problems? Shall we make it easy and just declare them and Muslims as our scapegoats as the Nazis did with the many sub-cultures they persecuted and murdered? Trump is openly blaming a religious group and immigrants for our problems. He is the most dangerous man in the United States of America. Walls never fix anything and always cause increased tensions. Walls come down. Teachers taught you history and why it's important, for the progress of the human race, to heed the warnings of our past so as not to repeat them in the present. We are in the midst of a crucial real-life lesson and, yes, THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST AND FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION. BTW... I'm not a Hillary fan, either.
and maybe if we would nt have pulled out, like we did. And showed strength, less people would have died! obozo and the dems are to blame for that! Knowing when and how to stop, is just as important as starting! If we OBOZO would have gone in, and stopped isis, at the start-think of all the lives that would have been saved! He has so much blood on his hands, its not funny! We could have stopped their "spring", instead of celebrating it! Then what else do you expect from a muslim sympathizer?!
This is exactly why free speech is critical in a democracy. The Oligarchs are using supposed racism as a way to take it away.  This is situation worked perfectly. This is how democaracy works He said nasty stuff People responded accordingly He lost his position That is how free speech works.  The Canadian government is using you.  Heaven forbid you are thrown in jail for crapping on a tax collector because he's Muslim or Jewish. These laws will be used against you when all you did was get pissed at a tax collector. That is how totalitarianism starts. You completely missed it.  There is a very clear insidious purpose to the bills being proposed in Ottawa.  The fake out the cons proposal only to pass the Libs. Thus the oligarchs get want they want. To take away your freedom  The Trump victory has hastened the oligarchy's need for control before they are toppled here and elsewhere. The German government is proposing to use immigrants as voters.  Without immigrants they will lose .
Here is what she wrote in her column:  "Questions and criticism about Islam are not Islamophobia. In fact, Muslims themselves engage in robust debates about modernity and Islamic practice."  Unless you didn't read the column, it's frankly bewildering that you think she doesn't "accept that people will critique islam" or that she "likes oppression of free thought."
Some moderate muslims have expressed concerns over M-103, e.g.,  Tarek Fatah and Ali A. Rizvi.  I welcome readers to read the opinions of these two individuals as a counterpoint to this article.
Ironic how this government is obsessed with language yet is only to quick to label millions of Canadians with the stigma of mental illness. A phobia is by definition an "irrational fear" and can be considered a form of mental illness. Equally insulting is the fact so many moderate and peaceful muslims are equally suspiscious and wary of the radical arm of Islam so they too now are labelled as having a mental illness. So not enough to create the wedge you now have to label the side you disagree with stigma in the name of votes. How utterly shameful.
Where are the feminists?  Indifference of Western feminists to the crimes against Muslim women . "The real fault, one last reader argues, is multiculturalism: it has prevented us from realizing “that there are depraved, hate-ridden pathologies in specific cultures, i.e. Islam & others.”  "The West has been so disarmed by its own hopes and prejudices that we can’t face the grave problem in Islam’s desire to impose its law on the planet." . "Robert Fulford: Dissidents who challenge Islam need our help. But where are the feminists? - Robert Fulford - National Post - June 20, 2015
Face coverings are not a requirement of the Muslim faith.  Ones face being visible should be a requirement of our culture and law.  This constant accommodation of foreign cultures and practises that conflict with our values and culture is unacceptable.
Many Muslims, Jews and other religions dont like the fact that Christmas and Good Friday
“It is time to heal the wounds that have divided us, and to seek a new unity based on the common values that unite us,” Trump says.  How is that possible when this same President attacks various factions of "us" ?  The Media, Mexicans, Muslims, protesters, etc...   For President Trump, "us" seems to mean those people hand picked to attend his "campaign style" rallies.   President Trump it seems, is unable to adjust his style or methodology, he is convinced he is right in every way, even when faced with overwhelming contrary evidence.
What do a large number of people sho have spent most of their lives in the US have to do with border security?! There can be no deal made by linking those two things as Trump well knows - he simply wants Dreamers and as many hispanic or Muslim people deported as he can possibly arrange. The conservative-dominated SCOTUS has just handed him a tool to indulge his bigotry and he will go all in until he's impeached.
Paul:  I had hoped my post made the exact point "putting the pictures of Ms Clinton and Mr. Trump on them superimposed politics upon some harmless fun."  I certainly didn't mean to imply that I thought the "bashing of candidates" was OK.  I think the pinata actions were just a few steps from defacing political ads and lawn signs.  You're free top substitute other candidates or persons into my condemnation of the "bashing", I don't limit that condemnation just to Ms Clinton and Mr. Trump. BTW: some would think bashing a pinata of Mexicans and/or Muslims is "cute" now.  I'm certainly not one of them.    Here's the first part of the wikipedia definition which is too long to post:  A piñata (/pɪnˈjɑːtə/ pin-YAH-tə, Spanish pronunciation: [piˈɲata] ( listen)) is a container often made of papier-mâché, pottery, or cloth; it is decorated, and filled with small toys or candy, or both, and then broken as part of a ceremony or celebration. Piñatas are commonly associated with Mexico.
"Many radical environmentalists can accurately be labeled “nature mystics.” And many of them express affinity with religions they generally consider more nature-beneficient than occidental religions, such as those originating in Asia such as Buddhism and Daoism, religious beliefs or practices surviving among the world’s remnant indigenous peoples, or being revitalized or invented anew, such as PAGANISM and WICCA. Paganism and Wicca are considered to be (or to be inspired by) the Aboriginal nature religions of the Western world, which have been long suppressed by imperial Christianity and Islam."
We also have a Christian duty to build a Christian culture.   It makes no sense to import people who are devoted to opposition to that culture.   This isn't a theory.   Social immigration experiments throughout Europe conclusively prove that Muslims from certain nations, certain cultures, pose a distinct problem to the peaceful citizens of Europe.      https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=europe+muslim+immigration+  The American people have voted - - we do not want this to happen here.
Moreham There is a common element. The west has been attacking Muslims for generations.
"Trump has been stirring waves of anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and racist sentiment for well over a year. Building a wall and banning Muslims were the two key rallying cries of his campaign. The bishops remained largely silent throughout election season. They seem tragically late to the party."  Exactly, Jamie!  The Republican bishops have sold America's immigrants down the river in exchange for Trump's empty promises on the pelvic issues.
I'm not trying to win points :)  I'm here to learn.  If I remember correctly, conversation with you led me to learn about federal scandals, just like the conversation with Ruben has led me to learn about the Hawaii lawsuit and about Trump's various versions of the Muslim ban.
"Muslim citizens went to the authorities and reported the future killers. Muslims took responsibility and called out the extremists"  Do you have a link to support your claim?
Radical liberalism is one the greatest threats in America today as they have taken so much of our liberties already, and as Henry pointed out, when these radicals get the 2nd amendment they get them all. They are the greater threat because they vote, ISIS cannot come to power here. As for Trump, he advocated blocking Muslims from entering the country UNTIL we get a handle on this, and never remotely advocated banning them for life. this is no different than what was done when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. Finally, after reading your posts, you have far more in common with moderate democrat-republicans than you do liberalism.
Trudeau said during the election " The more Muslim refugees we allow in Canada the less risk we have of terrorism:" ..
you mean Islam
The fastest growing religion in the world is the Islam faith. Fastest growing religion in Canada is the Islam faith. According to the 1966 census Muslims represented less then 1000 people, 2017 approaching 2 million followers.
A.  There is no legal challenge.  B.  If there was, the federal government would have no role in it.  C.  Whether or not it was an anti-muslim vote is just a matter of evidence, direct or circumstantial.   It's not so different from many other types of law.
Again, Pope Francis did not say there were not Muslim terrorists. He said there was no such thing as Muslim terrorism, any more than there is Christian terrorism.
Russian interference (not USSR; that is defunct) in the election was confirmed after the election, unfortunately. The fact that facebook only recently admitted that Russian bots may have tricked voters with fake stories was only recently admitted by Zuckerberg. If anyone voted for Trump was influenced by fake news about Clinton, Muslims, BLM, refugees, Mexicans, or anything else, then Yes, Russian bots affected their vote.  By the way, Putin's agents don't see social media as a pastime or a fun way to hoax people; to them it's a tool of war.  Oh, yes, T LOST the popular vote; it was the outdated and obsolete Electoral College process that put him in office.
For a few years Turkey has been progressively cracking down on Journalists, free expression and any negative utterances against the President and Islam..  Freedom of speech is becoming more and more restrictive here in Canada and I'm not sure who is behind it. So far at least we don't have mass arrests although any meaningful conversation about Islam is strictly prohibited. Sure would like to know who is pulling the strings here.
Are you aware that Justin Trudeau follows the Koran.  He frequently visits the muslim leader, the Aga Khan. He took the president of the Liberal party with him at Christmas. This Bill M-103 that does not allow anyone to criticize Islam is terrifying for the future of Canada.
It's not just the Yazidis, the Islamic State also murders Muslims who are not part of their particular branch of Islam.  It's just that there are few Yazidis, but a great many other Muslims besides those in the Islamic State sect.  If there were fewer Muslims, Amal Clooney's statement would also be applicable to the genocide of other Muslims by the Islamic State. ---- In that sense, the Islamic State is not a "terrorist" group.  They want to completely extinguish all other groups of people, not just terrorize them.
I don't want to hurt your feelings, because I sense that you are serious (very serious) in what you say. But, with respect,  you sometimes sound like a paragraph from the Catechism rather than a person who, I know, has a jolly-good brain  Here's further to what I think. Yes, God loves my parents and me, but I am not the direct issue of that love, but of my parents love for each other. This is something over which God had no control, since love must be free to be itself: love cannot be ordered or enforced. So with my conception (as with all creation), there is, as it were, an element of chance: of random occurrence.   I do not believe,  with the psalmist, that God 'knit me together in my mother's womb': no; chance did.  That kind of literal thinking would, in one sense, make me a Muslim, a believer in Ash' arism. This theological school holds that God acts by First Causes rather than through Natural Law.
What the USSR and the Kremlin couldn't accomplish, Islam and the EU will.
Christianity helps certain people be the best possible versions of themselves, but we were not founded as a Christian nation. The original Pledge of Allegiance read 'One nation, indivisible...' and all the 'In God We Trust' stuff only started in the 1950s.  "As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen (Muslims)" - Treaty of Tripoli, 1796, signed by John Adams and unanimously ratified by the Senate without any need for debate
Sadly, the liberal left seem to feel the need to mobilize hatred against any opposition to the liberal left cause du jour. However, they've now got themselves tied up in knots trying to reconcile long pursued and broadly accepted tenets of equality regarding gender and sexual orientation with this new passion for promoting Islam in the west. Like so many valuable social movements of the past, they've allowed the hunger for a new cause to trample over top of the values that made them a legitimate political force.  It seems they are blind to the conflict they have embraced.  It's as if Greenpeace decided to abandon the whales.
Whether you agree with Shannyn or not or Paul Jenkins or not we can never outrun the "slant" in what they say.  Whether that feller in North Carolina stopped and helped was a matter of his choice. (free will). Shannyn by her "slant" assumes that he was a Christian. She doesn't know that, but she played on your belief. I guess the Creator told Shannyn that he was. So what if the "lord" told him to move on what does that mean? Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, and on and on refer to a higher being as "lord."  I know that if I saw a legislator in the ditch, (except for perhaps a very rare occurence), I'd beep the horn, give 'em a wave and drive off. That's the human side of us all. It's not for us to get really too "preachy" and define if someone is good or not. Prejudice never shows much reason.
.... al salamu aleiykum means 'Peace be upon you', and Muslim protocol provides the appropriate response as "Wa alaikum assalam wa rahmatu Allah" which means "And to you be peace together with Allah's mercy." That must be the phonetic pronunciation of these phrases because this alphabet is definitely not Arabic. Interesting how religion is woven into social phrases and convention.
The Muslims that deny the Holocaust existed, and who want Israel to be wiped off the map are the extremists. These individuals are in the minority, and have twisted what Islam is about.   Most Muslims are moderates, and believe rightly that Islam is a religion of peace.
Fast and Furious, Clinton SOS server, IRS targeting, Obamacare lie of the year, DOJ spying on reporters, Benghazi, paying Iran $150B as he was leaving the White House, destabilizing Syria and creating a refugee crisis, destabilizing Libya via an illegal war,  suing Arizona for enforcing federal law while not enforcing federal law, Extortion 17, NSA spying on Americans in the US, bypassing congress by creating Czars and also recess appointments, supporting the Muslim Spring (ISIS), not prosecuting well documented voter intimidation (Black Panthers), extra judicial targeting of American citizens for execution.   I'm not supporting Trump here but the idea that there were no scandals during the Obama administration is absolutely absurd.
I also posted that according to the Quran Infidels can't testify against Muslims, yet the post mysteriously disappeared.
That is precisely the argument of Muslim-Canadian columnists like Tarek Fatah and Ali A Rizvi.
Some do, some don't. Nothing in Islam says you can't join in the fun part, playing carols and putting up decorations does not imply you worship Jesus as God.  I say if you can't join in celebrating other people's fun celebrations, you are the bigoted one. You won't join in and prefer playing Scrooge, fine, just don't try and prevent other people from doing so.
Why doesn't Denmark simply not allow Muslims to immigrate there? Banning what people wear is a human rights violation. The burka is cultural and religious and anyone should be able to wear one.
How many are still here on welfare or in muslim Africa?
You guys need a safe space if they don't mention that the person is a Muslim, Illegal, some other minority, but are also seem to need that space if the press mentions the person is a vet.  How about a list of terms that are acceptable.
Having a vacation with a wealthy man is one thing. What I find less appealing is the definite possibility that it was a religious retreat to study the Koran , do Islamic rites of submission such as reciting the shahada, and separation of genders   His demand for such utter  privacy is just not right given his political position.
One loon spouting idle threats proves Western society is Islamophobic, but thousands of Islamic terrorists slaughtering thousands of Infidels don't represent Islam. Go figure
The primary obligation of government is to protect it's citizenry. One should not have to walk the streets fearing that one could be a potential victim of Muslim terrorists, or any other terrorists for that matter. For a start Britain could simply ban its citizens from reentering the country after they travel to fight for ISIS in the Middle East; yet they have not done so. A simple act to implement which doesn't cost much money.
>>There are lots of places you can have a debate about Islam. It happens on almost every article on terrorism.   I you serious. Debate? Where? . What articles on terrorism has this paper published, other that the usual "but it is your fault" pieces by mostly female Muslim head-covered bloggers/"opinionistas"?    And I wrote that last sentence because I happened to notice, and then kinda keep an eye on this trend, specifically this paper. Aren't there other Muslim writers?
Neither hat black eye or that other violence could be justified by pointing to Christian scriptures.  As for Italians, the macho southern italian culture of small villages was part of the "mediterranean honour culture", and heavily influenced by Islam.  That is what a heavy cultural influence does: Christians living in Muslim regions end up adopting similar cultural traits independent of their own religion.
It's a Canaanite city where Jews, Christians and Muslims have all lived.
Hahahahahahahahaha.............."support ideals of Sharia Law".  If you took 5 minutes out of your pathetic delusions, you would find that Sharia Laws parallel Christian laws. Here is a website that compares the two religions; http://www.swapmeetdave.com/Bible/Christianity-Islam-chart.htm There isn't much difference in the religions and if you were rational, you would see that, but because you are an extremist like those that hijack Islamic teachings and set a bad example for the rest, you are proportionally exact.
Why don't you admit to the possibility that some Muslims intend to do us harm? Germans in the late 20s and early 30s were an educated and cultured people, but when they fell under the spell of National Socialism they became a grave threat to Western Civilization. Wahabbi fundementalism has become deeply entrenched in the Islamic community over the last 30 years due to Saudi indoctrination, and it poses a massive threat to Western secular civilization.
And so people of Canada, with Alceste help you see the clarity of the issue. Don't go away angry, Alceste, just go away. I"m going to quote Ayaan Hirsi Ali here, hopefully it'll make it through the G&M censors and will make an impact on Alceste: “Multiculturalism should not mean that we (the West) tolerate another culture's intolerance. If we do in fact support diversity, woman's rights, and gay rights , then we cannot in good conscience give Islam a free pass on the grounds of multicultural sensitivity. And we need to say unambiguously to Muslims living in the West: If you want to live in our societies, to share in their material benefits, then you need to accept that our freedoms are not optional. They are the foundation of our way of life; of our civilization – a civilization that learned, slowly and painfully, not to burn heretics, but to honor them.”
The Syrian Civil War has turned into another protracted proxy war, just like Vietnam. The only difference is that this war is based on religion.  It is a  sectarian conflict. The rebels are all Sunni Muslims, and are ultra-conservative. They are backed by the Sunni nations of Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  And since they are both "allies" of the US, we have joined in and are backing the rebels too.  On the other side you have Shia Muslims all aligned to support the Syrian Government, including Shia Iran, as well as the Shia Hezbollah Army in Lebanon.  And since Syria is an ally of Russia, Russia is supporting them too.  It is a total lie that the rebels are either progressive or democratic.  All of the religious minorities in Syria have joined in supporting the government, which has always been very tolerant of religious minorities.    There is no reason for the United States to be supporting this war.   We are 100% facilitating this human tragedy, and helping make it happen.  WHY??
Sorry, I know a little more about this than you do.  Those who fled the Islamic Revolution were ex-Savac and other state-sponsored murderers of the Shah who faced retribution for their crimes against humanity.  They looted the Iranian treasury as they fled to the US.  Their criminal American patrons never returned this stolen property, and continued to assault the aggrieved nation by deliberately shooting down civilian aircraft and backing the Ba'athists criminal war of aggression against them.  Essentially mass-murder carried out by proxy--such as Pearl Chemical (then-president Donald Rumsfeld) supplying the Ba'athists with the components for sarin and other chemical weapons outlawed internationally since WWI.  But then the big criminals see themselves above ALL laws.
After all if they can gather and protest the banning of Muslims from foreign counties can they not round up a couple of million to protest what I see has become the  number 1 issue of condemning  Islam in the 1st place being  fear of Islamic terrorists ? If your race or religion is being tainted would it not be worth the effort to go out and defend the truth and defy the bad for the good of Islam ?  Think about the message and effect this would have if the mainstream media were get a hold of a movement of millions of Islam against Islamic terrorists.
Great argument Rogue.   So when they attack Muslims both physically and verbally we should not call them bigots according to burt.    That is just a label I guess.   He also states that it is the left with the at ready labels; but would burt accept my bet for $1000.00 that if we calculated (added up) all of the labels on the comment section alone to this opinion piece, that the numbers would be the exact opposite of his claim.  Would burt therefore have the integrity to say, "hey I guess I was wrong, there are far more far right supporters making spurious labels on here".     I think we both know he would not, the cognitive dissonance that would occur in his head would forbid him from doing so.    Have no fear burt, I will bring the totals closer in line.  Yes, the far right are intolerant, racist, low effort thinkers that provide very little benefit to civilization.  But we still love you and earnestly seek your moral improvement.
The original problem of the Islamic  prayer rooms in schools was a matter of truancy: students ran off after noon prayers at the local mosque ( 2 blocks from the school) skipping the rest of the school day.  What should have been a parental disciplinary matter of making sure their kids returned to school collapsed into this taqiyya deception about accommodation.  Claiming to be so humble while taking what is not theirs is wrong.
Quite right, Richard Roskell   Few people seem to make the connection that, for more than a century, all classes are cancelled on the Christian Sabbath in public schools and everyone is excused school so they can stay home to honour the dictates of that particular tradition.  Imagine the howl were Muslims to abbreviate their attendance at school every day in order to attend prayer with their faith communities, and then demand that schools provide instruction on Sunday for them to make up for that.  What they ask is such a small thing. It would take almost nothing for every non-Muslim to provide it gladly and generously.  And 60% of reactions will disagree with my post unless, of course, it is rated uncivil.
Bannon is a Catholic who believes the West is engaged in a clash of civilizations with Islam that will determine the very survival of Western Christian culture. Why wouldn't he care who's pope? Especially since Francis is Muslim-friendly.  The Catholic far right also seems to have developed an appreciation for Vladimir Putin as a defender of white Christianity. (I base this on scattered impressions from inadvertent encounters with the Catholic fringe and the occasional news piece.) As we know the Bannon-Trump admin is quite fond of Vlad.
Actually, yes, they do. It is a far too common argument. If you complain about radical muslims, you are Islamophobic. If you ask about men's rights, you are anti-women. If you question how the concept of "gender non-binary" would work in practice, you are a homophobe. It is meant to shut down opposition to an argument by slinging mud, and it is effective because most people do not want to appear biased and insensitive, and so they just shut up.
Fr. Reese, with all due respect I disagree.  Donald Trump is and will always be a divisive person.  He has used disparaging names for anyone he disagrees with, he has offered to pay the legal bill for anyone who wants to use violence.  He wants to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it, he wants to ban Muslims from this country and the Catholic Church said President Obama was violating Religious freedom?  He abuses women because in his own words on audio tape he has the power to do so.  And you are saying we should all get together and work with this person and his cabinet for the better of our country?  How do you see that happening?  He wants to cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations and yet somehow find the funds to rebuild our infrastructure.  The church was very muted on all of the atrocious comments he made on the campaign trail and now you suggest we work with him.  I'm sorry I don't see how that is possible.
This is a great article that hits the nail on the head. The Government has been and continues to violate human rights especially of Muslims in Kenya under the guise of fighting terrorism and radicalization. What they don't realize is that by unfairly targeting innocents in their war on terror, they pose the ever present risk of further radicalizing these people. "An eye for an eye makes the world go blind" is a popular adage here and it perfectly describes the prevailing scenario in the anti-terror war.
http://raymondibrahim.com/2016/02/11/the-muslim-mans-sexual-rights-over-non-muslim-women/  THAT is what this cardinal is for.  I do not find his sexual views to be very Catholic.
"Edible pieces of art" enjoy no "protected class" status. - That means that, while the "artist/baker" cannot refuse to serve gays, neo-Nazis, blacks, members of the KKK, Muslims, Jews, whites, and Christians.....the "artist/baker" has the right to decline to use his artistic talents to decorate an "edible piece of art" in a way that goes against his religious, moral, ethical, and "whatever" beliefs he may have. - Because no "art" has "protection class" status, any and every artist/baker can refuse to decorate a cake in the following way: (1) a man being lynched (2) Nazi symbols (3) "May Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Bless This Marriage." (4) with unicorns, fairies, and little bunnies. (5) in a way that depicts a same-sex marriage. - #3 might surprise some people. But why would I even want to make a Jewish or Muslim baker "uncomfortable" decorating a cake in that manner? There are plenty of bakers who will gladly put that on a cake for the sheer joy of making money to please me.
hey Justin - Canada is diverse but you only support chinese and muslims.  Why is that?
The "All Muslims are bad", and the "ISIS is Islam" words are opinions; they're just ideas. And yes, they may be myths as you assert.   But Islam itself is just an idea and its god is a myth. Again, that's also an opinion, another idea.  But it doesn't mean I hate you or want you or your opinions, ideas, and beliefs 'extinguished'-- it means I wish to have a conversation-- and this is what the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides for all Canadians.  If you find these words offensive, I'm sorry to hear that-- but being offended is neither an argument, nor is it protected under the Charter. To engage in conversation requires all of us to grow some thick skin, and learn that living in a modern society requires compromise.  There are two choices in human political interaction: 1. Conversation; 2. Violence. I choose conversation.  Take your pick.
To reprise a well-used term by the left on these pages, "False equivalency".    The Libs are either woefully naive or dangerously ideological on this issue, and have upped their hypocrisy to new levels.  When a Muslim attacked Parliament Hill and killed a solider, the Liberals characterized the incident as a lone wolf attacker and lectured Canadians to not scapegoat all Muslims in the process.  Justin Trudeau went on to encourage Canadians to offer compassion in considering the circumstances which may give rise to radicalization.  When a schizophrenic white supremacist kills an anti-right protester with his car, this is construed as the first victim in the second coming of the Third Reich.  An author offers pretty much the same comments that Trudeau did and gets absolutely slammed as enabling or excusing nao-naziism.  ...continued
You're cute when you're angry.  Speaking of "deflection", Funny how you turn every tRUMP story ADN prints, into a budget deficit story regarding Obama. This story is about a Muslim War Hero and his Family that tRUMP just can't stop using as toilet paper. Just like all presidents since way back, except for Clinton 1, they've all been fiscally irresponsible to one degree or another and have used the U.S. currency like toilet paper. tRUMP is so rich he probably uses fresh dollar bills for TP. The part about Clinton budget RESPONSIBILITY is what really gets your goat, if you dig deep enough into the dark corners.
"This war is all about whether Syria be ruled by a Sunni or Shiite government."    Codswallop.  Assad is an Alawite, they are a weird Syrian offshoot of Shia and feel they should be considered a separate branch of Islam.  The Iranians, who are backing the strongest rebel elements, are also Shia, but of the traditional orthodox variety.  The ISIL-backed rebels are Sunni in name, but of the Wahhabi or Salafist extremist branches, and they're not going to be the winners anyway.    In reality, this conflict revolves around whether the Ba'athists (dominated by the Alawites) will maintain their tribal/military control of Syrian government that they've held since 1963 or be cast into outer darkness.    Sound complicated?  Well, it's sure a lot more complicated -- and a lot closer to reality -- than to opine that it's a question of whether "Sunnis" or "Shiites" will run the government.
His birthright is Canadian and should we remove anyone's citizenship due to the actions of the parents or vice versa then we would be deporting entire families of muslims where one has been involved with ISIS or other terrorist acts.
Putin has a formidable competitor in his quest for world dominance .......  Islam.
" I'm not thinking about abortion on a daily basis." Good to see good old Tony Corcoran speaking out on women's issues-- so many men these days care only about their own concerns.  If we are to overcome our societal divisions, men and women need to care about each other, white and black about each other, Christians, Jews, Muslims and agnostics about each other....
Christan v. Muslim, a war that has been going on for centuries. Will i ever stop? Not as long as people are taught to hate.
There is no such thing as moderate Islam. The opinion of whoever preaches moderation, the opinion of the Grandest Mufti, is irrelevant from the get go.  Islam mandates that all Muslims are bound to follow the moral teachings of only one man, who died centuries ago, and whose morality made him a serial rapist murderer.  Qur’an 3:32—Say: Obey Allah and the Apostle; but if they turn back, then surely Allah does not love the unbelievers. Qur’an 9:73—O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.  Qur’an 9:5—Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.   In other worlds, all Muslims must follow their divine leaders teachings that say: join them or die!
I did a quick search...  "On Monday night, Britain and its Prime Minister were forced to confront a fact...: Those guys are the same sort of extremist. Though their anger may be directed at opposite targets, they are motivated by the same basic idea, the same political vision, and they pose the same threat.  That became sickeningly apparent shortly after midnight Monday, when a man, reportedly named Darren Osborne, drove a rented van into a crowd of worshippers ... while allegedly shouting anti-Muslim slogans.   This attack was the latest in a long sequence of terrorist-style acts by figures motivated by the politics of intolerance and exclusion – attacks that include the murder last year of Labour MP Jo Cox by a man, Thomas Mair, who was a member of right-wing parties opposed to her pro-European Union stance."  ...From Saunders 6/19/17 piece:   https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/in-london-two-strands-of-extremism-share-the-same-world-view/article35370640/
This will never end, until Western Civilization recognizes that Islam is and has always been a threat to the very fabric of society. All of the Islamic Theology must be wiped from the face of the Earth or they will reach their goal, sooner or later, to raise the Banner of the Islamic Faith over all of Mankind. When your Enemy, and make no mistake Islam is the Enemy, tells you it is going to destroy you if you do not convert, you had better listen. To not do so, gives rise to such horrors as the Nazis and Communism in which millions are ruled under an Iron Boot. What is going to have to be done, is horrible but it is going to have to be done. These scum are no better than cock roaches and as such have to be dealt with in like kind. You don't only kill the ones that crawl out of the walls, you have to destroy the nests. Iran must be destroyed. The phony religion used to rule and subjugate the eastern Civilisations must be stamped out. Islam has declared war, so be it. Total War.
So a private law school that bans non-Christians so that its students can have an atmosphere that "respects, encourages and supports their beliefs." would be fine?? Or how about a Muslim law school that requires a study of Sharia law in addition to Canadian law so its graduates can better serve their community's culture.
Difficulties that Muslims have in Canada can be traced to the federal government and the media.   The federal government ordered our troops into Muslim territory, Afghanistan even though Afghanistan had not attacked Canadians in any way. Our best friend had been involved in a war with Arabs/Muslims since the US funded the takeover of land in Palestine. 9/11 was one battle in that war. 9/11 was retaliation.  The media did not report that the US and Arabs/Muslims had been fighting each other since the  takeover of land in Palestine. The media reported that 9/11 was an unwarranted attack on the US.   So to Canadians the Muslims were the bad guys, when in  fact they were simply retaliating against the US. And then with Canada involved in Afghanistan, the Muslims were retaliating against Canada.  That puts Muslims in an entirely different light. They were/are victims.
You do know there are Muslim Americans, right?
Dunno if you were being serious about this or not, but if you are Muslim I would be remiss in not greeting you as required: "Al-Salaam alaykum wa Rah'matullahi wa Barakatu."
this summer Muslims tried to blow up   the great  Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.   All the ancient Gothic cathedrals  Europe targeted for destruction.  I am sure the demolition Great Sphinx of Egypt will be a tremendous achievement for Islam
OK, show me the quote where Trump says he changed his promise.  I asked a while back, but you couldn't come up with one then.  If you can't find a quote of Trump saying he changed his promise (that is, a quote where he retracts his earlier promise to ban Muslims from the US), then before you tell me "Nope, the news media knows this for certain" please look up the definition of "inference" and consider how it might apply in this instance.  Also, please remember I've shown you a video clip from the end of last year where Trump denied he'd changed his promise when he was asked the question directly.  He said he was "right all along."
So, he was simply a devout Muslim.
We have a Federal immigration law prohibiting the entry of anyone who intends to practice polygamy and prosecute our own citizens who do so.    Islam permits four (4) wives.  Is that not a 'religious' belief?  Is that not discrimination for a belief?    Is prosecuting someone who practices polygamy fascism, then?
The systematic introduction of islamic practices in our country under the pretext of religious tolerance. How's that the Globe never published the Sun's new article; "The Trudeau government is planning to quietly introduce new measures to rubber-stamp the approval of many asylum seekers — including people from dangerous and war-torn countries who may pose a threat to Canada’s national security." I'll be surprised if the Globe's mod let this comment for a period of time.
So what exactly is the alt-right?  Those mythical beasts that are in office right now that are anti-semitic? I mean you seem to think Nazis are a myth but your own antifas/blm/radiacal muslims are the real myths.  You need to look outside your infowars/drudge/fox bubble and see how the real world is.
Re: para 2 & 3 - Palestine did not "belong" solely to the Arabs, as there have been Jews living there without interruption for 3,000 years.  The idea that the Palestinian Arabs are the indigenous people of Palestine is, quite simply, false.  Your argument fails completely when you consider partition as a plan for the situation in the Middle East as a whole, as Jews had ancient populations in Libya, Tunisia, Alegeria, Iraq, Iran, Syria, etc., that predated the Muslim conquest. Re para 4 - The point is the hypocrisy of the Muslim world  in advocating for the larger, bloodier, more disruptive partition to accommodate their aspirations, but reject the same policy for the Middle East. Re para 5 - Europeans like to view that they are at the centre of history, and the view that Israel = European colonialism is an expression of this conceit....tell that to the 6 or 700,000 Jews who found refuge in Israel from Libya, Algeria, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Iran.  Europe doesn't own Jewish history.
The usual suspects use the inclusion of  islamic prayers in our schools, to attack Christianity, which has formed part of Canada's traditions and values from the beginnings of our country's formation.  Why,  should we ban christian optional prayers in schools, when in turn they accommodate muslims to pray in the same schools.   The above caption picture, an islamic  woman is wearing:  "During a Peel District School Board meeting on April 12, a supporter of religious accomodations wears a t-shirt with the saying ‘Respect existance or expect resistance.’ (Glenn Lowson/The Globe and Mail)  "Or expect resistance"?! Really, we are heading towards the same chaotic violence Islam is causing already in Europe.
Many conservative white Christians have problems with people that think all lives matter, like the Mennonites. Of course, the haters can't tell the difference between Mennonites and Muslims. The Christian Trump voters are quite proud in their ignorance. They refuse to take the advice Jesus gave them. Heck, they think Jesus was blonde and had blue eyes. Just look at his pictures in their churches. They can't handle the truth. They will resort to 2nd Amendment solutions if you try to force the truth on them.
My whole point is Aga Khan is not even a Muslim.  It's Trudeau' his love for fame.  Trying to protect his privilege.  He keeps moaning about how Fidel and Aga Khan are his family friends.  Guess what if his Father wasn't the PM, do you think they would be his family friends?
I think we have known this for quite a while but seem to be disinclined to do anything about it.   It's like burying one's head in  the sand.  We know that doesn't work but let's give it a go anyway. We'll wake up one morning when it is too late. What I don't really understand is why some Muslims want to recreate the society from where they came when it was so abhorrent to them. I guess it's just hard to let go.
I've admired this great man since I was about eight years old.  He taught me by example that it was possible to stand up to those in power and oppose their evil and injustice.  I had the great honor to meet him at a fundraiser held by the San Diego Muslim community in 1985.  He gave me a book of du'a (prayer supplications) said to have been recited by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Saala Allahu alayhi wa Ah'liihi wa Salaam), and he autographed it for me.  I gave it to my son when he was little, and he still has it.  It is a prized family possession.  Inshaa Allah my family and I will recite Al-Fatiha for our brother Muhammad 'Ali (rah'matullahi alayhi).  You have fought long and hard, ya'Mujahid, in the ring and against God's enemies.  Take your rest now in cool Gardens beneath which rivers flow.  May Allah have Mercy on you, bring you near and keep you in His Good Pleasure forever, ya'Allahumma 'aamiin!  Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi Raji'uun--to Allah we belong and to Him we return.
Time for Muslims to understand that religion should not be mixed with other institutions, being political, educational, or commercial. You are free to pray for God in a setting that does not offend others, and where you do not give the impression that you have rights other religions do not. What if Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and decided to pray in schools
Why struggle to include a term that is ill-defined, confusing and divisive when the proper term already exists, i.e. anti-Muslim bigotry.
The bottom line is our public school system is secular and for good reason. Recently a  Muslim mob of university students in India  accused Mashal Khan Yusufzai of being an Islamophobe. and committing  blasphemy. The 23-year old student was shot, beaten to a pulp and was about to be burned before police intervened, while the bloodthirsty crowd shouted “Allah O Akbar”. http://thepashtuntimes.com/pakistan-journalism-student-mashal-yousafzai-killed-in-abdul-wali-khan-university-for-alleged-blasphemy/ M-103 and schools that encourage  prayer  can create breeding grounds that are hostile towards  secular Muslims  particularly if they are  critical  of  Islam !! Our values and culture must be adhered to  so that all can share equally  in a fare and just society.
For example, the UK where more than 50% are now openly atheist. Thirty years ago that was about 20%.  Atheism is beating Islam easily.
The islamic kingdom asked for more cupholders and a backup cam next year
Speaking of reality checks, if you include the known and the suspected but unable to prove honour killings of Muslim women and children, the intercepted terrorist plots we know about like the Toronto 18's plans to kidnap and decapitate the PM and blow up public buildings plus the many more we are not told about, the fact that we are on ISIS's top 30 list of nations to strike, the now dangerously open border with increasing numbers of undocumented phony Muslim refugees flooding into Canada illegally, and the new focus by ISIS on terrorist strikes in Europe and America as their ME territory shrinks then you will get a more less misleading and laughable picture than the one you have drawn here.  But far be it for me to intrude on your pollyannaish view of the potential of the Islamist terrorist threat to create havoc in the West including here.   Are you, per chance, a foot soldier in Trudeau's post national state and therefore unconcerned about border enforcement?
The most immoral, sinful, decadent human to every occupy public office lays claim to religion for political purposes.  Tax free scofflaws aren't satisfied with not paying taxes, they want to infect the entire governing system with their mythological, non-existent ideologies.  Of course, this means all Islamic mosques will have the same privileges to support political candidates and governing operations.
It isnt fake, big deal  Trump shared some information given by Israel to the Russians. Big deal, nothing like Clinton and her emails.  Truth of the matter is that Russians handle the Muslim extremists better than the US does, perhaps he felt that Russia would do a better job handling the filth than we would. Chances are Bezos would get his stumbling zombie of a newspaper to gargle up some nonsense on why killing terrorists is racist.  Either way, what is with leftists being so hawkish towards Russia? They didnt elect Trump, they didnt nominate Clinton. Your Party put perhaps the worst presidential candidate ever to run on the democratic ticket against Trump and lost BIGLY.   Newsflash the Republicans won Michigan due to the fact Hillary was such a garbage tier candidate. She couldnt relate to the working class better than a man who uses a golden toilet. She with [ 50 years of "experience"] who lost the election to Trump (who took up politics as a hobby 9 years ago).
The only conclusion is that all Globe and Mail articles on anything to do with Islam derive from a pro-Islam agenda.  That's fine if you no longer wish to be regarded as a serious newspaper.
No one can can really tell if a "smartly dressed" young man or "refugee" is who he presents himself to be,  if his goal is jihad. With each new attack like this, more people realize that looking for needles in the haystack of Islam is fruitless. Close the borders; - there is no reasonable accommodation.
xqglfirp,  You hit the nail on the head.  I lived in an Arab country for over two years.  I found the Muslim people lovely to interact with on a day-in-day-out basis.  But an honest Muslim will tell you (and it's been told to me to my face) they will NOT report a terrorist family member to the authorities.  In other words, family loyalty comes before public safety.   And that's wrong.
I think it is happening many places, irrespective of culture.  I visited Japan last year and the stats are terrifying.  Japan is shrinking by 1/3 by 2065 (that's the projection) to just 88 million people down from a peak of 128 million.  Many of the men are not and do not want to get married and birth rates are shrinking every year.  And they don't have immigration (only very small).  I've witnessed there that there are fewer grandparents as their kids did not marry and have grandkids.  I think part of this is the affluence of 1st world developing nations but part is that males all over the world are no longer wanting marriage.  I think the Muslim world is where population growth is the highest now (obviously there's much less female equality there).
.The Executive order is not a 'Muslim ban.' The Constitution is not a suicide pact: the President has authority to control our borders. This AP news article cements its reputation, and the Star Advertisers' complicity, as one-sided and, by omission of the facts of the matter, pandering to a certain class of Hawaii's voters who see only 'we love all ethnicities and religions.' Look at the grins in the photo. This is political grandstanding and a distraction from the Puerto-Rico-like trajectory of this state's public finances and the slow moving train-wreck social disaster created by tight land use, over-regulation of building, import of international big money folk, and either the exodus of our young families or their being ground down by 2-job, long-commute, unaffordable living conditions. Oh, and homelessness. Oh, and medical doctors' retiring or leaving. Oh, and can't keep teachers on the job. Oh, and the 10,000+ extra state workers hired by Waihee still burning up our cash.
Chris in Ottawa - I agree. There's nothing in this nice column that opposes official multiculturalism.  But, perhaps because the writes disses Trudeau at the end, the anti-Trudeau and anti multiculturalism brigades are here praising it to the hilt.  And, not incidentally, bashing Islam and Muslims as offering a counterpoint -- that does not in reality exist.  Oh well.  Binary thinking and all.
islam is not a race, but the uneducated will tell you it is.  I personally dislike all religion especially where the women's roles, are either horres , oppressed woman, obedient woman or stoned woman ( and not from pot). Religion does a disservice to people, you are raised to believe in god's will but never allowed to question, not imbued to believe in self . Where is the teaching of self esteem and confidence?  At the end of the day just learn the 10 commandments,  as you don't need a prescribed religion to tell you this are good 'laws/rules/ideals " to follow by.
Intersting: how many Americans, recent immigrants or otherwise, are leaving for a better reception elsewhere? Are the Muslims clamouring to return to their homelands, is there a stampede of US citizens heading for communist China or North Korea? Or perhaps to the birthplace of the Statue of Liberty, Europe. The fact simply remains that the US is still the choice of destination for the world's immigrants.
Come back after reading the Quran (the core Islamic doctrine which is seen as the direct command of God and irrefutable, immutable, ineffable and perfect by all of Islam) and the Hadith of the Rashidun caliphate then tell us that Islamic terrorism is like all other form of terrorism. It's theocratic ideology that gives the impetus for Islamic extremism of Muslims practicing Islamic fundamentalism. you can't say the same for all acts of terror. Because regardless of whether or not they are politically or ideologically motivated, they are not generally seen as the direct commands of God by the terrorists, except in and consistently with Islamic terrorism.
I am in agreement with this money would be better spent (or put towards) on the issues at hand in this column.... instead of letting in all these immigrants from Syria need giving them tons of funding through the welfare system the money could be better spent helping the ones that have every right to EQUAL OPPERTUNITY !!! Those who are born in this country rather than those fleeing from there's to come here so they  can slowly take away our canaidian way of living for there Muslim propaganda b.s.
A. Shetsen: You do realize that official Islam considers the Western concept of human rights irrelevant and not applicable in their societies, right? I wonder if we're being played for fools where the brouhaha over Islamophobia is concerned? I'll wait for an equivalent of the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam to affirm its support for gender equality, gay rights and the right of Muslims to convert to other religions or atheism before worrying too much about whether we're overly negative about Islamic ideology. I suspect I'll wait for a long time. For the time being, I have the right to say such things.
I laugh when I hear people say "if there was evidence to the contrary". Assuming the Catholic church is as efficient as the Islamic faith in destroying anything that contradicts their belief, there never will be any. It's long gone.
ISIL is smacking its lips with glee; ISIL is gloating that after ten years of trying to persuade marginalized Muslim youth around the world that the West hates Muslims without much success, Donald Trump has handed ISIL the  raison d'être for its existence.  Now watch disenfranchised Muslim youth flock towards ISIL in droves.  The fact that no Muslim from those seven countries have engaged in terrorist activities in the United States doesn't sit well with a man who fabricates outrageous lies. Donald Trump is the world's most dangerous man and still many think he's going to make America great again.  Ha! Ha!
"Germany has been killing Muslims since 9/11."  Um, what?
All thoose racist attacks after Trump won was provided they never happened and that the Muslims that said they did admitted they lied
M-103 is only intended to lay the foundation for new laws to protect Islam. What ever they study about Islamophobia will be used as a pretext to implement draconian laws against anybody with alternate opinions about Islam. . It may even have a recommendations for Sharia law as the only viable solution to the egregious sufferings of Muslims in Canada. M103 is only a tool to wring concessions and privileges out of the rest of society, to build a separate and unaccountable Islamic power in Canada.
I hear you, but to clarify,  Timothy McVeigh was supposedly Catholic, however nothing about his faith or religion was ever directly tied to the actions he carried out. He never used his faith as a reason or cause to carry out his actions. Will have to go back a little further than him for an incident of a Christian attacking others in the same magnitude  or frequency as Muslims.
Off topic but can you appreciate how lucky we all are that "Islam is peace".  -  -  Can you imagine how dangerous the world would be if Islam were war .or if Islam was intolerance , or if Islam was misogyny or hatred................. - - - - and GO RED SOX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fight those who believe not In Allah nor the Last Day Nor hold that forbidden Which hath been forbidden By Allah and His Messenger, Nor acknowledge the Religion Of Truth,(i.e. Islam) from among The People of the Book (Jews and Christians) Until they pay the “Jizya” With willing submission And feel themselves subdued The Qur'an, Sura 9:39 (The “Verse of the Sword”)  The verse above, Qur'an Sura 9:39, is in direct conflict with Canadian values. Support moderate reformist Muslims such as Imam Tawhidi, Canadian Muslim Raheel Raza, along with Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Muslim British activist Maajid Nawaz  in their efforts towards the peaceful reformation of Islam.
Trump is gambling with house money, and it'll cost his core supporters the most. I doubt that this executive order will succeed... it'll just pileup with the rest of his failures such the Muslim Band or Obamacare repeal.
What does the Iraq war have to do with Islamist fundamentalists? The Iraq war was a mistake? Thanks Captain Hindsight, what about Obama pulling troops while talking up a  "stable self-governing Iraq" in his speech? The speech is still available if you would like to google it - yes the Iraq War was a mistake but once it started, cutting and running after the troop surge made it worse. The issue facing the UK (and western Europe) is Islamist fundamentalism, the Germans and French weren't in Iraq and look at their issues.  It's the mosques and imams who sympathize with Sharia Law and promote cultural segregation through hostility to western values. It's the private religious schools who encourage gender segregation and fundamentalist interpretation of religion.
Christ who needs ISIS We have the Liberals They  are taking out christian societies 10 times faster than ISIS is. At 500,000 Muslims a year in 10 years + 4-8 births per family white - anglo saxon Canada will be gone.  And you all do nothing but smile an accept the demise of your heritage, your race, and your culture. Shame on you
This is not an ill conceived motion it is a well timed one . All the disingenuous blather about the proper definition of Islamophobia  is similar to the calls for a precise definition of antisemitism by various neo nazis  accused of hate speech.. Everyone knows what both of these terms refer to,  the problem is that Islamophobia and the vilifying of Muslims is a central plank in the campaigns of  various CPC leadership candidates as it was for the Conservative Party in the last election   That is shocking enough but what is really disturbing is that many news organization and reporters  are giving them cover as though asking them to sign this motion was some sort of nefarious trap.   By running interference for them those same reporters are  giving  the Conservatives  carte blanche to continue fanning the flames of hatred and Islamophobia..
I have lived in rural Canada, and their hatred for Muslims is barely hidden. They are also hard core Conservative voters.
Oh don't forget to repeat your debate remarks about how Muslims were cheering the collapse of the WTC over in Jersey. You "saw it" after all.   If Trump goes off script, it's going to be a wild eyed brain burner. Hopefully he can stick to his 3rd grade level teleprompter reading performance and make the entire even less painful for this nation. 9/11, to most of us, is the most tragic even we've lived through. Don't need to open up old wounds and sprinkle some Donald J. Trump fubar juice in it.
It's International Women's Day and yet the Muslim women who spoke in Parliament launched screeds against "Islamophobia"--that abhorrent shorthand for censorship--instead of using the platform to protest against the misogyny and chauvinism institutionalized in Muslim-majority countries.  In 2019 I will not forget your shameless pandering to special-interest groups at the expense of one of our most cherished freedoms, Mr. Trudeau. I doubt my fellow Canadians will forget this either.
There certainly is - political interference from the Trump administration! Mr Khan made The Donald look bad with his remarks about Trump dodging military service and maligning Muslims whereas Khan's own Muslim, son was killed in action for the US forces trying to safe members of his unit. The last thing Trump wants is a repeat performance outside the US.
And yet Singapore, touted as a model of successful multiculturalism, with a large indigenous Muslim population, bans the hijab in the civil service, and manages to have civilized discussions about it.  http://blogs.blouinnews.com/blouinbeatworld/2013/11/06/singapores-civilized-hijab-debate/
The liberal bias to defend the muslim is interesting.  Do they voice such concern for the Catholics and Protestants?   As a Lutheran I was brought up to never lie to anyone, irrespective of their beliefs.  No one ever spoke of killing someone who wasn't a Lutheran.  I laugh at the thought of someone trying to tell my Grandmother, Mum or sisters how to dress or what to wear.  That's killer.  I personally don't care what God a person chooses to worship. But don't put it in my face.  It's not socially appropriate for other Satan worshipers to don their silly garb and symbols of slavery and parade around.  Why is it appropriate we think muslims should?    Please help me with this questions: 1.  Why do so many muslims move to historically white Christian nations? 2.  There are approximately 50 muslim majority countries in the world.  Please list the ones where a person can exist in freedom, openly express their views?  Live any non-violent lifestyle they want? Be happy?
Many of  the PBS.org programs have commercial tie-ins outside of the normal channels of marketing.  Sesame street alone is a multi-million dollar a year cash engine. Odd Squad, Wild Kratts..a whole list. One can find many "action figures" and "dolls" and stuffed animals and even dog chew toys depicting PBS cartoon characters. Ka-Ching! If even half of the current budget given to CPB were to promote conservative views with an eye towards balanced unbiased content, I MIGHT concede some spending.  Two things: 1) Govt shouldn't be picking winners and losers; 2) The "winners" of taxpayer largesse should work towards a more fair and balanced provision of content and not just from the left. If you look for it, Peg + Cat had a program encouraging the benefits and cultural enlightenment of recognizing muslim religious observances, but on the flip side Easter programming was about the Easter Bunny and not the Resurrection of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I can hear you rolling your eyes.
@Ruben Reyes, you can read the quote from the suit, which references Trump's campaign promises.  Here is one of them.  At a December 2015 rally in Charleston, South Carolina, just a few days after the San Bernardino shooting, Trump told thousands of supporters:  "Donald J. Trump is calling for a complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on."  I read "complete and total" to mean "all", don't you?
I know a good deli where we can get good smoked meat. Some potato latkes and a sour pickle on the side What's not to like,  my Muslim friend? This is Canada and we're all here to get along aren't we now?
This has nothing to do with republicans,nobody disputes there right to protest,just the platform they chose,if there goal was to bring equality there are ways to do that.people forget that kaepernicks girlfriend was a radical Muslim,her hatred for this country,she got him to believe that protesting this way will get the attention,it was meant to divide not unite,the professional athletes are just useful idiots that are trying to equate this with injustice that they perceive is going on,except everybody has moved on they are stuck in the past not willing to change and make there communities better for there kids,and you have the democrat party leaders keeping them there,republicans are not perfect and need to be more inclusive,but this is a democrat problem that has spilled out and affect everyone,till these people see that those that are supposed to represent them don't care about them the cycle will continue.
Let's not joke like the support and creation of Israel somehow has forever damaged all Muslims everywhere in the world and now perpetual war on the "infidels" will forever be justified.  If this is the basis of your argument then I argue that Muslims are really backwards in their thinking...get over it.    How about Muslims band together and condemn the acts of violence in Europe, in countries that not only are not part of any wars, but actually took in millions of Muslim refugees.
I live in the city and observe changing traditions. The earlier arrivals from Islamic countries were generally quite conservative. Wearing traditional attire along with a hijab.  Now I see groups of these women with older but fewer tradionalists. The younger women, while wearing the hijab, wear western style cloths and makeup.  I believe that the next generation of these woman will probably not even be wearing the scarf. Settle down people, let traditions change on their own.
I was thinking of Muslim armies  demolishing the ancient art of Roman Christianity and eradicating 1000 years of history  with the conquest of Constantinople in 1453.
The movie has been banned in Lebanon and several other Muslim countries because the leading lady is Israeli.
and to think the Gitmo imprisoned Muslims/Islamists lived a life of luxury vs. the Japanese in the interment camps of WW2. These Bad Terrorists got the Royal prison treatment, well, some may have. lol, I cannot lie or deceive readers like a Muslim/Islamists/Liberal Democrat could to further their cause(s) Like the Muslim/Islam religion, I hear NO Liberal Democrat denounce "lying" to further their goals! They just turn a blind eye, they hear nothin nor say nothin. NOR do I hear the Liberal Democrat "denouncing" the things done to Conservatives by their "Antifa or BLM" groups.
Will we ever have a discussion without the Stepford commenters' predictable response? I could write a bot to do it. Here's what they do.   First, they scan for content not in line with the Stepford talking points. You know, loosely, 1.) Trump's not fit for the office; 2.) Mexicans, immigrants, and Muslims are bad; 3.) Russia is good; 4.) Comey is bad; 5.) Mueller is bad.  Second, start your response with an insult – "snowflake," etc.   Third, while ignoring the actual content of the letter, editorial, or comment in play, dismiss it entirely as sour grapes from the last election. All questioning of "our leader" is only Democrats, liberals, and the like (ugh), still fixated on the results of the last election.   Test me on it: Scan for something questioning those key talking points. Those automatic comments will follow. As our painfully inarticulate president would say: sad.
Reading your sports update about our Alaska football teams, only to be slammed hard in the face about some games can't be played because of some Islam Holiday? What in the  Wide World of Sports is going on? Heck we play basketball or other sports during Christmas and other holidays and yet this Islamic holiday now is dictating when and where sports can be played? There is something seriously wrong with this picture! Unacceptable and downright kowtowing to this present day PC culture. Next thing is that we will not be allowed to play sports or indulge into any other activity because of our failure to speak up and say enough is enough! It appears that the Christian world is being attacked  on all sides while Islam (especially) is creeping into our world with their ideology of supplanting all Islamic "non-believers". Signs of the times of our nation is morphing into a land unlike when our first founding fathers drafted the constitution and separated the church from the state.
It seems to me stating Trump as having 'profoundly un-Christian values' is wrong.  Trump's values are uncivil, bullying and contrary to all decency whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim or atheist.  To be a Christian value the value ought to be unique to Christianity...otherwise it is a universal value.
I think it's strange how so many ignore the elephant in the room that the Pulse shooter was inspired by Islam. To hear the bishops quoted, you'd think the killer was inspired by the Catholic faith.
Nuke North Korea now, while we can take down anything he can put in the sky, if we keep waiting and waiting he will eventually have thousands and start selling them to he Muslims. It is easier to kill the alligator when it just came out of the egg than wait until it is 15 feet long.
Why does the media always construe opposition to religions pushing their way into schools as anti--Muslim?  It's not anti-anything to keep our schools as secular institutions.    For years Christians have been forbidden from saying the Lord's Prayer before classes.  Christmas celebrations have been re-named "Winter festivals," Easter is now "Spring Break," but when Muslims want to do what other religious groups are forbidden to do, we are suppose to accommodate them.  The answer is "NO!"  Practice your religion outside of school.
Let's be clear: Muslims do not have a God-given right to access the US. If the government determines there is a serious security risk, then it can take action to protect the country. Remember, this is not taking place out of context: there have been horrible attacks within the US and numerous plots. It is long past time to take a breather as Trump has said, "until we know what is going on."
Yes, Muslims are just like Japanese?  Both are being persecuted.  BTW, Muslims are not a race so the racial profiling accusation is off base. Muslims are followers of Islam, so it is a religion.
But if one DOES question Islamic practice in Muslim countries, as a group of women in Egypt recently discovered, one's life is usually threatened.  I find it hard to believe that much honest debate can take place in Muslim countries for that reason.    In Islam's case, religion and culture have been conflated, and the only way to deal with it is to clearly separate "church and state" by having only secular run societies.
Since when is islam a race?
the non muslim kids and teachers are impacted....why are they disadvantaged.  pray elsewhere and do not distrupt or disturb the teaching or the other good kids who want an education.  the disruption is enough of a reason to stop this insanity.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate  The first non Christian country I see was Myanmar at number 28. The first Muslim country was Turkmenistan at 34.  And I lived in a Muslim country in Africa (Libya). Have you?
Sher-e-Hindustan: Sources please. Further, many Africans are Muslim, but maybe you're not aware of this? I suspect the biggest factors underlying high crime/murder rates are poverty and inequality.
Mr. Trump,   For over a year you have been making degrading, mysogynistic and racist remarks on the public stage. You even made fun of a disabled journalist by imitating his handicap before an audience. You have no ethics, no manners and no respect for Others. You have opened the door to the expression of intolerance and violence by your example.  My best thoughts are with the grieving Muslim families of Quebec. Human supidity has no boundaries.
She raised a good point in her testimony, though. Can a government attorney defend against the anti Muslim defect in the court order honestly and without suborning dishonesty or purjury by the government? Notice that Trump has removed anti Muslim language from his website. People have looked at the arguments by US attorneys defending Trump's order and noticed the weak or no defense with regard to anti-Muslim bias and this is probably why. Trump's own words and words of people like Giuliani made defense of the order very difficult. The second order may have a better chance, but there may need to a third order to fix the probem.
There weren't any Muslims in Charlottesville - or if there were they were peaceful.  Your deflection isn't going to work here.  This was a separate incident and saying "B-b-b-b-b-but Muslims" isn't a defense of racists.  trump was trying to tell us that some white supremacists were good people.   He's wrong about that.  There are no good white supremacists but that's his base so what should we expect?
This will only increase Islamophobia.  Guaranteed.  Additionally, as the news get worse in Europe regarding Muslim migrants and the likelihood of Muslims entering Canada, it will only get worse.  Especially if there are any subsequent terrorist attacks in Canada or the US.
Sally Yates turned Sen. Ted Cruz into an AM talk show hack when she outmaneuvered his every attack against her principled stand against Trump's illegal Muslim ban.
only "background" we need to check is if they are muslim
Pure? Nothing is pure.  "Look, are there some people that are white nationalists that are attracted to some of the philosophies of the alt-right? Maybe,” Bannon says. “Are there some people that are anti-Semitic that are attracted? Maybe. Right? Maybe some people are attracted to the alt-right that are homophobes, right? But that’s just like, there are certain elements of the progressive left and the hard left that attract certain elements.”  "A Twitter analysis conducted by The Investigative Fund using Little Bird software found that these “elements” are more deeply connected to Breitbart News than more traditional conservative outlets. While only 5 percent of key influencers using the supremacist hashtag #whitegenocide follow the National Review, and 10 percent follow the Daily Caller, 31 percent follow Breitbart."   "The disparities are even starker for the anti-Muslim hashtag #counterjihad: National Review, 26 percent; the Daily Caller, 37 percent; Breitbart News, 62 percent."
Another issue that is statistically near zero is getting killed by terrorists. Unfortunately the fear of such an extreme possibility hasn't stopped the President from targeting all Muslims.
The crack may or may not be politically correct, but it IS correct.  Those who don't have their heads in the sand are very aware of the spikes in hate crimes towards Muslims (and immigrants in general) since Trump made it politically correct to indulge in hateful rhetoric about Muslims and refugees.  His actions as president have underscored his campaign rhetoric. It wasn't just campaigning - he meant it and his actions in office clearly show this.  Sadly, many of those who support Trump do so partly because of his anti-Muslim, anti-refugee, anti-immigrant policies. I have never once been aware of you calling out those on this board who indulge in similar rhetoric, in the same way that you have called out the author of this particular feature.
As a female Muslim, I don't feel safe waking the streets of this Country without a male companion.  I beg my family to return home to Iran where we can enjoy our culture without fear of racist onlookers.  We were invited to move to Canada, and although I'm the only family member who can speak English, my 8 brothers and sisters promise to try to learn.  Meanwhile, we try to live on the meager government financial support. Mother has a broken heart leaving her sick parents behind.  But we've been promised that Canada will allow them to join us next year.  With hope, our entire extended family will be with us shortly.  Then we can live well with the help of Justin Trudeau.
I completely respect your opinion, Mr. McDowell, and honestly, that's kind of the way I used to see it, but after more than a decade of digesting voluminous amounts of information regarding our unending, self propagating, war on terror, and the motivations of Islamic terrorists, I no longer view the United States as an unwitting victim of the violence.  Our foreign policies include propping up authoritarian regimes with dismal human rights records against their own populations, training and arming groups we call "freedom fighters" one decade only to label them "terrorists", and "insurgents" in another when we experience the blowback from our policies.  I don't agree that we, and the world are at war against illiteracy, and lack of education. If we were, we wouldn't settle for our increasingly dismal public education system. You don't end up with a guy like the Trumpster as POTUS with a country full of intelligent, educated voters, who are sophisticated enough to know how to fact check.
I would be perfectly willing to vote for a Sikh, or a Muslim, or any religious minority. However, Mr. Singh opposed the Ontario sexual education curriculum. That suggests he intends to impose his views on others. That is what I would vote against.
May I offer a little different slant from the others posted on this thread.  Donald Trump, in appealing to the right-wing zealots on a myriad of issues, did, in fact, make some very radical promises.  He promised mass deportations, he promised the "wall", he promised a ban on Muslim immigration, he promised a reversal of Roe v Wade, he promised to defund Planned Parenthood, he promised to end efforts to address climate change, he promised to radically modify or end our participation in NATO, he promised a reassessment and possible reversal of the position on same-sex marriage, he promised to support, under the guise of "religious freedom", discrimination against same-sex couples.  His supporters, it seems, believed him; after all, he won the election.  Are you suggesting these promises were just campaign hyperbole and he has no intention of keeping the very promises which helped elect him?  Are you suggesting those who would be the victims of those promises should just ignore them?
"Anti-Muslim hatred has no place in my Canada" and neither does Newfoundland and Labrador, according to some of her previous musings.  I believe she called it, "a vast and scenic welfare ghetto." And the province was, "full of ingrates on pogey" !!
The stats show that only 325 people were affected out of 325,000 coming into the US every day. Or that 40 muslim countries were not part of this temporary ban.  Or that few of these are being accepted into the Arab Countries, and those that are must be of the same religious denomination as that of the majority.  Just check how many Shias refugees  are being accepted into Saudi Arabia.....Zero.  Recall Canada in WW11 when Canada refused to accept Jewish refugees  from Germany.  Once again , brain washing of the masses is in full speed ahead.  Goebbels convinced his subjects that Arians were the super race, with slavery and extermination thr destiny for the rest. And they sucked it up.  Its no different now. Tell a lie often enough and it will soon become the truth
All the Muslims I have come across have no "disdain" for Canadian values and are model citizens including some good hockey players. Your stereotypes are just anti-Muslim hate that have no basis in reality.
I'm sorry, but it is not speculation that Trump has business dealings in the Muslim countries which are not on his list.  He has zero business interests in the seven countries on his list.  So OK, it's not a muslim ban, it's a 'no business' ban.
Nope - read the documents more carefully.  The divine truth is revealed in many ways and many paths.  Yes, that means beyond the confines of the Roman Catholic Church.  For example, do you think 500-million Buddhists or 1.8 billion Muslins are wrong?  Of course not!  The deep abiding presence of the incardinate God is on oneness and nonduality​.
I would be interested in a further drilling-down into the election-statistics . . . what would have happened if:  1. there was compulsory voting as there is in Australia, and 2. the American electoral roll had none of the below on it . . .  (a) African "Americans", (b) Latinos, (c) Arabs (& North African Muslims), (d) Asians & (e) non-Slav Southern Europeans south of the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Danube?  What would be the "shape" of the Congressional Districts, & the distribution of the Electoral College?  Would Hillary's campaign have been any different?
What about the Hate crimes occurring world wide against  those that are non-Muslims. What do you think the life span would be for a  young women that rejected Islam and became a Christian. You have not prepared a balanced article. .
Egypt tried the alternative with the Muslim Brotherhood, and all non-Muslim extremists suffered.  Is that what you prefer?  Democracy only works if it includes protections for individuals and minorities like we have in our Bill of Rights.  The popular vote alone can be the worst form of tyranny.
All forms of hate needs to be eliminated. All forms of racism, Islamophobia, Homophobia, anti-semitism and laws discriminating against Transgenders. We need to get behind Justin, Obama, Hillary and Premier Wynne and fight all forms of hate which includes Trump!
The Torah was given to the Hebrews from Jehovah. The "arabs" had only pagan multi god beliefs until well after The birth date ascribed to Jesus. Islam did not exist until the pedophile illiterate warlord mo hammed babbled on to justify his hatred of Jews and Christians, at least 700 yrs after Christianity spread throughout the known world. No Roman Emperor compiled the texts commonly used as the Bible. That was done by 2 different councils long before mo hammed was born. The texts were vetted on certain principles-one being that they had to be written within the 1st 100 yrs after the death and Resurrection of the Christ, provably so. The Old Testament, rooted in the Torah, is the history of Jehovah's relationship with His Chosen and prophecies of the coming Messiah to save the world and fulfill the promises HE made. You have NO understanding of the Bible at all.
True. But that's only because violent attacks by non-Muslims aren't labeled as terrorist attacks while any violence perpetrated by a Muslim is automatically considered terrorist. If ANY of the shootings that have taken place in Anchorage the past year were committed by a Muslim, they would have been called "terrorist attacks."
Of course Communists world wide and especially in China approve of junior making Canada a 'doormat'! Radical Islam everywhere celebrates the naive little potato! Only real issue is ALL real Canadians paying the price with record poverty,unemployment and homelessness!
"Because you simply don't get it. If it was you or yours you would be howling like a mad dog but because it was some Muslim kid you think its okay. Well its not."  Me & mine do not enlist our battle ready teenage offspring to journey halfway around the world into a volatile war zone in order to specifically wage an insane holy crusade against western society.  That my friend is called treason and at the very least should be punishable by deportation.
Trump really has not changed from who he was in the Primaries.   This  is the problem with single issue voting.  Yes, he appears to be pro-life. However, his policies are still the anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, self centered views, and run the country like a big business with absolute executive authority.  But we knew all that before we voted, didn't we?
"Your account is restricted! Your account is restricted because too many of your comments have been rejected as uncivil. You can make 3 comments per 24 hour period"  That's amazing, how about truthful ... does that matter to your company at all?   I'm going to sue the Globe and Mail for breach of fiduciary duty on freedom of speech... will you cover that?    We don't have freedom of speech in Canada do we?  That's  a rhetorical question Glove & Mute.   As far as killing children in the name of  Islam,  yeah it upsets me along with every other liberal thinking Canadian in Canada!        Grow up Globe and Mail, don't be so politically correct, or is it M-103 that's got you redacting whatever your lawyers want.  What about journalist integrity, does that still exist in Canada?  You're disappointing the majority of Canadians outside of Toronto, you know the real world!    I'm hoping that you still  have journalist integrity, but so far  the Globe and Mail has become the Glove & Mute
So there you have it. Kudos to The New York Times for finally breaking the big story in plain sight: the  conservative wing of the Catholic Church is a collaborator with the "alt right" (neo-Nazis) and Steve Bannon, de facto president of the United States and mad plotter of World War III, the Holy War against Islam.  The question arises: what are progressive, or even just decent, Catholics going to do about it?
Since 9/11 our politicians and media have been inundating us with religious issues related to Islam, Christianity and Judaism.   Religion, for the rich and powerful, is always about social, political and economic control of the masses.   In the 1980's, Christianity was so powerful it almost destroyed liberalism. The powers that be wanted to  destroy anything to do with the secular social revolution of the 1960's. They were so successful, the US and Canada have been pushed relentlessly and ruthlessly to the right wing. Democracy, incompatible with religion, has shrunk. Corporations have grabbed ever more power over governments. Now corporations and politicians want to distract folks from their economic woes with endless religious issues.   Our democracy has shrunk under corporate ownership. We are faced with the daunting task of separating corporation and state to save democracy from Consumerism. Now religion is undermining it.We need a strong movement for freedom from religion.
Yet another example of failure to follow Poitier's Law: "ASSUME just makes an @$$ of U, not me."  I am a linear descendant of Stonewall Jackson (no big deal, a lot of folks of various colors were.  Stonewall got around).  My parents, both sets of grandparents and all but one of my great-grandparents were US born, as am I.  The single exception was a Sephardic Jewish immigrant from Syria.  My great-grandmother (a Jackson) wasn't allowed to marry him until he "converted" to Protestantism and weren't happy about it even then.  As for the Islamic Republic of Iran, you argue according to what TV tells you.  I argue from personal knowledge and experience.  Start with the fact Iran hasn't invaded another country in over two centuries.  Have I proved you wrong about enough that you're willing to start over and try to learn something, or will you opt for the "rationale" of "why expend effort learning with ignorance is instantaneous"?  Apologies to Bill Watterson.
Ban or no ban. I would think the bad Muslims or Muslims who are thinking about becoming bad are already living everywhere in the world. It's just a matter of time when they blow up things, shoot people or run over people. Also a lot of these perps are just plain nut heads who were born with a few screws missing and there are a lot of them. With access to weapons. I don't see any end to this madness anytime soon.
If religion does not belong in schools then take away the Saturday and Sunday as off days from curriculum. They were made off days to accommodate Christians (Sunday) and Jews (Saturdays) for their religious (Holy-days) to accommodate their prayer rituals.  Muslims are only looking for one hour of time to pray on Fridays. They should the up the game and ask Fridays off and watch people go in a riot.
We have hate laws in place in canada use them !!! we do not need to take one barbaric so called religion and place it on a pedestal with it own set of rules concerning speech. M-103 is nothing more than a way to silence free speech against islam and get Islam teachings into our school's system and start sharia law in Canada. Please take a look at the UK,France,Sweden,Australia they would love to change now but it is too late for them and have been taken over
sirencall,  Your lies are starting to add up as there were absolutely no "off the cuff" interviews you conjured up made by Trudeau with anyone prior to his official release at 9:00 PM that I referenced.  The entire Parliament core was in lockdown until quite late in the afternoon and actual events had Harper having an emergency meeting with both Opposition leaders to discuss the situation and clarifying what took place before the press release.   Even from your link there is no reference other than the 9:00 PM news conference he had after Harper and Mulcair that I supply below.   "Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday night that he was saddened by the shootings and condemns "these brutal and heartless" acts of violence.  Mr. Trudeau called for continued co-operation with Canada's Muslim community "to help prevent the influence of distorted ideological propaganda posing as religion."   You've done nothing but embarrassed yourself making fake news about the tragic event.
I can not believe the degree to which this comments section is being brigaded by extreme right-wingers.  It's almost astounding.  You guys need to pick better arguments, these are neo-nazis for crying out loud.  They are trying many weak arguments:  Redirect:  "What about Islam?"  I think you mean Islamic extremists.  Yes, Islamic extremists are also right-wing nut-jobs.   G&M Credibility attack: "The G&M never reports anything negative about on the extreme left."  - That's because it doesn't happen much.  The problem is, the extreme right has been responsible for 74% of politically-based violence in the US since 2007.  The extreme left has been responsible for 2%.  False Anonymity right: "These people have the right to protest without interference, which means they should not have their photos and names publicly posted." - No.  They gave up their anonymity when then expressed their opinions in public.  When you do something in public, you can't cry that anonymity is a right.
The author has been given by the Globe and Mail a sandbox to express an opinion tarring the population of St Apollinaire, and the rest of Quebec, as anti-Muslim. An opinion not based on facts.  1. There is no ban on Muslim cemeteries; Muslim people are being buried in Quebec. 2. Only the people having property around the proposed cemetery where invited to vote. 3. Most people I know don’t like to live next to a cemetery. 4. It stands to reason that some people voted against the cemetery regardless of its religious denomination, some other voted against it being a Muslim cemetery. Nobody knows the reason behind a single negative vote. Jumping to conclusions like Peter Stockland just did, is pure speculation. 5.  Basing an opinion on speculation is extremely dangerous and certainly foolish.
Nonsense again. You are the one conflating people's religion with their race. No one has grudges against Buddhists for being Buddhists, because Buddhism is not a threatening religion. There have been times in the past, as now, when a particular nationality was at war with us, and was suspected accordingly.  Blonde blue-eyed Muslims have been islamic terrorists, everyone knows that, which is why people are afraid of the religion, not the race. The only difference is that they are less likely to be Muslim, so unless they wear the visible garb that identifies them as such, it is reasonable to assume they are not, just as it is reasonable to assume that a little old lady or a woman with young children or a young child isn't.  But since those assumptions have been proven wrong, that is why we have stringent procedures to check everyone, likely or not.
The Troubles in Ireland were created by good old English geopolitics where the English imported masses of Protestant Scots into Catholic Ireland. Boy, that sounds a lot like Churchill and others putting a lot of Jewish people into Muslim Palestine, doesn't it?
Trudeau had a choice which was to maintain caretaking funding of our inept armed forces and basically not respond to the change in American foreign policy of allies stepping up the funding for their own military- 2% GDP.  This would be the position of his newly acquired left wing Liberals from the NDP Party. The position he appears to have taken is as a responsible ally and foot the bill for our own defence national and international- a position of may of his blue Liberals as long as funding and employment for military spending is directed towards their ridings.  As for "reproductive health", the Liberal government has to be cautious about not placing another target on this nation for political and religious extremism of terrorist groups such as al qaeda, boko haram, al shabaab, and ISIL, who regard "reproductive health" as a threat to their interpretation of Islam and to all Sunni Muslims.  Aid focus to help women and girls also requires armed security for the aid workers.
But I thought that all attacks on non muslims were only in response to the US intervention in the middle east.
Don't tell the Muslims that!
It's been there decades, Doug and no it's not beside any church. It's actually one of three Catholic cemeteries that are still in operation in the area. One of which is right next to a non-demoninational one, they share the same address and entrance but have separate areas for Catholics and non-Catholics and operate independently.  Do they cater exclusively to Catholics? Not exactly but here's what their ByLaws state "All Catholics and their family members (whether Catholic or not) are invited to make use of our cemeteries" So unless you have a Catholic connection, you're out. The most recent one opened in 1992 and a quick internet search turned up planning documents for a Catholic cemetery in Halton (near Toronto) as recently as 2010 so there is little doubt that religious based cemeteries are still active and being planed today.   I haven't yet seen why a Muslim cemetery is any different than a Catholic one. In fact there are already other Muslim cemeteries in operation in Canada.
Clearly, the PM has identified in Muslims a constituency whose vote can be captured and, just as clearly, he is determined to do just that.  That explains why this self proclaimed feminist is happy being photographed in locations in mosques where half his cabinet would not have the right to stand because of their gender, and also his refusal to ever use the term 'islamic' in the same sentence as 'terror/ist'.   It also explains his statement issued at the beginning of Ramadan which states, in part, that it "...commemorates the revealing of the Qur'an to Prophet Muhammad" (Note this statement presents as fact a religious teaching and fails to qualify it by stating "which Muslims believe commemorates..." or something similar.)  Query whether the PM would ever issue a statement on Assumption Day stating that this holiday commemorates the day the Blessed Virgin rose into heaven?  So how do you think his office will seek to interpret 'islamophobia', broadly or narrowly?
Do you have a rational fear of Christianity, Buddism, Hinduism, Baha'i, Zoroastrianism, and the religions of the First Nations as well? I don't. I don't fear Islam. I fear Leitch, Alexander, Drumpf, Hitler, Stalin, etc.
"Its time to move to a country that is blocking these people."  Yes, please do, and let us know how it is.  May I suggest Saudi Arabia? They aren't fond of Muslim immigration and instead welcome lots of westerners. Even Trump is a fan. See ya.  "What does the Liberal party do Open the floodgates..."  I seem to recall Muslim terror attacks that took place under Harper.  Under Trudeau we had the French Canadian terrorist, as well as his sympathizers who sought to justify his actions.
As usual, the Sequim Socialist Squealer left out ANY information of import, specifically that this is a DEMOCRAT organization, which is doing everything they can to destroy America. A minutes' worth of research will show that they brag of their accomplishments, which does not consist of anything worth while. they claim to promote equality( they use those words, the liars) but they praise the election of Muslims, Democrats, and pretty much anybody who is not a white male. This outfit is racist, sexist, and all of the nasty things they accuse decent Americans of. Prattle away, Pravda. I will not hear your lies.
"U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson criticized what he called the "illogic" of the government's arguments and cited "significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus" behind the travel ban. "For instance, there is nothing 'veiled' about this press release: 'Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"' Watson wrote, referring to a statement Trump issued as a candidate." From a CBC report today.  Apparently it is you that is not familiar with the realities of the law, lazee.
Will the Globe and Mail publish the names of the hundreds of Canadian Muslims who traveled to Syria to join ISIS, Al Qaeda or other Islamist terrorist groups?
Larry Bodine, You're from New Jersey. Your area, NY/NJ, has experienced the lion's share of terrorism, when it was happening (pre-Obama). You would be safer here. Hawaii has been free of such incidents, nothing has changed, except a fear-mongering conspiracy theorist was elected president. His travel bans are anti-Muslim and have nothing whatsoever to do with stopping terrorism or making you safer. But stay where you are. That will improve the quality of our visitor base.
Time for Muslims t get with the program and understand that religion is not welcome as a mixture with other institutions, being political, educational, or commercial. You are free to pray for God in a setting that does not offend others, and where you do not give the impression that you have rights other religions do not. What if Christians decided to pray in schools?
Name the countries  China's national price starts in 2017, and I know of no other Asian or Muslim countries whose emissions are higher than Canada other than Japan
Leave those puppies alone... let them grow up to be big German shepherds used for interigating Muslim extremists like this guy...
A natural solution would be that the many  Muslim countries in the region take them in.
firstly, Anyone that cites the SPLC as a source immediately loses ALL credibility.  In Alaska, he says, plenty of people value living off-the-grid in rural areas and celebrate their caches of guns. As an African-American Muslim man, "I don't have that freedom,  Jones does have the same rights as any American to own land and do upon his land as he wishes. I call bullshit on his snivel drivel that he don't have the same freedom.
Miss out the exhaustive list.  Just  give us a few examples of the advances that have been made by a Muslim working in a Muslim country.   Vaccinations,   Electricity, Chemistry, Physics,  Surgery,  Engineering,   Human Rights, Democracy etc , that have improved our lives
That's right.  It's a comment that indicates Trump thinks his promise to ban all Muslims hasn't "expired".  Can you provide a link to Trump saying his 2015 promise "expired"?  If not, you might want to consider that he doesn't believe your claim that the promise "expired".
I've posted "Muslims don't like bacon" 5 times  and each time it disappears within 5 minutes. As an experiment, I also posted "Jews don't like bacon" and that didn't disappear. Seems to me that neither Jews nor Muslims like bacon, and I can't see how it's uncivil to post a statement of fact.
"Viewed through that lens, supporting Muslim prayer for 15 minutes per week and supporting LGBT rights in Catholic schools are perfectly consistent stances."  And yet the former aligns WITH freedom of religion and the other aligns AGAINST it.  Given that we're talking about a core charter right, and the school system itself guaranteed in the constitution, that's an issue, no?
Good move. Obama's LOVE for all things anti-American and communist was irrational. No reason to support a muderous regime. Now NIX the Iran deal....and Obama's love for all things anti-American and islamic.
Trump is trying to not have this be a "Muslim Ban" that gets jammed in the courts. He is also trying to make the Saudi's our allies and let them buy our best weapons, including our best anti missile and aircraft weapons at discounts and we are fighting with them in Yemen. We are fighting for Muslims in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, Djibouti, Iraq, and Afghanistan-- and we expect to be sending more troops there. Trump does not want to be seen as anti-muslim or anti-Islam anymore.
Turkey is a major reason why Syria is a mess. Syria was a former province of Turkey, and they're trying to control it by backing Muslim fundamentalist militias. Also, Turkey is a Muslim nation...Muslims should be looking after their fellow believers.
Mayor Khan called for Trump to be barred from visiting Britain....BACK IN FEBRUARY.  It seems the Mayor, who is a practicing Muslim, felt POTUS Trump was "cruel" in his attempt put a temporary hold on immigration from 7 countries.(all 7 were also on Obama's list of terrorist watch countries). Seems the good mayor is overstepping his bounds somewhat. There is a PM in Britain who receives foreign heads of state. London's mayor should focus on protecting citizens from the Islamic terror scourge.
I like Trump's passion and determination.  Obama and Hillary act sooo tired and disgusted.  They don't have a handle on Radical Islam or the radical Koran.  We need to follow Japan.  But it is a little late.  We have 6 million Muslims here.  I keep asking, "Who let them in?"  Anyone that believes in the Koran cannot assimilate into our society!
While there are a number of racist organizations and individuals it does seem the accusation is made at the drop of a hat for all kinds of self serving reasons. Turns out saying "all lives matter' is racist, or "America is the land of opportunity" is racist. I remember Chris Matthews  on MSNBC saying that folks opposed to the President's policies appeared to him to be racists who covered themselves by supporting Black Conservatives. I'm still scratching my head over that one. On the other hand , it is also true that Trump has said some racist things about Mexicans and bigoted things about Muslims that would appeal to actual racists. .
The Charter does NOT say that people have to pray in school.How long has it been since the Lord's Prayer was banished from the public school system?Or do Judeo-Christian values carry less weight than Islamic values?Separation of mosque/church and state has to be part of a Western liberal democracy.
>>Duke Charles Martel >>Are you a muslim Alceste? ... To that question, Alceste has a canned answer - "Are you a White Supremacist?".. or "At least I am not a White Supremacist?" Either way - it is pretty telling how he feels about himself. And what does he equates being Muslim with. .. Now, to the apprentice who would be given the task of "censoring" this post - read twice.. Just because there are some words in it that may scare you into censorship, there is nothing offensive, or false in it, it is based on actual posts ( go search your database).
I don't know Donald, Muslims might get the feeling they're not welcome.
Unless they're his business partners, of course,  Note the Muslim-majority countries exempt from the ban.  Nothing gets in the way of business.
Well now, Mr. Trump does not accept the banning of people from certain middle eastern countries is bigotary, He did say that the US would accept Christians from those countries.  That leaves what, ah yes, the Muslim population of those countries.  Trump has banned Muslims from entry to the US - this is unconstitutional and the accompanying amendments.  This could be the basis of impeachment in that he is not defending the Constitution as he vowed that he would when inaugurated.    As for his spokesoman "Alternate Facts" Conway, she tried to spin the line that only a couple of hundred people around the world were refused entry.  Everything that comes out of this woman's mouth is BS.  She has absolutely no credibility.  Trump needs to sac kher immediately, but, yet again, he is full of the same stuff.
I was trying to be semi-sarcastic so don't take it so literally. The early social, political, and religious refugees who came to the US of A before it was the US of A to escape oppression became the oppressors themselves so in some ironic twist, the current native-born population today do have a plausible fear of refugees changing the status quo, especially with the the situation in Syria/ME and the fear of radical Islam that you see/hear in the media everyday. I can't speak for the Muslims or the trajectory of future Muslim immigrants/refugees but Vietnamese have adapted very well and contributed socially, culturally, politically, academically, scientifically, etc.   As a Vietnamese born to refugee parents, I experienced the bullying and name callings growing up in the US but never let others' hate/ignorance turn me into a hate monger myself.  Actually, a few of kids that bullied me are now my close adult friends. Surprised that this came from an educated grown adult. PEACE and LOVE!
This is a heartworming story. However, it is not compelling. It looks like a tale of someone walking down a dead end road.  This guy had his heart in the right place to start with but did not grasp the issues. Showering in cold water to save the environment? Get real.  There were/are lots of things he could have done to "improve the plight of humanity" besides adopt a religion.  He could have joined one of many international aid agencies and worked overseas. There are lots of groups in Canada crying out for volunteers, too. He was just too self absorbed to look for them.  My sense is that Islam has not taught/will not teach him anything. He is still self absorbed, engaging in Islamic rituals that get one no closer to God than if they sat on a park bench and waited for God to walk by.  I doubt that he will find fulfillment in Islam. It has no respect for the environment which starts with having fewer children in a world of 7+ billion people.
I'd be careful with that one Jim.    There are lot's of reason to be proud of family, community, nation.     Just because the source is white.black, Christian, Muslim should make us assume that pride is associated only with that label.   Appreciating your writing, I don't think this is likely from you, but it happens.  But I think I know what you mean and I too hold nothing but contempt for people who assume superiority in the eyes of God, or Nature, only because of skin color.
In response to "Dude was an atheist who hated Christians." you wandered off to talk about conservatives and Muslims and 'people of color'.  'Deflecting' the conversation.  "trying to steer the conversation in a different direction."
Not to minimize your experience, but it sound to me like you are talking about war, and if I'm right about which one, a particular World War.    A few things:  War is rarely just about one thing, and even if it is, that one thing is almost always economic in nature. That argument can, and certainly has, been made about our Civil War, and rightly so.  I said "an individual with a gun". War incorporates many other ways of getting people's attention.  What percentage of Rebel soldiers do you think truly hated slaves?  What percentage of German soldiers do you think truly hated Jews?  What percentage of American soldiers truly hate(d) (pick from the list):  The British The British Mexicans Southerners Phillipinos Haitians Guatemalans Nicaraguans Cubans The Japanese Koreans Vietnamese Thais Cambodians Middle Easterners/Muslims Gettin' tired of typing now . . .  If you go to war because you hate someone you've never met, then someone sold a young fool a bridge somewh . . .  Wait.  Uh-oh . .
Trump Asks, "What About The Al-Left? Here's The Answer  "But overall, far-right extremist plots have been far more deadly than far-left plots (and Islamist plots eclipsed both) in the past 25 years, according to a breakdown of two terrorism databases by Alex Nowrasteh, an analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. White nationalists; militia movements; anti-Muslim attackers; I.R.S. building and abortion clinic bombers; and other right-wing groups were responsible for 12 times as many fatalities and 36 times as many injuries as communists; socialists; animal rights and environmental activists; anti-white- and Black Lives Matter-inspired attackers; and other left-wing groups...."  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/trump-alt-left-fact-check.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share  So yeah, the right is far more violent than the left.
I'm always sadly amused when the usual watercooler experts trot out the shopworn narrative about how "we" invaded Muslim countries and that this somehow causes or justifies Islamist terror attacks. Someone should ask them why many Islamist terror attacks occur in countries that have had little or nothing to do with military activity in Iraq, Afghanistan, or Syria.  And why the most consistently numerous and some of the most horrible attacks are directed at Muslims inside Muslim countries.
Why, because Moore, like Trump, is a birther?  Why, Moore, like Trump, has no idea what the First Amendment is? Trump has his Muslim ban and Roy Moore stated the Keith Ellison shouldn't have been allowed in Congress because of his religion. So much for freedom of religion. Some conservatives pretend to love the Constitution but not when it interferes with their bigotry.
So who's the bigger threat to Americans??? Islamic Terrorist or American Terrorist killing thousands of Americans in places like Chicago??? #MAGA
Ummm... if we halt the process of allowing Muslim students a place to pray on school property, then leaving school on Fridays to pray is exactly what's going to happen.  It may have been by accident, but you've just provided the exact reason religious accommodation exists here.  If you think Britain's situation is WORSE, then you should be supporting religious accommodation, not opposing it.
Trudeau isn't really Catholic. He supports Islam and he is anti-Christian.
"Rushdoony’s doctrine maintains a theocratic necessity: submit the state to the Bible with a logic no different from the one that inspires Islamic fundamentalism. At heart, the narrative of terror shapes the world-views of jihadists and the new crusaders and is imbibed from wells that are not too far apart. We must not forget that the theopolitics spread by Isis is based on the same cult of an apocalypse that needs to be brought about as soon as possible. So, it is not just accidental that George W. Bush was seen as a 'great crusader' by Osama bin Laden."  Evangelicals want a theocracy no different in spirit than that of ISIS. They both believe that what they support is good, everything else is evil. Remember the American Evangelical pastor Scott Lively, who persuaded the Ugandan government to make homosexuality a criminal offense a few years ago? That's the country the Evangelicals would have you live in. Women are to be submissive to their husbands. If you disagree, you are Satanic.
It would be difficult to find anything remotely accurate in this bizarre, rambling diatribe against Israel, but I will restrict myself to the following points:  The myth of Arab Muslim victimhood is cheap propaganda stemming from the failed Arab attempts to destroy Israel, and drive its Jewish population "into the sea."  The anti-Israel left continues to pander to the irrational, bigoted demands of the Middle East's Arab Muslim majority to suppress the region's only non-Muslim state, in favor of yet another Arab Muslim country.  That blatant disregard for the rights of anyone who is not an Arab Muslim is precisely the reason why the Jews of Israel had to fight for national independence.   The mere existence of Israel proclaims the national rights of the Jewish INDIGENOUS population of Israel; a country and a people that predate Arab colonialism and will outlive it as well.
isn't there a ban on laptops from all these places????  so why isn't that against muslims too??    these so called judges are wasting time and putting us in danger......
The article says "The Department of Homeland Security will require passengers coming to the United States from airports in Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Morocco and Qatar to check electronic devices larger than a cell phone such as tablets, portable DVD players, laptops and cameras".  Why does this policy only affect people flying from countries that contain mostly Muslims?  How come people are worried about Muslims or is there some reason to believe non Muslims on those flights will cause trouble?
Sandy Hook  -  Religion not used to justify actions.  Sikh Temple  -  Religion not used to justify actions  Planned Parenthood shooting  -  Religion not used to justify actions, objected to killing babies                                                      and selling the body parts. Mentally impaired.  Church in NC shooting  -  Religion not used to justify actions.  Jewish community center shooting  -  Religion not used to justify actions.  Radical Islamic terrorist actions are all based on religious justification.
Don’t get me started on the medical industry, the pharmaceutical industry.  Those trump firearms by a large margin...  and for anyone researching, most firearms deaths are self-inflicted suicides.  It’s a culture issue, not a gun issue.  Do you think a “waiting period” to rent a Home Depot truck would have prevented the NY massacre?!?...  Funny how when a Muslim terrorist kills people in the name of Allah they say “Don’t blame all Muslims.”  But when a crazy person kills people it’s “We need to take away all guns from law abiding citizens.”
It's ALL on video:  The Muslim ban, the David Duke denial, the “Mexican” judge flap, the mocking of a disabled reporter, the draft dodger denigrating John McCain’s military service, the son of privilege attacking an immigrant Gold Star mother and the constant revisionism and lying about past political positions taken are but a few of the lowlights that have punctuated Donald Trump’s chaotic chase for the presidency.
Let's flip this around for sake of discussion.   May Catholic scholars study the Quoran; the Quoran is the foundation of the Muslim faith; but these scholars continue to profess Catholicism. Is it your view that these scholars cannot possibly understand the Quoran without becoming Muslim? Are you suggesting that there is something defective in the heart of those scholars because they do not profess Islam?  Ebes, since the mid 18th century, there has been an extraordinary deepening of our understanding of the bible via a scholarly project that involves all Christian denominations, except those that professes fundamentalism (i.e, literal understanding of scripture). One happy result is that seminarians of all faiths generally earn credit for scripture studies regardless the denomination of the professor.   And, say I, the foundation of this great blessing of the Spirit, is the shared determination to understand scripture as LITERATURE first, in order to deepen our faith understanding.
"US President Donald Trump has broken a nearly 20-year-old tradition by failing to host a dinner marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan"  My guess is that once Justin rests up from marching in the Pride Parade, he will attempt to make amends with Muslims for the actions of Couillard and Trump!!
Like Belgium, France, England et al, everybody thinks it's humanitarian to open their doors to immigrants. Should have monitored them and their mosques. Now they're firmly entrenched in their own lands, and they cannot remove them. Now they will take note of Trump's unpopular tactics to stop muslims at American borders. Shut them and everybody south of the border and deport the illegals. Now we are beginning to think maybe he was right all along.
This sounds eerily familiar to Trudeau's comments after the terrorist attack on Parliament Hill.  Trudeau spoke of the need for understanding how the disaffected could be lured into such behaviour, and how Canadians must resist attributing such beliefs to all Muslims.    Too bad he couldn't risk saying something similar recently without risking the mob rising in indignation with their inference he was condoning the white supremacists.    Perhaps Trudeau was at his best when he was leading a 3rd-ranked party.
I'm not deflecting.  Trump is a business man and not a politician therefore will  make statements that are not polished as would a professional politician say.  Hence, the "Muslim ban" comment to stop the radical Islamist terrorist entry into the US.   Regardless, the actual executive order put a temporary pause on immigration from those 7 countries until a review of vetting could be done.   There is nothing immoral or wrong about that.  In fact, he is performing his duty as president to protect American citizens.  Again, it was only a PAUSE and not an outright ban on all Muslims.  Muslims from all over the world would not be affected only the citizens from the 7 countries , both Muslims and non-Muslims.
Part of the problem is the 1,000 years of European Christian propaganda aimed at stirring up the peasant masses to defend European kingdoms from invasions from Islamic countries.  Everything from the Crusades, the Reconquista of Spain in 1490, the battles for Malta in 1565,  the defense of Vienna in 1683 to the Barbary Pirates in North Africa up until 1830  (the U.S. Marines still sing about it, "to the shores of Tripoli").  Then what about those French Foreign Legion movies painting the Islamic tribes as barbaric animals, "Beau Geste" in 1966 or "The Mummy" in 1999.  It is inherent in our European based culture to be Islamophobic.  I was taught it in Sunday School, really. (You should hear some of the people in my family... think of Marlon Brando at the end of "Apocalypse Now"... the ignorance, the ignorance, the ignorance.)  And do not pretend for a nanosecond that it doesn't go the other way.
There is quite a difference between a society shaped by a certain heritage, and having experienced some other influences as well. We can make a long list of multiple cultural influences over time, but you are contradicting yourself when you decry the fact our traditions and institutions still reflect a Christian heritage on the one hand, then claim we are equally "shaped by" Islam, Buddhism, Shintoism or Confucianism, etc. And I made the point earlier  to someone else that our holiday traditions are based on a merger of Christianity and existing pagan traditions.  I'm not claiming we have uniquely Christian origins, I'm saying the fact we still have traditions based on religious origins does not mean we are not secular, that is a very narrow definition of "secular". It doesn't mean extirpating everything that might reflect religious origins. One can be secular and respect one's cultural heritage, and others'. I have no objection to celebrating people's cultural heritages in schools.
Not exactly Layla, I'm pointing out that people will deride allowing Muslims 15 minutes for prayer in an unused classroom as some kind of religious encroachment into secular society while at the same time ignoring the pervasiveness of Christian influences in their daily lives.   And I expect you meant non-Christians not non-Catholics.
Religious kids are allowed to form clubs in schools, like the Inter-School Christian Fellowship Club or Pathfinders.  Christian prayers are excluded from official use and at school functions because the schools, as an institution, are secular and students of many faiths attend them.  When Muslim students gather to pray it is not an official school function any more than Christian students gathering in a club meeting.  Where I teach, the Christian kids gather at the school flagpole some mornings to pray for the school and the community.  There is no great conflict or mystery here, except this one: why do posters not know what they're posting about so often?
Right, isn't some grand poobah Muslim currently under investigation for preaching in a mosque the assignation of Jewish folk. Then there's the muslim lady in jail for trying to kill people with a golf club in CTC, she didn't show up for her trial date. It 's all publicized and festers the concern about muslim people
#1.  Trump is smoking crack if he thinks he or his Ivanka's husband are going to 'broker' any deals, especially given his recent anti-Muslim activities; and  #2.  Why is it our responsibility to be in the middle of this?  Let both parties work it out between them.
Did you watch Trump while he was speaking to a huge room of Arab Muslim leaders in Saudi Arabia this week?  The huge room built for anti-terrorism?  He told them to run the evil haters out of their countries.    " That goal is to meet history’s great test—to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces of terrorism."  "But, in sheer numbers, the deadliest toll has been exacted on the innocent people of Arab, Muslim and Middle Eastern nations. They have borne the brunt of the killings and the worst of the destruction in this wave of fanatical violence. Some estimates hold that more than 95 percent of the victims of terrorism are themselves Muslim."  "Every time a terrorist murders an innocent person, and falsely invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith. Terrorists do not worship God, they worship death."  "DRIVE THEM OUT of your holy land, and DRIVE THEM OUT OF THIS EARTH."  They did not seem to be offended.    Even the MSM covered that much of the speech.
Sorry to disappoint you Deborah. There is no "angry old white guys" club, but I would suggest you start a new "Clueless Ole' Biddy Club."  I am a woman, and I am a Hillary supporter, but what does that have to do with anything? Yeah, George Bush's war was a colossal mistake, but tying that to the terrorism we are currently experiencing throughout the Western world is a fantasy. We certainly destabilized the region, but 9/11, you may remember, was before the Iraq War. But I'm sure it is much easier for you and others to just blame some "angry old white man" than to have to look at Islamic terrorism and find a way forward that will protect us without trampling on the rights of innocent people. Sorry, I can't take down your comment, so it will just have to stand in all of its wisdom for the world to see!
The argument that "they see it as a requirement of their faith" - despite the lack of any such mandate in the Quran, as cited by the majority of Muslims who do not wear burkas or niqabs - reflects a flaw in the legal system's approach to religious rights issues.  I don't like accommodation of any law to religious beliefs in general, but if it's going to happen, it should at least be limited to cases where objectors can cite a bona fide scriptural mandate to behave a certain way. If a law is important enough to impose restrictions on the general public, it shouldn't bend to accommodate fringe interpretations and unwritten customs.
Some Muslims have suggested that 'anti-Semitism' is a rough equivalent of 'Islamophobia'--  in that it puts Jewish people into a separate category regarding bigotry towards them.  Anti-Semitism has come to mean discrimination against Jews, but is somewhat of a historic misnomer. Semitic languages include Arabic, Amharic,  Hebrew, Aramaic, Maltese and others. Further, recent studies have revealed DNA links among the peoples.  To satisfy those Muslims who have suggested the Jews have been given 'special status' with the anti-Semitic term, perhaps we could blend the two in the interest of fighting bigotry and promoting brotherhood: how about "Islamo-Judeophobia"?
German boy beaten, kicked by Muslim schoolmates after telling them he is Jewish  http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/german-boy-beaten-by-muslim-schoolmates-after-telling-them-he-is-jewish
The comparisons between Islamist terrorists and other groups like white supremacists has its limitations. While your point that 99% of Islamists are "peaceful" may be true,  it doesn't erase the fact that there were mass celebrations in the streets of many Islamist countries when the 9/11 attacks occurred. Few Muslims would initiate terrorist attacks themselves, but how many support the terrorists and the spread of Shria law? Would you say that is a equally small number?   Islam is a religion where religious law is joined with state power. Europe and free countries everywhere have a serious problem with the terrorist acts inspired by the religion. We need a better strategy to combat it than excusing it away by making facile comparisons with white supremacists or any other group.
My bad. Technically StewartBrian is correct. I meant U.S. District Judge James Robart. However, the point I made is correct - the Constitutional issues related to Trump's first attempt were identified by Robart, a Bush-era appointee, in suspending Trump's first Muslim ban. Therefore, my contention, that it is wrong to claim that a self-respecting judge will make a decision based purely on ideology, stands.
What about the millions that have been fed by non-muslims..Lets report on that.
Given that there were only 45 eligible property owners to vote on the referendum and that    35 actually did exercise their franchise, then it would seem reasonable for the Muslim community to carefully buy up enough properties to swing the vote.  This, of course, would lead to charges of ghettoism, but we have seen examples of such action before in Canada i.e. Mennonites in Ontario, Jews in Quebec, Mormons in B. C., Doukhobors  in B.C. and  Hutterites in Western Canada.
I agree that poverty and inequality are usually the causes of crime (an issue my conservative friends in the US usually disagree with me - apparently crime is an ethnic/cultural phenomena).  I use this data to prove that crime or violence are not Muslim prerogatives.
My fiancee is Filipino and from Mindanao. She agrees with Trump that people need to be vetted first.  The UN and EU say that 2 to 3 ISIS terrorists and 12 people sympathetic to radical Islam are likely to infiltrate into Europe for every 100 "refugees”.  America’s FBI, CIA, Homeland Security, National Security Director, US Border Patrol and military is warning ISIS is using fake passports and is sneaking into countries posing as poor refugees.  Poll after poll, of Muslims everywhere, show that they are sympathetic to the goals of ISIS and al-Qaeda.  The Philippines has the following terrorist groups according to the UN:  • Abu Sayyaf • al-Qaeda • ISIS supporters and recruiters • MILF…Moro Islamic Liberation Front  • MNLF…Moro National Liberation Front • NPA…New People's Army military wing of the Communist People's Party of the Philippines (CPP)  US State department, Japan and many other countries has listed Mindanao as a no go zone…Go at your own risk but don’t expect help.
The problem is that North Korea is willing to spend vast resources to fix the "problem" described in this article.  If accomplished in a few months or a year, the real threat will exist and NK can then be used as the "pit bull" of China in dictating their influence in East Asia.  Let's all be clear on what is transpiring here.  China wants to be able to dominate the entire Asian continent from South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia and Northern Asia.  A very simple concept.  Who stands in the way of China?  In reality, it is just Russia, India and the United States.  On its western borders, the muslim provinces of China are facing unrest and crack downs by the masters in Beijing.  So in the end, what is the United States to do?  Re-unify the Korean Peninsula?  Eliminate the "pit bull"? Or, wait for that bright flash of the nuclear bomb going off over Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, Seattle, and Honolulu?  Should we have a vote on this issue? Choices, bend over and take it, or nuke NK?
This will not buy JT the Muslim vote and so this guy will not get any pay off.
Paul, just google the organizer, you well get plenty of information. You say you resent folks lumping all liberals together, yet you are assuming this event was about hate, I'm guessing that is because this liberal and biased media is portraying them that way. Just like what the media is doing with the insane person who killed those two gentleman, he was ranting about Christians as well as Muslims but since it does not fit their agenda they continue to leave that part of the story out. He was at a pro Trump rally, the media is quick to point that out also, but does not bother to tell the rest of the story where he was asked to leave by the organizers. Just because someone has different political views then the left and we also want to exercise our rights does not automatically makes us haters. So many on the left have been taught to express hatred and anger towards all who would dare disagree with them, are you allowing yourself to be in that category?

Trump did ban Muslims.  Two courts, controlled by Republican appointed judges, recently ruled that. . Trump lost easily and bigly.
Why drag Trump and USA into this article ? Somalians killed and dragged and desecrated young American men's bodies through the streets of Mogadishu , all captured on film and distributed worldwide to humiliate Amaerica. USA owes NOTHING to these people. Let them solve their own problems...go to Saudi Arabia , plead for charity. Isn't Islam a great charitable religion?   Somalia is a failed state, and a terrorist state.
No you dont?! I used to go to  a public school that forced me to recite the christian prayer every morning, after standing for national anthem, one day while i was in kindergarden i was standing for prayer like everyone else, except i wasnt reciting the prayer and i didnt have my hands together like the others, well the teacher came over to me and asked me to do it, once i refused she scolded me and marched me down to the principals office, in which i was suspended and sent home! C'mon i was 4 or 5 years old! Mind you that wasnt even that long ago as im 21 now!   The sole difference is that nobody is being forced to pray i this accomadation, they are simply providing ALL students with a room to pray, but its mainly used by muslims, since muslims have to pray 5 times a day, and would instead be praying in hallways.  Nobody will even see them praying! Whats the problem? Ill tell you, its because they are muslim, Now if they were christian this topic wouldnt even arise.
This is the radical who killed these Americans:  “I pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may God protect him [in Arabic], on behalf of the Islamic State,” Mateen says on the new transcript.  The old version had several words scrubbed and read: "I pledge allegiance to [omitted] may God protect him [in Arabic], on behalf of [omitted]."  House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., called the earlier decision by DOJ and the FBI to release only a partial transcript "preposterous."  This is a presidential election year.
This article brings to mind something I often think about. Why does the concept of faith become a stumbling block in our relations with others? Why should I care whether or not a Muslim or Jew believes Jesus is divine? Why shouldn't the common ground we can arrive at through our respective moral codes and our shared humanity be enough?  It seems that so many of the issues that become contentious between adherents of different religions are more about politics and power than spirituality. The older I get, the less I can get my head around a God that cares more about the profession of a creed than the behavior that profession inspires.   [NOTE: I expect the usual anti-Muslim hysteria to follow. To save time, let me state up front that I won't respond. Every religion has ancient literature with incendiary passages, and most Muslims aren't radicals. They want no more than the rest of us want out of life, which is to live in peace. That's all I have to say on the subject.]
Religion of any type does not belong in public schools . With regard to Islam , in Britain it has devolved to the point where Muslim children are allowed to leave school on Friday to attend the neighbourhood mosque. Heed the old saying " To see Canada in 20 years , look to Britain today ".
Too funny. The French  colonization of Algeria took place between 1830 --1847  and no there wasn't over a  millions  muslims killed. You should learn to read
Why does the Left continually trip over their own ideology?  Anyone with the cognitive ability to turn on a TV knows that there's no serious parallel between so-called "right-wing extremism" - meaning semi-regular Billy Bob in a bedsheet gatherings - and Islamic Extremism.  One is a tiny group of complainers that an even smaller number of people listen to. The other is about a fanatical dedication to upping the body count - anywhere anytime. IMO  by elevating the status of the former,  Goodale is creating low hanging fruit in order for the government to claim easy 'wins' over extremism like cancelling a parade or protest.  Meanwhile,  no serious solutions on the latter.
Yeah, starting a "purely Islamic" village, or enclave, is a really great step in uniting Muslims and Christians. I call b.s.
Actually Alan I do understand  the distinction between Muslim fundamentalists and MODERATE Muslims.  Its the moderate Muslims that must lead the way for a reformation to take place in Islam.   I'm trying to facilitate that.  I feel its you who doesn't understand that distinction. Here's two URL's that will give you a little more insight.   They are by  Canadian Muslim reformist Raheel Raza, maybe you'll listen to her.   Become informed on the subject you so vehemently support, don't let political correctness get in the way.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSPvnFDDQHk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2KsvcJ4Myw
Fact is it is the republicans who love to expand government.  Just remember it was under GW that  the country saw a major increase in government.   Today this is being repeated with the potential  building of a stupd wall along the border and the expansion of agents to throw out Muslims.    Have to laugh at you republicans who complain about how weak the military is under obama while silent under republicans.  Just remember 9/11 happened under GW, and it took Obama to get Bin Laden even though GW promised that he would not rest until Bin is brought to justice.  Then  6 months later basically said he couldn't be bothered.
You know people "used to" think the world is flat-Trump originally said the wrong thing by mentioning "muslims" in his attempt to describe who needed to be banned. When will the media update their story to reflect what the real intent of the ban is? To keep the terrorist from these countries out. Whether their Muslims, Catholics, Protestants, black, white, green, gay, straight, women, men, aunties.......get my drift? The media is the divisive component to where we are now as a society.
It's interesting to note that the comments to this article mirror the topic so well. Namely that perception is not necessarily accurate. These comments are filled with anti-Muslim ravings which to some might indicate widespread anti-Muslim sentiment however when looked at objectively it's readily apparent that the extent of the hate comes only from a very few posters who are obsessively repeat posting their prejudices. I'm sure they don't even appreciate the irony they are contributing to by echoing the article's premise.
You're a touch sensitive, Communica.  You wrote: "... Gary and the Mayor want to continually perpetuate the myth of the backwoods Alberta (well certainly in comparison to anything in BC)..."  The article stated: "... statistics show that acts of hatred and Islamophobia are on the rise across the country – and Calgary is no exception" and "... it's an issue here, but you also see it in Vancouver ..."
First of all those are completely different things. Secondly,  would you be ok if someone from the Muslim faith wanted to pray at the game?   If not, that's why laws like this are in place.
An inference is not inherently a fallacy.  Inferences are conclusions drawn on by evidence and reasoning. It is not unreasonable to infer that Mr. Trump “offers no limiting principles when it comes to the use and abuse of power” - when we are inundated with things like building walls, the advocating of torture, extracting Muslims from the US - the list goes on and on.  Just as it is a perfectly logical inference to assume that one who constantly dehumanizes women - is a misogynist.  This ‘direct interrogation’ mandate you propose is flawed to say the least - people do lie afterall.  Beyond that, I would submit that this ‘direct interrogation’ method is yet another tactic used by abusive person to try and hide and/or deny the fact that they are abusive.  (Boy, that was “evil” of me)
No need to ban it. Just let women dress as they want. Somehow I don't see that happening. They won't even allow non-muslims to dress how they want.
Kellyanne Conway defended the muslim ban by citing the Bowling Green Massacre. Everybody remembers where they weren't when they heard news of the Bowling Green Massacre. From the eastern seaboard to south Florida to the Bering Sea coast, people from all corners of the country didn't weep in sorrow. In prayer vigils all across this great land Americans didn't mourn the dead. A group I was with wanted to pray and mourn over the pictures of the dead from the Bowling Green Massacre but there weren't any so we used the pictures of people that come with new wallets and we cried "why oh why didn't this happen to you". After the Bowling Green Massacre, America will never not be the same. We need someone to not make sense of this story so questions for you Trumpsters...Is the Bowling Green Massacre story fake Fake News or is it fake Fake fake news? Tell us how that works And what do you Trump fans think of the un-dishonest media that didn't not report on the Bowling Green Massacre?
The article says "Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, the latest directed at Egypt’s increasingly embattled Christian minority following two church bombings last month that killed more than 45, also claimed by the group".  Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslims don't have to influenec or insprie any other Muslim. All Muslim jihadists have to do is follow Islam, the hadiths and the many verses in the Quran, the holy book of Islam, that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers (infidels).  Islam and the hadiths and the verses in the Qur'an are inspiration enough.
"How does a Muslim woman quietly riding a public bus create any harm, or risk of harm, to the broader public good?"  The wearing of a veil is not "quiet", but an expressive and public anti-social message of "dont interact with me", especially if you are male. One could argue that polygamy and genital cutting are also no risk to the "public good."  All these practices, however, share the same extreme misogyny and sexism endemic in Muslim groups and are antithetical to the concept of religious freedom.  A free woman or person would NEVER choose to wear a burka. Like polygamy, and genital cutting, wearing a burka is a manifestation of religious-sanctioned male dominance and control.
So once again you're insisting that Muslims be obliged to put all their cards on the table when you've admitted that you prefer people to hide signs of their religious affiliation. So which is it? Do you want them to be explicitly overt or completely neutral? And you accuse THEM of being "coy"?  You're saying that it's the responsibility of Muslims to be explicit about their religious standing whether moderate or conservative, in order not to feed the ignorance of those who only see Muslims as ultra orthodox. It's as if you're blaming Muslims for the ignorance of others. Almost like blaming a sexual assault victim for wearing a short skirt.  It's sad that you refer to the columnists as "hajibis" which can easily be taken as offensive and that you assume they are "ultra conservative" because of this. If they were truly "ultra conservative" wouldn't they be wearing a burka and not even be allowed to write a column?The more you post, the more your prejudices come out.
There are 3 races. Caucasian, Mongoloid (Asian), and Negroid (Black). These are their scientific names. Anthropologically, they refer to relative frame size & shape of the head. Everything beyond that, including soft tissue, brain and other body systems, are exactly the same, just changes in melanin in the skin. They just look different because of environment.  Mexicans are both Caucasian and Asian, as are most Central and South Americans. Many American Blacks are Caucasian and Black. Judaism is a religion, just like Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism. If you're Jewish, there are ethnicities. It's just like being Italian or Irish.  Askenazi, Sephardi, etc. If you're Ashkenazi, you are most likely at or within 2% of being 100% European, mostly living in colder climates. Being European, to most white supremacists, means white. So basically, I bet if they did a side by side study, you'd find most Ashkenazi Jews are as "white" if not "whiter" than most supposedly "white" supremacists.
A Muslim or Jewish deli would be able to easily say that they do not carry pork products, and therefore can't/won't sell the product.  The baker was denying a couple something he sells to others simply because they were gay.  As far as it being due to his religious beliefs, the other problem he runs into would be that it is unlikely he checks to make sure none of his heterosexual couples have committed sinful acts.  To me, if the couple wanted a cake with a decoration he found objectionable, I'd side with the baker so long as he offered to sell them the cake and the materials for the decoration.  If the baker refused to make #17 from the wedding cake catalog simply due to the customers being gay, then that is discrimination.
Presently the world has 7.2 billion people by 2098 (according to the UN projection) the world will have 11.2 billion people on the planet. Majority of the growth in the Muslim world and Africa. Average family size in Syria and Pakistan is 10. Average family size in Denmark and Japan is 1.8 children. Highest birthrate in the world is Nigeria which is 12 children per family. The world has a shortage of fresh water. Birth Control needs to be addressed in the Muslim world.
Are you saying, AI1144, that Muslims are targeted in El Salvador? Do you have any data to prove that?  Is it not also possible that one young, impressionable immigrant killed another because he could not stand being at the very bottom of a racist order, and so he attacked some Muslim youth as a way to exhibit power over them and even in the belief that this might win approval?
It works that way with violence Motley.   I don't care how moral or immoral a person may be, I'll bet on the person with the biggest weapon and the willingness to use in without hesitation.    Not all Muslims have weapons, or certainly not weapons to match ISIS or random terrorist cells.     Millions of Syrians have been fleeing their home country at great risk.   You don't do that because you have whim to uproot your life, you do it because you are convinced you will die otherwise.    Facing starvation and an unwinable battle, people will run, walk, or crawl to get out.   Mainstream media reports the peaceful Muslim.  I've seen it.   It come mostly in features and back page articles.   It's a one day life for these positive stories.  But a terrorist attack will consume weeks of analysis and take 100's hours of broadcast time.   It sells, which fits the goals of ownership.  It's enough to make one think every Muslim is a terrorist.
I, too, found the inclusion of Hume to be puzzling, given that he was an apostate and most likely an atheist.  Do you know what happens to apostates and atheists in Muslim-predominant cultures?
Leitch does not "echo Trump"   She is proposing a calm and rational discussion of Canada's immigration issues, and proposing a starting point, i.e. "Canadian values" for individual immigrants, not a blanket ban on people of certain origins or broad religious category (there are many types of Muslims, most who wish to come here are not extremists but fleeing extremists).
Since you have copied & pasted this same ridiculous comment all week, I am compelled to point out your exaggerations.  In the history of the planet, the CCP would not make the top 100.  In the past 100 years, they probably wouldn't make the top 10.  Perhaps you have heard that Saudi Arabia still allows public floggings, amputations & beheadings.  Canadian companies have a contract to sell $15 Billion worth of armoured troop carriers to the Saudis and the public has hardly batted an eye.  Even Justin could not reverse that deal.  The CCP will not permit a public debate of human rights, so we need to eliminate this issue from trade talks.  We will have far greater influence on these issues in private discussions after we have forged political & economic alliances.  I am appalled at their treatment of the Falun Gong, and the oppression of Muslim Uyghurs in the western provinces, and of course the Buddhist in Tibet.  Name a country that has NOT oppressed its minority  populations.
I just took a quick look at the 10 most wanted on the FBI website.  Only one is a Muslim and he's from Egypt.  So I have to ask.  What part of the FBI website are you referring to that refutes "fear of betrayal/harm is unfounded?"
Allan, Jack does not have to read M 103 (as if you have)  the fact it singles out "Islamophobia" by name for condemnation makes it "racist" (yes we know Islam is not a race) Jack did say "ignorantly selective)  no other religion is mentioned specifically so if not "racist" what shall we call it "religion bias" ? "religion exceptionalism?
In Islam, the liars who can't get into Paradise are admitted to Canada as their second choice.
That is the wrong answer, because the question should be, "Why is religion relevant when it is Muslims, but not other religions?" Should we expect home-grown Buddhist terrorist bombers in retaliation for intervening in Buddhist countries? The question answers itself.
Oh how noble. I wonder if he's aware or cares that all of these nations permanently bar entry to their countries of anyone holding an Israeli passport. Not only do these ones bar entry but so do a dozen other Muslim nations. Will he refuse to go to these countries in sympathy for their racist, bigoted barring of Israelis? My guess is... uh, NO.
Just an addendum. Serbo/Croatian is not a language. The Slavic language dating back to the multiple  tribes who ran from the Ottomen/Turks found their way to the land of the "Dragon", Croatia and fought the Muslim invaders for from 200 to 400 years, , co-mingled ( bred I mean) with each other and drove a lot of the Islamic  hordes back to Muslim lands. So with all the mixed blood how could they not become one instead of repeatedly slaughtering each other? Yup I have some of that mixed up DNA from the Balkans to the Baltic.  But at least there are many languages  in the Anchorage schools, hope they all get functional English and adopt their new country. We do not need another Dearborn Michigan.
Trump spewed hate filled rants on women, Mexican's, and Muslims. Did you miss them? When did Obama ever come close matching Donald's vitriolic tone? Never.
Hallo Loy, you write  "And I have my baptismal and marriage promises to keep . I like to see them as bonds of love ."   So you are an exception. Most of us were baptised as babies. The fact that we are born into an institutionalised religion has often been the basis for religious wars. No child is born as a catholic, a protestant, a muslim, a buddhist, an atheist and so on (maybe with the exception of being born of a Jewish mother). Our confession is the result of education, or - if you like - of vocation, grace. But I am deviating of this topic of women in the RCC. Sorry.
So, Chin's lawsuit is not frivolous, right?  A frivolous lawsuit is any lawsuit in which the plaintiff knows that there is little or no chance of the lawsuit succeeding if pursued in court.  Chin's lawsuit has so far worked to modify key parts of the Muslim ban.  The Supreme Court clearly believes it has some chance of succeeding, or the Justices wouldn't have agreed to hear arguments.  So, not frivolous, right?  I'd be happy to have Muslim refugees in the neighborhood.  Most of my neighbors now speak dialects of Chinese, which I don't speak, and it hasn't proven to be a problem.
Why do you think that Muslims should be excluded from the US because they are Muslims? Do you actually know any?
Real Canadians support President Trump. Appeasers and traitors are living in a fantasy world. If you want to see a good example of the prevalence of hatred and injustice, spend some time in a  Muslim-majority country.
In your opinion, is it inappropriate to have a "men only" section of the Western Wall? I think it's inappropriate.  What about you?  And back to the original question, which you didn't answer, are girls allowed to lead these Muslim prayers in these Canadian schools?  If not, is that wrong?  I think it is.  What do you think?
Hawai`i's challenge to Muslim Ban III is a public document.  I believe the argument about "finding" starts on page 18.  Take a look!
That's quite ironic Doc since you've been accusing me of intolerance all along, vilifying me for daring to stand up to the good people of Saint Apollinaire when their objections to a Muslim cemetery were clearly irrational and based only on ignorance and prejudice. I even gave you the opportunity to provide a logical, rational explanation for their objections yet you haven't been able to do so other than a long winded explanation that people aren't rational so I shouldn't expect better or hold them to account for that. A convenient deflection and one-size-fits-all excuse that has no weight whatsoever.  Sounds to me more like you know they don't have any good reasons and you're just trying to dodge the issue. Multiculturalism? You brought that up yourself. Bit of a Freudian slip I expect. And now you've tried to up the ante by attacking me, further distracting from the fact that you and the objectors in Saint Apollinaire have provided no reasonable grounds for their objections. Sad.
Does Islamaphobia include critical analysis of Islam, religious satire, and comedy? Does Islamaphobia include criticism of political Islam, sharia law, and the human rights records of countries governed by Islamic law. Is it Islamaphobic to criticize the misogyny and gender segregation prevalent in countries governed by Islamic law or is it simply a function of cultural relativism (Iran's morality police beating girls for not covering their hair, Saudi's ban on women driving). Finally, why not also condemn anti-semitism in the some motion, it is more prevalent in Canada. Is there a reason why Islam should be afforded a higher sensitivity compared to other religions? Is Islam beyond reproach? South Park can make fun of Christians and Jews all day long but Islam is a sacred cow? Does Canada's Charter not cover religious discrimination?
Right When was the last time a Muslim country had concentration camps where 12 million innocents were killed?  Right. Never.
How's the board going to handle when the Muslim students and their parents complain about the moral decay at school?
The backers of Israel are at the root of the anti-Muslim hysteria in the USA. To keep the US perpetually at war with the potential enemies of "our best friend in the Middle East" Islam must be demonized. So where do the volunteers of this congregation stand on that issue?
someone needs to add up the economic disruption of his executive order that obviously wasn't read by the employees of the government and followed instructions based on what Giuliani claims is a "Muslim ban"
Of course.  If you are a Muslim candidate, like Abid Riaz Qureshi, a Republican led Senate will refuse to ask you any questions at all.  In fact they will refuse to even consider you, once nominated to say, a Federal judgeship.  However, you will be accused of trying to bring Sharia law to America by Trump supporters commenting on Breitbart. (For the record, Qureshi came to this country from Pakistan as a small child, and graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School, and apparently knows far more about federal tax law than Islamic jurisprudence.)  I'm not a fan of Feinstein's line of questioning (I think she was missing the point of what the nominee had actually written) but you do need to consider something beyond the same old knee-jerk response.
if it's not about pot ,feminism, parades or Islamophobia our PM is not interested.
Firstly the motion includes more than just Islam. Secondly, where were you when motions specifically condemning anti-Semitism were passed? That was quite definitely for "one group only".
"I wanted to pray in the open, but I was kind of scared with everything going in the media," he said. "I'm a Muslim, it's not what the media portrays me to be. If people look at me, a Muslim praying, I don't know what they're going to think, what's going to happen. . . . I was kind of scared right now. But I just did it. I relied on God. I went over to the corner and just prayed." "I'm a Muslim, it's not what the media portrays me to be." ???????
No bans on countries where Trump does business or big American companies do business.  Expect all US Muslims to sew Islamic symbol on their jackets soon and be rounded up to live in designated areas.
Actually, 12% follow Islam.  82% are Hindu.  Just FYI.
Same here. Saunders spends too much time dancing around the main issue. It's not that complicated - Erdogan is an Islamist and is simply "governing" accordingly.
In 2011, The Center for American Progress developed a 138-page report titled, Fear, Inc. The Roots of the Islamophobia Network in America http://tinyurl.com/8ftkxhw  listing donors, grassroots organizations, right-wing media enablers and their relationship to the religious right, and the political players involved in this network.  The Council for the National Interest has recently issued a summarized account titled The Main Purveyors of Islamophobia http://www.councilforthenationalinterest.org/new/?page_id=167.   There is extensive collaboration and funding between these entities, targeting a common agenda to demonize Arabs and Muslims in order to justify Israeli and U.S. violence against them.
Western white liberal/conservative nations with a Christian heritage are better for women than any other system you can identify. Women and gays under Islam ? There are  feminist and LGBT who actually think that's preferable despite all the bloodshed proving them wrong.
Entirely different mentality between the Japanese and muslims. One came her to acclimate and serve America. The other came here to convert and take over America.
you little censor hungry peasants working for minimum wage over there must be on cloud 9 whenever your masters print one of these boring wannabe sensationalist muslim stories. I want to see you continue to do that: keep simple and small, keep running to mommy and daddy to shelter your precious fragile minds. it bemuses beyond your comprehension - how wantonly self destructive you are. go ahead, invite daddy under the covers there with you, i know you can keep the secret - go ahead and have no other sexual experience until you are gifted to the old hairy bozo down at the used car dealership, enjoy that old world misogyny while you trumpet the open society and tolerance. and you know what? when the war DOES happen, i wont return your pettiness and scorn in kind - i, the big, strong, intelligent, successful white man, WILL rescue you, like i always have. im bigger than you, its just that simple. now go ahead and continue playing in your little mind control sand box. i do consent
The Muslim ban has not yet been tried in court, please stop spreading fake news.
No one answered my question so I'll answer it. From what I've read from various sources, what President Trump told the Russians is that Islamic terrorists are planning to turn laptop computers into bombs. This was widely known or suspected already. That's why airlines are contemplating prohibiting laptops and large digital electronic devices in the passenger compartments on international flights. So what's all the hubbub about?
I got news for you JSB1, but none of the Blue people has been suggesting that the Russian's hacked the vote.  That's never been the suggestion.  You are now part of the group that makes up news of your own to support your own point.  By the way, they haven't been Soviets for quite a long time now, so I'm a bit worried about that slip up.  Anyway, meddling can mean a lot of things, and in this world of insta-news a quick fake story planted in a news feed by a foreign power can cause all of your neighboring countries to suddenly issue sanctions against you and shut down your economy.  Just as Qatar what happened to them when the Russians allegedly hacked into their news feed and posted anti-Sunni muslim rhetoric.  This is actually a new kind of warfare but no less dangerous.  And, the fact that the citizens of the USA are so willing to believe anything they read on the web or in a tweet from someone they trust, is really scary.  What we really need is people to engage their brains.
"Moreover, we need a prudent re-evaluation of this supposed greatest threat to America and the world."  - Most certainly - as in, let's listen to scientists who aren't "former," "retired," or "emeritus" professors. How about we consult climatologists who've conducted original research since the Cold War?   "Is this a greater threat than the nuclear missiles currently pointed at America?"   - Whose missiles? North Korea's? They can't reach us, and we can shoot them down, so, yes.   "Than the declared radical Islamic jihad against freedom-loving peoples?"  - Yeah, 100%, no question... and I was in lower Manhattan on 9/11, so save it.     "Some things you don't have to think or pray much about. The Lord gave us all a sound mind to recognize reality."  - I'll say. Kinda ironic coming from you though, Rep. Pittenger. Hey, BTW, sorry to hear your district's being redrawn because it violates federal law. Good luck in 2018! (No, not really. May your loss be a study in humiliation.)
Trump put lipstick on his pig of an immigration executive order.  Trump’s second immigration executive order is still a step toward fulfilling his promise to ban all Muslims from entering the US.  He has never retracted that promise.  As Supreme Court Justice Souter said, the world is not made brand new every morning.  Trump has a history of discriminatory statements regarding race, religion, national origin, and gender.  He is trying to create the world in his image.  That is why there is so much resistance.  Trump’s favorability is at an historic low for a president this early in the term, and it keeps dropping.  More and more Americans see what the Trump presidency will be like, and they are dismayed.
Yet the left  who won't permit discussion of Islam prides itself on being tolerant.
In the past I have lived a short distance from two cemeteries, I always thought anyone could be buried in them, they didn't seem to have a religious requirement.  I have seen church yard cemeteries that I understood only interred parishioners.  I wouldn't want to live right beside any cemetery though because past experience was that they were places that the youth threw rowdy parties at after hours and they attracted vandalism that often carried over into the surrounding residences.  I don't think this rejection has much to do with Muslims and much more to do with cemeteries in general.
Another attack by Islamists today in Pakistan killed at least 40. Comments are open in the article but my comment (which is perfectly civil) was deleted. Happens a lot. The censorship in this newspaper is being noticed by more and more readers. It's beyond ridiculous.
I'm sorry are referring to the muslims in Denver or ISIS or our Commander In Chief ? As far as I know only these fine people who have given their time and love towards the Homeless have not ranted hate speech . Where Our President and ISIS have .. you should really learn to read and comprehend what you read and then and here it is THINK ABOUT what you have just read ... I know auto racism is the latest fad in America but try and rise above the low baseline of our Great Nation .. Think about what these people have done before you try and cast them into the same boat as say ..ISIS or Donald J Trump
You can't be this oblivious, can you? Since admitting thousands of Muslims into their country, Germany, Sweden, Austria, and other parts of Europe have experienced firsthand  muslim extremists roaming their cities, with sharia police and sharia law enforcement attacking and detaining both Muslim and non-Muslim citizens, alike. . Have you, like, not read any news in the past two years?
Have you watched any news other than The Failing NYT's, or CNN? Have you seen what's happening in Germany, Paris, Iraq? Did you know that in the 70's Iraq looked like America, that the women wore mini-skirts, that the men didn't rape or beat their wives, that they were allowed a college education? They didn't desecrate cemeteries, or call for the murder of anyone who doesn't submit to Sharia law. They didn't have chants on killing America. The entire pledge of Radical Islamic terror is to take over the entire world and make us all submit. I think we have the right to protect our land.
Hmmm ... you think the first Muslim ban "is still in the works?"  Actually, it's not.  The administration did not appeal.  Probably because they couldn't win the case.  What about Muslim ban # 2 in your mind makes it more likely to prevail?  Did you read the decision?  I'm betting no.
Most mass shooters were white by far. All were men. All were mentally unstable, had been bullied, or felt unjustly wronged. Most felt that they were at the end of their rope somehow. Several mass shooters attributes their violence to far fetched reasons--conspiracy theory stuff, but were mentally unstable and had failures in life. This massacre was, I feel, more from a mentally unstable, confused man who chose this ISIS cause as his reason when it's more likely he was at the end of his rope for other reasons (conflicted about his sexuality, failed marriages, powerless, had history of mental instability). Banning Muslims is not only against our constitution and values but is inflammatory and misses the point. Mental health and FBI background checks on weapon purchases and banns on semi-automatic rifles are more reasonable.
Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Immigration has already stated categorically that he will not open Canada's doors to Christians. That would be religion faith based immigration policy and against our secular moral standards. He said just a couple of weeks ago that Christians don't face the same dangers as other legitimate refugees. He will however welcome all Muslims fleeing Trump's persecution in the US.
Trump wants to get rid of illegal residents. Muslims, Mexicans, anyone here who is a legal resident has nothing to fear. No matter how many times Trump haters say that he is Hitler, he is not Hitler. Stop the fear mongering.
Is it not true, Thomas Dye that there is nothing in the Hawaii Suit that says  ****"all muslims"****? "ALL Muslims", Thomas Dye.   "All Muslims".
I thought the correct response to terror attacks was hashtags, candle light vigils, hugging the person next to you, singing "Don't Look Back in Anger", and to Keep Calm and Carry On ?!   Why does this attack have more significance than Manchester, London Bridge, and Westminster combined?  3 out of 4 of the latest attacks in the UK were committed by devout muslims and killed 34 and injured a hundred more.   Globally, there have been 145 Islamic terror attacks responsible for 1,350 deaths just during the first 25 days of Ramadan.   But this 1 attack should be our sole focus ?   Paul Joseph Watson puts it best here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb99RVT6afI
And where do Muslim girls pray?
The only troll is Azira herself, trolling for Islam and for western civilization's submission to the Koran. Her hijab is the sign she handed her fate to Allah. Giving up free will is just one thing Muslims ar expected to sacrifice for their religion.  4th posting
Back when Stockwell Day and Stephen Harper came forward to get elected PM, we worried about the Trumpesque factions of the conservative party and its supporters. Harper muzzled them and we were told they were figments of hysterical liberal imaginations, no one in the fold was so extreme.  Well, see?  Told 'ya.  We heard how certain people spoke off record about non-whites, non-Christians, non-straights, non-conservatives, and new Canadians.  It was toxic stuff. And we took notes when we learned what sorts of catch phrases got used to code the prejudices in public ('family values' meant 'anti-gay' while 'Canadian values' meant anti-Muslim, etc.).  Now, note the excitement in some of the comments here that Trump has risen and that we could emulate him. Oh sorry, I'm still hysterical?  You mean it's only about a desire for legal immigration, the more dangerous applicants, respect for Christian values too, and a sincere almost humble concern for jobs?  Yeah, right. As I say. We have ears.
"3% real, 17% perceived."  I don't understand why lefties think this is somehow a positive point for muslims.  As for your second point, it's simply idiotic. They probably haven't watched lorries being rammed into people going about their business, or tube trains being blown up, but they happened.
"For example, a recent poll by Forum Research indicates that Muslims, First Nations people, South Asians, Asians, Jews and blacks are the most likely to suffer bias by fellow Canadians, in that order."  By itself, this statement says little. What, for instance, are the actual levels of bias expressed by those who were polled? And some in the identity-focused political community might be upset. Some activists have tried to convince us, for instance, that anti-black racism is a problem that apparently eclipses other forms of discrimination and must be addressed as a priority. But could their premise be wrong, as the ranking the author provides suggests to be the case? And I wonder what the poll's rankings would look like were it to include homeless people and the disabled, the two groups that realistically are the most marginalized in Canadian urban society (i.e. excepting First Nations reserves)?
Germany let in 1.2 million refugees without much screening. Belgium and France have huge Muslim immigrant populations in ghettos and they have not integrated.  I agree with your other points, but telling us there is no link to waves of Muslim immigrants and terrorism is naïve and wrong. You cannot accept thousands of undocumented Muslims without the proper security checks. I am more confident that Canada is doing that, but Europe is likely beyond hope. Merkel was foolish in accepting so many at once.
Halal slaughter involves severing the carotid artery which renders the animal unconscious in seconds. I'm no fan of Islam but I really cannot see a problem with Halal slaughter if done correctly. Kosher slaughter is virtually the same procedure, I believe.
Dead right, Progressive111.   Perhaps marketing and PR really are "foreign" concepts for the Muslim community.  Too bad.  Canadians have done lots of "reaching out" newcomers.  Obviously, I don't expect much of a two-way dialogue with them--they've got a HUGE learning curve about Canada that sucks up time and energy.  But those more established?   Next to zip.  Perhaps it's of a "no news is good news" mind-set.  Don't know.  There's LOTS I'd like to learn about Canada's Muslims.     Apart from a monthly column from Sheema Khan, and one outrageous guest column from a PR woman from a Canadian Muslim organization of some sort (forget the name), that's pretty much it for Globe and Mail readers.  Over the past year or so.  Or...have I missed something?
Trump was elected on a Muslim ban. People liked the idea. It's why he was elected. Mulcair, like Trudeau, loves Islam even though he's a detestable Infidel, who Muslims would, were they in power, seek to convert, tax or kill. Tommy would probably just convert. He's already got the beard.
We cannot avoid speaking of the World Trade Centre. Similarly, however, we must recognize the damage caused by the colonization of the middle east in the 19th century. As well, how can one avoid speaking of the creation and western support for a Jewish nation? It is a fact of history. How then can we face the Muslims who were disenfranchised, whose homeland was reduced to something that resembles little more than a penal colony?   Conversely the Jews were themselves exiled as they had been before. Coming from somewhere, yet belonging nowhere. Did they not, after the horrors of the Third Reich, finally deserve a home, historically validated, when so much of their world in exile had been laid waste? What were the former Jewish sections of Warsaw, Prague and Budapest now but rubble devoid of the possibility of life? Where was their home if it no longer existed?
Five New Mexico players knelt during the National Anthem to protest the U.S. Air Force Academy graduates bombing "majority Muslim" countries during Obama's Presidency. The five NM players indicated that they'll continue to protest the U.S. military, all veterans, and the families of veterans to remove the "stain of America." NM HC Bob Davie defended his players fundamental right to possess vitriolic hatred of the U.S. Davie chuckled that with a $2M buyout for his contract he couldn't care less if his players joined ISIS. (Note the sarcasm).
Since we all agree it beneficial for children to learn about other people, let's have all kids learn about the Bible and the Gospels in class too.  Have the Muslim girls take off their hijabs while singing Jesus Loves Me. Have the Muslim kids recite passages from the Torah and have  rabbis as guests to teach them the value of being a mensch. The lunch room can have  a kosher lunch of deli bagels and latkas.  How could a Muslim mother say no to her pischer  such fun  because  we all agree it beneficial for children to learn about other people?
The  4 women of the Shafia family would be alive if their  <benevolent and  moderate> Muslim family, husband, son and second polygamous wife, were not so hostile to Canada's culture of gender equality, The 3 daughters and first wife wanted to dress and live like other ordinary Canadian women and died for the sin of disobeying men.  Tell us again how Canada has short changed you?
Oh brother.  This has nothing to do with a "threatening Muslim monolith" and everything to do with a policy that attempts to cover concerns but sometimes misses.    "The U.S. won’t say why the girls were rejected for visas, citing confidentiality. But Mohib said that based on discussions with U.S. officials, it appears the girls were rebuffed due to concerns they would not return to Afghanistan. It’s a fate that has beset many Afghans seeking entry to the U.S. in recent years as continuing violence and economic challenges lead many to seek asylum in America, or to travel through the U.S. to Canada to try to resettle there."    Note "it is a fate that has beset many Afghans...in recent years".  Yes, even under President Obama this could have happened, because of concerns that people from war-torn repressive countries (this one happens to be majority Muslim, which is, btw, why it has a history of being repressive toward women) who might want to try to seek asylum.
Why not go to the rich gulf states why western countries that are not muslim.  We keep this up and trump will ban all canadians from traveling to the U.S.  We should have the same immigration policy as the states our border is way to long to properly secure way easier to do it from our shores and airports.
Personally I believe, religion does not have any place in the school which is solely for the purpose of education. At the same time, self proclaimed secularists do not have any right to spew hatred towards the muslim students. Leave the muslim kids alone.
Nemo What has educated women got to do with those uneducated in villages because radical Muslims won't allow it.
At least America has the cajones to do something.  Good ol' Canada, on the other hand, is about to make 'islamophobia', whatever that is, a hate crime.  We Canadians, apparently would rather sit on our hands, than take a stand against fake issues.  The American government is doing what it believes is right in protecting its citizens.  The Canadian government on the other hand does nothing for its citizens......unless they're muslim.
It really wasn't about the niqab, was it? It was dog whistle politics. Sound like you are being reasonable, but actually aim at an entire ethnic group or religion.   The reason a lot of non Muslim ethnic minorities in the 905 area switched their vote from the Conservatives to the Liberals was that they recognized who the next ethnic targets would be.
Trump said the new muslim ban is a watered down version of the old one.  Guess his justice department wanted Judge Watson to water down his ruling.
Deflecting again, aren't you Ruben? Trump's EO is both illegal and unconstitutional. He is targeting a religious minority under the false pretext of protecting the national security when he is not doing anything about the white mass murderers within the US. He instructed the CBP and ICE to ignore the court orders and they are doing so enthusiastically even to the point of detaining US CITIZENS and asking questions about their Muslim last names and their religious views.
Mr Jones ran for public office. His youthful upbringing and the organizations he is a part of, should be disclosed to the public. I will quote from the tmoa website: "The Islamophobic propaganda should come to an end! Muslims should not be pushed into blind alleys, but must be allowed to fully participate in the affairs of the state in their respective countries. Burning Holy Qurans and making objectionable videos and books on the Holy Last Messenger, peace be upon him, should be stopped! Give a new interpretation to the right of freedom of speech that does not allow other parties to hurl insults and abuses to anyone's creed, religion or religious beliefs." We see how the faith of islam deals with those that do not embrace it! Charlie Hebdo anyone? He talks about how the Shiites are not moslem. And this is the root of much of the trouble. Your faith has been fighting amongst themselves for around 1400 years.
Funny enough Christianity originated in the Middle East and now faces a real Genocide and true oppression.  In Canada, Muslims believe oppression is anyone who has any questions or concerns about their Religion. Hence M-103. being implemented as we speak.  We truly live in Insane times, anyone who votes Justin back in 2019 is completely out to lunch.  Vote Conservative or NDP in 2019 to end this insanity.
This is the 2nd story today (that follows many more in prior weeks) that chooses to characterize them as "primarily Muslim-majority countries" as the foremost distinction.  Perfect example of spin.  While technically correct, it's still very deceptive because it suggests that the reason for the ban is because their travelers are Muslims.  It's a grossly irresponsible characterization.  The REAL reason is because our intelligence agencies deem those countries to be at higher risk of sourcing terrorists/jihadists/other bad people that want to hurt Americans, and don't have as good of screening processes to weed them out.  But the WashPo and the AP and others can't resist pushing their narratives, hoping that the lemmings don't notice.
"Donald Trump may want to ban foreign Muslims from coming to America, but that didn’t stop him from taking $225 from one Shahriyar Nasir, according to a new report from the Center for Public Integrity (CPI)."  "Trump’s campaign is in the process of refunding Nasir’s donation, not because he’s Muslim but because he lives in Canada: It’s illegal for presidential campaigns to accept money from foreign nationals unless they have a green card, according to the Federal Election Commission (FEC)."  http://fortune.com/2016/09/13/donald-trump-campaign-refund/
What is a "satanic school," and when did you come up with that term?  And, while there may be Muslim schools, just as there are Catholic schools, sharia is a type of religious law, not an educational system.
Speaking as a non muslim, it's easy to not see the islamaphobia that's overtaking this nation. Terrorist attacks account for an extremely (EXTREMELY) small portion of deaths in the US. Yet, it's way more publicized in the media, and by this government. Moreover, do you really think that muslims come to a mosque and get radicalized and this can somehow be stopped? The religion nor the muslim communities are doing anything to perpetrate this kind of behavior.  "With the recent radical Muslim attacks, people fear that these murderers are being harbored and not exposed." Well nobody is harboring them. The muslim community is comprised of normal everyday americans who happen to be muslim. If people fear this, this in itself is islamaphobia, which is what AMEN is trying to address.
Trump has business (Golf Hotels, etc) with Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, and Lebanon....all are Muslim nations, and all are exempt from this Muslim ban --- Yet the 911 hijackers all came from those countries .... None of the Hijackers came from the 7 countries in the ban ...
Germany, France, Sweden and not even Canada are ready for the next waves of more refugees that will stream westward from Erdogan's oppression and Islamic extremism. The Liberals will embrace the teaming new comers, calling us Ismaophobes if we object to even more people from self-destructing third world Muslims states.  Erdogan will clean out Turkey's teaming unemployed masses to reduce many of his domestic problems.
My "obsession" with single parenthood is its socioeconomic effect on society. I am not judgemental about the issue - if some rich Hollywood actress has a hundred kids outside marriage it is not as harmful because she can provide for them. You are assuming that I think that women have to be suppressed to reduce single parenthood. I actually think  more contraceptives are the answer ( a large percentage of these single mothers are teenagers or very young women). Contraceptives are not provided to young girls in conservative Muslim countries. Back alley abortion is how they deal with the issue, which is much worse. Conservative Christians in North America want the same for young girls here.  Child poverty ensures that this dream/ideal of hard work, discipline, education, etc goes out of the window (a visit to an inner city school in the US should prove that).  Child poverty rates are around 40 percent today in the US. Those kids will not go to university, or become economically successful
Actually religion is a protected class. If it's a public business it's open to the public . So if a Muslim business sells wedding cakes they legally have to sell them to Jews or Christians too. The Equal Rigjts Amendmwnt was put in place because of people refusing service to people they didn't like; like Blacks, Jews or Muslims. Imagine that!
CEI - I agree that many are low information individuals.  I like to watch a variety of news programs, and I just cannot believe the leftist slant or misinformation that is provided to viewers.  If I simply watched CBS, MS/NBC, CNN, etc., I would oppose the temporary travel ban too.  They constantly refer to it incorrectly as a "Muslim ban" and not a "temporary travel ban from six countries."  I guess it's easier to say Muslim ban.  Even likable and local KGMB/KHNL news does that!
I'm part Japanese, I felt the bigotry in the early 60's still in Hawaii mind you. I despise the correlation of the Japanese treatment in '41 to the Muslim World today that Jane feels. She's got her right to feel that way but it's way different in my mind. The lesson from '41 was learned, the US doesn't go knocking on Muslim's doors for nothin today! There may be mistakes made from time to time so... . But it's not the norm.
There are large sections of suburban Detroit with Muslim populations where one won't find a single American flag displayed on the front of the house - in sharp contrast to what typically finds in U.S. towns and cities elsewhere. So, will this Muslim man swear allegiance to the U.S. and mean it?  It's also interesting that the headscarf and niqab are discarded by women in Muslim countries when religion police are reined back during moderate times, so why is headgear so persistently worn here in the west?  The reason is for what they tell us on the street - some may wear it out of fear from their families, but most Muslim women here stubbornly wear it as a form of protest, and of superiority, against the very culture in which they abide - the culture which actually gives them rights and a safety net.  The headgear is intended to draw reaction from others - it's a form of jihad meant to disrupt U.S. culture. These Muslim women aren't surprised by reactions which they deliberately induce.
No it was the muslims, or women, or 'insert aggrieved group here'.
Hedzer, if there is a Christian sect that mandates prayer during a particular school day (as is the case with the muslim prayers), I cannot believe they would be denied the space to do so in a Canadian school.  If they were, they should take legal steps.  I do not believe Christians are discriminated against in University hiring procedures.  If you're talking about not being qualified for a special affirmative action position, that's a different matter, but otherwise, they should take legal steps.  Like pretty well all religions, muslims are wary of being the subject of missionaries.  I suspect that's what your chaplain situation is all about.  In my experience, Christian groups are not shy about sticking up for their legal rights.
Happy Ramadan and Aloha Akbar to you too poidoggy.... LOL  https://youtu.be/OO7mAEeNRoo
I've read several articles that report Khizr Khan is an attorney with ties to the muslim Brotherhood, has vigorously worked to see more muslims admitted to the USA & has worked to see sharia law accepted in the USA. If these things are true, I'd like to the the media report on this aspect of the outrageous Mr. Khan.
Turkey banned the burka for decades.  The burka is a Saudi Arabia fashion trend only a few decades old.  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has just announced his intention to curb the extreme aspects of Islam as practiced in his country.
They were in all likelihood driven there by otehr Muslims, with the time and place pre-arrranged for them.   With their cell phone GPS and online bank accounts they will  be well taken care of by their handlers, Imams in Canada, the US, and in the Middle east. Next will be to get the rest of the family into Canada because of the last minute change of plans caused by that infidel Trump. .  The air fare is covered by mosques and Muslim donations from around the world.
I was not asked as well as my neighborhood my relatives and my friends who are all against accepting muslim refuges. How many does it make? The problem is that Canadians are not asked. All the polls are fake and they are faked by Canadian media including G&M
The world has a problem with Muslim extremism.  It seems reasonable to me to at least make a minimal effort to screen people who are coming into the country as illegal border crossers.  They should be given background checks that include screening for hostility towards Western values.  Political correctness has no place in security screening.  Moreover, Islam is both a religion AND a political ideology that in some respects is not compatible with Canadian values.   Being required to answer questions intended to identify those who hold potentially problematical values should be viewed as a necessary step to gain entry to our country with its many benefits an privileges.  No one has a right to complain about any questions that are asked in this context.
No, I was speaking specifically about Breivik and generally about the difficulty of preemptively catching mass murderers. Whether Muslims get a pass or not on protesting terrorism depends on who is talking, obviously. Dick Walker, for instance, insists that Muslims don't condemn terrorism. I have clearly stated otherwise.
And he let 100,000's of Muslims in.....  ya wonder why  There is a conspiracy here, that is pretty clear,  Lyin Hillary with billions in her scam foundation now this ?  it's clear that these families are using foundations for corruption.  We demand an audit and criminal investigation
My mistake. I got the impression from the statement "currently one does not see" as meaning  it is not happening, but it could. Instead, you mean it is not being reported? Or, you don't see it but it is happening? I am confused. Based on those who offered you evidence it does happen, others were also confused.  If I was to say: "one does not see it snow in Acapulco" I mean it does not snow in Alcapulco i.e, it never happens.  I agree we are in a war with a sect of Islam that is marginalized in the global Islamic faith. But this is just a renewal of conflict that goes back over a thousand years. But if we're going to group the entire religion together, there has to be some similar generalization from the number (not just one or two) examples of Christians committing similar crimes around the world (we only listed the U.S). In that vein, I'd include religion as a source of much of the world's problems. And inequality. And occupying State actors.
Actually ... We are far too tolerant... it will destroy our way of life unless we push back. Too much immigration and focus on multiculturalism will see the country divided and weakened over time.... assimilation is low especially in the Islamic population and is a problem and will breed hate on both sides.... Many question if we are wise to allow this journey.
continued from above,   After CIA Operation Neptune Failed 2001, we overthrew the Afghan Taliban Government as Ordered, we chased Osama Bin Laden, his Al Quada, Millions of Afghan Taliban, Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam from Afghanistan into Northern Iraq, they then allied with the 30 Million Kurdistanis aka Kurds and became Ansar Al Islam.  President Bush ordered us to Eliminate Ansar Al Islam as those Responsible for the 9/11 2001 Attacks and Providing Support to those that were Responsible, as 2001 U.S. Military Operation Viking Hammer.  U.S. Military Operation Viking Hammer Failed after the Muslim Nation of Iran gave them Islamic Sanctuary.  Osama Bin Laden, Al Quada, Millions of Afghan Taliban, Holy Warriors of Islam returned thru Iran to Afghanistan, and British General McColl allowed them to reenter Afghanistan, his sense of British Gentleman "Fair Play" of allowing the Taliban to gather at the scheduled battlefield.   Third  Kurdistanis as "Iraqis Insurgency" killing U.S..
The gunman was a 64 year old Caucasian killing mostly Caucasians at a country music festival.  The police did not kill the gunman, instead when they stormed his Mandalay bay hotel room, gunman already committed suicide.  Not likely any racial motivation as his 60 year old girlfriend was Filipino and he had to know a country music festival is attended mostly by Caucasians only.  Serious mental illness and access to high powered  rifles converted to automatic has to play a big part in this mass killing.  Pictures of Las Vegas police with shotguns or handguns was completely ineffective against the gunman shooting from a 32nd floor hotel room down at a massive crowd of thousands with nowhere to get cover.  Unfortunately he has now given Muslim Islamic terrorists an effective way to kill hundreds of Americans without police able to do anything soon enough to make a difference.
""Propaganda phrase" YES! Your spam -and inability to even address clear and obvious facts- is a comic highlight of many peoples' day."  Glad to oblige! People are taking these things way to seriously. We should lighten up and chuckle a little now and then.  AND!!!...we should treat ourselves to some Muslim comedy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  http://muslimfunnyfest.com/  It's not like we're living in grim old Russia, or someplace horrible like Syria where there really is true suffering on a scale we can't even begin to imagine.
I thought the muslim community turned down alternative proposals...their way..only muslims to be buried there....sounds pretty intolerant!
You hold rather a narrow definition of promoting grumpy.   If you are suggesting that Islam presents no concerns about equality of gender and sexual preference, then I'd be interested to hear your arguments in support of that hypothesis   But if you are simply ignoring the obvious impact of your decisions about the values you choose to support, then indeed, you really are a grumpy Lefty.  I have to say the whole notion of the Left supporting freedom strikes me as a bit rich.  Beyond the realm of the freedom to pick my pocket to serve goals the Left can neither afford nor manage competently itself, the Left tends toward heavy control of everything, and is most often frightened of freedom.
Palestinians had a Two state solution  in 1948 when the UN created both Israel and Palestine but Palestine REJECTED that Two state solution by declaring war on Israel, country of Holocaust survivors, with the help of Arab allies  Then in 1967 and 1973 it waged wars again, thus confirming its rejection of Two state Let's not be naive, Palestine wants ONE state, that  being Palestine  And it thinks it will get ONE state with the help of 350 million Arabs 1.5  billion Muslims and leftists in the West who fall for Palestinians playing the victim card
Check out the difference between Muslim societies and ours, you'll soon see the difference.
There is an Islamophobia going on in western culture and that is plain to see and many take it way too far.  Should Islam be criticized, without doubt, but that does not mean many in the west do not take it to the level of blind hatred where they have no intention of coming to an understanding.   Should we allow people into this country that refuse to shake the hand of a woman....No we should refuse entry to that person.  But let us seek to understand and get along as well, while being far more restrictive of who we allow in.  Also why JT needs to go as he simply has blinders and only sees his fathers outdated vision.   We should not forget white people have become most likely the  least racist due to evolving, we should not go backwards and remember we still have a ways to go ourselves.
Dare I raise the spectre of political correctness gone mad. Let us objectively observe the behavioral trends among different religious youths from the second generation, i.e, born and brought up in Canada. The Christian kids , the budhist kids, the hindu kids, etc have religion as the last thing on their minds. the 2nd generation hindu kids can not be dragged to a temple even if tempted by free big mac afterwards. Even if the 1st generation parents try to ram religion down their throats they just laugh back. That is as it should be; healthy and natural behavior - just have fun but be responsible. I do not understand the obsession with same age kids from the muslim community to cover their faces, kneel down however many times a day...doesnt that strike anyone as wholly unnatural ...
Can you prove that "Democrats... are now importing thousands of young Syrian Muslims.."?  Until you can prove it, I will consider it to be yet another lie.  What are you doing here, sir or ma'am?  What are you fishing for?  Do you even know?
Living up to the saint he's named after, who was willing to meet and dialogue with Muslims at the height of the Crusades.
Here is the view of a muslim woman supporting banning the niqab https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/03/the-right-to-ban-the-veil-is-good-news-for-everybody-including-muslims/
abate2, as I understand it, the enmity between the Sunni and Shiite factions  is even greater than that between Muslims and infidels. In the meantime, Happy New Year to you and your family
One, the word is "nonsense", not "non-sense". Your ignorance of the English language is proven with every post.  Second, a lot of Muslim conflicts can also be presented as tribal/ethnic. For example, the Armenian genocide was related both to ethnicity and religion. The Sunni-Shia conflict can also be presented as a mainly Persian-Arab conflict, dating back to the Battle of Qadisiyyah.  Where exactly do you see genocide against Christians? In the Sudan, the genocide has gone from Muslim-on-Christian to Christian-on-Christian.
Good You will pay for Them with Your taxes and They (muslims) not People from Mexico go to the top of the line including Homeless People for housing, health, ebt cards, and money. Take care of Your own first there are alot of homeless in Hawaii.
A blatant disservice to Hawaii is that lawsuit. We can easily afford a few less visitors from these Muslim countries . In fact more people would be coming here if they don't have to watch veiled women parading the beaches and streets.
Odd how the bishops haven't been grandstanding concerning the ratio of Syrian Muslims to Syrian Christian refugees over the last few years.   They do have their agenda to push.
"Far left treats women as second class citizen"...  I am not a leftist nor close to one but as we can see in the US right now the far right would rather have women as non-class citizens .  And the right has nothing to do with Islam, mostly  Christians
The recurring atrocities by Islamic terrorists were bound to create a backlash. Isn't that the purpose of the terrorist strategy of ISIS - to make everyone so angry that  hate crimes rise  against muslims? These crimes  can then "prove" that the West hates muslims. Well, it seems to be working.  But it is a false conclusion. Those who respond to violence with violence do not represent Western society any more than the actions of the terrorists represent muslim society.  In every section of society there are extremists, including the left, whose extremists have smashed windows and torched cars in anti-globalisation marches. We must all do our part to call out extremism wherever it exists, whether in mosques, on the streets, in protest meetings or in political parties. Staying silent because the extremists are "ours" is passive complicity. With respect, Ms Aziz would have had more credibility if she had acknowleged the part Islamic terrorism has played in causing the rise in violence.
The DP has posted at least eight separate stories about this incident, and I'm sure there are more to come.  Last month when a Muslim black man in Fresno shot and killed three random white men on the street because he hates white people, the DP posted a grand total of three stories - and one of those was actually a story about gunfire sensors used by the police.   I wonder why there's such a disparity in the amount of coverage.
Regardless what he may or may not of said during the campaign, that's not what he did. 85% of Muslims don't live in the countries he targeted.
In truth, much of this is on Trump.  No, not because he's cracking down on "illegals".  The problem is HOW he's doing it.  The US Administration has been extremely vague in terms of who is being deported and why.  People have had green cards rescinded.  Anyone even LOOKING Muslim attempting to cross the border, even Canadian citizens, have been turned away for a variety of vague reasons.  The new policies have been so sloppily implemented that even legal immigrants and legitimate refugees have no clear idea where they stand or what will happen next.  If President Trump were to publish a thought-out policy, that includes details for all groups, and communicate specific instructions to border agents and INS on what to do and when, I think a lot of the panic we're seeing would subside.  This is the result of an inexperienced politician introducing a complex policy in an irresponsible manner.
Jack Bauer: Given the timing of the Michigan and Virginia incidents, I think a lot of people have picked up on this discrepancy. It appears to a lot of people that incidents of anti-Muslim bigotry appear to be getting full play in the Canadian MSM while incidents of Islamist-inspired violence are being addressed differently. I understand the impulse to throttle the discussion about the latter on grounds that such discussion tends in some cases to bring out bigoted views but democracy is all about free-wheeling discussion even if we don't like its content, isn't it? In any case, apparent censorship is likely to have an effect exactly opposite to that intended because it substantiates the view held by some (many?) that the playing field is being tilted in one direction on grounds of favoritism or, worse, on grounds of a hidden agenda. Nothing contributes to conspiracy theories more than perceived (or real) censorship.
“They [Muslim Leaders] need to trust they won’t be scapegoated. If that trust isn’t there, the information [on potential terrorists & terror acts] isn’t coming.” ..........................................................................................................................................................................................  This bandwagon academic argument suggests that the concern of Muslim leaders for terrorism is not strong: they will provide vital information only on a quid pro quo basis.  And the quid will grow exponentially with the growth of their population base.
Multiculturalism should not mean that we (the West) tolerate another culture's intolerance.  If we do in fact support diversity, woman's rights, and gay rights , then we cannot in good conscience give Islam a free pass on the grounds of multicultural sensitivity.   And we need to say unambiguously to Muslims living in the West: If you want to live in our societies, to share in their material benefits, then you need to accept that our freedoms are not optional. They are the foundation of our way of life; of our civilization – a civilization that learned, slowly and painfully, not to burn heretics, but to honor them.
Think Does it really make sense to found a Jewish nation surrounded by their enemies, Muslims and Arabs?
Not so sure, I think Islam will give China a run for its money re dominance.  Either way, not looking good for modernity, of which females have been main beneficiaries.
But for Islam, those soldiers and guards would not be called out . Yet we are supposed to believe Islam has nothing to do with it.   Big Taqiiyya is alive and well.
The original story on this matter was more clear and less shrill.  The insane man was ranting and raving but not attacking.  He ranted on multiple topics finally including the Muslim clothing and Muslim behavior.  Men on the train decided to try and silence the man.  It did not turn out well.  The loss of the men is very very sad, but the media is making something out of this that it is not.  The man was very clearly deeply disturbed mentally.  Apparently, he was offensively shooting his mouth off about many things.  Perhaps he should have been institutionalized.  But it turned out to be unwise to attempt to silence the insane man who was not attacking.  It is interesting how the media wishes to turn this into one of their stereotypical anti-Trump scenarios.
where's  the  leftist/black  outrage  over  this  hate  crime  committed  by a  black  and  a  muslim  immigrant? Ignored  as  usual.  FBI opens civil rights investigation into deadly Tennessee church shooting  353 Comment   Share   Tweet   Stumble   Email Last Updated Sep 25, 2017 12:01 AM EDT  NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the church shooting that left one woman killed and several others injured in Tennessee, the agency said in a statement Sunday.  "The Memphis FBI Field Office's Nashville Resident Agency, the Civil Rights Division, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee have opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting at the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch, Tennessee," the statement said.  All  victims  were  white  I  presume.
You named 2 people out of 360,000,000+.  Not all Muslims are Islamic terrorists, but all Islamic terrorists are Muslims.
Nope.  HR 158 amends the visa WAIVER PROGRAM it does NOT ban outright "immigrants and non-immigrants" from any country.  Under HR 158, the visa and green card holders that Trump's EO blocked from entry into the US would be admitted because they've already been approved for their visas and free cards.  The Trump EO IS an outright and immediate ban on ALL people with citizenship from the Islamic 7 REGARDLESS of whether or not they have a valid US issued visa or green card.  On a personal note, I sincerely hope Putin hasn't coerced you into being a troll and that you or your loved ones aren't in any danger from him.  I am sincerely sorry if he has, but he can't be allowed to expand his dismal influence any further.  Best, -HAYKI
The original situation about an Islamic  prayer room in a high school was a matter of truancy: every Friday the teenage Muslim kids went off to Friday noon prayers at the local mosque, 2 blocks away, but wouldn't return to school. The school made necessary accommodations by adjusting the schedules to fit their prayers.  What should have been a matter of parental discipline became an uproar over religious persecution.
it's ok, not all muslims are like that.
There is a documentary on Netflix right now showing the link between Islam and Hitler . Apparently Hitler was a big admirer off Islam . There were over 22,000 Muslims in the SS and many war criminals converted to Islam after the war to carry on their war against Western civilization .
He supported Trump too. I can't imagine why would someone who yells anti-Muslim slurs would be attracted to Trump, can you?
No one is turning a blind eye to any extremism.  That's the point.  All extremism is bad, Islamic or extreme alt-right.
It is already clear that Trump is acting responsibly and wisely in his first weeks in office.  Though he is under constant and merciless assault by the staunchly liberal media, he remains set on the courses he described to the American voters.  Reading the evil media one would think that he had single-handedly  banned abortion, killed American citizens, banned Muslims and all sorts of totally false fact news.  The libs show their true colors in their massive hatred and mockery of the President and any citizen when they do not hold PC liberal views.  Thanks to God that we an independently minded person as President.  Time that the libs and their short-sighted bankrupt policies are pushed aside and some other perspectives are allowed into the driver's seat.  And yes, we Trump supporters care more about all Americans that the false face libbers.  We just see different roads to achieving maximal well-being.
probably the work of Islamists.
"...I am very Christian..."  . You're  Muslim.
The son of legendary boxer Muhammad Ali was detained for hours by immigration officials earlier this month at a Florida airport, according to a family friend.  Muhammad Ali Jr., 44, and his mother, Khalilah Camacho-Ali, the second wife of Muhammad Ali, were arriving at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Feb. 7 after returning from speaking at a Black History Month event in Montego Bay, Jamaica. They were pulled aside while going through customs because of their Arabic-sounding names, according to family friend and lawyer Chris Mancini.  Immigration officials let Camacho-Ali go after she showed them a photo of herself with her ex-husband, but her son did not have such a photo and wasn't as lucky.   Mancini said officials held and questioned Ali Jr. for nearly two hours, repeatedly asking him, "Where did you get your name from?" and "Are you Muslim?"
POTUS can't legally order a wiretap.  Taps have to be approved by Judges on the basis of evidence.  So if there were taps, Obama couldn't have had a hand in it, and presumably there was evidence supporting a warrant.  That is, IF there were taps. As for sources...Donald's seem to be his own fevered imagination.  Remember the thousands of Muslims celebrating 9/11, and the "millions" if illegal votes that were(n't) cast?
Not sure I'd go so far as to equate them to Islam and Iraq.   On a side note, my use of the p word got changed to *****. Not a big deal. Just funny to hear it from our soon to be President but it can't be printed here. But, this IS the RGs property.
Respect, elegance & class is back. Kowtow muslim bowing...is over.
That forever gone ( wannabe) decade of the 90's, when multicultural Spain was given grants to anyone ( Islamist exploiting democratic freedom,  printing leaflets in Granada - " We'r going to reconquer Al-Andalus.." -  gave Catalonia a free pass as well:  downgrade teaching of Spanish in the public educational system ( as in Quebec in the late 70's etc...):  the  wannabe, separatist Catalan ( not a majority yet...) sent/send their children to private schools where Spanish was /is taught properly ..., while programming a future of "separation," boasting that Catalan "is going to be a " world language (?) - while adoring English and looking down at the language of Cervantes ...Right. Meanwhile, a wannabe minority, savvy at misusing of power, corrupt to the marrow,   entrenched in the public service, media etc invited many immigrants Muslims to come to live in Catalonia ( Pakistanis galore...) - in exchange for their ( future) votes ...What a cynical, chi chi nightmare Catalonia has become
Muslims and liberals excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of Christianity, Europe. Israel, and America. Islam's destructive iconoclasm is destroying historic treasures across the ME,  burning churches and killing Christians. They even have Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal wars between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects, ISIS , Taliban and Al Qaeda are the root causes of most of the wars and social chaos happening around the world today. It is worse than anything expressed in the west, yet we are expected to believe it all stops as soon as they come to Canada.
Any form of racism is intolerable, but why after all these years are Muslims singled out??
Will this initiative include Muslim countries?  Islam is staunchly opposed to abortion and many Muslims will find this initiative offensive.  So is this "Islamophobic".. does that fit the definition?
And Christians love everyone even those who do not buy into their beliefs, right???    I didn't think so either...  I will certainly not defend the way Muslims treat their women,  if we want to generalise neither are Christians, but let's not generalise, many muslims are extremely nice people worthy of our trust.  Like with all beliefs it is those who interpret in order to satisfy their lust for power that are dangerous, how they brainwash the weaks, the uneducated, those who feel they deserve better in order to satisfy this need for power.
Canadian businesses need an open border.  President Trump's security measures of banning certain Islamic countries will be duplicated by our own domestic security policies or the Canada-US border will be shut to Canadians.  It's as simple as that.
Trump's Muslim terrorist travel ban included countries that sent 11 of the nineteen 9/11 hijackers to the U.S., right?  Right?  What????
The issue is terrorism.  The left-wing,  lying MSM basically gives a pass to Islamic & leftist terrorism.  They hammer, as they should, anti-Semitic right-wing terrorists.  The MSM needs to be unequivocal in their condemnation of  violent extremists,  be they Islamic, right or left wing.  Is that too much to ask?
There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that Canada will have a Muslim majority at any time.  Canada continues to be a more secular place every year.
Any idea at all on why and how Hasan and the other US born Muslims turn into deadly terrorists?   In spite of growing up in the US?   If one born here in the US can become a terrorist, how the heck can any one predict that a foreign born some of whom may have been indoctrinated to hate the US not commit an act of terrorism after gaining entry into the US?
Trump is actually blowing the old ineffective spineless globalist ways of doing politics out of the water in his first week!!  He is making practical decisions all around. Even major Union leaders spoke very highly of him!   it seems all the left has is to shout "racist!" without any facts. But they are desperately trying to paint him as a racist.  Some point to Muslim countries visa restrictions.  That is just practical for the time being. Perhaps it will force those countries to get tougher on terrorist cells now that it's THEIR problem and not the west's.  Also if Trump was trying to make a Muslim ban.... then why didn't he ban people from Indonesia? The biggest Muslim country in the world?.  Glad Trump had the courage to sign that order. Other spineless politicians would not have the guts...they are way too politically correct.
We cannot, Democrat President Obama's U.S. Aid and U.S. Assistance Package with the UA (African Union) and Entire Continent of Africa's Nations.  Both Houses of U.S. Congress, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives would have to Unanimously Vote to stop the U.S. Citizens Funding as U.S. Congressional Appropriations, you would also have the (idiots, "College Boys", "Frat Boys", "Politicals" with absolutely no experience) of the U.S. Department of State Opposed.   The Democratic Party will Oppose based on this being an Obama Action.   There is also something as a Strategic Resource at Niger, that the Muslim Nation of Iran, their Proxy Fighters like Hamas, Hezbollah, Al Quada, Holy Warriors of Islam WANT that I know of from having been at Niger before, Highest Grade Uranium Ore, you get more Uranium per ton of rock mined.
Everyone should be careful when they hurl labels at people. And that includes when they label Muslims as "misogynist." Simplistically categorizing people is an attempt to diminish them and their views. It's dehumanizing.  The proposed motion is intended to heal public wounds. We should set aside our personal feelings, at least temporarily, and support it.
Explain why the ban contains an exemption for non-muslims.  Why are you not reporting that?
Thing is... Muslims think their religious beliefs should be the law of the land. They're offended by anything non-Muslim. They think all women should dress modestly in public. They don't want you walking your dog past their house. They think fling a Canadian flag on your house is an affront to their home country. They really want sharia law in place.  It's no wonder there is a little push-back. starting to surface.... It's going to get worse.... look at the problems in England and France.
"For those who care to look into the incident a little more closely, Trump did not mock the disabled reporter."  The incident has been looked into extensively; google it and decide for yourself. Consensus is that yes, the short fingered vulgarian was 'aping' the disabled reporter. Even more interesting is why; PEOTUS was trying to provide a source for yet another of his many lies, this one the 'thousands of Muslims in N.J. cheering the fall of the WTC', and got pissed off when said disabled reported refused to play ball. Along with denying the aping, might as well deny the lying.
Where did you find that study, as looking through their own page, there is nothing at all to support your claim. There is one from August 2016, but nothing after the election... Also, how many of those were found to be perpetrated by those that reported them, as we have seen the last week that there is an inordinate amount of Muslims that are reporting violence, and being found to be false... The only accurate part of the statement is that there were, in fact, 154 confirmed anti-Muslim incidents in 2014, according to FBI crime tables. That’s up from 135 cases in 2013 and 130 in 2012, but a far cry from the total number in 2001, when the FBI investigated 481 hate crimes against Muslims.
America is a big nation and Hawaii a small state, so here is something to consider for those who think, as opposed to those who feel.  http://usajustnow.com/2017/03/25/virginia-judge-found-trumps-ban-legal-every-way/.  As Hawaii continues to squander limited taxpayer funds for causes without any long term benefit, we plainly see that our Democrats will always place their public image over taxpayer identified priorities and real national threats. The president is trying to protect us from a religion that accepts slavery: "You can enslave for sex and work" Qur’an 4:3, 4:24, 5:89, 33: 50, 58:3, 70:30", diminishes women's rights "You will need 4 Muslim male witnesses to prove a rape. Qur’an 24:"  and advocates for terrorism "You will terrorize non-Muslims. Qur’an 8:12, 8:60".  For Muslims, the Koran IS THE WORD OF GOD. The instructions contained in it have not changed over centuries. Jefferson knew the threat and dealt with it. Today, knowledge is yielding to ignorance.
What percentage of suicide bombers are Muslim?  If you had a large bowl of M&M peanuts and one of them contained enough poison to kill you, would you risk eating any of them?
The GLBT is still, and always will be in total denial of the attack.  You do not have to look far to find GLBT websites (advocate.com) with columns talking about Pulse, Resist, Trump, Hillary, tying it all to the Pulse massacre/attack, everything except Islam. The Pulse attack is also unique in the victims themselves are being politically correct to avoid the truth.  It would be as if the folks who made it out of WTC and the residents of lower Manhattan blamed the attack on pilot error, then had a memorial and held up signs to resist Bush.
Location Location Location. Other people would simply move on and get along.     but that's not the point anymore. Its not about burying the dead, but getting their way. They made a demand and lost, and now they have political leverage. Things are actually going well for the Muslims. They will probably sue the town and  win  big money.
Over a thousand women sexually harassed at Cologne's New Year party last year. Other cities in Germany it was a similar thing. There's a huge problem with migrants in Germany - we're talking problems with tens-of-thousands of migrants who do not have German/European values; they have Islamic values which are incompatible with European secular values. Hence this year there were thousands of police to protect Germans from Muslim migrants. Not all of the Muslims, of course, but there's a large number that are a problem.
I wonder why the widespread media is constantly pushing the Muslim love fest?  They have been hiding incidents that have happened to girls and women by Muslim men and boys for years, or at least downplaying incidents.  What is with the pro-Muslim movement?  And our Government is doing the same thing, and Obama was also.....why is the west doing this?
It's funny that there the author never bothers to explain the anti-Jewish rhetoric found in the Qur'an, and goes on to explain that the Ahadith filled with hatred for Jews are "alleged" sayings of the Prophet. I think Muslims need to introspect and examine their own canonical texts, starting with the Qur'an, and then do some writing and discourse on such topics. Merely blaming some preachers whose views find ample support within your own holy book is not the way to go. And thank you for reminding us that MEMRI is "pro-Israeli".
my African Canadian friend said the same thing.  My irish friend didn't agree.  I talked to a muslim who said it wasn't great but no big deal
Actually it doesn't require any taxpayer dollars to accommodate as there are unused rooms in the school. And since there are 100's of thousands of Canadian born Muslims, this has nothing todo with immigration.  And of course demanding changes would never occur to you. Sunday's are already off and Christmas and Easter are already stat holidays.
>>Every single one,   Right... and   >>the Orthodox Patriarch resided there for hundreds of years afterwards.  . And Hagia Sophia remained a church... too, Right? . How many Muslim in said countries now? And how many non-Muslims left in Muslim territories since onset of the Religion of Pieces ( not misspelled)?  What is the word for a  'black person' in Arabic? Abd (slave)? And 'Kafir'? Please do tell us more about history?
"We must ... act on our shared responsibility to protect the vulnerable Muslim population that is being preyed upon by its own government. And what does that mean for Canada in concrete terms? It means forming a coalition of like-minded states drawn from all the world's regions to demand that Ms. Suu Kyi end the Myanmar military's rampage. It means calling for accountability for those in Myanmar who have committed crimes against humanity. It means mobilizing global public opinion to put pressure on the UN Security Council, where China and Russia are already standing in the way of any sensible discussion, to take measures that will end the violence."   Wow that will fix it for sure..............
What I would give to be voting for Kasich, Rubio, or Bush, but I can't.  Instead Trump is what the GOP has allowed to slither its way to the top of the ticket.  They're sorry now, but it's too late.  I don't know what might have been possible way back when, during the primaries, but how did we get here?  Can anybody supporting him honestly believe he would be good for our country?  He will never keep any of his promises.  Most of them he couldn't even if he wanted to. Like building that fantasy wall?  Jailing his opponent?  Rounding up and moving all the Muslims out?  Respecting and Protecting women's rights?  (That one is Iaughable).  His so called "new trade policy" that will bring all the jobs back is utter nonsense.  Yet millions support him still.  Donald Trump has truly violated the entire country and forever damaged the moral fabric of our society.  I can't even express how much I despise him for this.
Watching your own reactions and calming your own negative reactions is the only thing that will deradicalize anyone.  For example, some people blow their gasket when they see a woman all dressed head to toe in black or brown, wearing a complex folded head-covering that just lets the face show.  They should relax. Relax! That's just a Carmelite nun!  Relax! Be happy! Smile at the nun! Smile at the Muslim woman who just wants to feel good about herself! Smile! Laugh and make everyone feel at home!  Santa Claus is real! He lives in everyone's heart and all we have to do is let the generosity of spirit out! Ho! Ho! Ho!
He said Muslims in Canada and I would say in the West in general. He is not alone in asking the question. Some Muslim scholars are asking the same questions. They want the Wests liberalism to protect them against Islamaphobia but see liberalism as the enemy when it comes to LGBT rights, sex education in the classroom, gender equality and a secular state. If it becomes a power struggle, it appears the Trumps, Putins, LePens and other populists leaders yet to emerge will be the victors. A moderate Muslim leadership that revises the religion to the realities of the West and a modern multicultural state is key.
As I said, it won't come from Muslims, but others who use Muslims to support their own cause.
Why all the media coverage on this story ? The guy broke the law and must be held accountable. He never came forward all these years to become a citizen. He deceived the community. I suppose that we will not be hearing from Doug Chin as Mr. Magana Ortiz is not a muslim.
Muslims and liberals excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of Christianity, Europe. Israel, and America.  Islam's destructive iconoclasm is destroying historic treasures across the ME:  in just one  year Notre Dame in Paris has had three close call bomb threats.  They even have Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal wars between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects, ISIS , Taliban and Al Qaeda are the root causes of most of the wars and social chaos happening around the world today. It is worse than anything expressed in the west, even by Trump
What a bunch of HOGWASH!  Do you know the facts or are you relying on main stream left wing propaganda for your info?  The Muslim people have been coming in at a rate of about 40 to 1, and leaving Christians out by the droves.  If we're going to admit refugees, lets not further persecute the Christians by 'playing favorites'.......shall we?  It would be so refreshing to see SOMEONE get the facts straight and tell the WHOLE STORY for a change!
I did ask that question ... and answered it in my very next sentence:  "There are lots of places you can have a debate about Islam. It happens on almost every article on terrorism. I'm not a big fan of Islam myself, but I tend to stay away from those discussions online because of the displays of bigotry, intolerance and hatred (already mentioned) they attract."  And, uh ... you *were* the one who used the word 'racist.' And then you snapped off a one-liner "as if Islam is a race." It's like you're insulting yourself. Lol.
"The familiar becomes the normal, which becomes, by default, the acceptable way of doing things."  The "normalcy bias" is like an opioid drug in the United States of Amnesia.  We have been living in a broken democratic system of government which had been a slow erosion process until the Patriot Act and Citizens United decision. The loss of civil liberties and political representatives that are beholden to those who control the wealth and not the people who elected them - has become the accepted status quo.  Ironic amnesia is that the #1 reason of losing our civil liberties was because of fear of Muslim religious terrorists, and now #1 issue is not to discriminate against members of this religion.  What a country and what times we live in!  Mr. Milner, you are a true journalist and we salute you. Thank you.
Man this is a long whinge.  As others have pointed out, it is immigrant Muslim communities who distance themselves from the rest of society in many countries.  " ........ there is an urgent need for a new world view of how communities view one another."  Yep, starting with those that attempt to shut themselves off.  It is rather difficult to take a more positive view in such circumstances.
All the fundamental faith Muslims disapprove of our culture. And there is a pool of thousands who consider attacking innocent Non-Muslims. Only those Muslims who give a hoot about their religion should be allowed to remain in US.
Well, let's see: what party was the president from who tried to impose his liberal, secular, atheistic, humanistic views on the Catholic Church?  What party of the two parties tends to trample religious rights--except of course when it comes to Muslims?  (The Democrats love Muslims) It certainly isn't the Republican party. It is not the fault of the Catholic bishops that they support religious freedom while the Democratic party does not.   The Democratic Party is obsessed with abortion--so---that makes them the party of death.  Suppose we had a president who supports slavery, but otherwise wants to help the poor, and do everything else you claim the Democrats do. Would you say "Well, yes he supports slavery, but look at all the poor he wants to help! We should support him!"    Same logic: abortion is fundamental.  When the Democrats support the destruction of innocent human under the guide of women's rights and "choice" the rest of the good they stand for is irrelevant.
"Consider two rabid dogs fighting ..."  Yes, Shiite Muslims and Sunni Muslims have a long history of fighting each other, each side building up resentments in a feud that goes back to the beginnings of Islam. But, comparing Muslims to dogs? Feel free to attack me for being too sensitive, but I find the comparison disgusting. It was not that long ago in this country when restaurants and other shops had signs on their doors saying "No dogs or n-----s [blacks] allowed" or "No dogs or Mexicans allowed". Legitimate arguments can be made that maybe the US ought to let people in the Middle East fight it out amongst themselves and not pick sides, but let us at least recognize it is "people" who are doing the fighting.
Mocanic, it is a flat-out lie that Gary Johnson "couldn't even name a world leader".  He simply could not name a world leader WHOM HE ADMIRED, as a good libertarian would NOT admire anyone who is fostering the growth of statism and authoritarianism, as every current world "leader" seems bent on doing (and as an aside, why is this the worldwide trend, with essentially no exceptions)?  You may as well ask a Mormon to name their favorite brand of coffee, or a Muslim to name their favorite liquor.
The RCMP released a report that defined what a hate crime is and isn't. In order for something to be labelled a hate crime , an actual crime has to have occurred. Calling someone a name is not a crime . It's rude and can be labelled a hate incident but it is not a crime. The difference between cemetery stones in a Jewish cemetery being vandalized and a Muslim being called a name is that one is a hate crime and the other is a hate incident. Unless the authorities released a defined list of actions I would review all discussions with a grain of salt , and so should you.
"Of course Muslim women feel apprehensive going outside "  It isn't "Muslim women", it is the small minority of islamists, wahhabists, who wear the face covering.   Most Muslim women do not even wear the hijab, never mind the face covering.  Some people are nasty to smokers, too, that is not a reason not to ban smoking in all kinds of places.
Yep, just a matter of a few years before western women adopt the notion that showing anything but face, hands and feet is "immodest". We'll wonder how they could ever have been so immoral as to wear clothing that bared their legs, arms, shoulders, hair...  But there is hope. Those leggings aren't hiding the woman's shape after all, and neither do those body-hugging tunics, and the tons of makeup certainly do not abide by the intent to "hide your beauty", so some of those fashions are in fact subtly subverting the intent of the religious prescriptions. Muslim women are rebelling against their intent, which is to make them less attractive to men.  What it does show as well though is that Islam is quite compatible with consumer culture. The importance of status, showing off one's wealth through designer clothes, bags, etc. is quite obvious.
Easy for you to say. You probably don't face discrimination and hateful behaviour like many Muslims do.
Hmm America propaganda have washed our mind clean.  Trump announced his singular foreign policy agenda is to 'wipe Islamic radicals off the face of the Earth'. Did you listen to his inauguration speech? He therefore continue American holy war with revised energy, a war of annihilation.  America holy war started as it used Islamic insurgents as proxy fighters to fight the USSR in Afghanistan in the 1980's. It recruited, trained, financed and supported them with advanced weapons. One such leader is called Osama bin Ladin, a valued CIA asset. This strategy worked so well it contributed much to USSR collapse. The CIA and Pentagon proceeded to adopt the strategy to spread insurgencies, civil wars and overthrow governments. The insurgencies in Oman, Libya and Syria are copies of this strategy - used Islamic terror fighters as proxies to overthrow governments. But along the way the CIA lost control resulting in terror blowback in Europe and U.S. Reasons: double-cross and incompetence.
I think that any real healing will have to involve much more than managing Trump.   I have read numerous accounts of people being harassed and intimidated.  Terri posted on her wall that her son has told her that people in her son's neighborhood are burning rainbow flags, as they are hanging on people's houses.  In Queens,  a Black woman was told to go to the back of the  bus.  One of my Muslim friends told me that she is telling her children not to talk to anyone at all about the election, because she is so worried that they may be attacked.  These are just a few examples of stuff that is happening.  When behavior like this is going on, this indicates a very, very serious problem.  That problem needs to be recognized and addressed before there can be any healing.
Definition of Phobia : An overwhelming and irrational fear something.  Definition of Islam: A monotheistic belief system regarded as having been revealed by a person called Muhammad who proclaimed him self to be the prophet of Allah, the Arabic name of the Abrahamic god.  Definition of a Muslim: one who is a follower of the Islamic belief system.  First one has to prove that the condition called “ Islamophobia” even exists.  We can prove that cases of Arachnophobia, Acrophobia, Claustrophobia exist...we approach such cases with understanding and compassion...we do not hurl abuse at sufferers and pass laws forbidding them.  If  sufferers of the condition “Islamophobia” actually do exist, then they also deserve compassion and understanding....I , of course, do not believe that such a condition does exist, that it is , in fact, a politically loaded artificial and contrived term and I refuse to use it or recognize it.
The parliament of the Chechen Republic has passed a bill allowing schoolchildren to dress according to their religious beliefs, meaning the female Muslim hijab headscarf will be permitted in local schools. The bill reads that all educational establishments in Chechnya must consider the students’ right to wear clothes or symbols required by their religion or national traditions, provided this does not contradict federal laws and does not harm the children’s health. Glad to read Comrade Putin is on board with this issue!
Such a tired argument, especially considering  a couple dozen "so called moderate muslims" were killed in this attack. But for starters, a bunch of people in Muslim Turkey, including their Muslim PM and President, spoke up. If you really need help taking your head out the sand, I'll handhold you to search facebook for "muslims against" and see what comes up.
I strongly suggest you hold town meetings on all Island before you institute such a policy. The local tell Main Lands folks to go home on an on going basics.  We are american citizens we are at home in all fifty states. I love having Muslims here, because I love the constitution and especially the Statue of Liberty. We are a country of immigrants, the only Natives are American Indians.  You need to get Hawaiians and the rich people you cater to on board with your idea.
I read it on twitter....Islamocrats.
Go to http://www.snopes.com/president-obama-ban-muslims-2011/.  Happy to help.
Yeah, KeepCalm, you are just wrong. When two people are drunk as skunks they don't know what they are doing.  So, it really shouldn't even be called rape in these instances.  As they say, in Islam, you get stoned when you commit adultery, but in Canada you commit adultery when you get stoned.
No MG-TD. An attack by Muslims was to be expected since Canada had attacked Muslims. What more appropriate place to attack then the home of government of the country which had attacked Muslims. Similarly for 9 11 and the US financial and military heart.
Do you think the "NEW" Treason Party will hold hearings in this?                                                                  Why are we allowing the "NEW" Treason Party to place political correctness above our Constitution and our NATIONAL SECURITY? Isn’t it made very clear in the Preamble of our Constitution and Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 BOTH stating “provide for common defense” of this nation?  Who is the Treason Party you ask!    It is the entire Democrat Party, the Muslim Brotherhood’s own political party, the benign-sounding U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations and the RINO/GOP leadership/followers in the soon to be defunct Republican Party!
Believe it or not, I had sociology in high school.  Needed a filler course.  I will let you guess what I thought of it.  From your wording, I think you get my point. I also take it you are ignoring what has and is happening to Arabs, and obvious Muslims, Latinos, especially in some parts of the southwest?   Are they not also facing some of these same problems?  Do we have to start a separate "Lives Matter" group for each of them?  If so, why?   I also thought you would have appreciated the word, inclusive.
in fact I bet there were liberals in the WTC in 911 here or of having relatives and/or friends lost in that terror attack. They'll react and respond the Muslim/Islamic Faith had nothin to do with it! Yikes! It is no different than the Liberal Democrat inferring there is no difference between a "legal" and "illegal" migrant in the US. We can all play that game if you will and want to look at it that way.
Arabs gave the world the number system. Jews expelled from Spain for working with Muslim Moors. Muslim world took in these Jews Sephardic and they settled in North Africa and Turkey. Muslim religion Jewish religion very close in many ideas both from Mid east Arabia.
Hebdo was lauded for mocking muslims. Not so mocking white people. For the crime of mocking white Americans, vehement scorn for Charlie Hedbo was commonplace yesterday. “An evil, despicable cover,” opined National Review’s Tiana Lowe, who nonetheless added that “the losers at Charlie Hebdo have a God-given right to publish it.” Infowars’ Paul Joseph Watson, long a fan of Charlie Hebdo’s anti-Muslim cartoons and an advocate of the duty to re-publish their content, yesterday announced that, actually, one may hate and denounce their cartoons while still supporting their free speech rights: “The Charlie Hebdo cover is offensive & dumb, and I fully support their right to be as offensive & dumb as they like.” The right-wing actor James Woods announced: “So much for ‘Je Suis Charlie,’ I guess,” calling the cartoonists “French traitors” in a hastag he added. National Review’s Byron York, showing a picture of the new cover, was similarly candid: “Today, we are not all Charlie Hebdo.”
Many scholars from around the world have agreed that Aisha was 6 years of age when she married Muhhamad, and why couldn't you counter attack my statements about Islamists killings thousands of innocent gay men and women? You think as if people are going to round up Muslims and kill them when in reality the American people will absolutely not let that happen. We just have to be more careful because there are many Muslim groups out there that absolutely hate Americans no matter their political or religious views and will do everything in there power to attack innocent American citizens.
but at least they've never tried to force me to practice it --- they do now: Cheer team at my girl's school had to change outfits to long sleeve top and leggings under the skirt to accommodate observant Islamic girls.
I am finding it difficult to say the word "Muslims" without adding the F expletive before it.  I think I am not alone.  Christopher Hitchens was the voice of absolute truth when he wrote "God is Not Great --  How Religion Poisons Everything" and it seems that Islam is bent on proving this.
"At first, scientists concluded that Christian and Muslim children were less likely to share than those who were non-religious. But a re-evaluation of the data found the variation was influenced more by what country the children lived in. "  I couldn't let this tidbit pass by without notice. One really has to wonder how good much of this research is, especially in a soft science like psychology. We are in a time of unprecedented egalitarianism and heightened concern for others, but how much of it is genuine?   Yes, many people feel good when they give, but that good feeling could just as easily be the self-satisfaction of the smug rather than altruism.
"...given discriminatory gender practices in some Muslim cultures. " I think you meant to say in every single one of the world's 57 Muslim majority countries, didn't you?
Because I should be willing to give up my basic freedoms so as not to upset radical Muslims?  Nope, will not do.
Sad waste of Hawaii taxpayer monies.   There was no need for AG Chin to initiate this lawsuit as there would have been others who were going to file anyway. Just grandstanding is all this is.  The claim that this temporary restriction of muslims coming from the six identified countries would hurt tourism and the University is laughable.
There are too many posts where reality is not what's being commented on.  Too many posts that are knowingly taking a travel suspension of 90 days from a few countries in the middle east that either don't have a central government or can provide even minimal information on their citizens and turning that into the end of  freedom. Too many of the same people taking the time to vote in a negative and predictable manner based on whether the comment is favorable to the author or not. And I'm not even a Trump supporter.   Kafkaland.??  Muslims are far safer in the U.S. than in Canada and this author and the posters are obsessed with America taking 90 days to control its borders.
Left? What left are you talking about? Can you give a historical example of a "leftist" group in the U.S. and how it was more racist than the current Republican party is? Since the crime that Americans are most concerned with has to do with violent crimes and since neither legal nor illegal immigrants are responsible for the majority of violent crimes in the U.S.--U.S. citizens are--and since violent crimes have dropped sharply in the last 25 years, it's safe to say that Republicans have used and are currently using the issue of supposed immigrant crime to distract, divide, and racially "cleanse" America. Trump's immigration ban for example is unconstitutional because it targets Muslims, a group that is undergoing the process of racialization in America.  Definition of racialization :the act or process of imbuing a person/s with a consciousness of race distinctions or of giving a racial character to something or making it serve racist ends. Merriam-Webster
Premier Philippe Couillard has in the past always been very kind, supportive and protective of the muslim community in Quebec. But even he sees that fighting extremism requires more than inviting neighbours over for dinner.  “You cannot disconnect this type of event, terrorism, from Islam in general,” Mr. Couillard said. “I think President [Emmanuel] Macron yesterday was very eloquent about this when addressing the Muslim community in France. He told them it’s also your responsibility to act on the theological front to explain to your people that this is not part of the religion, that it’s contrary to the teachings of the religion.”  https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-premier-couillard-in-change-of-tone-ties-michigan-attack-to-islam/article35441387/
sexist and racist nonsense.  thats the same logic the alt right uses to associate terrorism with islam.   the proud boys , bannon and co., and a few cranks in austin are the anecdotes that define white males? are 3 anecdotes on false rape accusations enough to make a case that all women who report rape are suspect?  maybe its just the fuzzy logic evident in white females, who, by the way,  dont come home in body bags. its the white boys (including those proud boys) who come home in bodybags. its time for white women to walk the walk on equality on the battlefield as well in the office. hup two, three, four ladies!
First of all,Timothy wasn't a Christian; never claimed to be, didn't do it in the name of God. Second, Give me some names of Christian bombers or terror groups that have been carrying out attacks. Third, I don't know what church you go to, but mine and all that were a part of it throughout the US held a day of prayer immediately after. Let's also not forget Bill Graham and his sermon/prayer immediately after which I'm sure if you wanted to put some time in, you'd be able to find on youtube or a simple google search.  Sorry wygent, I simply disagree, and last I looked, the organization who claims to be the voice for Muslims in the USA (CAIR) has yet to release a statement or press release. I realize that not all Muslims are bad, but when you have 25% in our nation who justify violence in the name of Jihad, that's a huge problem.  In WWII not all Germans were bad, but that small percentage of Nazis ran over Europe for 5 + years. Have a good one. :)
There was an African American Church in N.C. spray painted w/ "Trump" and burned to the ground  right after the election....It was marked & set fire by a liberal to make Pres. Trumps election look evil. An anti-Semite attack in New York after the election was attributed to a liberal woman who wanted to prove electing Pres. Trump was a bad, racist idea. The attacks and murders on Jewish people in Europe are often from the  Muslim community. There was an attack on a Muslim business right here in Anchorage after 9/11 and we found out it was the Muslim business owner that trashed his own shop (Mr. Maad) SO......yeah, a spike in hate crimes against Jewish people could be coming from a lot of different places, hopefully this is a crime that can be solved and then we will know.
Islamophobia is perfectly understandable, even justifiable. Why? Four reasons: 1. While many Muslims are nice people, invite 20 million to come here, and Canada will be a Muslim society with a Muslim government. Some Canadians are asking themselves: Do we want to live in a society similar to those in the Middle East? Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for the introduction of Sharia law. 2. The violent conflicts between Muslim groups in the Middle East are well known. Do we want to import those conflicts into Canada? 3. Many Canadians from Europe are familiar with the history of the "white slave trade". Between 1600 and 1830, 2.6 million white girls and boys were kidnapped and sold in the Middle East slave markets to serve as labourers, domestics and sex slaves in harems. The Barbary pirates in North Africa sailed as far north as Ireland & Iceland to kidnap white children. (continued below)
British Muslims have to choices: step up their game and report potential extremists or become pariahs within their own country.
True and the same goes with headscarves. Its not  religious requirement  but a cultural choice. Simple otherwise there would be no Muslim woman that don't wear them and clearly there are.
Why shouldn't it be linked to religious freedom?  Islam permits polygamy.  Christianity and Islam permit slavery.  The defence of "religious freedom' has been used to discriminate against same-sex couples, deny pregnant women of a full suite of health services (i.e. contraception and abortion).  So why should we not recognize the religious freedom defence for Mormons?  The simple answer should be that religious freedom doesn't supersede the rights of others.  In the pecking order of freedoms, it should come last.
Trump appears to strongly admire pure power. The power to arrest and murder opponents and perceived enemies on whim must seem intoxicatingly appealing to Trump. While he is trying to make it easier to sue reporters and critical media sources, just arresting and jailing them would be far simpler would it not? And "carpet bombing" muslim enemies was part of his campaign promises. Trump's privately owned business is not a democracy, so constraints on his executive power must be very frustrating.
British papers reported this old couple took in "Syrian refugees," but that juicy tidbit was filtered out of this article, for obvious reasons.  Had the men arrested been white, it would be prominently on the headline. You can tell they were non-white and Muslim because their demographic is scrubbed from the article and known external information omitted.  The media want to herd us and tell us what values to take on.
Looks like this discussion went way off the rails. The Author was stating her own, and her family's, reaction to the election. By almost any standards, it was a hateful election cycle and like many parents, she was looking for a way to help her children understand how such a person could have been elected (for all the reasons that at least one person here described). I  am often reminded of the song from South Pacific:  "You have to be taught to hate and fear; you have to be taught year after year; ..... you have to be carefully taught".   For our part, we recently attended a wonderful interfaith (Catholic, Muslim, Jewish) discussion in Lexington, KY where the motto with the halo was used in both English and Arabic. I didn't realize that the idea/art work originated in Lexington; nice to know! Not lecturing, but certainly hoping and praying that we can all unlearn the hate and fear that is so prevalent in our society.  We are all God's children; surely we can learn to act that way.
If you see how many Muslims have been killed by Westerners, the number does run into the millions. For example, the French killed over 1 million Algerians in the 1950s and 1960s.
You do realize many of our fallen were Democrats and Liberals. Right? You know there are Muslim American soldiers buried in Arlington. Right? Have some respect. It shouldn't be political.
Better relations with Russia should be a top priority, we may not agree on everything but where we do, we can work together for the good of the world community.  If we want to have any hope of wiping out islamic extremism, we'll need Russian help to do it. It's no different than when we needed their help to rid the world of Hitler, together almost any challenge can be overcome.
Defenders of Islamic culture such as this columnist typically attempt to obfuscate, and blame anti-Islamic reactions on 'xenophobia' when this is as far from the truth as it gets.   Westerners are not reacting to race or language or the colour of one's skin with Islam, no, it's the very philosophy itself of Islam found in the Quran - Mohammed's own writings. It's the crushing misogynist nature of Islamic culture, and the blatant denigration of unbelievers, the actual slaying of the unbelievers that's promoted by Mohammed's Quran - instructions which can also be very easily interpreted by any Islamic reader. It's black and white.  And the problem is . . . .westerners see these instructions being carried out by Islamic fundamentalists not only upon westerners, but upon Islam's own peoples on a daily basis in Islamic countries. And, it has been going on for centuries.  So, please do tell those of us in the west how this 'kindness' approach has been working out for Islam in Islamic lands?
>>Duke Charles Martel >>Are you a muslim Alceste? . To that question, Alceste has a canned answer - "Are you a White Supremacist?".. or "At least I am not a White Supremacist?" Either way - it is pretty telling how he feels about himself. And what does he equates being Muslim with. Now, to the apprentice who would be given the task of "censoring" this post - read twice.. Just because there are some words in it that may scare you into censorship, there is nothing offensive, or false in it, it is based on actual posts ( go search your database).
Maybe you should read up on your own world history, especially in regards to Christianity, as if it's is sooo much better right? Killing each other, the Crusades; "Oh wait, that was the past we don't do that anymore" Oh really. For a while there US weapon manufacturers were inscribing bible passages on military weapons. Probably still do. There is a great lot of Christians who need to stop portraying themselves as saints, when they are far from it. I'd rather surround myself with a hundred Muslims than with the same number of fundamentalist or evangelical Christians. Their attitude of we're right and you will always be wrong, is just arrogant, egotistical balderdash.
Note that it is Christians who are killing abortion providers.  But I'm sure you realize that those Christians don't represent the majority just as Islamic terrorists don't represent all Muslims, right?
Between apologizing for all generational misdeeds of the white man, meeting with Muslims in mosques and catering incessantly to LGBT, our man Trudeau seems to have a full agenda. Maybe in year two he'll make some time for the average Canadian who has bills and taxes to pay.
I guess it fascinates me that the Germans, who had fought two wars with Canada, were allowed in at all. After all, none of these Islamic countries in question has really fought a war with Canada.   PS - I am not a Muslim -  I am liberal and against Islamophobia
"why the left supports radical islam" I'm looking for evidence that your broadly worded claim is based on reality.
How about the rights of the people who will be affected by the cemetary, lower property values, increased traffic and loss of future tax revenue for the town. The Muslim community would be served better if they concentrated on the various violations of the Charter within their own religion.
The real agenda and NWO is going to be an alliance between Russia and the U.S. to destroy their common enemy of Muslim radicalism and Communist China's strident world imperialism and polluter of the entire planet. 'Little potatoes' and their shiny pony entourages will be crushed if they try to hide in the middle!
No, you didn't answer my question, Martel.    I asked WHY you chose the name, and you answered with who he was.  That didn't answer it, so I asked why, more specifically.  You didn't answer at all.  Even so, here's the answer to your new question: In 732, it was the moors of Spain attempting to control lands further north.  Martel also took land in offensive wars against other 'Christian' territories, including Bavaria, Alemannia, and Frisia.  And now you can finally answer my question: Did you chose his name for yourself because you're calling for another war against muslims?
This is not praying "on their own time." Christians will bow their heads and pray. Muslims require a whole ritual (prayer mats, segregation, washing up in bathrooms)- and it has to be at exactly the right time of day - whether that cuts into every other program at the school and is costing the school board millions of dollars in resources is something of no concern to Muslims. There is not enough space to even give French its own classroom in most schools in Ontario - yet there is room for Islamic prayer?
I don't agree, Elagabalus. It is what we want to believe. But I think the Christian support for Assad is based on their calculated perception of the own well being. They anticipate that is the moderate rebels win, they will become the  victims of the tyranny of the majority in a Muslim state. (Fuller reply below "Not necessarily, Gay.")
A little while ago I found out this Khan guy is a muslim brotherhood agent.
The Muslim community of Virginia should do itself and its country a favour by supporting Trump's immigration policies. In fact, they should exhort the mango mussolini to deport all illegal aliens.
Did you check the other 54 states in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which has 57 member states? Why focus on only 3 states? Even if these 3 states do not restrict it to believers, it does not mean it is acceptable in practice.
Omg he's probably not even a Muslim. Sorry. Not buying it.
Sorry, but we are a sanctuary state  but have not declared it as such.   The practice of sheltering illegals on the sly has been going on for over 20 years but since Trump became President, it has been coming to the surface.  One example is the state AG's involvement in joining in the legal challenge against the temporary halt of muslim travelers from certain muslim countries.
Look, I am not a Trump fan, but Ibittson needs to take a pill and relax.  Misspelling  "peace".  Islamic vs Islamist.  And the shocking unconfirmed secret that the leaked intelligence about ISIS and laptops came from Israel.  Surely you can do better than that.  And how, exactly, is he a "rogue" president.  He campaigned on terminating the Trans Pacific Trade deal and NAFTA, got elected, and now he is doing it.  How is that rogue?  There is lots about the guy that causes me to shake my head and wonder how he ever got elected.  But the media, including Ibittson, needs to chill out a bit.  When candidates campaign on a set of ideas, get elected, and then proceed to implement their promises, that is democracy at work.  Get over it.
While Muslims excoriate us about supposed Islamophobia, we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, Judeophobia and antisemitism, , Christophbia, Europhobia, Americanophobia, democraceaophobia,  iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal  wars of extermination between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects are the reason for all the war and fighting all across  Islamic middle east. and are worse than anything expressed in the west, even by Trump
The Enemy remains terrorism be it home grown, ISIS inspired, using guns in Orlando, bombs in Oklahoma, City or aircraft in New York. When we separate our gays, Muslims, preschool victims, and rich people at the World Trade Center from the rest of America they win and we lose. Terrorist use violence and fear to fragment our society, and we play into their hands when we distinguish one group of our people from another.
It has everything to do with sharia blasphemy laws!  Try criticizing islam if M103 passes and see what happens to you!  Wake up!
Question.  Was anything posted on her FB page untrue?  Based on what  'Michelle Theriault Boots' said is in this article?    Demboski posted a "link" to an article written by "others" which made claims!  Perhaps those claims are wrong, perhaps they are correct but the fact remains, as Demboski said later, "she should be able to broach the subject without being "afraid to be attacked because we dared bring it up," .  This is what open discussion is all about.  This is not, touchy/feely, PC, babble.  This is 1st Amendment protected speech.  Jones is a member.  The organization has enclaves.  Their 'stated' motives are Constitutional and wonderful.    However if it is Islamophobic to understand the "FACT" that every terrorist attack, around the World since Jimmy Carter was perpetrated by people claiming to be Muslim, then there are a whole lot of Islamophobic people!  Until the peaceful Islamic World openly denounces and puts a stop to terrorism, suspicion and questions will be real.
Religious accommodation is the right of all people under Canadian law. Other religions are also accommodated - an entire religious school system is funded with public money for Heaven's sake - and Friday prayers generally happen during lunch hours or after-school.   Any class time missed by Muslim kids due to Friday prayers is not a burden on the staff or people of other faiths. It's a self-inflicted burden which all Muslim kids recognize must be addressed by their own efforts to learn any portions of a lesson they may have missed.
Sisi is an unfortunate fate visited on Egypt.  The Muslim Brotherhood was less than ideal, but they were democratically elected and not in the habit of arresting thousands of their political opponents and executing them.  The military coup that put Sisi in power was a huge step back for democracy in the ME.
Although the founders were careful to omit direct reference to Christ, it's clear that the US became a great nation for the next 200 or so years based on Judaeo-Christian principles. You can't name a Catholic/Muslim/atheist country that's done nearly as well during the same period. Of course, it's all going to heck in a handbasket now...
kag - thanks for pointing out that large families are not exclusive to Islam. My point was that large families are necessary in countries with low income and agrarian societies where free labour is necessary to maintain farms and livestock. This also goes hand in hand with low education and inequality for women. This issues are not specific to muslim nations and appear throughout much of the third world.
MP Khalid has had more than her alloted 15 minutes of fame over this and it has now become cynical, tiresome political grandstanding.  Until so-called "moderate" Muslims publicly condemn and disavow the Prophet's exhortation to destroy all infidels, there's nothing to talk about; except perhaps the banning of a hate organization.
The rose-coloured glasses are on the left.  It's a numbers game alright - get enough people in Canada who sincerely believe a Muslim society is superior to ours, and my freedoms are in peril. And I should just shrug that off? No.
Problem is there is a confusion between Islam (the religion)  and Islamism (the political militant ideology)  and it is up to moderate Muslims to clarify this to "my Canada"  So far they are not doing a good job
Alceste  ...  !) I don't think muslim high school students should be threatened in any way.      2) If there are "lots of Mulims doing that", there needs to be more and more importantly, leaders in the community who have a voice in media.
Kudos to the Post for juxtaposing two editorials on religious liberty.    In the cake case, the editorial argues that the cake artist shouldn't be forced to contribute to an activity that violates his conscience.   In the school case, the Post argues that tax-payers should be forced to contribute to activities that violate their conscience.   The vouchers the Post want could go to Muslim madrasas that teach Sharia law, for example, which would likely violate the conscience of many.  Surely, excluding Muslim schools from a voucher program would be the kind of unconstitutional bigotry the Post has long railed against. Contributing to "Christian" school that teach bigotry and discrimination would violate the conscience of many tax-payers also.  Will the vouchers be conditioned on the school teaching the "proper" moral values? This has less to do with respecting conscience and more to do with undermining public schools and cutting teachers' incomes.
Islam triumphant. yeah,  Oh boy.   Liberals, feminist, natives, LGBT  and socialists will love that.
Duke.. ">>Are you a muslim Alceste?" . Alceste >> Are you a White Supremacist...  . @Alceste So you equate being a Muslim with extremism ('White Supremacist')? . I do remember you called me a 'White Supremacist' a year ago - in response to a similar question?
So here is some real education for you:-  The world's largest Christian country (USA), by population, only has Christian festivals as public holidays.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_the_United_States  The world's largest Muslim country (Indonesia), by population, has Muslim, Hindu, Christian and Buddhist festivals as public holidays.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Indonesia
No, once again I made no attack upon the Koran. Someone asked what was the source of Sharia Law and I simply replied "the Koran." I made no other comment.
A few facts to help you understand this story.  There are approx 20 Muslim majority countries in the world and many others with significant Muslim populations.  Trump picked the six that were on Obama's visa exemption exclusion list. The Obama Gov had already vetted the Muslim world for terrorist threat in the creation of this list.  Trump has furthered Obama's agenda with a temporary suspension of all people visiting from those countries, regardless of religion, race or culture.
The issues raised in this article aside, Jesus most definitely did not participate in assisted suicide. There is a difference between taking a moral stance that puts one's life at risk and deliberately seeking death.  The Christian concept of martyrdom (as opposed to the perverse Islamist concept) is that one reluctantly accepts death if there is no conscientious way to avoid it. That's what Jesus did.  "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me ..." Those are not the words of somebody looking for a way to die.
Pope Francis did not say there were no Muslim terrorists. He said that there was no such thing as "Muslim terrorism".  Global warming is a fact.
How do you "vet" someone from a country whose gov't is in chaos, and what records (reliable) do you use to "vet" them?  Vetting of anyone from these countries is a joke and people with common sense know it!  Meanwhile our own gov't is paying groups including Christian groups to take these people under their care.    You can get statistics anywhere:  Here is another one: Ludger Woessmann, a professor of economics at the University of Munich, tells German magazine Zeit 65 percent of Syrian refugees fail to meet international standards on basic reading and writing skills. Just 10 percent of the one million arrivals in the country this year have a college degree, which may force unemployment rates and demand for social welfare to rapidly go up.  Read more: http://dailycaller.com/2015/12/08/65-percent-of-syrian-refugees-cant-read-and-write-join-workforce/#ixzz4ed87JdfT  Muslim is not a "race."  Muslim is a religion/political system (see Sharia Law) ,
#2: might be correct, OldBannister, but not important. U.S. post-election analysis shows that the poor or underprivileged did NOT elect Trump.  They voted in big numbers for Clinton, instead.   The midde- and lower-middle class America did it for Trump.  Among Trump's biggest supporters: 54% of college educated white men; 45% of female college graduates.  (CBS news Exit Polls.)  "...the 64% of American voters who earn more than $50,000 a year, 49% chose Trump, and 47% Clinton." (the Guardian)  Republicans' "Irrational obsessions" convinced voters?  Likely not.  Many probably voted for Trump IN SPITE of racial/law and order fears. CNN money: " Trump voters told CNNMoney they want "better-paying jobs," and they believed in their gut that a billionaire businessman was their best chance to get them."  Heard much about banning Muslims or the Mexico wall this month?  Nope.  All about trade, jobs, etc.
Every place I've ever lived in Canada has Catholic, Protestant and Jewish cemeteries. Refusing to build a Muslim cemetery is another example of bigotry. Congratulations.
Iran, long at odds with Saudi Arabia and a behind-the-scenes target of the move, blamed Trump’s visit last month to Riyadh and called for the sides to overcome their differences. quote ----- If Iran blames Trump then Trump must be doing something right Trump inspired the Sunni Muslim Arabs against Shiite Muslim Iranians (not Arabs)
I keep wondering, how are these people going to fight nascent Islamic radicalism?
Actually...No.  I would personally place the business owner's Rights as a Christian , (or a Muslim, for that matter) higher that my own desire for a cake, and just go down the street to another bakery.   WOW! Now, THAT would be interesting! Think of the quandary the DemLibs would be in if a Muslim couple that ran a Bakery, refused to bake on Their religious grounds! haha.
Are you seriously pointing to these terrorist acts and implying Islam is innocent or just not as bad?  You do realize the number of terrorist attacks attributed to Islam in 2016.  During this time period, there were 2477 Islamic attacks in 59 countries, in which 21,240 people were killed and 26,680 injured.   In the last 30 days of 2017  there were 119 Islamic attacks in 24 countries, in which 990 people were killed and 1180 injured.  Peaceful Muslims must start to aggressively expose and prosecute those who wish to do harm to their religion, otherwise you'll be seeing more of this type of behavior by Non-Muslims... and can you blame them its self preservation. Currently to Non-Muslims the screaming silence and lack of action from the majority of peaceful Muslims appears like a silent confirmation of these Islamic-fascists terrorist acts of genocide. That has to stop.   Read: "Heretic  Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now by Ayaan Hirsi Ali"
Muslims who didn't live there and had no right to vote in the referendum went door-to-door to get people to vote yes. Should they have no been allowed to do that?
I think the anti-Muslim feelings of EU people (and some governments) show that EU membership is impossible for Turkey. So it is no great loss. If Turkey was admitted to the EU with no border controls, Turkey would be encouraging its 3 million Syrian refugees to find greener pastures further west.
Why don't you lecture Muslims about how they abuse trucks?
You don't know me so you want to ascribe a political motive. I am interested in the truth and not ignoring things others want to hide from because it upsets the pc liberal kumbaya narrative. Most Muslims are peaceful because they ignore the parts of the Koran that sanction violence. The New Testament doesn't have passages Christians have to ignore in order to function nonviolently. I think church leaders don't want to admit that there are problems with Islam because they would have to admit all the "spirit of Vatican II" optimism/naïveté about non-Christian religions was mistaken. I think the Church should focus on bringing the Gospel of Christ and the Sacraments to the Muslim people instead of hoping they skate by on invincible ignorance. It's weak and not keeping with the Great Commission Jesus gave us (and the example of St. Francis).
so lets teach all the Islamic children all about the virtues of Judaism and Christianity and have them recite the Lord's Prayer.  Just learning not teaching - do you think this will work? And Muslim parents certainly would not have issues with this as all religion is fair game.
"Then, with Trump having threatened to inaugurate a "Muslim registry," we hear, in conversation with a young Muslim woman, from a 90-year-old Japanese woman who remembers the mandatory registration and internment of Japanese Americans early in World War II. The question: Could this happen again — this time with Muslims?"  Of course it could happen.  People always say it can't happen here right up until it does.  An amoral conman like tRump wouldn't think twice before rounding up people he doesn't like.
What's truly hilarious is that you hysterically gabble about "Shari'a", but you couldn't provide ONE authentic Shari'a tenet or ruling if your life depended on it.  You're kind of a religious analogy to "chicken-little."  Fact is, Shari'a doesn't APPLY to non-Muslims.  How do I know?  Because the first Shari'a document ("constitution" if you will) for the fledgling Nation of Islam at Al-Medina specified that Christians and Jews living in and under the protection of that State were free to practice their own religion and WERE TO BE JUDGED BY THEIR OWN LAWS.  I supposed you could complain that we're "discriminating" against you by not forcing you to abide by Shari'a.  Hate it for ya.
You might have noticed that almost all the victims of the Islamic state are also Muslims, not infidels or Christians. The inability to distinguish between ISIS members and Muslims in general shows profound ignorance.  No, you're not technically racists. Bigots is more accurate, but the effect is the same.
Unfortunately, I would expect that many of the ultra-conservative Islamic movements like Wahhabism, IS and Al Qaeda would claim that they ARE the reformation of Islam. Not that the Christian Reformation was a lot better. Calvin and Luther were very intolerant of other interpretations of Christianity. The Reformation also kicked off a series of religious wars. Syria and Iraq are serious conflicts but they pale in comparison to the carnage of the Thirty Years War.  In large swathes of Germany the population was cut in half.  If Islam is to go through a historical process from which the West has benefited I would prefer the Enlightenment.
What part of Public Education do Muslims not understand. Public means for the general populous. Education means a Canadian approved curriculum. Taught to all children to learn without religious bias, to not alienate any child from learning in Our Canadian schools.  Faith can be practiced on their own private time. There is no law of which a Muslim must pray five times a day. I know many Muslim children(friends of my son) who make up for it when they get home, as all other faiths. We as parents are allowed our own religious rights and freedoms, we also have say on what our children are exposed to.  The 'Islamophobia' rhetoric is for the victim card holder. We don't care about their religion, practiced elsewhere. You can label these parents racist, but that doesn't make it true. If anything the ones shouting the labels could learn a thing or two of tolerance. Nobody is going to hurt their children, except themselves allowing comments '300 brown or black kids to jump at them' says it all.
No they don't. Everything goes to intimidate those who dare to object hate speech in Canadian mosques, local funding of the Jihadi terror overseas, and etc. We are supposed not to be concerned with the Islamic terror and cheer for Hezbollah, El Qaeda, Isis, ad Hamas.
You've hit one of several bull's-eyes on this matter.   In order to show its disapproval with the belief system at Trinity Western University, the Law Society of Upper Canada made a decision that denies students from that university the right to practice law in Ontario. Yet clearly the 'offending' belief at TWU is the same as many other religions. LSUC does not, however, screen Catholic and Islamic applicants over their beliefs about homosexuality.
In 2013, firearms were used in 84,258 nonfatal injuries (26.65 per 100,000 U.S. citizens)  and 11,208 deaths by homicide (3.5 per 100,000), 21,175 by suicide with a firearm, 505 deaths due to accidental discharge of a firearm, and 281 deaths due to firearms-use with "undetermined intent" for a total of 33,169 deaths related to firearms (excluding firearm deaths due to legal intervention). 1.3% of all deaths in the country were related to firearms.  So should we be more worried about nutcase U.S.-born Muslims, or the proliferation of firearms?  Should we go along with the NRA's victories to keep us from being protected from lunatics acquiring guns, domestic violence criminals from getting AK-47s, or children under five picking up guns and killing their siblings or friends? The NRA was even able to keep explosives used in domestic terrorism from being tagged so law enforcement could track those vendors who were supplying bombers.
Just like the Islamist terrorist who mowed down dozens of Christmas shoppers in Berlin, Germany, the terrorist who shot to death 39 people at a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey on New Years Day had been fighting against the Assad govt in Syria.  And neither one of these two terrorists was Syrian. In fact tens-of-thousands of Islamists have traveled to Syria from North Africa, the Middle East and Europe to fight for ISIS and other Islamist terrorist groups backed by Saudi Arabia to establish an Islamic religious fundamentalist state or caliphate.
The OP states that Muslims are wrong in their silence, so you are saying that Christians get a pass while Muslims do not?
Sure thing--how do you feel about precious Amy's personal history--specifically her foisting another man's spawn on her then-husband as his own?  What a fine, upstanding Christian woman!  Let's publicize THAT.  No?  If you object I'll simply conclude it's just as much a hypocritical double-standard as arguing that it's OK to publicly burn my Qur'an while screeching and wailing that saying "happy holidays" constitutes a 'war on Christmas'.  And it matters not one whit to me that you claim Brother Jones doesn't accept me as Muslim.  Not his call.  That's the purview of a Higher Authority, and that's Whom I answer to.  So does He.  So do you.  Five'll get you ten Brother Jones didn't say that.  However, I'll ask him, inshaa Allah.  Doesn't change my position in any event: he or she who proclaims "Laa illaha il-Allah wa Muhammadar Rasuulullah (No God but Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger)" is my countryman (or woman) until by word or deed they indicate they don't wish to be.  Khalas.
Can you please cite the research that your hate filled bomb then into oblivion has ever worked?    Another cause you ask....let me see bush and blair kill over a million Iraqis and Afghani's and you wonder on the cause.....Muslims did not even have to kill near as many for you to buy into the blind violence method....so just imagine for a bit Mr. short sightedness.
Wow.  Testy.  Was there anything in my post that demonstrated self-professed expertise on American society – or inflated claims as to Canadian tolerance?  But if we are to get on the subject – American military spending cannot be described as self-defence.  No, it is the price paid to be the bully on the world stage.  Or were Viet Nam, Iraq, and the propping up of banana republics intended to defend the good old USA?  And your stats on incarceration are somewhat comical, given that the US has the highest rates of incarceration and recidivisim in the Western world.  Same goes for indigenous peoples.  Trail of Tears, anyone?  The example of the worst massacre of Muslims is similarly flawed.  That was the act of a lone madman.  Or should we judge the United States based on men like Gacy or Bundy?  The US more or less invented serial killers.  No, Canada is far from perfect.  But the US ain’t no beacon either.
Heh.  I just love these born-again phonies who claim to "love Jesus" (alayhis-Salaam) while just about everything he ever said slides right on by 'em.  The Messiah (alayhis-Salaam) admonished to "...sin no more..." and 'organized' Christian shrieks in unison by way of reply, "WE CAN'T STOP SINNING!"  And they expect their 'deity' to overlook THEIR sins.  Problem is they're not so willing to overlook others' sins.  I think you guys need a reminder like we have in Qur'an: "Forgive them--do you not want Allah to forgive you?"  Hmm...if only we could get my guys to remember that one.
IF the guy who rammed the car into a crowd was Muslim, he would have been called a lone wolf, with mental problems,  no political or religious affiliations, and no friends or associates who might think like him. .
The question is what the role of schools should be in propagating particular religious faiths. It has been made clear they should have no role propagating the majority, Christian one, even to Christian kids, but then it does in propagating minority ones? The reason parents and imams want the schools to be involved is that they act as enforcers of a rule they couldn't make their kids follow otherwise. Is that the role of schools?  In Indonesia and Israel, two places I have been to recently,  most businesses and offices close for the afternoon, i.e. 1:00 or 2:00 on Friday, not the whole day. That gives people plenty of time to go to the mosque for afternoon or evening services, or prepare for the Sabbath meal before sunset (although in Tel-aviv, it seems to mean people can go to the beach for the afternoon...:-)) .   Given our school days actually end quite early, our schedule doesn't make as big a difference as you claim.
Islam translates as ' submission".  They are determined to make St. Apollinaire submit to their demand. In a few years a name change for the town will also be  requested  and submission that will be considered obligatory too.
“right-wing populism”  The troubling re-emergence of the far-right.   It can’t be called “populism” because it does nothing to empower the disenfranchised. Quite the contrary, far-right politicians redirect the public’s anger at the crises caused by corruption, neoliberal “globalization”, unprecedented corporate power and inequality, and of course, the incessant US-led criminal wars of the past 15 years, from those deserving of it and into the usual scapegoats – Muslims, refugees, immigrants, minorities, as well as Liberals/Progressives – in order to protect the very status quo it feigns opposition to in order to win support.  Like “conservative”, this is just another misleading euphemism the press has used to avoid calling the far-right by its real name, which helped to conceal what it truly represented, and the threat it posed.  We must begin to confront it, and eliminate the political legitimacy it should never have been allowed to amass in the first place.
Trump's favorite 'Irish proverb' which he read out during visit by the Irish prime minister is actually a quote from a NIGERIAN poet    		President Trump met with Irish PM Enda Kenny on St Patrick's Day     	He shared his favorite 'Irish Proverb' which was actually a quote from a famous Nigerian poet Albasheer Adam Alhassan,    who is Muslim
You are precisely right... I would venture this sense of entitlement is expected, encouraged & inculcated by the religiosity that remains as the Nation of Islam.  One question though is this strange statistical nom of many boy children versus so many fewer female children by comparison.   Now, how the probability --  does that abnormality happen in one specific religious collective??  Gender engineering, perhaps ??  /  ..
All the time and energy wasted on debating islamophobia is time and energy better spent on things that really matter, ie, the economy and wasteful government spending.
You might have to put your Islamophobia on the back burner for now: we are discussing immigrants and refugees, and not Canadian-born terrorists (the majority of whom, so far, were not Muslims). I am sure you will find (or, as is the case here, will create) plenty of other occasions to spit this venom out.
Actually, there is no mention of this fellow's religious views  here, so using this as a forum to discuss Christian extremism is a leap too far without more information.Assuming he is a radical Christian without information ? As unwise and ill-considered as assuming a Muslim is an extremist "just because" While I think we need to have the conversation, care should be taken that facts fit the examples. We don't have the facts to fit your assertion here, even before one gets to the assertion.
Will the city also pay for a Catholic Club with a swimming pool? Or a Muslim Club with pool? Seems like Public Land should be used for non-religious uses. Last I went to a YMCA there was Christian propaganda as soon as I got in the door.
It is high time the CPC condemned Islamophobia.  Instead it gives cover to this hatred.
Well because I (along with the silent majority) do not believe in multi-culturalism obviously that list could be rather long. But I would probably start with cultures that are diametrically opposed to our own. Cultures that historically cause conflict when bordered with Christian based socities or are introduced within them. First, second and third on that list of mine would be fundamentalist muslims. Moving down the list we would see refugees with chips on their shoulders especially from Salafist supported warzones. The Founding Fathers had some choice thoughts on what was called "Mohameddism" in their day. This country was to be a beacon to it, not a welcoming party.
The inaugual speech was almost identical to Hitler's decrying the wreckage of Germany after WWI.  Trump falsely claimed this nation is similarly destroyed and needs a new Fuhrer to climb out of the wreckage.  Hitler's claim was true of a nation in complete economic chaos.  Trump's regurgitation demonstrates his fealty to the policies and artifices of Mein Kampf to gain control of a nation.  So far, so good.  Now all he has to do is unleash the military, border patrol, and law enforcement on all who dissent - women, blacks, latinos, Jews, Moslem, Native American.  All of those preventing the looting of the nation's land, water, and resources by his Billionaire Baron Corporate Oligarchy.  Joining the Russian Oligarchy with the U.S. Oligarchy into a worldwide fascist empire ruled by the Oligarchs from the bunkered board rooms.  Welcome to the U.S. Corporations of Amerika replacing the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-SBlmEu4bM Muslims and liberals excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of Christianity, Europe and America, destructive iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal wars between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects, ISIS , Taliban and Al Quada are the root causes of most of the wars and social chaos happening around the world today. It is worse than anything expressed in the west, even by trolls.
Remember when every single day in the news there weren't 5 or more headlines related to Islam in some (invariably negative) way?  That was not so long ago, maybe 20 years ago.   Those were the days...
The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Most of those Muslims came from Bosnia (anti-Serbs).  Stalin killed more innocent people than the other little guy. Yet the Allies allied up with him. Realpolitik
"The countries were not chosen because they are predominantly Muslim but because they present terrorism risks, the administration said."  Transparent bs. Then why isn't Saudi Arabia on the list?
Christian, Jew or Muslim; i fear anyone who thinks one book was written by the creator and hears voices talking to them from the sky. I fear a government who is run by these principles.
Mr. Purdy makes a very important point.  Generalizing and stereotyping others only serves to further divide our country.  Were a few demonstrators rude and obnoxious to Mr. Thompson and other Trump supporters? Based on Mr. Thompson's OpEd, I'd say "yes, they were." Do those few individuals represent "the left."  As Mr. Purdy points out....no, they don't.  Do the Bundys and their buddies represent all the ranchers in the West? Of course, they don't.  Do those who bomb abortion clinics and shoot doctors represent all the Pro'Life Movement? Of course not. Does ISIS represent all the Muslims in the world?  Again, a resounding no. Do those zealots who spiked old growth logs at the Swanson mill in Noti represent all the environmental movement? Of course not.   and. for a "closer".........Does Donald Trump really represent the Republican Party?  GOP leaders and long-time Republicans are having a tough time answering that one.... What do you Republicans on this site think?
If religion does not belong in schools then take away the Saturday and Sunday as off days from curriculum. They were made off days to accommodate Christians (Sunday) and Jews (Saturdays) for their religious (Holy-days) to accommodate their prayer rituals.  Muslims are only looking for one hour of time to pray on Fridays. They should the up the game and ask Fridays off and watch people go in a riot.
Trump calls on us to defend Western Civilization, and the Left denounces it as a white nationalist dog-whistle.  Sarsour calls Trump a fascist and urges good Muslims to embrace jihad against him, and the Left says she's only speaking metaphorically.  This is gaslighting par excellence.
No, I am saying the Muslims that enagage in terrorist acts and kidnapping are a kooky fringe cult.  The Muslims that I know personally are kind, tolerant, and peace loving and I firmly believe that they represent most followers of Mohammed.   Couillard's remark is without basis in fact.  Tormaine's claim was that Islam is the only religion that engages in violence or extemism, and that, too, is demonstrably false.  And no, I did not imply that anyone is excusing the Army of God or anyone else.
What are you talking about? Cultural conservatives thought Catholics were 100% antagonistic to American culture. Remember....  "Those Catholics don't want to assimilate. Heck, they want to even start their own schools!  And their own colleges and universities. They want to impose rosaries, apparitions, celibacy, Latin, and Bingo on the established American culture. They don't even want their people to marry WASPS, the 'real' cultural conservatives.  Catholics have 'blacklists' of all-American books and films. Their pope has even condemned Americanism. They don't believe in freedom of the press or in the separation of church and state. They won't allow their people to worship with us on Sunday morning, calling it a grave sin to do so."  You are so wrong---they did NOT want to adopt American mores and culture. Immigrant Roman Catholics were the Muslims of their time to social conservatives.
But political Islam was no where to be seen. Just kids wanting to pray for 15 minutes on a Friday afternoon. Why do you object to that?
My Shiekh was formerly a Catholic choir-boy from Buffalo, NY.  He's also an eminent and highly-respected Shi'a Muslim scholar who's writings are recognized worldwide.  Allah is indeed Merciful.
While not a Taylor Swift fan, it seems that she does what she does without much fanfare, aside from her music.  Perhaps today's feminists wish that she would speak out more forcibly but that is her choice.  The problem appears to stem from rigidly held viewpoints from committed feminists (or Christians, Muslims, Republicans, .....) that you are either totally in or your not.  Not allowing differences of opinion will cause increased conflicts, both within a movement or organization, or in society in general.  Frankly, I really don't care what Taylor Swift has to say.  She does, however, influence the minds of young people.
These guys have got to grow some or go there; I worked in the Persian Gulf, for 6 years and a couple of things I learned, god, family and self were the order of affinity. I found the muslims had no trouble making up their truth to the advantage of themselves. So it does not matter what you ask on the questionnaire, if their answers will void the application to Canada; they will lie.  I had one woman whose father died three times, she forgot she used the excuse before.
"Atheism is, in the broadest sense, the absence of belief in the existence of deities.  Less broadly, atheism is the rejection of belief that any deities exist.   In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities.  Atheism is contrasted with theism which, in its most general form, is the belief that at least one deity exists."  These are all unproven and unprovable 'beliefs'.     You have to 'believe' to be an atheist; you have to 'believe' to be a deist or a Hindu, or a Muslim etc.  Without this  'belief system' athiests' do not exist.
The only way to fight islamophobia is to pack our liberasts along with all the muslims and to send them to ME to build some sort of democracy over there.
I've read the Old Testament in its entirety nine times, and the New Testament eight times.  I continue to research its meanings according to its original languages (mostly Hebrew and Aramaic because they're Semitic languages like Arabic and therefore easier to follow.  Not so much the Greek, but I dabble at that, too).  So by all means, feel free to step up and impress us with your scriptural 'knowledge'.  You haven't done a bang-up job of that so far (typing in caps doesn't count).  All the absurdities you mention are indeed in biblical scripture, and the history of the New Testament's development in particular is just as absurd.  There are also very worthwhile, and very moving, moral and spiritual teachings in certain parts of the bible.  Perhaps when you're a little older you'll be able to open it up again and appreciate them.  (I admit I feel kinda weird, as a Muslim, defending the Christians' book, but brash willful ignorance, while excusable in the young, should be corrected).
Not according to the Muslims!
In 1453, a mere 39 years before Columbus sailed west,  the Islamic Ottoman Turks conquered the Christian  city of Constantinople.  Constantinople  was founded by Emperor Constantine in 325 as the  new capital of the Christian Roman empire.  The Muslim armies drove out the Christians and massacred them in wholesale bloodbath.  Canada did nothing of the sort to natives what Islam's invasion  armies did to Christian Europe.  When the eastern  trade routes fell under  Ottoman control, European traders had to find a new route to China, hence  the necessity of Columbus's voyage. So it is you who should apologize to natives. If you're prepared to cede Constantinople, Turkey  and the Bosporus back to European  control, we can then discuss your support of  native land claims.
Don't call her Mandela then. Call her the Asian Washington. He fought for "freedom", while owning slaves.  Suu Kyi fought for democracy, but only for her people, not "Muslims".
No, political Islam is trying to force Muslim children into a clique separate from the other kids in the school. Where they can be forced to conform to be members of the Muslim, not secular, community.
When is the rest of Washington going to stand up and tell this bully to stand down? In a few short days, he has further alienated women, the Muslim world, Mexicans, China ... and I've likely forgotten a few.
Dr. Jirran, I hope your implied equivocation isn't meant to suggest approval of patriarchy in either religion - or indeed in any other guise. When Muslim lives and health depend on dogmatic teachings on gender, it's academic if Christianity is just as misogynistic as Islam. To those Muslims, it's the power of their own clerics who matter most.   It isn't Christian or humane to ignore injustice committed against those of another religion.
It is curious to me, the way that the same newspapers...  .. the same newspapers that claimed the reason they would not publish Mohamed cartoons was that it would provide fuel to extremists that there is a war between the West and Islam....  ... the same newspapers that wag their fingers at Westerners to be very accommodating to Muslim preferences so as not to provide fuel to extremists that there is a war between the West and Islam....  ... um, hello, those same newspapers are now screaming, at the tops of their main pages, the phrase "TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN ON CITIZENS FROM MUSLIM MAJORITY COUNTRIES blah blah blah".  Hello?  Seriously, hello?  Why is THE PRESS providing fuel to extremists that there is a war with Islam gong on? Hypocrisy,  much?  Trump's travel ban is NOT a blanket "on citizens from Muslim majority countries": The vast majority of Muslim-majority countries are not on his small list. His ban is on countries identified during the Obama adminstration as posing high risks.
What a glorious exercise in obfuscation.   Numerous times the author mentioned 'terror attacks' and 'terrorist threats', without a solitary word of qualification-- what is the source of these attacks and threats? Citizens need to hear it, and the truth cannot emerge with half the story untold.  The author says Canadians "agree with slowing immigration and the acceptance of refugees from certain regions . . . eliminating immigration from certain areas of the world . . ." Really? From where-- Scotland? Scandinavia? New Zealand?   Canadian values are changing, he says, because, ". . . the world is becoming a scarier place." What group is making it scarier?  The fuzzification in your article is disgraceful-- spell it out Buddy: we are at war with some segment of Islam, and this minority of Islamist and Jihadi Muslims is responsible for these terror attacks and terrorist threats. It is they who are making the world a scarier place!  Tell the whole truth.
"In a post-truth environment, false perceptions can hurt us all" The title says it all.  What kind of orwellian doublespeak, meaning: language that deliberately obscures, disguises, distorts, or reverses the meaning of words, is this about? She begins the article with an anecdote about a woman, "who called our office last fall to express her deep suspicion of Syrian refugees, Muslims and women in head scarves. “It’s getting to feel like we’re living in their country, there’s so many of them everywhere you look,”  Isn't that exactly true in many municipalities? Surely major Canadian cities are rapidly becoming unrecognizable to anyone 40 and older. I suppose we will all be irrelevant in a couple decades anyway right? It is astounding to suddenly be a stranger in your own home town. Eyed at and treated like a stranger in your own home town. We can't even say a word about it. It is all dismissed as being "post-truth?" It's all false perceptions?
Wonder where all the haters are who keep talking about Muslims not being Canadian enough.  Guess they would make an exception for Kadri?  Hard to say, the haters are really scary.
It is curious to me that the computerized system here has chosen several "related to this story" news items of recent months, and all of them are headlines about Islamist terrorists committing mass murder in the "Alluhah Akbar!!!" sense.  Smart computer you have there, Globe and Mail...
In your odious comparisons, how would you explain all civilized nations cooperation and dedication to eradicating these diseases?  lol.  ps- you are not including all victims of Islamic extremism.
This lone, fanatical gunman shoots over 100 people, while the crowd remains - waiting their turn it seems.  On the 9/11 jet over Pennsylvania, some passengers saw the inevitable & tried to rush the muslim murderers, but at the club, no such rush of victims or soon-to-be victims took place. Seems a shame, worthy of some deep soul searching. I believe I know what I would do in such a situation ... & it is not just stand around, waiting.
Suspect is Arcan Cetin, 20 year old Turkish Muslim.
Good article. Some necessary tiptoeing around the ignorance of the current US President, but that can't be helped.  Glossing over what Israel has to gain is less welcome as there is clear mention of Hamas and their relation to the Muslim brotherhood and to Qatar.  If Qatar pivots to Tehran, they will become the voice of moderation in the region.   (Note I said "in the region".)   It's almost something to be hoped for.
A few questions after reading this article:  -Omar Mateen was American born.   Would Trump's policy have worked to prevent what happened in Florida?  -If we ban all Muslims, can we ban Catholics from entering the US as well?    They now run the largest organized pedophile ring on the planet.   Or is Islam the only religion with potential criminals?  -What if someone was born a Muslim and deconverts or switches to another religion?  Will they be considered "approved" or be banned for life if their name is Mohammed or Aisha?     -Would we have to put all Americans who convert to Islam in jail preemptively?  How about Americans who convert to Catholicism?  -Anyone who hunts with an AR-15 is either a lousy shot or a coward.  It's like salmon fishing with a stick of dynamite.  Is there a legitimate reason to own one outside of a well regulated state militia?  -Multiple people armed with guns in a drinking establishment like the one in Florida is a bad idea.  Yes?
Omar Mateen is the son of Muslim immigrants but he was born in America so he's a citizen.  This is Obama's vision for America.
Ambrose Best call it what it is if it involves Muslims - retaliation. Think. Where has the west been attacked before the West attacked Muslims?
Islamists of today seem strange, historically, compared to other totalitarian-like movements and previous Muslim-run societies.  Think about past "might-makes-right" regimes where the "little guy" did not get to vote and was forced to accept the iron-fisted decrees from above: Rome of 2,000 years ago, Germany 75 years ago, the Soviet Union 50 years ago, in each you had powerful leaders who ruled the land, top down, with an iron fist and where the "little guy" did not get to vote. And also think about Muslim rulers of lands in the Middle East about 800 years ago.  What those leaders had in common was this: They ALL valued scientific and technological activities and creativity. Most frightening was Germany of 75 years ago, where research derailed in murderous directions based on Jew-hate and bigoted views involving genetics. Nonetheless, all those places valued scientific advancement.  Today's Islamists, in contrast, want to destroy: They crush scientific activity and take pride in that!
Oh no, it could not be. Liberal is all about fairness, transparency and exclusive as claimed by pro Muslim,  Fidel dictatorship admiring(Castro, Mao) and selfie loving PM.  I wonder behind the scene, just like his dictatorship idols, he would say it 's 2017 and his anointed candidate or highway to the riding candidates.
If this had been domestic violence - related to his previous conduct toward his former wife - he would have used his guns to go attack her or other women, at maybe a dress shop or beauty parlor.  He attacked a gay bar because of Islam's attitude about homosexuality....and its attitude about killing....and dying in the act of killing.
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad dressed better than the men pictured in the article. Wanna see "Islamic dress meets style"? Check out Poosh designs in Tehran.
Apparently they don't know what it means.  Even the authors of this article say it is irrational fear of Muslims.  That would be a literal translation.    But it isn't any more accurate than saying homophobia is the irrational fear of gays.    We all know that imprecise usage has made tacking phobia onto an identifiable group mean hatred rather than fear of that group.  And I have heard more than one alt-righter defend Islamophobia as fear rather than hatred.  While I think M-103 is misguided, I wish people would stop using this construct.  It makes hate sound like a very minor case of mental illness.    So maybe we do need a definition, or at least a more precise term.
The "findings" argument in Hawai`i's challenge is about whether or not there is evidence that travelers from the countries in the Muslim Ban constitute a credible threat to the US.  Here is a link: https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Hawaii-Travel-Ban-3-TRO-MOTION.pdf  The argument about "findings" starts on page 18.  Enjoy!
Pretty much your usual profile of western converts to religious sects. Islam is just the "religion du jour" these days, in the past it has been the Hare Krishnas, the Children of God, the Maharishi...  Young people with disordered lives but usually some strong religious background they reject as not demanding enough. Have read of many Catholics rejecting Catholicism and Christianity in general as too complex a faith, it demands too much nuanced thinking, Islam is so much simpler and straightforward.  So said Lawrence of Arabia of the Arab Muslims: "They were a people of primary colours, or rather of black and white, who saw the world always in contour. They were a dogmatic people, despising doubt, our modern crown of thorns. They did not understand our metaphysical difficulties, our introspective questionings. They knew only truth and untruth, belief and unbelief, without our hesitating retinue of finer shades."   A very appealing view of the world to some people...
They don't have grudges against Buddhists today, but 70 years ago there was no problem herding them into concentration camps in Canada and the USA. Or a hundred years ago they weren't allowed to bring their wives in. Or forty years ago there was no problem dropping more bombs on them than on the Nazis.  The target group always changes. It was the Africans, Irish, Italians, Jews, Chinese, Indians, etc in the past. Today it is the Muslims.
I have been to Apartheid ISRAEL that daily terrorizes the PALESTINIANS, particularly children, has illegally established Jewish settlements in PALESTINE. Now ISRAEL is threatening holy CHRISTIAN & Muslim sites. Most certainly all funding $38 Billion from OBAMA at the urging of Mazie and BRian must immediately stop. AMERICA should not support ISRAEL Terrorism. IfAmericansKnew.org., Jewishvoiceforpeace.org. Chritianpeacemakers.org.
" Or pass a law prohibiting men and women from consuming alcohol together."  It already exists under sharia law. Maybe they are on to something.  What are the rates for sexual assault against muslim women in Canada? Lower? Serious question.
Make the 900 people unlawfully fishing and living in Hawaii citizens.  They are from Muslim countries and have never been vetted... no problem.  Make them legal, give them rights let them come off of the floating prisons onto the shore like the rest of us.  Free those that are unlawfully detained.  Make Honolulu Harbor a sanctuary port and a safe place for unlawfully trafficked persons from the Philippines, Indonesia and Viet Nam. The time is now and it is consistent with AG Chin's and the States values.
Everyone please write to Chin and his cronies to demand all female government employees wear proper Muslim attire to not offend our new Aloha brotherin when they come to government offices to for various services and to register for Section 8 vouchers. Every female government employee should be mandated to wear a: niqab or hijab or a burka! No exception or be given a fair trial and then be swiftly executed!
Ah, you ... spoiling the narrative. I am sure somewhere a Liberal is tasked with rebuking stories like yours. Alceste is attached to the Muslim narrative, not sure who has the 'Indigenous ' portfolio.... stay tuned.
. On International Womens' Day I would have expected that a  Muslim woman would have addressed  the issues women face in Muslim countries., not a M103 agitator. .
Wait and see, the whole world will get a front row seat to the destruction of Islam by HaShem himself. "Their is a G-D in Israel!", and the Jews are the Light of the world and NOT some man named Jesus(son of zeus).
Boyle is lying. The Liberal government is lying. The news coverage is lying. We all know we are being duped.  Omar Khadr and his Islamic Terrorist family, along with this man, and his wife, have the dearest sympathies of Trudeau, and all of them will cheat Canadians  with lavish reparations as if Canada owes them it.
.  BurntErnest,  you are wasting your time with Alceste.  His only role in these forums is to deflect and qualify anyone questioning anything Islam  as a non-Canadian, bigot, supremacist: . "... no doubt that a lot of participants in Globe comments despised this writer merely by seeing her hijab, but that isn't representative of Canadians." . Background: ------ . The above quote is a new "talking point" for him, which he adopted since last week. It was result of me questioning the motives of the G&M (and other media)  publishing "opinions" of only (practically) hijabed women. As if the Westerners should be  brainwashed that only a hijabed woman can be a true Muslim woman.   I find it interesting that the bulk of the  media doe not publish Muslims, critical of Islam, and calling for a reform - a hard look as to the state of Islam today. They do not publish Muslims, critical of the hapless left who is used as a Trojan horse to advance political Islam agenda in Western democracies.
The Muslim religious culture is so far from our Canadian values that it is impossible for most Canadians to believe that our supposed multicultural society can ever accept their religious culture. The solution is obviously that we should very much limit the number of Muslim immigrants.
Did you not read the article at all??  Yes, Obama deported millions of illegal immigrants and Trump is promising more of the same... only with muslims!  The numbers were given to show the increase in numbers of refugees from the US.  Obviously, life in the 'richest country of the world' is not as good as many Americans would have you believe.
These covering's origins are older than Islam.  It's possibly pagan.  It's not synonymous with the Muslim religion so get over yourselves.
Prgressivm :      Agreed and unfortunately Islamism is spread by the radical sect Wabbabis of Saudi Arabia in their religious schools or Madrassas throughout the Muslim world. It is also up to moderate Muslims to break this link to the Wahhabis. They don't seem to be doing a good job of this as evidenced by the visiting Imam to a mosque in Montreal who preached killing jews one by one; and apparently no Muslim in the mosque reported this incendiary speech to the authorities. Our government could best use their resources to combat Islamism (per example) rather than a mis-guided and wrong headed effort to combat Islamophobia by bill M-103. The sharia law of the Islamists provides for harsh penalties for criticism of the koran, Islam or Mohammed and it seems to me bill M-103 borrows from the ideology of the Islamists as it attempts to enshrine in Canada protection against criticism of Islam when in some instances, criticism should be made rather than covered up.
The usual Jihad apologists get right at their job every time innocents are slaughtered by Jihadists.   "Muslims also died when Christians were targeted" Is that supposed to make their families and worshipers of the same faith feel better? Christians don't want to Muslims to die along with them, Christians want to live and not be afraid to pray.  Like clockwork, the story about murdering Islamists is gone off the front page after just one day so we can carry one with our favorite topic: the grow of Islamophobia in Canada.
The article refers to two proposed laws- one in Poland and the other in Germany in regards to Kosher slaughter and the other circumcision. Both laws have met fierce opposition from both the Jewish and Muslim communities. I am talking about physical attacks- Attacks in France, Belgium , Germany, Holland etc. Physical attacks on Jewish businesses, institutions and  individuals. These- in the past 20 years have almost all come from radicalized Muslims as an another article referenced in the Jerusalem Post article you posted.
It seems the Ontario government stopped the Lord's Prayer in our public schools and they have stopped Christmas, Easter and Halloween celebrations in our public schools so non Christian students and parents wouldn't be offended.  Non Muslims now know there are prayer rooms set aside only for Muslims and non Muslims know Muslims are practicing Islam in our public schools. If non Muslims get offended when they know there are prayer rooms set aside only for Muslims and when they know Muslims are practicing Islam in our public schools, do our governments and school boards care?  Why is it unacceptable to offend Muslims but acceptable to offend non Muslims?
So, the issue Kaepernick "protested", because his girlfriend is Muslim, is invalid.  Got it.  BTW, our President voluntarily and purposefully avoided military service 5 times.  Therefore, any words he says about respect or commitment to the military are also invalid.
Is that Iqra Khalid, former president of the York University  Muslim Students Association?  This is the second anti islamophobia motion that has been brought forward by the Liberals in less than one year, even though the first one passed.  What is going on here?
The Muslim who attacked Donald Trump, Khizr Muazzam Khan, is a Muslim Brotherhood agent, working to bring Muslims into the United States. After reading what we discovered so far, it becomes obvious that Khan wanted to ‘trump’ Trump’s Muslim immigration. But not so fast. Trump we have your back.  Khizr Muazzam Khan graduated in Punjab University Law College, as the New York Times confirms. and he specialized in International Trade Law in Saudi Arabia. An interest lawyer for Islamic oil companies Khan wrote a paper, called In Defense of OPEC to defend the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), an intergovernmental oil company consisting of mainly Islamic countries.  Khan is a promoter of Islamic Sharia Law. Khan is also co-founder of the Journal of Contemporary Issues in Muslim Law (Islamic Sharia).
I do find irony in that  Ezra Levant is stopped from speaking my mobs similar to the ones he incites against muslims. Seems fair to me.
How about Obama's love affair with the muslim leaders?
"the new authority given to U.S. preclearance officers could lead to problems for Muslim-Canadian travellers. "   Really? how? It also could lead to problems for Mormon, Lutheran, Anglican, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Atheists if these other Superstitious Canadians involve themselves with or have links with criminal activity or hostility against the US.
Barack Obama has once again demonstrated why he will be considered as one of the most destructive presidents to ever hold office in the US. Apart from dismantling the underpinnings of the US economy by adding $13 trillion dollars to the national debt, he has facilitated a soon to be nuclear capable Iran, when he could have held tight to economic sanctions that saw Iran ready to capitulate to western demands to dismantle its program. Now he facilitates the incursion into the domestic policies of a friendly sovereign nation by a UN Council that has deviated from its original intended objectives, since its membership has grown to include dictatorships and countries ruled by despots, few of whom have any attachment to world peace and are members only to legitimize their own domestic corruption.   One wonders whether the community organizer is in fact harboring  a deep seated agenda, perhaps tied to his Muslim roots.
How wrong are thou?  Let me count the ways:  (1) I am a practicing Muslim.  Have been probably longer than you've been alive. (2) I'm not a member of the Democratic Party (3) I voted for neither the Repignicrat nor the Demopignican candidate in the last election. (4) Shari'a doesn't apply to non-Muslims.  The first (and still binding) Shari'a "constitution" if you will, dictated by the Most Noble Messenger Muhammad and transcribed by his son-in-law al-Imam 'Ali ibn Abu Talib (alayhimus-Salaam) mandated that Christians and Jews under the aegis of the Islamic Nation were to be free to follow their own faiths and live according to and be judged by THEIR OWN LAWS.  Sorry, you wanna come under Shari'a you gotta become Muslim. (5) While I am a practicing Muslim, I doubt I'm as good a Muslim as Brother Jones. (6) Which is why it's probably a good thing I had to work and was unable to attend tonight's Assembly meeting.  Amy Dunbitchski would have gotten an earful if I had.  I'm not nice.
Its called mind control Soft cuddly articles about the beauty of Islam He even slips in the bigot word to make it look like anyone who questions Islam is a bigot... Boy the deep state and oligarchs are pulling out all the stops  The mind wars have started Since G@M is a for profit paper I wonder which group paid for this article Trudeau Foundation? Khan? Soros? You through Immigration department?
She "nailed" nothing. ======== Let's say I walk into a Jewish Bakery, a Gay Bakery, a Muslim Bakery, and a Buddhist Bakery because I didn't know they were Jewish, Gay, Muslim, or Buddhist.....and I ask them to decorate a Christian Wedding Cake with "crosses" and "May Jesus Bless Our Marriage" written on it......and they decline because doing so goes against their religious beliefs or same-sex values. - Sure, I might be sad. But wouldn't I just find another bakery that (1) wants my business (2) will gladly create the "edible art work" I want? Of course I would.
really?  So almost everyone in Germany is a Nazi (except of course for the immigrants from Muslim countries, eh)?
Leitch doesn't go far enough. She should propose a binding, national REFERENDUM on muslim immigration. I want the PEOPLE to have their say on a very, very important issue for the future of our children and what kind of country they will inherit.
Not a police state? Didn't Sweden once track a (not a moslem) Terrorist by looking for anomalies in electric billing / usage, compared to the number of residents on the official register?  There was also the case of the Swedish woman whose child was seized by authorities. They had told the mother to lose weight, out of concern that the child might be teased about her monther's obesity. When the woman was unable to lose enough weight to please them they took her child away.   Hasn't there been a pattern of depopulation in rural areas, where younger people pay prohibitive taxes to support elderly and jobless, then flee to the cities, leaving the remaining working young to pay even higher taxes, leading to a feedback cycle of workers leaving for the cities?  So it goes in the non-police state.
There is nothing to define here. Sheema will just have to accept that people will critique islam just as she critiques non-islamic Canadians all the time. If she likes oppression of free thought, maybe move to North Korea, Cuba, or Saudi Arabia.
Clinton lost an election she was supposed to win 86% to 14%, backed by a hate-Trump propaganda of bigot, racist, etc. etc. from Clinton, Obama, Warren and the Opposition media.  Why and how could Clinton lose and Trump win?  When Clinton was sure to win as the sun rises from the East and sets in the West. How could Trump beat Clinton?  How could Clinton lose and Trump win with this thing called Muslim ban hitting Trump heavily in Election 2016?
If Trump was colluding with The Islamic State and other radical Islamic terrorist organizations. Then maybe the Democrats could have a problem that is news worthy. But the Russians...not a problem. We need good diplomacy with Russia.
.  "The actions were the latest legal blow to the administration’s efforts to temporarily ban refugees as well as travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries."  --  The Trump Gong Show continues.  "The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight" (with apologies to Robert De Niro, Jackie Vernon and Jimy Breslin).  Never a dull day.  Like watching a slow motion train wreck.  .
Western Europe needs to take a hard stand against Islamists - they are currently treated with deference and are allowed to fester in culturally-segregated communities where foreign Imams have a large pool of naive young men to fill their ranks, pushing a Salafist/Wahabi-style of Islamic fundamentalism. There are foreign Imams and radical mosques across western Europe that promote hostility to western values under the guise of religious piety - they are promoting a theocratic fascism and should be shutdown and their transplanted fundamentalist Imams deported.  Private religious schools funded by foreign sources should face immediate intervention from education ministries with a complete curriculum overall or face closure.  Hoping for the best has failed.  It's not a function of cultural relativism, it's a function of progress versus regression and right vs. wrong. Advanced secular societies are fundamentally incompatible with political Islam or Islamism - just like Turkey under Erdogan.
The article should read:  "VANCOUVER Cemeteries running out of room".   Here in Alberta, the city of Edmonton and the city of Calgary are both building or planning to build new cemeteries.  In Alberta, privately owned "for profit" and church run cemeteries still have lots of room.  In Edmonton, both the Ukrainian Catholic Church and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church have opened brand new cemeteries, and burial and cremation is open to all faiths and cultures.    The Muslims have a opened a brand new cemetery in Edmonton.   In Montreal, Mount Royal Cemeteries just opened a brand new cemetery, in addition to their other two.  Apparently, research and fact checking is unheard of at the Globe and Mail.
Al Lah = The God = one face of the Abrahamite "trimurti"   Jesus = Isa  = a prophet recognized by Islam
The one used in Nice was rented, not stolen. The van used to run over Muslims in London was rented too!
So we need to abolish the 7-day week because it is based on the Bible?   Maybe we also need to reform the calendar? You realise we are in the year 2017  because we use the Gregorian calendar, with B.C. and A.D. meaning Before Christ and After God (Deus) (the recent change to the nomenclature Before the Common Era and After the Common Era in academia notwithstanding)?  For Muslims we are in the year 1438, and for Jews the year 5777. ..  Or you could just accept that our society is the result of its history, and 2000 years of Christianity has left its mark on our culture and traditions.
ctnd What about all the Muslims I know who are undistinguishable from their non-Muslim neighbours, are they now "ultra-liberal", or maybe "not REAL Muslims"? What about all the Muslims in Muslim-majority countries fighting off the islamists'' attempt to redefine their religion in an ultra-conservative manner?  I know which side I'm on. Do you?
I am also still wondering how these orders could be considered 'muslim bans"?
Many anti-muslim and islamophobic comments here today. All have been reported under M-103. We're not to be critical of religion in Justin's Canada. Or maybe not, it depends on the religion.
So you have a religious state Saudi Arabia (Sunni Muslim), Iran another religious state (Shitte Muslim) and a Jewish created state named Israel. What year is it  2017 its not 700 AD. Canada and the west should have a serious talk with all three parties and progress to 2017.
So what if a Christian bakery refused to bake a cake for a Jewish couple because they don't conform to evangelical beliefs? Should they also be allowed to refuse to bake cakes for Muslim couples, Buddhist couples, or anyone who isn't a card carrying member of their church? Should they be allowed to deny service to women if their church believes that women don't have the right to make decisions? Discrimination is a slippery slope. I wonder how their employees are treated? I'm sure this controversy is very awkward and embarrassing to them. Some of them may have different beliefs and business ethics. It's not fair or legal to discriminate against them either. We have labor laws for good reasons. Nobody likes a bully. Skin heads enjoy threatening and intimidating people. No sane person or boss should expect anyone to deny their own identity and have to pretend that their something or someone they aren't just to get acceptance from their peers. That's how work place violence happens
Folks keep in mind, among other things,   Muslims should engage in Taqiyya and lie to non-Muslims to advance Islam.  Ever wonder why the Vatican has a 30' wall around it? HELLO!!
It's very telling perhaps that when people oppose other religions they are typically labeled "anti-_______" (insert religion here, I'm certain that you can guess some of the more common ones).  When it comes to this case however the preferred term is not 'anti-______', but '______phobia', implying a fear as opposed to a simple dislike or even hatred.  It is not me saying this, but the proponents of the religion itself.  Perhaps then these people should be asking how we arrived at this point (root causes) and find real solutions instead of enshrining the fact (and reminding everyone) that people are afraid of Islam into parliamentary decrees.
Fort Lauderdale shooter was “Aashiq Hammad” on MySpace, recorded Islamic music
Controlling both houses, he failed to: repeal Obamacare; do tax reform; end NAFTA; end Iran deal; pass infrastructure bill; build a wall; halt Muslim immigration. He did however spend more time vacationing than any other president, by far, and manage to explode the Secret Service budget in 100 days. Okay, there were a lot more failures, but these were his major campaign promises. In his favor, he did manage on his own to sign a lot of (harmful) presidential orders. He also stopped TPP, giving the Chinese a huge present and allowing it to fill the economic vacuum.
Well, when it comes to gender equality, Scandinavian countries are far ahead of Canada and the USA. They have elected female leaders, half the parliaments and company board are female, etc. How would you like to listen to them lecture you about how backward Canada is? Would you enjoy that judgmentalism?  So save the judgemental attitude towards the Muslims, and work on making Canada the best country in the world for gender equality.
OK, but curious, Alceste: You're a citizen of what country? Not Canada obviously.    Oh, you ARE Canadian?  Then, let me be the first to give you the news: "According to Canada's 2011 National Household Survey, there were 1,053,945 Muslims in Canada or about 3.2% of the population." (Stats Can) Not "millions...who are our neighbours."
Ruben, Totally agree---those that will come are the ones who did not want to fight for their country. Mostly criminals, bad people who will get hundreds of USD just for dropping by. It doesn't work. I know. I was with 3 million refugee's during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan for 6 years plus 2 more years working in another Muslim country. They are not nice people  cheers
Boycott the Socialist Republic of Canada, Americans, and all things Canadian.  It's fast going Muslim, anyway.
It's unfortunate that Muslims are starting to feel the same intolerance other religious groups have experienced for far too long in Canada.  Secular progressives are entitled to their opinions, but the culture of intolerance they have bred has no place in a free and democratic society.   We all hold the right to practice our faith, we all hold the right to criticize religious dogma in all it's forms.  Unfortunately, the secular progressives have bred a culture where the religious and the religion, are now one in the same and being critical of the faith, also means being critically intolerant of the faithful.
Canadians are about to lose their Right to Free Speech as parliament gets set to vote for,  Liberal MP Iqra Khalid’s M-103 bill!  This bill will criminalize all criticism of islam and sharia law and force Canadians to accept sharia law limits on everything!  Criticize islam for killing homosexuals?                  Sorry that is now hate speech! Criticize islam for female genital mutilation?        Sorry that is now hate speech! Criticize islam for allowing men to beat women? Sorry that is now hate speech! Criticize islam for honor killings?                             Sorry that is now hate speech!  Want to maintain your Freedom of Speech Rights, then contact your local MP and tell them they are totally wrong forcing sharia law on Canadians!
Mrs.Wente your column surprised me.   "And if an optional 20-minute prayer session once a week helps them feel more welcome, then why not?" The problem with Islam is that it will NOT stop to 20 minute prayer. Then there will be more and more requests such as segregated girls/boys classes, dress codes, no music class....Pressure and harassment on the non Muslim or non practicing kids will start.  Eventually non Muslim kids will feel unsafe and will  leave these schools which will become more and more Islamic. Look at what happened in England. This is how it goes with the Muslim religion. This is why France has to be so firm about secularity in schools and universities.  The prayer rooms is only the beginning.
I enjoy how Ms. Khan tries to implicitly claim that there is an equal amount of evil done by all religions. In fact, since Raman has started, there have been over 150 terror attacks by Muslims, with 1532 fellow human beings killed at their hands. Terror attack by all other religions combined? Zero. Muslims killed by islamophobes? One.  We do have a problem, Ms. Khan. Guess what it is?
'It is 90 days to get a better vetting process in place'. Current refugees from these countries take, on average 24-36 months to be vetted and approved. Even if the Trump administration can come up with something better in 90 days, anyone wishing to enter the US will then have to go through the new procedure so it will be far more than 90 days before they can enter. 'It is where the terrorists and the ones spreading their goals are'. The individuals most responsible for promoting and spreading radical Islam are Saudi clerics and yet Saudi Arabia is not included in the ban.  'You don't wake up one day "self-radicalized:'. Making Muslims feel unwelcome in America, thanks to Trump's numerous anti-Muslim comments during his campaign plus the current ban, aew the kiknds of things that promote self-radicalization among young Muslims.r
John Ibbitson Question: What are Muslim Canadians virtues and if one must add, values?...What are they? Do Muslim Canadians values differ than say, Muslim values in the Middle East or France?  Muslim values? Are they comparable with Western world values, say multiculturalism? Well maybe they are. But is multiculturalism valuable. But please, explain the virtues of multiculturalism first – then explain Muslim values would you – dare you try?
Suicides - which are usually by gun - outnumber drug overdoses as a cause of death, by about 13 to 4 in 2015. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus16.pdf#019  That said, I say legalize it all. Guns, steroids, gambling. After we're all dead, the Mormons can duke it out with the Muslims for all the joy it will bring them. (DARFC)
Reasonable points Wente, but where on the spectrum of "hatred" do comments like "... Muslims are taking over Canada" fall into?  I ask this, because although one might argue what "taking over" means, it is difficult to argue with arithmetic.  Between 1991 ad 2011, the proportion of the Muslim population of Canada went from 0.5% to 3% - over  9% growth rate.  It is quite true that this percentage is large because when starting from a small base number, increases are magnified from a percentage perspective.  But, having said that, if you take today's Canadian Muslim population, 1.2 million, and apply even declining growth rates decade over decade, it is easy to project a Muslim population in Canada of between 20 million and 40 million by 2080. It is just a function of what growth percentage is used, and what you use for a rate of decline for that percentage.  So, by 2080, what will Canada's population be? 50 million? 80 million? More? Less?  Let's not say, "take over". Just "majority".
You don't think that Trump on the campaign trail and in Oval Office calling to ban Muslims has anything to do with incidents like this?  It's no surprise that the left accuses the right of lacking brain power.  A bad highschool student could connect those dots.
Why focus on just anti-Muslim hatred?  Why not against all types of hatred, especially the comments section here directed against the Chinese when your newspaper publishes its race-baiting articles?  Did you stand up and defend Olivia Chow when she was attacked by the supporters of the crack-smoking late Mayor Ford?  Or when Chris Rock made his racist Asian comment at the Academy Awards?
So much for the constant barrage,  canadians are racist. Look what they're asking, their own place where only muslims will rest in peace.  Translation, 'muslims' will not be buried besides a non-believer. Are we so naive as to accept their sanitized version of the truth for Western world consumption?.
Which polls? Polls of Muslims in which countries?  Laws for which countries?
Nowhere does the niqab take on religious significance in the Koran. That is a fallacy promoted by those who would take us down the road of political correctness and Sharia law. A Nun's habit is often likened to the niqab but in the former the face is not covered thus the argument is moot. At the end of the day however if you think that Canada is the place you would like to live in then follow in the tradition of what Canada does, do not try to change it to what you are fleeing from.
Odd that you should say that since Muslims have been here since Confederation,
She has admitted to some of her lies herself, if only after having been caught. That you ascribe her more credibility because of her academic connections is an excellent warning to prestigious universities not to play politics with their honorary degrees/fellowship appointments. It sounds like you already shared her bias to trust her implicitly regardless of her fraudulent record. This is someone who makes up statistics on the fly and contradicts herself according to how right or left-leaning her audience is at the time. You also faithfully replicate her false equation of the whole of Islam itself with a few of its many subsets of followers: the radical groups/individuals who issued the fatwa and otherwise harmed her. Islam itself does nothing to anybody. Its adherents may, but Hirsi Ali encourages the dangerously prejudicial mindset that ALL adherents of Islam (a quarter of the world population!) are alike despite their diversity and all as dangerous as the active extremists.
I am afraid I do not agree with your definition of intolerance.  Disagreement with a viewpoint does not constitute intolerance.  Denying basic rights because you disagree with a viewpoint does.  The federal government showed intolerance toward homosexuals during the sixties sweep, for example.  Many show intolerance toward Muslims when they say they should not be granted asylum based on their faith.  I dispute that humans need a moral law giver, though.  An educated and compassionate person should be able to make these decisions for him/herself.  There are those that choose to delegate that responsibility to another, be it a religious authority, philosopher, or other perceived leader.  Speaking for myself, I prefer to apply critical thought to moral dilemmas and apply my own judgment.  Either approach is valid and is entirely dependent upon the individual.  But an outside moral authority is not necessary for a person to behave in a dignified and respectful fashion.
I think you're expecting too much from Evangelicals, but especially the Falwells. I mean these are the same people that on one hand condone kids being taught that dying in the fight against Islam (since they're right and the Muslims are wrong) is one of the greatest gifts you could ask for, even if you're only 6 years old. Then they turn around and tell them all abortions are murder. So sure they love life, but only if it's unborn. Once you're out of the womb, they have no problem with you dying. Oh and who cares if the fetus won't actually go on to live, the mommy doesn't matter at all (except in the choice she makes to ensure her own death for that chance in a million that deformed fetus might survive).  These are the same people that think a business being forced not to discriminate is a war on their beliefs (who cares about an individual's rights!). The hypocrisy amongst them would be funny if it weren't so horrific at the same time.
Islam does not promote reduced family sizes. As I understand it large families have long been seen as a sign of verility by Muslim men. Attitudes like that do not change over night or over one or two generations.
If so few Muslims must make a huge impression to cause such emotions. And by the way, these are not post-truth times.  For some yes, but for most of us not so.  As to basing one's decisions on emotions psychological research claims , as of latest findings, that we in the end base our decisions on emotions and intuitions. That rational thinking is a forerunner happening in our sleep, but in the end it's our feelings that speak loud and clear.  We do always need as much factual basis as possible.  But facts are often not just simple facts but someone else's opinion of what they are. We are all different in the end.
Donald Trump won because, as many fellow Americans, and former Democrats by the way, told me, he was saying things that many were thinking, but "afraid" to say.  After living in Europe in the 1970's, and returning there several times, the last few visits in the past 2 years, have alarmed me, & I am now afraid to go back.  I am terrified to ride on trains, be at train stations, etc.  Europe is no longer safe.  Frau Merkel has more empathy, love and concern for the refugees than her own people.  Pres. Obama also showed more empathy for anyone but "white Christians".  African Americans, Muslims, illegal immigrants, all are apparently more important, their lives are more important, than regular "white folks".  Many former democrats here have switched to Republican. I hope Frau Merkel does not win, and that Europe can return to the safety it had when I lived there. Otherwise, I cannot go back, it is extremely dangerous now. So very, very sad.  Vote her out, people!!! For God's sake!
Maybe in a thousand years women in Muslim sharia countries will be up to as much has 3/4 of the value of a man, instead of the current limit of  1/2 they are now. How much value does Justin put on his own wife?
You are confused with more successful immigration from other countries where people actually integrate and adopt the values here.  You obviously haven't read the stats and extensive studies done on migration from the Muslim world to the West have you.   Study after study and real world data shows that integration isn't happening with immigrants or migrants from these countries.
"More than one in three U.S. Muslims fear they could be targeted by white supremacist groups following President Donald Trump’s election ..."  Yes they could be...could be... or may be not . Once again we  face the spectre of the "white supremacists" out there waiting to kill, but, looking across the globe at who is killing and/or          persecuting Muslims...it ain't  "white" supremacists....
This was a very strange business decision for someone from Malaysia to make, that country having a very large Muslim population.
Religion does not belong in Public Schools at All..  If an individual wants to bring their child up in a religion, then the onus is on same said parents & religion to provide the fundamentals for a religious education not students sermonizing during a 'Public' school day'  Kids writing their own sermons proselytizing within a secular educational environment pits diverse religions against each other especially given that psychologically Humans do not mature mentally until age 28. Therefore, abstract emotional arguments arise among young students which should not be taking place in public educational institutions  Islam is more than a religion.. it has its own financial system; legal system; dictates as to how to live from day to day; gender roles & expectations; sexually dictated rules, etc.  Islam is seemingly a Nation, organizing to take its battles to base-root levels in order to project & protect its Nationhood gains over the last decade   Power in Numbers..   http://muslimlink.ca/
I scrolled down for more information about this tragedy, only to be confronted with someone rude enough to try to make this about himself and his beliefs. I don't begrudge you those beliefs, but this is the worst possible time for you to flaunt them, in the worst possible forum, and I specifically logged in to 1) flag your comment, and 2) request that you keep your faith as private as you would undoubtedly hope a Muslim or a Hindu would on subjects such as these. For all you know, the victim was Jewish, and would find your hijacking of his death to flaunt your faith an insult to his.  "And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full." - Matthew 6:5
In Hitler's Germany it was the Jewish people. In Trump's America, it's the Muslims. Now we have 2 residents of Canada acting out Trump's hate in their attack in the Mosque. We should all be horrified and disgusted.
I hear that same argument over and over again, however I never hear a liberal idea other than cut military spending. In my opinion liberals would be perfectly fine with building a wall complete around the country so they could cut military spending to nothing. Fortress America, except they would have doors for illegal aliens and Muslim terrorists
Mulcair wants Trudeau to ''stand up for Canadians who are affected by Trump's order to ban immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries''. However, that order does not apply to people who hold dual citizenship, i.e. Canadian and from one of those countries. So the only people affected by the order are not Canadians. Or am I missing something?
Religion or Islam? No other religion in the world would even consider arresting a woman in a similar situation.
Irrelevant. The only statistic that needs to be employed is the list of Muslim terrorist attacks that have occurred globally in the same time frame. Hundreds and far too numerous to count and far outnumbering the number of terror attacks by any other ethno/cultural/religious group. The extensive list can be found on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Islamist_terrorist_attacks Restricting the list to the number of terrorist incidents in Britain only serves to minimize the threat that Muslim terrorism poses globally regardless of location.
One wishes that?  What you mean is YOU wish that.  And what you mean further is that you imply those people don't support that; what you mean is to suggest that the people who are against anti-muslim hate speech here are all for anti-christian hate speech somewhere else. That's  an obviously irrational position that you baselessly invent just so you can insult those people. It's triple-irrational: 1) baseless invention 2) implied not stated 3) that's an absurd false dichotomy.  Jews and Muslim Arabs and Persians have lived side-by-side peacefully for centuries. Centuries. So if you're genuinely concerned about anti-christian and anti-semitic sentiment there (and not just using it as a cheap ad hominem) then do some research and find out what has changed, because the religions haven't.
(Part one of two)  the mandatory registration and internment of Japanese Americans early in World War II. The question: Could this happen again — this time with Muslims?—Maureen Fiedler ambivalent because she is quoting “a 90-year-old Japanese woman who remembers.  It is as if Catholics have nothing to special to offer in their liturgy of the Word, particularly for today, December 31, the Seventh Day in the Octave of Christmas.  “But you have the anointing that comes from the Holy One, and you all have knowledge.  I write to you not because you do not know the truth but because you do, and because every lie”  Hello Donald Trump, “is alien to the truth” (1 John 2:20-21).
It's not an argument, it's a request. Apparently being muslim isn't liked by moderates as well.
Sorry but I'm a bit confused by your comment. I'm not attempting to read anyone's mind. Mr. Trump has made numerous public speeches in which he has made angry, hateful inaccurate remarks about Mexicans (rapist, murderers, drug-dealers) and Muslims (terrorists).   I'm not sure why you assume I'm basing my remarks on my "perception of his anger towards others", unless you deny that Mr. Trump has made these remarks and is somehow being falsely accused.
This is a good example of a rant from someone who seems to hold values completely contrary to those of most Americans & to Common Sense. Reich would have us believe that voter ID is bad because it is inconvenient to some -yet ID is required to travel by air, etc. Reich fears that even monitoring of muslims is bad - in spite of continuing atrocities committed all over the world by muslims. Even worse, according to Reich would be restricting muslims entry to the US.    I've enjoyed some of Reich's essays, but this one makes clear that he is an ultra-liberal, impaired by a near total lack of common sense, espousing some nebulous concept of a global government completely devoid of pragmatic Nationalism.
' Female Genital Mutilation is not mentioned in either the Quran or the Bible.  But let's look at a little perspective.  UNICEF reported in 2013 that, for example, 55 percent of Christian women and girls in Niger had experienced FGM, compared with two percent of their Muslim counterparts .
You wrote: "As for the Baha'i, they got in trouble with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary government for having sided with the Shah. Understandable. Shah Pah'lavi via his murderous Savak secret police murdered 1.3 million Iranians during his 26 year, US-sponsored reign of terror. Actions (and alliances) have consequences. Next question" - - - - - - - -  So my 'next question' is: How is this different than what any Nazi would say about the Jews? You have just justified what the murderous Khomeini regime did do a powerless minority within its domain. The Nazis accused the Jews of being 'at war' with the German State and causing its defeat in WWI. You have just done the same thing with the Baha'i (instead of Jews, although you don't appear to hold Jews in much higher regard).
Who said this was about Islam?  Who is saying that multiculturalism means we must accept the intolerance that may exist in other cultures?  What I find ironic is how some won't hesitate to point out issues with "diversity, woman's rights, and gay rights" in fundamentalist Islam, yet ignore similar instances in historically Western religions.
Puffin writes:  "Trump's doing something nobody ever expects from a politician these days - he's fulfilling promises made on the campaign trail. "  --  Actually, he's not.  Nothing of the sort.  He promised "A ban on all Muslims entering the US".  This isn't even close.  And this so-called "ban", doesn't even mention Muslims.  Another Trumpenproletariat suckered by the con man.  .
I am not interested in  a Jewish or Muslim theologian's incorrect view on the resurrection, since they obviously don't believe in the event.   We are on a Catholic website, are we not, albeit a very misguided one.  Your responses remind me of a trial lawyer, trying to get a guilty defendant off of a criminal charge, always ambiguous and never crystal clear.
In another article on the topic the Globe's Nathan Vanderklippe writes: "Armed with machetes and a few guns, hundreds of people launched the assault. They fought under the banner of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, a fledgling insurgency led by a small group of Rohingya, based in Saudi Arabia, who claim religious sanction for their cause of employing violence to halt the persecution of Muslims in heavily Buddhist Myanmar. The militants sustained heavy losses that morning, but killed a dozen people."  How is a country supposed to react to an attack on its security by hundreds of Saudi-backed Islamist terrorists?  Maybe it's a disproportionate reaction but something needs to be done about global Islamist violence and oppression.
Rio Canadian values? Like helping the world's bully in attacking Afghanistan? The attack on Afghanistan was US retaliation for the Arab/Muslim retaliation for the US supporting Israel's takeover of land occupied and surrounded by Arab/Muslims.   Canadians should have been outraged that Canada took the side of the bully but our media, at least the G&M accepted the US explanation - that the US had been attacked. Retaliation  was never mentioned. In fact anytime I used it in Replies, the Reply was deleted.    One thing that would make sense is if the leaders of the support for Israel bought shares in military hardware firms..
Agreed but you're wasting your breath. Those with eyes to see will see and those without won't. The left has a form of Stockholm syndrome when it comes to Islam and Muslims. They will mock, belittle, and bash Christians all the day long yet rush to the defense of Islam faster than you can say Allahu Akbar. They claim to care about women's rights, education for girls, as well as free speech, and gay rights but they see no irony in defending the biggest abusers worldwide of each. Oh and the most prolific slave traders to this day are Islamic. It may be because they think that Islam is a "race" rather than a religion and the worst sin to this group is any words even out of context that may make them seem racist. Or maybe it's because the radical Islamists hate liberal (in the true sense) western culture and civilization and so does the left only for different reasons? Enemy of their enemies type of thing perhaps.
Mercy is not exactly another word for love. It implies accepting people even if they are in sin as the Catholic church and its discipline considers sin. It also creates a bridge to Islam, since every chapter of the Qu'ran opens with the Bismala,the proclamation of God's mercy. Interesting the Bismala has two words for mercy, one an unconditional mercy showered on all of creation, and the other a special mercy for those who actively respond to the first mercy and adhere to a narrow path of virtue. Now that Steve Bannon is starting a campaign against Pope Francis perhaps he could use this to claim that the Pope is secretly a Muslim.
Your story is a little disingenuous in that a few wackos sending emails doesn't represent most Canadian opinions. The reality is that we have three publicly funded school systems in Ontario, the Catholic, the secular and now the Muslim, everyone else can go take a hike. Seculars have spend decades embedding their the school system so that it is no longer a public system where all mainstream beliefs are welcome. The seculars seem unwilling to take on the Muslims, that's the only new twist.
I’m a former teacher and an atheist but I have no problem if students in a public school, on their own time decided to pray in any respectful way they choose.  While I personally hope they come to the conclusion that there is no supreme being, they need to come to this on their own.  Neither the school system, haters, my fellow atheists nor anyone else has the right to tell a student on their own time what they should do.  Leave these Muslims (and Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists or anyone else) alone.  Some Muslims are terrorists.  So are some Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists or even atheists.  No group is innocent.  And no group is all evil.  Again, leave these kids alone.
You go Amy. We don't want fundamentalist Islamic communes thank you very much. Apart from the ADiots in te comments section, most people are with you on this.
There is something fundamentally perverse and disconcerting about a person being unwilling or unable to show their face. Facial recognition is absolutely hardwired into human beings.  As opposed to another Muslim tradition, the hijab, which is fine, even looks nice as often as not.  For facial coverings to be allowed really means that Canada as a country stands for absolutely nothing. Not the country in which I wish to live.
>>Duke Charles Martel >>Are you a muslim Alceste? ... To that question, Alceste has a canned answer - "Are you a White Supremacist?".. or "At least I am not a White Supremacist?" Either way - it is pretty telling how he feels about himself. And what does he equates being Muslim with. .. Now, to the apprentice who would be given the task of "censoring" this post - read twice.. Just because there are some words in it that may scare you into censorship, there is nothing offensive, or false in it, it is based on actual posts ( go search your database).
Wrong... obviously you're having a problem with the new diasporic reality of Islam... but then 'self-interest & bigotry' does foment protest of the petulant dismissal type -- get the idea, friend. 1) (c)"Islamic Financial System: Principles. Term “Islamic banking” refers to a system of banking or banking activity that is consistent with Islamic law (Shariah) principles and guided by Islamic economics.

It is derived from both the Koran, Islam's central text, and fatwas - the rulings of Islamic scholars"(c)  3) (c)"Muslim Link is Canada Muslims' Online Community Newspaper. The site includes an up-to-date Events Listing, and Business and Community Directory for.."(c) Of all the cities in Canada, Ottawa, seat of the Nat'l Cdn Federal Gov't is the chosen site..  Yeah...
Why are young men prone to radicalization?  Because fundamental tenants of their religious faith makes them susceptible for radicals to hold influence over them long before the radicalization process starts.  Sheema Khan, unbeknownst to her, made this same unintentional connection when trying to defend mainstream Islam in an article at the G&M yesterday.  She was writing about a group of young Muslim males she was teaching, who she stated were unanimous in there support of the Beslan school terrorist attack when she broached the topic.
Homeless people (disabled, those with criminal records, registered sex offenders) need some place to go, so they go to the library and parks. Republicans created this homelessness mess by requiring everyone and their brother to register (even streakers) and by allowing employers to discriminate based on a criminal record. Americans used to discriminate against blacks, but then that became illegal, so they stepped up discriminating against others. They'd like to discriminate against Muslims, but somewhere in the Constitution it's prohibited.
It is too cold in Canada to wear a bikini at the mall. On a more serious note though, your very first sentence betrays you for a hard nosed muslim male. You are essentially saying that you will decide what your wife will wear at the mall and isn't that what we do not want in Canada. I suggest that you ship back from whence you came, you will be much happier.
After the recent Edmonton terrorist attack, the Globe immediately closed down comments on almost all related stories, and those few that had forums that remained open were severely censored and restricted.  Yours truly was informed that most postings would not be allowed on any of those "sensitive" forums because I was "restricted", due to posts from me in the past 24 hours.  In fact, I had made none in that period.  Khan and her fellow Muslim apologists on the Globe enjoy a freedom from criticism that would make the Imam-dictators  in the most oppressive Muslim states drool.  I wonder what the media's agenda is?
One can only hope. Queer Islamic Supremacy is a growing problem in the West.
Not here, apparently they don't think that would be nice. But I've seen him reported as Muslim on other sources.
' U.S. District Judge James Robart, . ….whose temporary restraining order on Donald Trump’s Muslim ban was, . ….upheld by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, . ...is moving ahead with the lawsuit by Washington and Minnesota challenging the ban. .
The problem is that there is not a single Muslim cemetery in the Quebec City area. The only one that exists is in Montreal. If you can't see that as a problem no one can help you.
Interesting how every society in the world governed by Islamic law (without exception) has no free expression, gender equality, or freedom of sexual orientation.  Accommodating regressive cultural practices under the guise of religious freedoms has failed conclusively in Europe. Accommodating cultures that are hostile to western values has resulted in cultural segregation and societal divisions in Germany, Belgium, France, Sweden, Denmark (pick one). There is a reason Denmark went from the most liberal to the most strict citizenship laws in Europe in under 10 years. Defending secularism is more important than accommodating regressive cultural practices that are hostile to western values of free expression and gender equality - just look at Turkey over the last 8 years, the regression under the AKP speaks for itself.
My point is that ALL terrorists are NOT Muslim.
Those folks in Parliament:  If they pass a "motion" condemning Islamophobia, should they understand the subject matter that they are voting on?  Should they know something about the contents of the Koran, for example? Should they understand the historical progression of the Koran verses and how the later verses revise the earlier verses? There are hundreds of millions of people who read that book and their actions follow from what is written there.
What does a "particular religion" mean?  So if this guys turns out to be Christian we'll blame it on Christiantiy?  I do'nt think so.  Fact is anyone committing terror in the name of Islam isn't following Islam - they're just using it as an excuse.  But no actual true believers of Islam are committing terrorism because the religion doesn't allow it.  Far too many people don't get it.  Studies prove that terrorists are generally not even overly knowledgable about Islam let alone devout.  It's all just an excuse to justify their violence.  That's why it's so hard to solve.  It was just a religion it'd be easy.
"That said, I have no idea if girls are allowed to lead the muslim school prayers."  Funny that you have tons of examples of minutia that support of your position yet claim ignorance of an obvious and well-known point that doesn't.  Almost like you're all rhetoric and little to no substance.
The judges are not living in the reality of the real world just like the liberal democrats. What has happened in Britain will happen here soon. Then they will say my bad and will not take responsibility for their actions today. Trump is the first President that the Muslim world is respecting in over a decade but here the vocal minority is not and putting the rest of us in true danger.
Arabs and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation has used UN to try to pull the wool over world's eyes long enough.  The truth is the UN court is ringed, by judges who were hand picked for their political convictions rather than for their understanding of the international law. The fact is the Israeli settlements are perfectly legal.  If the settlements are indeed illegal as this article clams then why, even the usually pro- Arab, French Court and Court of Appeal of Versailles, France, dismissed the Palestinian claim about settlement in 2013 and ruled that Israel has the LEGAL right to West Bank, and has a right to build on the land if they wish to do so?
But God isn't Catholic.....nor Jewish, nor Muslim, nor Buddhist, nor Hindu, etc.  Jesus actually had a number of female followers but the early 'fathers' of the church chose to honor twelve men....relating to the twelve tribes of ancient Judaism.  ... The gospels that actually name the apostles don't even have the same list of names.  The 'church' didn't even exist as an organized religion until after Constantine (around 312).  The church was alive with political maneuvering; hence what we see today.  The Bible, which didn't exist in a New Testament form until the 400's, has been edited, translated and retranslated through the generations to fit the male hierarchal ideology. Now the hierarchy have backed themselves in a corner of historical tradition and can't admit that they just might have misinterpreted the teachings and practices of Jesus.  Historical artifacts have uncovered evidence of female deacons, priests, and even Bishops in the early church.
He just gave a muslim 55 million of our taxes. Tells me he is a threat to the world. GO TRUMP GO
It is interesting to compare the two countries, Canada and USA.  For the USA, from the article: "Just 61 per cent of Muslims said they had voted in the 2016 presidential election, fewer than any other major religious group or the public at large".  Canada was the opposite: Muslim folks voted in huge numbers in 2015, estimates put that between 80 and 85 percent. And a poll reported by the CBC found Muslim folks were over 30 times more likely to vote Liberal than vote Conservative (65 percent Liberal to 2 percent Conservative).  It is hard to compare Canadian and American Muslims. In America, about a quarter are black folks with centuries-long roots in America, a great many of whom have converted to Islam in recent decades. In Canada, a great many are extremely well educated, the children of professors and engineers and doctors who arrived in Canada in just the past half century.  It is unclear to me, nonetheless, why Hillary Clinton fared much more poorly than Trudeau, with them.
No mention of "give unto Caesar?" How about salvation through grace, not works (jihad)? And what about Jesus' female disciples? Jesus' admonition to Martha? How about Jesus embracing the Old Testament? Jesus told us to beware of  those coming to declare a different Jesus than Himself. Jeez, why can't you see so clearly that Islam is the Antichrist? We're supposed to be leading people to Christ, not enabling their deception.
“We will not give up,” he said on Monday. “It’s insane. Three votes. We speak for thousands of Muslims in Quebec City.”  Does Mr Kesri believe that the sheer force of numbers should be enough to reverse the results of a democratically held  referendum?   Will we now be ruled by the tyranny of the majority?
Most of those attacks on Muslims were hoaxes,  conducted by Muslims to garner sympathies of  our weak minded politicians  There is an obvious pattern   by women who claim to have had their hijabs touched: they scream and yell the same words in the  same outrage that simply looks rehearsed,   from 1 - 100 in 1 second. There is always a video cam ready to capture it.    Originality is not necessary to get on the news.  Burning their own  mosques, and the same  "hate  speech" spray painted are part of the hoax mechanism.
Islamophobia "the irrational fear of Muslims."  You can easily label people as bigots for being afraid, but that doesn't change the fact that 100% of jihadists are muslims.   My question is, what constitutes a rational fear of muslims? Do you think people in Berlin can be rationally afraid of Muslims after an event like the Christmas Market attack? and if so when can we be rationally afraid that something will happen to us by some other extremist?   While I do recognize that many people are over reacting, and in the case of Quebec or Trump, making the our country/world more dangerous and giving more power to the likes of ISIS. I hope that the term Islamophobe will not be used to deflect criticism of the religion, which I think is warranted now more than ever.
Donald Trump’s speech in Poland may have attempted to camouflage its Fascist undertones with some Nazi-bashing, but no one will be fooled. The speech was probably shaped by alt-Neo-Nazi Steve Bannon, White House strategist and enabler of the white supremacist roll of toilet paper known as Breitbart. Like all Fascist speeches, it configured the Fatherland as weak and a laughingstock, threatened imminently with being wiped out. It is this paranoia and poor self-image that drives Fascist aggression. Above all, Trump upholds the values of fear, timidity and paranoia. A small radical fringe in the Muslim world cannot menace America’s civilization. But a far right white nationalist president with serious mental issues can.
If you understand the difference, why post the NYT link? It undermines your attempt to help moderate Muslims and just makes you look like the type who labels all Muslims as intolerant or worse because of the actions of the fundamentalists.
"Yes, any religion that demands total social identification with it as a primary social identity, gender segregation, and extreme female "modesty" goes against current values."  Yet amazingly not all Muslims follow that do they? In fact there are a lot in Canada who don't. Perhaps your perception of Islam isn't all that accurate.  "deserve the reaction they get" So really your whole argument here is based on how you think Muslims should supplicate themselves and ask you with all due reverence to allow them the rights that are already theirs by law. If that's not too much trouble for you.  Sorry sky, the world isn't here to treat you like some kind of supreme being, demurely asking for things that they already have a right to have. Feels like you have some issues that you need to work out. Maybe you should ask your neighbour why he thought a fence was necessary, You might not like the answer though.
Muslims are maybe 3- 5% of our population, white dudes maybe 30%. I'm just guessing but you get my drift. Yet you are comparing a dozen or so successful Islamist strikes on our population in just the last couple of years versus the occasional redneck militia that pops up every so often and are quickly dealt with. I can hardly think of a white militia that's had a lethal strike since Timothy McVeigh. I may have missed one or two but not many. And if your thinking of the various mass shootings that  have occurred over the years, those guys had their own individual twisted reasons for doing what they did. Islamist killers all share the same justification. I do know of a President who oversaw the burning alive of a group of people at the Branch Dividian Compound , including 19 children, because they were a cult. No, the FBI has been corrupted with PC and partisanship just like everything else this bunch touches. The Hillary email affair made that abundantly clear.
and the muslim ban expires in two weeks the SC will not even have to hear the case
‘Muslim students have observed Friday prayers in schools for about 20 years now.’  why isn't ALLAN ROSS asking for SOURCE ?
Unfortunately for those six who were killed by Boisonette is that this young man was obviously mentally unstable and has a general dislike for muslims. This dislike coupled with his mental problems was pushed over the top when Canada stated that we would accept the individuals refused entry by the US. That action, IMO, is what was the ultimate cause of the death of the six. This should be a lesson to our sanctimonious, do gooder politicians, but sadly, probably will not.
These Polls are not an indication of real people ! The Polling is skewed toward younger , Urban individuals who really don't have a clue outside of getting their news on the Internet ! They have never read the Qur'an (unless they are Muslim ), They are blind to what is happening in our Country and Europe , They do not like President Trump's policies towards Muslims and they don't know what is happening in our own Government ! Polls are Polls and you just have to look at what Polls meant in the recent  U.S. Election ! Besides , The Polls are probably paid for by the Government and will show what they want us to believe !
Dems cannot and should not align with Trump. A NEW REPORT published by Georgetown University’s Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding has documented an upsurge in violence against Muslims in the United States coinciding with the 2016 election campaign.  Critics say Trump’s proposals to ban Muslims, deport undocumented immigrants, and build a wall along the border with Mexico are also laying the groundwork for eroding American democracy more broadly.  The report cites 180 reported incidents of anti-Muslim violence during the period between March 2015 and March 2016. Among these were 12 murders; 34 physical assaults; 56 acts of vandalisms or destruction of property; nine arsons; and eight shootings and bombings.
We also have have the air to pollute, our water to poison, muslims to ban, Mexicans to round up, a state to police, health coverage to take from millions, and wealthy pockets to line with taxes they cut. Did I forget anything? Oh yes, Devos wants to cut nine billion dollars from Education so that we can "teach our kids".
He was not a practicing Muslim. Anchorage Muslims have never heard of him and have no idea who he was.  He did declare himself a dangerous threat to the FBI so the least they could have done was put him on a watch/no-fly list.    He did say he was watching ISIS videos with possibly mind control involved.  It seems to me that the FBI would search his computer and see what videos he was watching and examine them for subliminal messages.  Maybe it wasn't the CIA.   Maybe ISIS is using subliminal messages in their videos for mind control.  The FBI and Homeland Security should probably look into that.  The Bush administration was caught using subliminal messages in campaign commercials https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmZNJnTh2c0 ...so it is not outside of the realm of possibilty.
"The gas attack in Syria is a key test of Trump's resolve: How will he respond to this 'affront to humanity'? How will he respond? Take this opportunity and send  Obama, Hillary, Justin over to the ME, set them in a nice room, keep them there for the 8 yrs. of Trumps'tenure, under a signed contract.. Together with their experience and affinity to Islam, sure they will be able to resurface after that time, with a solution to the problems at hand. Ah, throw in a bonus, include there, Al Gore and Suzuki, let them study climate change some more. You're welcome, Globe.
The addition of NK and Venezuela to the current travel ban was obviously done to counter the criticism that this is a Muslim ban; however, we will see if he can come up with valid and relevant national security concerns to justify these additions or any of the other countries on the list. Trump is intent on banning and taking revenge on anyone that he personally dislikes. I wouldn't be surprised if he tries to travel ban or deport the NFL and NBA in a future order (yes, I am joking... I hope). Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, which has been the country of origin for many if not most terrorists, is notably not on the list.
Curious that you should nitpick this rather obscure point, in the face of world-wide Islamist-based war crimes. And the article states that the terrorist attack could have been done by the Islamic State. You did read the article, didn't you?
I don't know ... if I owned one of those burned-out cars, I might kind of feel like I'd been attacked and that perhaps my new neighbors are threatening my safety.  We need to stop making excuses for Muslim violence. If I'm a guest in someone's home I don't thank them for their kindness by burning their house down, and if I did, I would be arrested and jailed. Muslim refugees shouldn't be treated differently. They are guests in Sweden. Rioting breaks the social agreement to return respect for hospitality.
Mentioning third world countries won't work here. Half my extended family still lives in Indonesia. I'm in contact with members of the traditional Latin Mass communities in Jakarta and Bandung. These communities are able to sustain sung Masses with Gregorian chant Propers in the poorest conditions. The Gregorian chant revival continues apace even in the Muslim world. I've even seen antiphons from the medieval Sarum Breviary translated into Indonesian and set to square notation for the public chanting of Vespers.  I've also recently chatted with an African-American priest who's interested in organizing a solemn high Mass in the old rite with the "Missa Luba" performed liturgically.
Oh come on. Try googling a bit and you'll see that there were numerous articles following the assaults and months later. One of the articles I posted did follow up with several of the victims. And there was no cover up or attempt to hide the events, just the extent of them and since the media had clearly already reported 1000 asssults it's obvious that it wasn't being hidden. Further these were asssults, which while terrible, don't have the media interest that murders do unfortunately.   It seems to me that you're trying, and mostly failing, to blame the media, not for reporting, but for not spinning this into a fear of immigrant Muslims.
To the author: In your article you write, "need to hire more Muslim-Americans, Chinese-American, Russian-American..." Shouldn't it be, "hire more Arab-Americans"? Muslim is not an ethnic group or country  like Chinese or Russian  so why would you designate them that way?
You support the Muslim Ban.  Ergo, you shouldn't call yourself pro-life.
TAQIYYA  is the Islamic practice of deception. The Koran says it is a moral duty to tell falsehoods to infidels, Jews, and Christians to decisive them to promote Islam. Taqiyya is as basic to Islam as charity is to Christianity. No other religion has such a thing and so it is hard for non-Muslims to understand that it actually exists, and is used regularly in Islamic propaganda.   The worst part is that liberal media like the Globe, are now giving us taqiyya, doing Islam’s dirty work.
Good grief. Merkel can't even meet her NATO military obligations, and is too busy funding EU Mediterranean countries going broke as well as migrant Muslim males poised to bring in their huge families with multiple wifes on welfare, to provide any sort of effective leadership in Europe. She should hope and pray that Russia doesn't freeze them out by shutting off their natural gas supplies, and that Trump keeps American NATO forces stationed in Germany.  Doug Saunders should also occasionally consider getting off the lefty narrative bandwagon and do some real thinking for himself in at least one or two of his pieces.
This is great! Let the church be free to practice the christian faith as it is suppose to be. Give freedom to christians just like you have given to muslims e. t. c
Translation: I provided facts because I know my Faith better than you do (unsurprisingly), and you can't refute those facts, so you shriek and flail.  Been Muslim probably longer'n you've been alive.  The only people who have EVER threatened by children and grandchildren are white supremacist types, not Muslims.  Next!
When he said there's going to be mass deportation of the Muslims and Mexicans.  tRump doesn't care if these people are here legally or illegally.  All he sees is brown skin, black eyes, and black hair.
I hold Islam responsible. There should be worldwide condemnation.
Perhaps it wasn't justified then. Perhaps it wouldn't have received Liberal support. But then six Muslims were targeted and murdered, making the motion eminently justified. We're dealing with ALL the facts, remember? Hammering just a single fact, over and over again, is what propaganda does.
What if Canadians don't wish to show solidarity for muslim ideology?
Many people from all over the world are terrified of Muslims as trouble often happens around it. Why would anyone not acknowledge there is a great problem here. To try and white wash it is hiding the truth and hardly addressing the fears of our nation.
Still waiting for our so-called president to express his deepest regrets for the anti-Muslim sentiment and violence that he unleashed, and that helped to elect him.  Stephen J. Remington
Bana is an innocent girl who has been used by her parents and ISIS for terrorist propaganda. It should be noted that this girl's parents are jihadist fighters - as in, the same people who yelled "for Allah!" and then set fire to civilian-evacuation busses, the same people who runs into crowds with bombs strapped to their chests, the same people who beheadded the 11 year-old boy in Syria. https://twitter.com/saa_soldier/status/806257179057491969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw https://twitter.com/Ali_Kourani/status/803346365870964736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw https://twitter.com/ammarjaber8/status/785109861394702336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw https://twitter.com/ammarjaber8/status/781164540071387136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw https://twitter.com/MrTonyMan/status/766660512566435840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Bana is even named after the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hassan al-Banna.
The Democrat party aided and abetted by it's MSM flunkies are perpetrating acts of SEDITION against the duly elected government of the USA... and there can be no doubt about that now.  All these "demonstrations" are intended to overthrow the Trump presidency, and it will soon be met with extreme prejudice.  The extremist terrorists are rallying their people and sucking in naive malcontents out into the streets.  The "demonstrators" are just a basket of deplorables who must be crushed and condemned.  Let the pus pour out and true and loyal American citizens will see and understand the traitorous intent of the leftist feminist liberal Democrats and their muslim allies.  The battle lines are now drawn and Trump will win like he won the election.... in spite of the MSM goebbelian propaganda efforts.
Is this a genius WH ? Last I recall all terrorist actions in the US were by Saudis (9/11), Afghan (Florida night club) and Pakistani (San Bernadino, Cali) origins or homegrown. Or is it a subtle message to the already settled Muslims in the US ? This ban is going to affect folks who have nothing to do with "radical Islamic terrorism" !
The fact that Trump has some Jewish backers, son-in-law or whatever, does not excuse the racism he has inspired with his rhetoric. Unfortunately there are also Jewish racists and bigots, particularly against Arabs and Muslims,  who didn't learn from their own history. Nor does your post convince me that I should tolerate Nazis.
It seems this article completely ignored the elephant in the room. NATO countries and Russia are both  engaged now in a savage struggle with radical Islam. Terrorist incidents have been mounting and now are occurring week by week. In many of the recent cases: the attacks in Stockholm and in Saint Petersburg, the terrorists responsible are ISIL sympathizers. So why, with limited resources, are our troops deployed against a possible invasion by Russia, our ally in the war against ISIL?
every day now another puff piece of muslims
Sharia law can be defined as the Law of (a) God for Muslims.  The Ten Commandments can be defined as the Law of (a) God for Jews and Christians.  Note that they were all written down by men, and presumably match the writer's opinions.
I don’t look at this as a religious issue at all. Ours is an open society, we interact with each other face to face when in person.  People like Mr. Butt who attacks this law as targeting Muslim got it backwards. We disuage face covering in the public sphere in our open society first, and a small number of Muslim women cover their face therefore we need a law for the issue. We will freak out if a person walk into a daycare or a bank wearing a full face covering helmet (and claim cultural, habitual or religious cause) but are asked to accommodate another one wearing a burqa. What is the logics? This policy should be implemented across Canada.
Possibly a radical Islamic terrorist?  Everybody knows they always ride in first class.
I never thought she was funny and could not understand what her appeal was.  Very stupid and tasteless thing to do, especially since beheadings are a everyday reality in Muslim fundamentalist countries and it is not a laughing matter.
Placing persons in detainment camps because of their religion.  And yes, Islam IS a religion.
I thought ISIS was Wahhabi---I don't think that is the same as Sunni. But it is the version of Islam espoused for two centuries or more by the Al Saud.
Muslim Military Families Lives Matter.  Your boy is losing more Republican "support" by the day. I fully expect a Democratic Senate to take over and a House with only a 10 to 15 Republican margin. If you're not angry now, it should be interesting as to your demeanor when your boy loses.  Clinton 2  proposes a fairly small increase in taxes that would be borne almost entirely by the wealthy. Her plan would increase revenues collected by $1.1 trillion over 10 years, according to the Tax Policy Center’s modeling.  By contrast, Trump’s across-the-board tax cuts would represent a far bigger change than Clinton’s proposal. It would lower revenues over 10 years by a LIBERAL $9.6 trillion, according to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis, taking his strategy right out of the Bush 2 compassionate conservatism playbook.
Actually,  he and his wife came to Alaska with the intent of explaining their faith.  It was his mission.  It was his goal.  "The Islamic Post, heralded their arrival: "Shuaib and Maleika Ahmed recently departed to a new frontier in the Alaskan tundra to establish an independent, self-sufficient, purely Islamic village. The family's intentions are to further the mission to unite Muslims and Christians on their similar values."
Canadian law and custom require hiding significant parts of your body. The burqa just carries it a little further. To a nudist, there is little difference between customary Canadian nudity taboos and extreme Muslim nudity taboos.
“...( )...The problem was the inadequate approach to the Centre Islamique, who wanted to have his cemetery WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE POPULATION.  I assure you that the inhabitants of Saint-Apollinaire are NOT AGAINST  a Muslim cemetery, them. They wanted TO SHARE the ground, because they also need this field” Le Devoir
Alceste: I think the rejection of Le Pen had far more to do with her anti-EU stance than amounting to a rejection of her anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric. The French weren't/aren't ready to give up on the European project. Le Pen offered no middle road.
I think the most fascinating point in all this, is that the politically correct term is "islamophobia" and not "muslimphobia". Even the politically correct police therefore acknowledge it's not a "fear" of a *people* but of an **ideology**.  And yet it's still pushed. We are to be silenced in our opinion, not towards a *people* but towards an ***idea***.  That, I think, is extremely telling.
We have existing anti-hate laws that protect us. Do we need a motion that looks into crimes against each group to come up with an action plan? Imagine separate motions for each group.... Jews, Christians, Blacks, Latinos, Muslims, Native Canadians, etc. It might make some people feel good - unless you are a group left out.  All Canadians support a free and tolerant society and would welcome a renewed effort by the government to find ways to improve it.   So let's put petty politics aside and put an inclusive motion before Parliament and get on with it.
What I object to is when journalists don't ask the important question: what meaning do the women attribute to the clothing? Does it go along with the full behavioral complement, i.e. gender segregation, no social interaction with unrelated males and non-Muslims, etc., or not?  They keep mum on that...
We have had this discussion before, but to reiterate, Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country, celebrates Christmas. Christianity is not an indigenous religion there - it came with the colonial conquerors. And yet they respect all religions in their country.  France and Britain, precursor nations to Canada, don't have any Jewish holy days as public holidays. Even though the Jews have been there for centuries.
Islam promotes the marriage of underage girls as well as the submission of wives....if they let go of these traits than yes let's be more accepting. Then again I am speaking from no actual knowledge of the Quran, would love if somebody debates me and proves this wrong.
Back to the original Executive Order, it was a ban of everyone coming from the six Muslim nations, FOR 90 DAYS, while his office was able to improve, upgrade, the current application, screening and vetting of people coming into the United States - to EXTREME VETTING.  So what has his office been doing to improve it for the last 210+ days since he first signed it January 27, 2017?
But when Muslims do the same to an extremist, you insist that all Muslims are terrorists anyway.  Salman Abedi was reported to authorities, you know.
He's going for the Muslim vote. He needs it when he runs for guvnor.
As many others have pointed out, the US has never had a terror attack by refugees or other documented travelers from the seven banned countries. However all of those Muslim nations Trump says are OK to send people to the US have sent us terrorists in the past. So what's the real reason? Trump owns all or part of businesses in the exempted Muslim nations.
No, Harper played on anti-immigrant, anti Muslim prejudices of many in his base.  Also ran on anti-gay until he got his minority and happily lost the anti equal marriage vote in parliament.  Harper portrayed tolerant in public but let Leitch, Toews, Kent, Pollievre, etc. issue dog whistles of bigotry.
Much as I enjoyed all the wailing and gnashing of teeth in this comment thread, the lamenting is totally unfounded. I'm not yet 30 and I'm of Anglo and Indonesian descent in equal parts, so not only am I too young to have grown up "pre-Vatican II", I probably have more Islam in my family history than Catholicism.... and yet, I love the traditional Latin Mass.  As an instituted acolyte, I frequently assist at solemn high Mass in the role of subdeacon despite being married with children, and I hope to continue to assist in the old rite if God wills me to advance to the so-called "permanent" diaconate. I also manage my own men's schola for Gregorian chant, which sings for Masses in both the Ordinary and Extraordinary Form. Most of my chanters are under 30. We are the future of the Church.
hey peel, I want accomodation for my religion.  I need 15 minutes the same time each Friday as the muslims.  what do you mean NO.
That's from the preamble of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  I view it as one of many summits in the Western legal and political tradition.  How many Muslim majority countries have a constitution like Canada's?  Perhaps they should embrace Western ways (and perhaps the West could stop supporting some of their dictators).
How do the "legal experts" explain that Malaysia, Indonesia, Egypt, Morocco, and other muslim nations are not on the list..?
Sorry the so called ‘Muslim ban’ is but.   More than half the worlds population of Muslims is impacted not at all by the ban on travel from the failed states included in the ban.
Blazing writes:  "Deep State"  --  Snork!  Let me guess...... "9/11 was and inside job"   and ..... "Obama is a secret Muslim"......"Russia didn't invade Ukraine"?  Need a nice bridge?  I have a beauty for sale.  But it's cash and carry, only.
If progressive Catholics took Islamic theologies as seriously as they do their Christian counterparts - and that includes an honest reading of Reliance of the Traveler, an authoritative source on Sharia published by the prestigious Al-Azhar University in Cairo - then they would find it easier to make the necessary distinction between Islam as a power structure and individual Muslims subject to that power structure. Catholics who read this publication understand something about religious power structures, I suspect.
Take this absurdity one step further: Stop allowing Christians into Canada who have been overtly persecuted by Muslims because they are likely to harbour Islamophobic thoughts.
Noor is a Somalia American Muslim who does not like Christians so he shot her based on her religion that's what I see happened I could be right or wrong but I feel I am right.
It is not a "Muslim ban" or a "travel ban", it is a 90-day delay for visitors- regardless of their faith- from 6 predominantly Muslim countries with very weak and dysfunctional governments (or ongoing internal strife). This "ban" does not affect  Muslims or anyone of any other religion from any other countries with a large Muslim population (Egypt, Malaysia, Indonesia, etc).
It wasn't that long ago that hats with attached veils were a common women's fashion accessory. However, those were Christian women, so it was never a problem. When it's Muslim women, that's a different issue
If it isn't a Muslim ban, then why have multiple courts concluded that it is religious discrimination.    And Obama suspended a specific program temporarily due to a security lapse in that program.  There was a reasonable justification.  There is no reasonable justification for the wide and clumsy sort of ban Trump tried to impose.
I don't belong to a group like National Council of Canadian Muslims, but if there was ever to be a secular group called the National Council of Canadian Canadians, I would join in it. Our first order of business would be to ignore any group that has a suffix or prefix denoting otherness from us.
The FBI has missed so many domestic Islamist terrorists,that were all but handed to them on a silver platter, it has become a sick joke. This guy seems to be a very nice man with good intentions. I hope there is some kind of movement among the Muslim community to reach out to other cultures and, more importantly, take a stronger stand against radicals in their midst. Non-Muslims have been waiting for some kind of sustained, mass condemnation of Islamic terrorism from the Muslim community and have yet to see it. Mostly defensive  rationaliztion and excuses.
I don't understand how your comment is relevant--are you agreeing with a muslim ban which Trump doesn't support anymore?  Are you saying they had it coming, because they were college students, and therefore liberal?
It was cruel to block people who were already approved to come to the USA.  It was like inviting someone to your house only to slam the door in their face.  As for immigrants/refugees/visitors from those countries under the travel ban, it was more akin to not inviting someone over in the first place.  You're under no obligation to invite people in the house, especially if there are murderers hiding within their midst - better to give financial aid.  It should be added that Muslim refugees from Syria are safely (though sadly not comfortably) ensconced in camps in Turkey and Jordan, and can return when the civil war ends (as they are part of the majority group).  Religious minorities like Christians and especially Yazidis are not so fortunate - nor do many particularly want to return to a country where they were subject to genocide.  Canada, incidentally, has yet to give refuge to a large number of Yazidis.
The truth is that the vast majority of terrorists in the country are white Americans, not Muslims. That has always been so. The truth is that all lives have never  mattered in this country. Why worry about healthcare for the poor if you don't care if they live or die anyway. Sadly, in my experience most Americans are very selective with their compassion and empathy.  Fortunately, younger folks tend to have more empathy for folks different from themselves, than their elders.
YPG is fighting for Muslims. So how can an American go into Syria and fight for a foreign entity? If captured, he would be a high value prisoner and USA liability. Sounds like PTSD as he explained his intentions during a drunk. In any case RIP soldier.
Did you feel that the travel ban imposed on people from certain countries was fair? They were blocked from entering our country due to the POTENTIAL that they might emulate the actions of terrorists who they shared commonalities with. There's no difference. Penalizing all the Muslims for the actions of the few must also be fair then?
A very nice editorial and a stark contrast with the editor of Kent Reporter.   I would note that calling a quarter of the US population "deplorables"  fits pretty well with the sort of generalization one sees made by the people accused of "racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia and Islamaphobia".    Could we call it "deploraphobia"?
Along the line Canadians also embraced the humanist doctrine that respects and values the individual within our society while at the same time valuing and protecting the weak and the innocent. That's why painting immigrants, refugees ans Muslims with the same extremist brush is wrong and why people of good nature should speak out against bigotry and prejudice.
So nothing concrete to protest, they just do not like who Trump has in office, got it. If they were against the rape culture they would have never supported Hillary and her husband. They would be a little less tolerant of the issues that the Muslim community brings with their FGM.  This new comment section management system must be boring for all of the liberals who try and vote any thought that disagrees with them as offensive and gets them silenced. It must we a real circle of patting each other on the back to make your point feel better.  This is an example of unions not wanting to lose control of their cash cow. They could care less about education as our test scores and student performance shows that has never been a concern of the Public School officials and their Unions.
What's more important - what a book says or what the followers do?  Christianity has massacred far more people than Islam. Violence has been a key factor in its success for converting people. Islam was a little more gentle - and that is why it has ruled over other religions like Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, etc.  In Catholic colonies, it was either conversion or death. A major reason why not a single Muslim or Jew was left in Catholic Spain, Portugal or Italy(or any non Catholics in all of of South America) in the 16th century. Whereas I can't think of a single country where Muslims wiped out the entire local religion.
95% of people agree with you (including you and I), being civil is a good thing. The problem starts when you can't say proven facts because it hurts someones feelings. It's a problem that many politicians have. For example illegal Mexicans abusing our system, that 9/11 was not a disaster it was a radical Muslim terrorist attack, or the widespread fat people epidemic in the US (to just name a few). But if being civil means ignoring real problems and only caring how it makes someone feel, I don't want to be civil.
I'm not sure whether his positions "go far beyond these three questions of concern" or not.  His positions are ephemeral at best and may depend mostly upon the phase of the moon or the latest poll.    What do you think about polygamy?  Current Federal law prohibits entry of an immigrant who follows polygamy.   (Think about Il Quran which permits up to five (5) wives for those Muslim immigrants.)     "8 USC 1182   (10)  Miscellaneous   (A)  Practicing polygamists    Any immigrant who is coming to the United States to practice polygamy is inadmissible."
Why is the religion of the country relevant? Western troops have been in countries of many different religions. The troops were not there to fight Islam, but fighting to help one faction of Muslims against another. It is only relevant because some Muslim terrorists claim it is.  If we interfere in the civil war in Myanmar to help the Rohyngyas, will we later be accused of having interfered in a Buddhist country, or is religion only relevant when the country is Muslim?
I support the lack of funeral rites for terrorist. I believe it is a step Imans and the muslim community do not take lightly.  I often feel these days that not enough people are loudly, vocally distancing themselves from Daesh and making it very clear that following Islam means denouncing ISIS. It often seems that after an attack, the muslim community all over the world is silent or throwing up chaff by using other extremists (i.e supremacists whom no-one before trump ever took seriously anyway.)  I understand the muslim community suffers greatly from racism and stereotyping after each attack in N. America and Europe. Framing terrorist portrayals in news and movies doesn't help either. But really, one wonders, if muslim people feel they are so very far removed from the religious extremes of ISIS - tacit silence is not the same as standing against something - demonstrate against ISIS in the streets of North America as is your democratic right and I will believe you.
Christianity may well  be (or intend to be) fundamentally peaceful  but various off shoots are not.  Radical Christian extremists find homes in outfits like the Christian Identity movement and The Army of God and so on.  Are you saying because there is no group called RCE , the people who organize themselves with RCE precepts don't exist? Or merely that they cannot be Christians because their ideals are opposite of the larger notions of Christianity ? Like the Muslims who have been saying for years and years that the radical Islamic extremists are not true Muslims?  I think all these folks need to be owned by the larger religious umbrella they shelter under and booted out on their fannies as sick phonies-  Christian, Jew, Muslim,etc.  It is inadequate to the problem to just keep saying they aren't Christian. Owning that religion can be perverted is an important step  which is missing in the larger Christian community- at least in public.
The problem is exactly that some people interpret everything "from a Muslim point of view", even when not appropriate!
A Muslim is a follower of the religion Islam (not a race). Canadian people have not been asked if they support the high immigration that is changing their Canada, creating a vast pool of non-employed on social benefits, higher competition, no jobs for youth, and expanding  the numbers followers of different religions - politicians are too afraid of the answer. Many followers of this religion put their religious beliefs above the law. For example, women are not equal. The media has stopped reporting on their unequal treatment of women completely in some type of misguided attempt to quell intolerance. But we should be intolerant of intolerance and reporting should be honest in portrayal because that is the only way to modernize this belief system and align with the rule of law (that is MY Canada).   The more competition there is, the more intolerant society becomes - high immigration leading to more competition will increase the socio-economic tensions. Wente should learn some history.

islam has had a terrible impact on the western world. Now there is someone in a position of power that recognizes the danger and is willing to do something about the spread of it in the US.
I repeat, cigarettes DO NOT cause CANCER! When will you mor ... What's that you say? Wrong envelope? I repeat, CO2 is a harmless gas! You can't prove a thing that my uncle Fred can't refute. Socialism ... communists ... sunny ways ... LEFTIES Clearly a Muslim plot.
Yes.   Unlike women, gays, lesbians, transgenders, bi-sexuals, blacks, Hispanics, Jews, and Muslims, Non-Students are not "a protected class".  The Oregon Legislature is in session.    Maybe you can get them to add "non-students" to the category?
Where were these scientists when the US government implemented a policy of regime change in predominately Muslim countries from Afghanistan to Libya.  There are 65MM people displaced mostly due to this policy, causing millions to die. It started when the US abandoned the Afghans after the Soviets left.  Now that Trump wants to make sure this instability is not exported to the US, people are up in arms.    The solution of global warming is placed on the shoulders of the middle class.  If you are poor you receive subsidies. If you are wealthy your proportion of energy consumption to your overall budget is far less.  You end up with resentment from this group particularly from home owners.   That group overwhelmingly voted Trump since Democrats abandoned them for their apartment and condo dwellers.
"If only Stephen Paddock had been a Muslim … If only he had shouted “Allahu akbar” before he opened fire on all those concertgoers in Las Vegas … If only he were a member of ISIS … If only we had a picture of him posing with a Quran in one hand and his semiautomatic rifle in another …  "If all of that had happened, no one would be telling us not to dishonor the victims and “politicize” Paddock’s mass murder by talking about preventive remedies."  ---Thomas L. Friedman
Extreme right wing terrorism is not just for those who follow Islam.
One thing that has surprised me as I have traveled through countries with sizable Muslim populations is how welcoming and friendly they often are. Granted, I've seen a few frowns and some things muttered under the breath, but nothing compared to how I have seen obvious foreigners treated in this country.
I suggest to you that the point you are missing is the hypocrisy, which equates with dishonesty, of the opposition to the idea of  one population having to be disrupted to accommodate the right to self determination of another population, when they very people who oppose it were happy to accept and advocate for such disruption on a much larger scale when their own right to self determination was being accommodated.  The justice is that the Muslim world was all in favour of the disruption in 1947 of millions of Hindus and Sikhs, and therefore it is just that they accept the much smaller disruption to accommodate the Jewish right to self determination in the Middle East.
‘Muslim students have observed Friday prayers in schools for about 20 years now.’ Boy-oh-boy a lot has changed since I was in high school.
There is.  The first two Muslims I met in Alaska when I arrived here in 2004 were a 17 year-old young man and his 13 year old sister (wearing full hijab).  They were Native Alaskans.  It was at the State Fair and they prayed 'Asr prayer with my wife and I.  Very nice, respectful, dignified young people.  Wish I'd thought to ask 'em about how all the violence and terrorist attacks they and their people had suffered from Muslim immigrants.  But I was new to the area and didn't know this was a problem here.  And in hindsight, I suspect they'd probably have had much more to say about the violence and terror of Russian Orthodox and white American Protestants.  Moat.  Beam.  PS: That Somali restaurant has great food, if you like it spicy.  I do.
Islamic wars of jihad are not going to end with Aleppo. Aleppo s is just where we are right now. Aleppo today, Kabul tomorrow, Cairo next week. Baghdad next month, Paris,   New York, London, Berlin,  or Montreal  the year after that. We fight  ISIS today, and Al Qaeda again tomorrow.  Later this century  the Taliban, or Islamic Brotherhood, or some new grouping of former enemies who find common a  cause  to wage war on other Muslims all over again.  Muslim  Islamophobia against each other is not going away no matter how many peace treaties they sign.
Nothing is being shoved down your throat and there's nothing "preferential" about this treatment. If Christian students requested a prayer room, they'd assuredly be accommodated. The fact that it'd be hard to FIND a bunch of Christian kids who want to pray during school hours is certainly not the fault of Muslims.
It's your buds over at Stormfront, "Lars."   Join Date: Oct 2013 Location: Germany Posts: 3,616 Freedom lover has disabled reputation Portland: Two stabbed to death on train while protecting Muslims I like it.

Are we seeing the beginning of an uprising against the plague of islam, an uprising which will spread like wildfire into white lands in Europe? Hell, I hope so.

If you're a protestant, jew, or muslim--I agree.
I disagree entirely. Many of the refugees/migrants are coming from North Africa, or even sub-Saharan African. In fact, most of those crossing our borders now are Somalis, according to the media. And most of the violence throughout the Muslim world isn't due to western imperialism but the spreading of a more rigid, brutal Islamic theology the Saudis have spent tens of billions of dollars pushing.
But please, please .... this has nothing to do with Islam which is a religion of peace, with nothing bad to say about Christians and Jews. Just another bad apple .... you know...malesh.
The terror has always been here, ask the indigenous tribes, Blacks, Asians, Muslims. As has the racism, homophobia, inequality. Unfortunately we have presidential candidates who only perpetuate the myths and the prospect for violence except for Dr. Jill Stein, Green Party, and BERNIE Sanders. What has happened is tragic. As a mother, grandmother, I grieve for our AMERICA that doesn't value respect human life.
If Muslims were scattered all over the country equally, no one would think they are all over the place, they would be invisible.  But by concentrating in the same urban areas, they become very visible to those around them who feel "invaded", particularly when they dress in ways that make them easily identifiable by religion.  If they all dressed unobtrusively, and acted just like everyone else, mingling and interacting in a friendly manner with everyone else, no one would be the wiser.
Harvard educated ---  so was George Bush, so were many drunk Kennedys, so were many Saudi princes.  Do you really think the Aga Khan had a SAT score in the top 1%  Same principals for his British birth  And you must be joking referring to his wealth because he was chosen by his father to continue the great work his faith does.  Anyway your rationale is extremely weak.  btw I have great respect for the Aga Khan having become friends with a few Ismali Muslims almost 40 years ago.   However I believe the Prime Minister made a mistake secretly leaving the country as well as vacationing outside the country.
The European bans on the niqab are a backlash against the increased presence of Muslims across the continent.  Muslims represent a much higher proportion of total immigrants, and immigration has recently been much larger (as a percentage of the population) than in Canada.  And there have been far more incidences of Islamic extremist terrorism than in Canada.  Furthermore, the EU has attempted to force member nations to accept a certain quotas of (heavily Muslim) immigrants, leading to outrage, nationalism, and calls for greater national sovereignty.  My view is that the bans on the Nicaq etc are more of a symbolic protest against all of the above real objections to face covering.  In this context, the reactions are more understandable.  But this does not make them right.
You have no idea what Muslim students will be discussing in their Friday meetings. You haven't the slightest idea what it means to be a Muslim today. All that you have is bigotry based on ancient writings. Sorry if that doesn't quite cut it in 2017.
Islam is the religion that keeps on taking.
Try reading the article again.  "The current U.S. ban applies to nonstop U.S.-bound flights from 10 international airports in Amman, Jordan; Kuwait City, Kuwait; Cairo; Istanbul; Jeddah and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Casablanca, Morocco; Doha, Qatar; and Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. About 50 flights a day, all on foreign airlines, are affected.".  Most, if not all, of those countries are Muslim dominated.
Well, going by his own words and actions, he IS "a fascist, racist, sexist, homophobe, islamaphobe, that he is going to send all immigrants out of the country, that he is going to build a database of all muslims".  These are not "untrue statements." These are things he has actually SAID and demonstrated repeatedly that he is and these are the things he will do.  His apologists and spokesmouths even tell us NOT to "listen to what he says".  As for "abolish[ing] abortion", you are (to quote the Trumpster) "Wrong!" He said, "There has to be some form of punishment."  This is what IS "easily verified" because ... you can look stuff up, you know. (Instead of making stuff up.)
I think the Muslim view of Jesus is the same as the progressive view of Jesus, if we look to Marcus Borg or Hans Kung for definitions of the Incarnation. For both Muslims and Progressives, Jesus is a fully human being who related to God in a full and complete way--so much, that He is identified with God. But He's not God-in-a-mansuit, God coming down from Heaven the way Superman came from Krypton and had to disguise his real identity.   Also, I always thought Muslims considered Jesus to be the greatest Prophet, greater than Muhammad, who is the last Prophet, but not necessarily the greatest.
@Ruben Reyes, please see p. 9 of 40 in the Hawaii suit against the travel ban, where it says "President Trump repeatedly campaigned on the promise that he would ban Muslim immigrants and refugees from entering the United States, particularly from Syria, and maintained the same rhetoric after he was elected."
Nick - do you have as much problem with the government run military given we spent about 700billion a year on it.  Do you like the government being in charge of that? I do.   He was sold the rifle because it was legal to.   Being on the watch list was no obstacle for purchase.  You can thank the NRA for that as they do everything in there power to grease the wheel to gun ownership.  More the merrier philosophy.   Now tell us about the Muslim test. Also explain how criminal and serial liar doesn't apply to the presumptive nominee for the R's.
There is a simple solution. Let Jews, Protestants and Catholics use  the same prayer room, at different times to show unity and love. Muslims will certainly appreciate that.
Oh, but not Muslim Islamists.  Got it.
Sure Nathan - going to the Muslim war zone aka Xinjing where Saudi funded terrorists are routinely blowing themselves up , and trying to interview the terrorist sympathizers to do a story on "oppression" is such an great idea. You deserve full of it.
As one who was incarcerated in a WW2 mainland internment camp (aka relocation camp) as a pre-teenager for 4 years, I can relate to and understand the Muslim community's fears and anxiety today.  As Ms Kurahara correctly pointed out "Our country keeps making the same mistakes".  The difference is that today. Muslims draw needless attention to themselves by their attire dictated by their religion.  Too many narrow minded folks draw the wrong conclusion upon seeing this.  Blend in as much as possible to avoid problems.   As a humorous anti-dote that I can laugh at today, mainland Chinese were also looked at with suspicion during WW2 since most caucasians couldn't distinguish a Chinese or Japanese by their looks. In desperation, some mainland Chinese communities started issuing a large "I Am Chinese" button to wear.  That's kicking folks when they're down.
Most of the writers, reporters and media personalities do not live in the real world. On one side they do not struggle with the regular 'working' people, on the other side most have no real wealth and have a left liberal bias.  'Saint Merkel' has the sympathy of the international media as she 'ruled' with a middle to left coalition government Germany. Without consultation of her parliament, without public or tax payer agreement in Germany or consultation of EU leaders -  her personal invitation caused huge loss of life, criminal activities and tens of billions Euros of costs to the citizen of western Europe.  The unlawful actions committed by EU States border guards, police, military and politicians surrendering to the masses of economic invaders (85 % young males) with Muslim background are the reasons for eminent political change in Germany, Holland, France & Austria.  The Voters will toss out the Merkels and others, just like in USA reason will re-establish law & order!
The Saudis are BIG customers for American military equipment.  Wahabism, the extreme form of the Muslim religion practiced in Saudi Arabia, was the driving force behind 9/11 terrorists.  America first, Trump?  No, American business interests firsts.  Collateral damage be damned, eh?
How easy and soon everybody forgets.Does anybody remember the Quiet Revolution?Quebecers were sick and tired of Catholicism being rammed down their throats.The rejection of the Muslim cemetery is not a rejection of Islam but a rejection of religion in general and a victory for secularism,something Quebec has been striving for since the Quiet Revolution.Plus la change,plus c'est la meme chose.
Qatar funds terrorism  but so too does Saudi Arabia with its support for the Wahhabi form of Islam which is at the base of ISIS, Al-Qaeda and other Sunni terrorist organizations.
Ah, the "no true Scotsman" argument. You do know, don't you, that peaceful Muslims likewise disavow violent extremists who use Islam to justify their actions? That they make the same assertion - that violent extremists are not true Muslims? Personally, I usually feel that people can label themselves as whatever religion they wish. However, when someone cherry-picks a religious scripture in order to rationalize violence, it may be the case that they're not really adherents of that religion.
Be skeptical all they want...appears it simply isn't so.  [CNN] Police: Death of Muslim girl not believed to be hate crime http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/national/police-death-of-muslim-girl-not-believed-to-be-hate-crime
As Gorush is an "originalist" clearly his opinion is that the "Muslim ban" is unconstitutional. Judiciary is independent -  Trump brought Gorush to the supreme court dance.. doesn't mean Gorush needs to do the Charleston with Orange Hitler.   Sure that Drumpf will take to twitter at 3 AM whilst doing his daily constitution to condemn him... what a gong show. Chuck Barris would be a better president with Gene Gene The Dancing Machine as VP
The Crimean Tarters kidnapped Ukrainian and Russians and sold them on the slave markets in the Middle East. The Turks kidnapped Christian boys who were brought up from the age of 7 to serve in the Janissaries (infantry units). The slave trade is the reason why there are so many blond and blue eyed people in the Middle East. Worse still, slavery continues in the Middle East to today’s date – although it no longer involves white children. Type into Google the words “slavery Saudi Arabia” or another country and read what appears. The Muslim countries have never apologized for the white slave trade. No compensation has ever been offered to the descendants of the victims. No monument exists on the sites of the slave markets to commemorate the victims. 4. On 3 occasions, Muslims nearly conquered Europe. Twice the Turks reached the gates of Vienna. Muammar Gaddafi, when he was Libyan leader, predicted that Muslims would conquer Europe through numbers and their birth rate.
Why Allan, the one word I changed in my post was "Christian". And it kept getting censored, yet when I changed it to Muslim or Islam, the post wasn't censored. Isn't that amazing?  This post censored 4x already....why is "christian" a dirty word to the progressive left?
If Trinity was a private Muslim University, which required woman  to cover their heads and faces, would  the graduates be allowed to practice law ?
I would be surprised if you could find an actual citation that says we should understand Islamic extremism for any purpose other than to fight it.  I look forward to your producing the reference.
Alex, that attitude is not exclusive to Islam. Perhaps you could suggest religions where reduced family sizes are promoted?
All Christians, regardless of denomination, believe Jesus is the One Way to God. It's why we're called "Christians".   St. Justin Martyr (d. 165) said that there were “seeds of truth” scattered about in the teaching of the great philosophers. St. Paul honored the Athenians for their pious worship of the “unknown” God (Acts 17). Catholics, unlike many/most protestants, believe there are “other sheep” who do not travel with the flock but who do belong to the Shepherd. They may be devotees of Mohammed or Buddha because their hearts have recognized some sparks of truth and goodness in the teaching of those men. If they die good Muslims or Buddhists and are saved, they are saved not by Mohammed or Buddha, but by Christ.   (Your sarcasm and misrepresentation of Christian and Catholic teaching is tiresome)
So his first attempt at combating terrorism has got the 1.2 billion Muslims on this planet incredibly angry.  I would call that proof that he isn't fit to govern.
Any one who wishes to strive for the American dream, renounces allegiance to their homeland, and with the advent of Islamic terrorism, a renunciation of all things Sharia'h, which is anathema to freedom.  I'm fine with any nationality of persons who do not wish to harm us.  The Boston Marathon bombers were on the Russians radar screen, and they had warned the US that this family was troubling, but the Obama Administration disregarded this and allowed tem to become citizens.  Extreme vetting is required. I'd also hope that IRA terrorists would be denied entry to our country
In the two days since Trump's racist immigration ban, Muslims in America are more fearful for their safety because Trump has aroused hatred against them hat would otherwise lie dormant.  The new effort to document hate incidents is needed to show the results of Trump's policies.
I really don't think Islam and Christianity mix very well , maybe we should leave the middle east alone .
Harper also ran a candidate that would come to your home and pee in your dishes.  Doesn't mean Harper was really tolerant of that - at least for his own dishes.  At one time Harper wanted a party of Theo-Cons; all the orthodox religions of the book (Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist) holding hands and hating progressives and gays like Baird.  Baird wisely never "came out" to Canadians or his constituency; he just enjoy the benefits of all the progressives who fought for his rights.  BTW, Harper specifically attacked refugee programmes and had Kenney cut health care to vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers.  My MP sent me dog whistle note asking if I approved of refugees "getting better health care" than me.
Cohen is right. The Aga Khan is the titular head of the Ismaili community. Who, in turn, are the most ecumenical wing of Islam. The Ismaili dedication to development is something that Canadians should be praising and supporting. Stephen Harper recognised this. Only a knee-jerk anti-Trudeau reflex can explain this brouhaha. Why the PM chose not to publicise his weekend can only be explained by a wish to avoid this nonsense. Unsurprisingly, he failed!
Arabs murdered 8 Jews in Tel Hai March 1920. Arabs murdered more Jews in April 1920. Arabs murdered more Jews in 1921. Arabs murdered more Jews in 1929.  "The [1929] riots took the form, in the most part, of attacks by Arabs on Jews .“ “… 133 Jews were killed by Arabs and 339 others were injured…” Are Arabs were shouting "The Jews are our dogs!" & "Islam was spread by the sword!" as they murdered the Jews.  Haganah & Irgun were created for self-defense.  The day after the UN Partition Resolution in November 1947, some racist, xenophobic Palestinians started a genocidal war to exterminate the Jews.  Haj Amin el-Husseini – “I declare a holy war, my Muslim brothers!  Murder the Jews!  Murder them all!”  The war started with Palestinians attacking a Jewish bus driving on the Coastal Plain near Kfar Sirkin  killing five and wounding others. Half an hour later they ambushed a second bus, southbound from Hadera, killing two more. Arab snipers attacked Jewish buses in Jerusalem and Haifa.
I do not see your comment as being at all charitable and certainly not ecumenical in nature.  That you "deplore" the activities of Pope Francis (with no mention of what former Pope Benedict did, say, with Islamic Imams) tells us more than we care to know.
RangerMC cites a news story about a planned attack in Malaysia by Yemenis on Saudis  to justify terrorism in the US by Muslim immigrants on Americans.  Fear is the basis of his support of the executive order -- not logic and reason.
Jihadist groups are saying this proves USA has hatred for Muslims. Geez, I hope their feelings aren't hurt too badly.  This  has to be one of the strangers headlines I've ever read in this newspaper. Does anyone ever edit these articles ? Or is this supposed to be a joke.  Let me see....thems who want to kill us are saying we don't like them ! Okaaaaaay....whatever...
Listen Jack, I lived in Turkey in the early 60's. I KNOW a few things about Muslims and Sharia Law.  I know all these terrorists are FUNDAMENTAL Muslims. The radicals are the ones refusing to follow harsh Sharia Law, commanding believers to KILL or convert all infidels.  Mustafa Kemal Ataturk is the hero who made Turkey secular and put Sharia on the back burner. Further you damn well know what Taqiyya is but won't say it. Thats practicing Taqiyya. Are you a Muslim Jack. If so, which one, Sunni or Shia? Because I know you are an infidel worthy only of death.  Just ask a Sunni, and if they disagree I guarantee a Shiite will.And vice -versa too.
It's International Women's Day and yet the Muslim women who spoke in Parliament launched screeds against "Islamophobia," the most insidious ideological red herring of our time, instead of using the platform to protest against the misogyny and chauvinism institutionalized in Muslim-majority countries.  In 2019 I will not forget your shameless pandering to special-interest groups at the expense of one of our most cherished freedoms, Mr. Trudeau. I doubt my fellow Canadians will forget this either.  P.S. Third time posting this because regressive leftists and SJWs keep deleting it. Afraid of logic, snowflakes?

In the 1930s American journalists for the New York Times  went to the USSR to report on  Stalin's 'Five  Year Plans' and found everything was wonderful. The collective farms were producing vast amounts of grain. Shoe production was at an all time high. People were fat and happy.  What they did not report was the famine that killed 5 million people and the purges that executed as many a 60 million people. In that same vein, journalists today tell us we have nothing to worry about Islam because Islam is wonderful despite all the people being killed.
We bring flowers to the dead be they school kids, Blacks at bible study, Parisians, Africans, Muslims in war zones, civil servants in San Bernadino or dancers at a gay club in Orlando. It's about death among LGBT people joining the massacred. We mourn them. But serial mourning is as pathetic as serial Muslim blaming.   Congress, of all places, found a button to push. Gun violence.  John Lewis was there. I saw pictures of my old friend Judy Chu, identified among the least effective members of Congress, sitting on the House floor being ineffective, but bothering a lot of people. The sit-in has stopped for the moment.   Heard Gabbard was there, but don't know why. Ditto Hirono. There's significant opposition to any gun control  legislation for good as well as awful reasons. Let's light a fire under our representatives so we know where they stand. It's a matter of life or death.
The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Muslim-Jewish comity is the natural result of racism in Trump’s ranks. If Jared Kushner behaves as expected, there may be some renewed tension. I can’t foresee success in reducing divisions in the Middle East. His job is to pander.  I doubt many marriages in Philly are in trouble because of sex on the down low. The biggest cause is always money and the biggest money problem is capitalist exploitation of employees and the unemployed. Heritage is part of the problem, not the solution.  Bishop Frank is swinging from left field. He knows which way the wind is blowing from. I hope that this is his natural bent and am glad he now feels free to speak out. Cardinals Law and Burke are definitely out of the picture.
Multiculturalism should not mean that we (the west) tolerate another culture's intolerance.  If we do in fact support diversity, woman's rights, and gay rights , then we cannot in good conscience give Islam a free pass on the grounds of multicultural sensitivity.   And we need to say unambiguously to Muslims living in the West: If you want to live in our societies, to share in their material benefits, then you need to accept that our freedoms are not optional. They are the foundation of our way of life; of our civilization – a civilization that learned, slowly and painfully, not to burn heretics, but to honor them.
The left......Mr. Kaperneck and his militant Muslim girlfriend in this instance, ruin everything they get involved in  Good job lefties.....you have saved many American athletes from future brain injuries
This seems to be a case of zealous psychic projection employed as a defense mechanism: I MEAN -- You expelled some acrid flatus but are afraid to be accused of it, so you accuse everyone around you of it preemptively. It's an amazingly effective strategy for better or worse.... Now, I claim these Liberals and even many Muslims themselves, are in fact themselves the most virulently Islamophobic among us... Consider the possibility that the Liberal government is soooooo afraid of Islam in all its incarnations, that they enable these measures to protect themselves? The many Muslims I refer to are soooo afraid of Islam because adherents to that ideology are killing each other big-league. Muslims kill each other at a FRIGHTENING rate. Read:Shia VS. Sunni. But you know what's easier than honest debate on this? Blaming President Trump and every Liberal's favorite word: Racism.
When did Islam become a 'race'?
Islam has had a violent history wherever it has spread, and always will. Muslims do not tolerate non-muslims, or muslims of different sects. There is no consensus, nor a mechanism of muslims ever achieving a consensus, and so they will be able to address the verses of the Koran that promote violence and intolerance. The future does not look good.
Yes, religion should be practiced anywhere, including outside of schools.  If it were truly practiced, then we would have far less of the hate that has been shown towards Muslims or other religions anywhere.  In other words, treat your neighbor as you would like yourself to be treated.
Islam frightens me when I think of my daughters in an Islamized Canada, when I think of what happened anywhere else in the world that Islam has gone.  I think this fear is legitimate, not a "phobia".
Many of the recent terror attacks inspired by the Islamic State were carried out by homegrown Americans, not refugees fleeing war-torn countries.

Christian Beaten to Death by Muslim Classmates ‘Whilst Teacher Read Newspaper’  http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/09/12/pakistani-christian-beaten-death-muslim-classmates-teacher-read-newspaper/
There's only a grain of truth to that, first of all, muslims have always fit in quite well in europe. Second, I agree that current labour policies do not invite mass acceptance of mass immigration. What is usually missing from the equation is that much of the exodus from the middle east is due to the destabilizaiton of the region by the United States war in Iraq, something which was predicted.  So its ironic that the US caused the problem, yet claims that it doesn't want ANY refugees from the region it destabilized.       But when the economy tanks, this is what happens, and its no different in Canada or the US than in Europe.
I don't recall anyone being forced to recite the Lord's Prayer at school in Ontario in the 60's and 70's.   Jewish students who comprised many of my classmates did not. I don't have any issue with these prayers, Christian or Muslim, but I can see for for some that the expansion of accommodation to the Muslim religion is coincident with the denouncement of anything Christian, especially Christmas.  I would suggest there needs to be a restoration of  balance.  Christmas doesn't need to be celebrated for all of December but  allowing one or two schools days when people can say "Merry Christmas" instead of "Happy Holidays" would help.
Neither do you. The books of the Jewish Scriptures (Old Testament) were written down by different people in different times for different reasons -- and none of those reasons was to prove Jesus of Nazareth was coming. That interpretation came AFTER Jesus of Nazareth was executed by the Romans, and that interpretation was used to read back into the Jewish Scriptures proof that the Jewish Scriptures foretold Jesus of Nazareth. The Jewish Scriptures stand on their own, and Jews have been using them just fine without Christian interpretation. Plus, Islam's central prophet's name is spelled Mohammed in English. Insulting another faith and its prophets is hardly a way to plea for tolerance of your own.
Obama's "Muslim Ban" https://sethfrantzman.com/2017/01/28/obamas-administration-made-the-muslim-ban-possible-and-the-media-wont-tell-you/
That is not true. Some of the lone wolves have been of non-Muslims heritage who have adopted the faith.
"Let me see if I understand you. You think Islam should be banned because Sharia Law violates the Constitution" . Correct. . "How does that work?" . Sharia Law and its practicioners believe it overrides any government law or agency, and supersedes any enforcement statues which the Constitution would guarantee- it is based on ancient Muslim tribal law, is barbaric, and has no place in a modern, Judeo-Chrstian, Western, Industrialized Democratic Republic.  Does this clarify? . "How can the government tell people what [not] to believe "to protect them from Sharia Law"" . They're not- they're banning Sharia Law.  That's not the contractual law we subscribed to when our Founding Fathers crafted the Constitution. . "Many forms of Christianity and Judaism have rules that would be unconstitutional if the government enacted them." . Which is why they don't. And is also why Christians don't enact their own courts, their own police force, or their own tribunals- which is what Sharia Law is.
The USA has the right to prevent the spread of Islam in it's territory. As for Graham visiting Vancouver, who cares? Will it really make much difference?
Let's compare this inconvenience with the chaos and anger following an islamist terrorist attack and mass murder, and then the hysterical MSM can put it in perspective.
Persecution of people because of their sexual orientation in many (mostly Muslim) countries is despicable. The UN should be far more vocal. They aren't though as most of the countries in the UN are the very ones persecuting them. If Canada saved their lives, I applaud their efforts. However, this secret operation brings forth many questions and concerns for Canadians. The Trudeau government is taking liberties outside of our immigration laws in secret. How often will this occur and what groups will they secretly accept in the future unknown to Canadians? Our country has laws and regulations to follow but the Liberals in their arrogance seem to think that can ignore them. Trudeau promised transparency. So far there has been secret cash for access dinner parties, the squashing of electoral reform when it leaned toward propertional rep instead of the alternative vote that Trudeau wanted, Monsef's ignored questionable entrance into Canada, Trudeau's meetings with ethics Commissioner etc...
"We pray God will remove him"???? Really? Countries North Korea invaded since 1980: 0 People killed North Korean intervention sin last 30 years: 0 The United States has invaded, occupied and/or bombed at least 14 different Muslim countries, since 1980.  (stopwar.org.uk) The United States has killed more than an estimated 1 million Muslims in the last 30 years, according to Stephen M. Walt is the Robert and Renée Belfer professor of international relations at Harvard University. Maybe you should ask your God to get the U.S. to stop invading countries.
IRT Waoanaka:  That was a post of  mind numbing ignorance, the kind that gets innocents killed.  Tolerance is the primary reason these attacks occur.  The perp may have been a UK citizen but he's as Arab Muslim as can be.  The Euro's have been busy being "tolerant" and letting people from terrorist havens into their countries for decades and sadly this is the end result too many times.   You and Doug Chin separated at birth maybe?
Iranian citizens who belong to ethnic or religious minority groups - such as Azeris, Kurds, Baluchis, Baha'is, Sufis, Sunnis, Ahwazis - face discrimination and persecution. They are subject to suspension from universities, job dismissal, unlawful arrest, illegal search and confiscation, torture, and even the death penalty, for the crime of belonging to a particular ethnic or non-[Shiite] Muslim religious group. For those who are arrested, the conditions in prison are inhuman, and they are often kept in isolation and not allowed to have contact with anyone outside the prison.
Did Ms. Khan escape criticism? The article noted she's heard quite a lot of it.   White Canadians were apparently tired of holding their tongues around persons of colour or those of the Muslim faith. So once they found someone they figured "deserved" a talking to, they let her have it.   All I read here is a lot of people having a temper tantrum. So what if some student said something uncivil? Who cares? But no, apparently, she needs to be taught a lesson...  You could just rise above this you know. Seeing as her words don't actually threaten you in the slightest...
Muslim views discussed by Brigitte Gabriel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry3NzkAOo3s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guXBTgAxhIw http://www.israelvideonetwork.com/brigitte-gabriel-reveals-the-muslim-brotherhood-plan-for-america/ https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidnoriega/meet-the-charming-terrifying-face-of-the-anti-islam-lobby?utm_term=.xg3dOljA3#.cdpdGnQYW
Obviously forcing under aged girls to marry is unlawful, and one might wonder about the sheer number of 'celestial marriages" that seem to happen. (How do they support all those wives and children?). Even in Muslim countries, where it is possible to have more than one wife, few do so.  However, if you are dealing with adult men and women- whether it is called polygamy or polyandry, you might run into rights issues.. Interesting.
If we keep killing Muslims we can expect Canadians at home and abroad to be killed. Our troops should be brought home. They are engaged in hopeless and immoral fighting. They and their families deserve to live in peace, or, if necessary, defend Canada, not attack other countries.
they need to be able to go to work or school, work towards financial independence, take care of their children with care - that's a skill, recognize the modern economy and legal system, recognized individual and collective rights in the international economy,  be able to learn a marketable skill, able to follow modern laws and rules, peace behavior,  some Muslims laws are very old.  Recognize Modern business is independent and international and competitive with laws and rules. The government is involved in social welfare, citizens pay taxes for services and are free  people. Follow the law, northern economies are limited due to heating costs, long term welfare is available in the south at a lower costs. That's what they are now asked in the USA. They must also accept ethnic diversity while also recognizing ethnic towns and neighborhoods are available
It can be reasonably surmised some of the $10M Canadians paid to Khadr will be distributed to his family, who will use it to support Islamist groups engaged in terrorism.  Perhaps we should already start to fund the contingency account for when we are sued by the victims of these Khadr-funded Islamist groups for giving him the money that foreseeably led to their victimization.  Of course, when it comes to Trudeau, foreseeability of what might result from his actions, thoughts and musings isn't his strong suit, as the massive lineup of new "refugee" claimants cropping up everywhere can attest.
Really?!  The ADL Director is "so far-left", "typical", & "ignores the threat of domestic attacks against Jews by Muslims"?!  Well, those notions defy logic.    As read by many American Jews, [cf.https://m.facebook.com/TheRAC/], the threat of harm to Jews by Muslims is relatively small-scale, & certainly does not warrant an un-American action of excluding half a billion people.  You'd better rethink reality as it is, not as your preconceptions want it to be.
Halal is different from Kosher. Halal is insidious . Don't give us your taqiyya . Taqiyya is uniquely Islamic.
axel53, your prejudices are visible.  Why is this a Trudeau thing?  If you want to limit it to one  party, you have a very high mountain to cross.  Your reference to him visiting "an area heavily-populated by Muslims" suggests you have a racist bias.  You should review why racist attitudes are anathema to a healthy country.  (Perhaps you might need to look up the word "anathema" first.)
there were two partition plans in 1947....one was the partition of India to create the Muslim state of Pakistan to accommodate the right of Muslims in that area to self determination...14 million Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs were displaced in the largest mass migration in history, and hundreds of thousands (and maybe millions) of people were killed...the second was the plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and Arab (mostly Muslim) state, to accommodate the right of the Jewish people to self determination and self government in the form of a sovereign Jewish state in a tiny slice of the Middle East where Jews have lived continuously for three thousand years, including places like Libya, Iraq, Tunisia etc where they predated the Muslim conquest...the Muslim worlds seems okay with the first partition, but treat the second as an unthinkable crime..and by insisting on the "right of return" have rejected the idea of a Jewish state.  The "colonial" argument is a Euro centric conceit.
(The killings of the two Canadian Forces soldiers occurred after Parliament voted to send war jets abroad to join the U.S.-led coalition bombing the Islamic State).  It was most appropriate that the attack was made on Parliament Hill. That is where the decisions were made to join in the attack on Afghanistan and continued participation with the US, now in Syria.  So polticians are the source of the switching of RCMP criminal activites to anti-terrorism.   It seems so simple - stop interfering in Muslim countries  and Muslim supporters will have no reason for attacking  Canada.
In order to understand the term "islamophobia" we must also understand Islam's own misogyny, homophobia, hatred of Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Europe, America, democracy, dogs, free speech, human rights and now even Canada, and everything else not permitted (haram) by Islam. Even open and blatant racism against white people is now halal  (permitted) .  They want us to believe we are the bad guys.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU7FtJ64z2Y
Ha, yes, let's see how many come back...  I know some of those Canadians who moved to the US for better opportunities a decade or two ago, and love to ridicule Americans when they come back to visit. Somehow that isn't enough to make them come back.  Kind of like all those westerners who go work in Saudi Arabia, or all the Muslims who emigrate here, they like the more prosperous lifestyle, not the society, but what's more important...?
There's only one problem with your analogy Mr. Oshiro - the Jews never committed acts of Terror. And I would liken the imprisoned German citizenry to people fighting against tyranny within their own borders.  If this is Nazi guilt on behalf of Merkel, it is definitely misplaced. There are marches on the streets with throngs of Muslims advocating for Sharia law in Germany. Muslims interviewed in Germany haughtily state that they will out populate the Europeans and dominate the land.  German citizens are beaten in the streets, German women are raped.  And our American Press speak nothing of it. This is what is propagandistic- deliberately depriving American citizens of knowing the whole of the truth that is going on in Europe presently and I find it shameful. I abhor power politics and violence in all forms regardless of where it comes from. And, unfortunately, it is coming from Arab states. Muslims themselves need to fight against this hatred and violence.
False perceptions? Quite often it's just common sense.  Islamophobia happens  when you actually do understand Islam. If you aren't  frightened  by what is  inside Islam, the Koran and happening in mosques across Canada  you are not thinking clearly.
I agree that it doesn't belong but I also don't agree with the fact that as a Christian I would likely be tortured and killed in a multitude of Muslim countries around the world-yet I'm being told to be tolerant--tell me how many Christian churches/Jewish synagogues there are in Saudia Arabia?
Ok, so how did this fear mongering comment make it through the filter?  Religious race-baiting drivel is acceptable in a forum of adult discussion?  Since when?  Very nearly all of the victims of so-called "Islamic terrorism" are moslems.  We have 14,000 firearms murders in North America each year.  Since September 11, 2001, we have had, in total, fewer than 10,000 deaths due to terrorism of all kinds, including service personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In that same time period there have been roughly 500,000 firearms deaths in the US, of which more than 220,000 have been murders.  The number of accidental deaths due to children playing with firearms in the US is roughly the same as the number killed by terrorists.  Timothy McVeigh, Charles Manson, and Jim Jones were all Christians, therefore, by your "logic" we should label all Christians as potential terrorist fanatics and refuse to allow them into the country ...  Kaganovitch merely demonstrates that not all fanatics are moslems.
Understanding Muslims. Listen to Brigitte Gabriel who was born in Lebanon to a Maronite Christian family. Copy the websites below and paste to your browser & listen to what she says about Muslims. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guXBTgAxhIw http://www.israelvideonetwork.com/brigitte-gabriel-reveals-the-muslim-brotherhood-plan-for-america/ https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidnoriega/meet-the-charming-terrifying-face-of-the-anti-islam-lobby?utm_term=.xg3dOljA3#.cdpdGnQYW
Respecting the right to speech doesn't mean not reacting to it. Your argument is a false equivalency.   But let's take the next step on your scenario: What are these skinhead players advocating with their Nazi salutes? If indeed it is a salute to a repugnant murderer and advocating the genocide of a race, that very well could fit under "fighting words", which are constitutionally NOT protected. Now that's a narrow fit, to be sure, but it's important to realize that "free" speech is not the same as anarchic speech - there are limits.   For instance, it is illegal to make verifiable threats (e.g. "I'm going to kill you") and incite crimes  ("All Muslims must die!") against anyone and for any reason.   Brandon's taking a knee, while repugnant to some, doesn't present a clear and present threat and there are no fighting words beneath his action, as he went on to explain and demonstrate.
The current laptop ban is very similar to Trump's immigration ban - (1) The current laptop ban applies to flights from Muslim countries. (2) The immigration ban applies to people from Muslim countries.  Both (1) and (2) do not apply just to Muslims but the Hawaii Muslim community and AG Chin says the immigration ban (2) targets Muslims (i.e. religion).  I am talking about CURRENT laptop ban not future laptop ban.  With the current laptop ban, there is no mention of vetting.  The article does not say that they are checking where the traveler was before he is scheduled to fly out of the mentioned airports where the laptop ban is in place.
The authors of this article continue to claim that this motion was brought forth in response to the tragic killings in Quebec City.  The facts are that this motion was first presented in Dec 2016,  one month before the killings, and  two months after another anti-islamophobia motion had already passed unanimously in the House of Commons.  While I would understand a motion expressing outrage and sympathy for the murders, I don't understand the need to present the same motion twice.  One wonders whether the Liberals were disappointed that the first motion against islamophobia passed unanimously, and decided to present a beefed up version so as to sow disaccord.  With 69,000 signatures in support of this motion, it seems that the majority of Canada's one million plus muslims were not very interested in pursuing this.  Meanwhile, it seems that the majority of muslims are getting caught in the crossfire, as the Liberals use less moderate muslims (or is it vice versa) to pursue their agenda.
Another "friendly" little muslim boy from down the street.  Wake up, people.
M-103 is the beginning of demands to censor any criticism of Islam under the guise of fighting Islamaphobia. Google the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights on Islam. You see, the UN's version is too "western" and doesn't take into account the "cultural relativism" of Islamic countries, which judges human rights based on the only law that counts, Sharia Law. Any criticism, humor, or satire levelled against Islam should therefore be illegal, as it amounts to "blasphemy" (punishable by death in the most "pious" countries). I would challenge the Globe's smug editorial board to address the double standard staring everyone in the face, why is Islam more deserving of protection than other religions? Seinfeld, Monty Python, Family Guy, South Park, etc. - religious satire is a common them of our public discourse, there are no sacred cows in secular societies, free speech is either free or it isn't: Theo van Gogh, Danish cartoons, Charlie Hebdo, Satanic Verses, etc.
Are you serious?????? The computer lab is unavailable to the rest of the students because Muslim kids are praying in there? How about they built their own muslim schools like the catholics do.
You quoted definition (UNFOUNDED HOSTILITY towards Islam, and THEREFORE fear or dislike of ALL or MOST MUSLIMS), yet when you pretend to debate that very definition, you "refined" (?) and re-defined it to suit your 'argument', removing the essence of it, hence arguing with what suits you, and not with what was in the the definition.
Clearly, the PM has identified in Muslims a constituency whose vote can be captured.   That explains why this self proclaimed feminist is happy being photographed in locations in mosques where half his cabinet would not have the right to stand.   It also explains his communiqué, issued at the beginning of Ramadan, which states that it "commemorates the revealing of the Qur'an to Prophet Muhammad".   Note that this statement presents as fact a religious teaching. Unless we now have a state religion the statement should have been qualified by stating "which Muslims believe commemorates..." or something along those lines.  Query whether the PM would ever issue a statement to on Assumption Day stating that this holiday commemorates the day the Blessed Virgin rose into heaven?  All this suggests that his government will try to give as broad an interpretation to 'islamophobia' as possible.
Better title would be bad president...and Nate's comment is not closely parallel...this is more like the Bush Whitehouse and Dick Cheney's oil meetings. Didn't they try to block access to the records of visitors so he would have to tell who he meet with? But the real issue is that we are seeing extreme ideologs taking over in the vacuum of Trump's brain. No wonder Jeff ain't quiting, he's got of room full of true believers to create a Nixonian excuse for destroying America...'cause that's really the danger here. Funny too because some of the talk is a state's freedom to choose and then he's going after pot laws...but again, because it's an agenda. It's extreme radical views, as clearly pointed out by the Pope's people, that dismisses science, best practice, rationality, in favor of blind faith. Sound like we have looped back to the very people they most fear, radical Muslims. We do have an attempt to impose a version of 'Sharia law' here, it's called 'The Christian Nation.'
I don't feel like he represents me. He won't condemn those groups specifically, yet he has no trouble condemning foreign terrorists, undocumented workers, and Islamic terrorists. So no, he most certainly does NOT "represent all Americans."
Will moslems, buddhists, sikhs, hindus, and other non-christian groups enjoy the same freedoms?  Don't bet on it.
Civic pride and love of family has nothing to do with Muslim prayers. These prayers don't need to be accommodated in our public schools. There's a mosque down the road for that.
Ha, so you truly believe Muslims learned to hate us only 60 years ago, thanks for the laugh. Jews and Arabs/Muslims have been hating each other since ancient times cowboy bebop. If you're trying to make a point then blame the UN, they're the morons who originally granted the land to Israel and then the Brits controlled the area, until they didn't. The Brits pulled an Obama, immediately the Jews followed UN game plan, were attacked by surrounding Arab nations, War broke out, the Arabs lost.   You can also blame the liberal democrat Harry Truman for Muslims hating us, if it pleases you.
Let those puppies grow up to be beautiful German Shepards..... then use them to interrogate Muslim extremists like this guy....
"...The federal government plans to take in 40,000 refugees this year, down from 55,800 in 2016, despite concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump’s tough line on refugees and other immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries...." . . OK, but since I have read that the Syrian number for this year will be 40,000, does that mean no refugees from any other country? . . And as for "handling it well", since most people in Canada do not live in Toronto, or Vancouver, it could be interpreted "since I don't see any changes in my community, I guess its' OK. Just don't bring it here"..  . . As usual, if you ask carefully crafted questions, you could devise a survey that showed a majority of Canadians hoped Winter was all twelve months of the year...
Quebec stamped out the english language, why would we surprised at banning face coverings. OK so a bit of an exaggeration but so is the author's over the top defense of all things Muslim.
I'm giving odds it was a Muslim
I actually don't care who the majority are now, or in 80 years from now. Canada is a great place to live, and will always attract people looking for a better life.  My family can trace their time here from the late 1600's, they sure didn't come hoping for a worse life, and they were members of an immigrant minority. They built the country we now live in, and future generations of immigrants will continue to build the country, as the old immigrants did.  A society constantly changes, are you crying over the fact that Aboriginals in Canada are a minority?  I went out and asked my Muslim co-workers how many children they have, the number ranges from zero to two, seems pretty typical for 2017 to me.
The book in question tells of an attack that kills the President and most of Congress, an attack by religious fundamentalist terrorists who  launch a revolution, suspend the United States Constitution, take away women's rights, and establish a sexist, theocratic totalitarian state oppressing the masses with theocratic barbarity.  And for the religion chosen, the creepy, fundamentalist terrorist religion?  The writer of course chose Christianity, thus assuring a large following of fawning leftists and plenty of prizes and awards from their ilk in the ladder of literary politics.  Had the writer chosen Islam, her book would be condemned as hate speech for fanning the flames of Islamophobia, and she would have been condemned as an outcast pariah by human rights councils and academics, facing costly legal fees such as those foisted upon Mark Steyn for his writing.  Forget the dystopia of her book: We ALREADY presently live in a deranged world even without any fictional flourishes...
Well The Brotherhood of Peace aka The Seventh Century death cult known as Islam is at it again!   Cue the teleprompter so The great one, comrade Obama can yet again preach to us about how guns are bad and we need more "common sense " gun laws. Never let a tragedy go to waste.   Blame it on the gun right WaveMaker?
he is a muslim
Not necessarily, Gay. The Christian community in Syria has been inclined for a long time now to support their government against the rebel forces. I'm not well read on this issue, but as I understand their perception, it goes something like this: The original rebellion in Syria may have been led by students and others seeking an end to tyranny, but by now the bulk of the rebel movements have been taken over by Islamist of varying degrees of extremism. ISIS and others determined to wage war on the world aside, the bulk of the rest of the rebels are assumed to want to set up a globally peaceful democratic Islamic state which would domestically crack down on secular and non-Muslim religious elements...as happened democratic Egypt.   Unfortunately, it seems these Syrian Christians believe their well-being is best served by a dictator. What we see and what they see is just not the same. They fear the tyranny of a democratic majority more that the tyranny of a ruthless dictator. How horrible
The Trump campaign promise of 2015 to ban all Muslims is moot and inoperative when Trump reversed his campaign for an all Muslim ban into a ban on Muslims only from and only from certain countries in 2016 prior to the Nov. 8 election.    .
>>She makes some good points, but some posters see red at the sight of her hijab. . Her hijab IS  red.  Regarding the good points - what are they?  Clearly the objective is to cram in as much as "Islamophobia", "racist", "hate"  in a column.  The writing is atrocious in fact -  just look at these two paragraphs:  "What drove this man to allegedly commit this act of terrorism? In order to answer this question, we need to understand the context behind the attack. It is vital if we really want to confront the roots of extremism."  Yes, what would drive him to do so? You want to confront the roots of extremism? Start with reforming Islam.   “After the Brexit vote, hate crime against East Europeans and visible ethnic minorities increased, while after the atrocities in Manchester and London, the attacks are directed just against those perceived by bigots to be Muslims, "  What a misery....indeed.
Well, what is hard for a Democratic society to understand is that in Muslim countries religion is a part of their laws (sharia law) and culture. But in our country there is a separation of church and state.   In Muslim countries religious rules and customs are enforced by the government. So, allowing Muslims into our country in great numbers may bring a lot of issues that they will try and resolve themselves because the U.S. laws do not allow for religious doctrine to be enforced by the government. They will ultimately get elected and attempt to fundamentally change our way of life to theirs.
Do you think for a second Muslims will be content to have Jews pray in the prayer room?
Maybe,  Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain are agreeing with U.S. president Trump's request for Muslim countries to help fight Islamic terrorism.  Maybe Qatar should stop supporting Islamic terrorists.  Shouldn't Iran want Qatar to stop supporting Islamic terrorists?
Arab Leaders are very selective. and   how they treat other religious minorities  in their own countries They should  look i in their own   mirrors..  As an example the  Christian  Copts  who were in Egypt well before the Arab Conquest do not have a particularly easy time.  .      Saudi Arabia does not allow any other non Muslim   religion to  practice there.  Interestingly  from  historical records Jews were an important group in  that areas before the rise of Islam. Nearly a million Jews wee expelled from Arab Countries after the establishment of the State of Israel .wit h confiscation of their f property.  The long established Jewish Communities who contributed greatly to their countries well being are no longer in Iraq Syria, Egypt Algeria and Libya. .   Alexandria in Egypt was a haven during the 2nd world war for Jews from France, Greece and Italy.  What a difference today.  that Jewish people are not allowed to be part of arab  countries..
I can agree with the sentiment expressed by the G&M.  However, I don't think that the condemnation be restricted to anti-Muslim acts.  We already have protections within the Canadian Charter of Rights to protect all Canadians from discrimination regardless of race, creed, sexual orientation, etc.  Let's just say that anti-Islamic bigotry is unCanadian.
I think that many moderate muslims are equally or more afraid of the radicals.
Thanks for your reply. But who is condemning all Muslims? As individuals, Muslims are as good or bad as the rest of us. But they are shackled to a scripture that defines Islam, a system that forbids free thought and expression, i.e. apostasy and "blasphemy". (It's worth noting that at least one Canadian imam has called for the mockery of religious figures to be criminalized.)  In this respect, Islam is not like other "faith groups". One is born into it and forbidden to leave or to renounce its nastier tenets. That's part of what makes it so frightening to those raised in Western traditions forged during the Enlightenment.
Except he didn't "murder" a million muslims...did he? I love how ideologues like yourself bandy around statistics that you repeat endlessly, without knowing where they came from. In fact,"Iraq Body Count" a leftist, anti-American organization has what is considered the best count of all those killed in Iraq since 2003. The overall body count since 2003 is 268,000 - most of whom were killed by their fellow muslims. Facts are important.
Notwithstanding the fact that hundreds of French citizens have been murdered in Islamist terrorist attacks in the past two years, the French have remained calm (there have been no bigoted killings against Muslims, unlike in Canada) and the French have eschewed the far-right (unlike in USA and UK). In my opinion, an important reason why the far-right has been suppressed in France, in spite of multiple provocations, is due to France's strict and uncompromising laws on secularism.  The same could be said for The Netherlands and Austria. Perhaps Germany too (we'll see).
he attacked in the name of islam nothing eles
I don't know what the % of population Muslims are in Canada but in my country Australia they make up about 2% but occupy just about all of the headlines. An increase to anything beyond 10% would probably generate civil conflict. Where are we going with Muslim immigration?
It's not Muslims attacking Copts, it's terrorist extremists.
Canada's Minister of Immigration is a Muslim born Somali who came to Canada in his teenager years. This is completely absurd. This guy did not even grow up in Canada and learn our values as a child. While he was in Somalia I was growing up in Toronto, playing hockey, skiing, learning what being a Canadian is. Not worried about religion in schools or a first time MP muslim pushing for M103 which is a complete farce which will contribute to much anger among Canadians.
Johnny - sadly "Christian" terrorism is just as real as "Islamic" terroism.   McVeigh's horrific crime wasn't the last terrorist incident in this country to be carried out by a self-described Christian.        * Tim McVeigh carried out his bombing in 1995 (168 dead, over 600 wounded).      * Eric Rudolph carried out four bombings before he was finally caught in 2003.  He didn't blow up a marathon - he did bomb an Olympic celebration.      * "Christians" have murdered doctors and attacked (arson, shootings, bombings) medical clinics on a regular basis from 1995 to the present (e.g. Colorado Springs 2015).      * White Supremacists - who typically see themselves as defenders of "Christian" culture - have carried out terrorist acts of various kinds from 1995 to the present (e.g. Charleston 2015).  We (I am a Christian) live in a glass house.  We should think carefully before throwing stones.
I have worked less & make less money to make my income being under some threshold to minimise impact of Liberal tax changes.   Next year, I move back to US to avoid this socialist & pro-Muslim government 's tax grab from hard working people.
OMG-and I've NEVER typed that before!   This is the FUNNIEST thing I've read in years:  "After all, governments – if they are truly democratic – must listen to the views of their citizenry. Various levels of government often say they aspire to consultative models of governance."       I didn't read anything after that because its so preposterous.   Gosh yes, heaven forbid our citizenry make decisions (which they never do, in fact are never even seriously 'consulted') about say, muslims.   Because some woman made a comment so outlandish that its used in meetings!   Meanwhile, the feds bring in thousands of refugees during an economic downturn who now will be on provincial welfare rolls.  Oh, the 'post truth'!
franco prairie: The issue you address was recently discussed in an article that was published in the NY Times, entitled "Is Free Speech Good for Muslims?" My understanding of the gist of the article is that Muslim immigrants in the West have in many cases moved from very illiberal societies and yet many of these immigrants want to fully exercise their right to benefit from liberal values and protections in the West while simultaneously rejecting the aspects of liberalism, like gender equality, LGBT rights, and the ability to openly and vociferously criticize religion, that aren't consistent with what they believe to be Muslim values. To me, the situation appears to suggest a clear philosophical double standard (i.e. 'freedom to benefit us but not others'), which should be called out. We need leaders in government who are honest enough to openly tackle this.
And so people of Canada, with Alceste help you see the clarity of the  issue.   Don't go away angry, Alceste, just go away.  I"m going to quote Ayaan Hirsi Ali here, hopefully it'll make it through the G&M censors and will make an impact on Alceste:  “Multiculturalism should not mean that we (the West) tolerate another culture's intolerance.  If we do in fact support diversity, woman's rights, and gay rights , then we cannot in good conscience give Islam a free pass on the grounds of multicultural sensitivity.   And we need to say unambiguously to Muslims living in the West: If you want to live in our societies, to share in their material benefits, then you need to accept that our freedoms are not optional. They are the foundation of our way of life; of our civilization – a civilization that learned, slowly and painfully, not to burn heretics, but to honor them.”
Who is ranting? No one  we are asking why Muslims are getting special treatment in a democracy that protects lal opinions?  That is not democracy that is liberal fascism
saith the same Frederick minshall who loudly proclaimed he would take up arms against Americans if it comes to nuclear war with muslims in the mid east. http://alaskapride.blogspot.com/2012/09/local-alaska-muslim-implies-he-would.html
So "muslim religious belief" is that women must cover their faces or be considered immodest, that is not just an extreme wahhabist interpretation?
Why not allow a Muslim private law school?   If lawyers are professionally competent they shouldn't be barred for their religious beliefs.
A 'brand new' immigration order?  Wow! What a great idea. Where did that come from? Maybe from watching CNN - a network Trump hates but watches feverishly in his bath robe 'till the wee hours of the morning. The usual line-up of CNN legal beagles all came to the conclusion that El Presidente could sign a new, improved Muslim ban while still fighting it out in the trenches for the crazy one written by Bannon and Guiliani. Gee, if only Alan Dershowitz could have gone the extra step and written the order for him and held it up to the camera. Could have saved Bannon another sleepless night.  But the face saver for Trump is that, as he said Friday night, the new order will be essentially the same as the old one. Did he even read the Ninth Circuit decision? A new order mimicking the old one is likely to meet the same fate in the courts. The lunatics are still in charge of the asylum.
Why would the Muslims want their cemetery in a small rather isolated town in which they have no population? It is very possible they have plans to move en masse to St Apollinaire, by buying up property when values drop.  Forcing the cemetery issue is a way to get the town to submit.
nigelnigel: "Much as racist has become the go-to phrase for folks who dislike Muslims, ..."  'Racist' also gets inappropriately applied to those who oppose illegal immigration.
Trump has demonstrated contempt for the rule of law. He has not only refused to enforce certain laws; he has become a serial lawbreaker himself and counseled others to violate the law. Trump is undermining Obamacare, which is currently the law of the land. He is advocating police brutality. Plus, he has illegally bombed Syria, killed large numbers of civilians in Iraq and Syria, instituted an unconstitutional Muslim Ban, violated the Emoluments Clause and obstructed justice. Each of these actions either violate or indicate an intention to violate the law.
RangerMC, No wonder you're a Trump supporter.  Apparently, you're reading only articles that endorse Trump's zany behavior.  According to the article you cited, Trump's promise to ban all Muslims from entering the US is equivalent to saying "mean things" and should be ignored.
I believe that the Canadian author Ali A. Rizvi has written about this subject. He is a muslim with an interesting analysis.
Infiltrating power organizations is how sharia starts. Britain and other European countries are seeing radical Islamists getting elected then changing laws to get Muslim religion extra rights.  then of course they infiltrate the political parties and the slope steepens to outright sharia law. i.e. our minister who turns a blind eye to Muslims crossing borders.....  Why doesn't anyone see these actions as subversive and a direct threat to the rights of ALL PEOPLE!  As you liberals yap about rights  you are losing yours....  wake up!!!!
Numbers do not confer legitimacy in the world of ideas, and hence in the world of morality. We simply do not know what Islam truly is because we have not been allowed to discuss it or research it objectively. Everyone who does so puts their lives on the line. Until the threat of murder is removed from the free discussion of Islam, any interpretation is as valid as any other, since all people have to go on are their lived experiences and their gut choices.
I am saddened that the federal government is not willing to take a stand in court against this odious piece of legislation.  It is not even the entirety of Bill 62 that is at issue here, only the provisions clearly intended to stick it to the Muslim population.  Of course Muslim women feel apprehensive going outside in such a hostile environment.  I, as a middle-class white male, would feel apprehensive if such a law were targeted at me. '
Interesting use of the concept of "the tribe".  Leave it vague...that avoids spelling out that those "retaliating" have defined the issue as religious by identifying their "tribe" in religious terms, as "muslims" rather than Afghans, or Saudis, or Tunisians, etc.
Had he written a Muslim Ban he it would quite possibly be an impeachable offense. I don't know what "pathological" means to you, you would need to elaborate.  Submit - accept or yield to a superior force or to the authority or will of another person.  You are submitting to his authority whether you think you are or not - he is the POTUS  Hello - Commit a federal crime and see what happens - you will be subject (and already are) to the federal authorities whether you admit it or not.
Actually, Trump claimed in late 2016 that he had been "right all along".  He didn't retract his promise to ban Muslims.
Reasonable people do not fear the modesty of Muslim women but they do reject the self-effacement of some.  Reasonable people also fear the strident condemnation of Jews, Unbelievers, and Apostates, the disapproval of individual choice that is woven into the fabric of Islam.   Reasonable people fear the  insistence by most visible leaders of this faith worldwide that their interpretation of holy law supersedes human-made law.  I would welcome some articles in the Globe that deal in depth with these issues; nothing less will lead to understanding.
The majority in Quebec and probably in TROC actually favoured the CPC's proposal that people of all races and religions while taking the oath of Canadian citizenship should not cover their faces and hide their identity with a burka or any other face covering.   The Liberals are as out of touch with majority Canadian opinion on this as they were when the PM tweeted that Canada is open house for anyone from anywhere anytime and the resulting dramatic increase in phony refugees - about half with criminal records - crossing into Canada illegally and having their bags carried by the RCMP began and continues.  But enlighten me on this - Egypt is over 90% Muslim including president el-Sisi and yet the Egyptian parliament under his direction is now banning the wearing of the niqab, burka and other face coverings in pubic places.  Is this anti-Muslim dog whistle politics, is el-Sisi a secret Jewish agent, or is it  that el-Sisi hasn't yet met and learned (LMAO) from The Clown Prince?
n 1453, a mere 39 years before Columbus sailed west,  the Islamic Ottoman Turks seized  and conquered the great city of Constantinople.  Constantinople  was founded by Emperor Constantine in 325 as the  new capital of the Christian Roman empire.  The Muslim armies drove out the Christians and massacred them in wholesale bloodbath.  Canada did nothing of the sort to natives what Islam's invasion  armies did to Christian Europe. If Kahn is prepared to cede Constantinople, Turkey  and the Bosporus back to European  Christendom ,we can then discuss her support of  native land claims.   The one good thing to come from that tragic event was the refugees from Constantinople  fled west to Rome and Florence,  sparked the Renaissance.  We are still living with the benefits of it today, even though it's  lost on her.
On International Women's Day, I would expect a Muslim woman addressing women's issues in Muslim countries, not a M103 agitator...
The US is being flooded with illegal immigrants not only from Mexico but also Africa and recently 4 ISIS terrorists were caught crossing in Texas. Are open borders a good idea? Have you heard about open borders Europe with mass Muslim immigration from the ME and Africa,  the rapes and terrorist attacks Europe is enduring?   The sanctuary cities in the US are paid for with federal taxes and there are lots of drug lords /gangs in California. Tax payer's pay the bill for their housing ,medical, education, and illegal cheap labor takes jobs from citizens.   Open borders have made the world a much more dangerous place because now the criminals and terrorists can roam free. Common sense, closed borders, and enforce the existing laws. We do NOT want open borders in Canada and that is the NWO GLOBALIST plan. Obama, Hillary Clinton, Trudeau, Merkel, are globalists. https://socioecohistory.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/new-world-order-diagram-nau-eu_african_union_asian_union.jpg?w=750&h=390
Canada's unelected courts eliminated school prayer in public schools. Now the muslims have the daily prayers in a school in Toronto. Why is that? Why is Islam a better religion than Christianity and why shouldn't we expect newcomers to Canada to embrace Christianity? It's the hypocrisy that stuns me about the liberal-left.
Exactly! A majority of Catholics and Evangelicals voted for Trump because of his "so called" opposition to abortion. All these people closed their eyes and ears to the crimes and corruption of Trump with abortion being their excuse. What others crimes and abhorrent behaviors are they willing to put with? Prison camps for Muslims, the loss of civil rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of the press, assaults and killings of anyone not white enough, etc. Sounds just like Nazi Germany or your Despotic Theocracy!
Why do we need to talk about Islamophobia when it is a made-up word by Islamists to silence honest and critical debate about a religion that needs reform? Why do we need to talk about white supremacy when "white" nations are the only nations of the world who openly allow other groups to immigrate and give them equal legal status? This is not happening in the rest of the world. Zimbabwe white farmers were forced off their lands they owned for generations and now the country can't feed itself.  Why do we need to talk about far-right terrorism when the overwhelming problem in the West is Islamic terrorism, which we can't even begin to discuss honestly?
I'm willing to bet that his administrations goal is to end immigration into this country completely. And make it exceedingly difficult for anyone to visit on a visa. Regardless of nationality. The Muslim ban is just the start. And if it goes through will probably be used as precedent in the future.   So when a German commits a crime. Ban on Germany. South African caught speeding. Ban on South Africa. Canadian is less than polite. Ban on Canada.  See where I'm going with this?   On a side note, tourist visits to the US are already down 16% since inauguration, but Trump thinks he can do better....
They get paid with internet currency like Bit-coin and cell phone money transfers from the controllers is Syria, ISIS, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan or Iran. They are not wandering blindly: they all have GPS.  Like the Muslims invading Europe, they have specific instruction where to go and what to do there. Prepare to be swarmed.  They already have allies  in Toronto ,Montreal, Calgary  and across the country waiting for them .
My mother struggled with my sexuality. Charlatan Dr. Prevo made her struggle worse. He demonized me, my tribe and my value as a human being.  I don't care what he and his followers  believe, but we have a secular Constitution (frequently ignored in Alaska) that guarantees I have the same rights he and his church have. He wants me disenfranchised. Dr. Prevo, this is not some nightmare Christian theocracy similar to the Muslim one in Iran. But, that is what you want. I don't know how many gay kids were terrorized by Dr. Prevo. I don't know how many gay people met violence or death as a result of the hate rhetoric with the lies that evoke  violence--even death--in my gay tribe.  I do not believe God created me to view my body with shame. I do not  believe God made me gay for torment by Dr. Prevo and his ilk. Religious freedom stops where there are calls for death to a whole class of folks. You know, like no human sacrifice.
Trumps plan to ban Muslims isn't that back, in fact it's a policy the US government has tried before, successfully I might add. At the start of World War 2 all japanese, US born included were all rounded up and placed in interment camps for the safety of Americans on US soil. Most if not all of the US born japanese American had little complaints because they understood it was for the greater good of the country.  I don't see how Trumps plan is that much different. It's just good common sense, deny entry untill it can be proved beyond a reasonable they are no threat. I'm no fan of politicians. Modern politics has ruined government and killed common sense in Washington.
After the Orlando  massacre, leaders of the LGBT and Muslim communities across America and even Toronto, immediately blamed Trump and the NRA for the bloodshed. They ALL categorically exonerated Islam. Mateen was devout a Muslim and shouted ALLAH AKBAR while shooting gay men and women.  Mateen's own wife, father Imam, mosque had an army of supporters who financed his military training in the middle east, in his jihad to kill homosexuals. They now insist he wasn’t even Muslim at all. Only Trump identified exactly who did it and why: Islamic terrorists in America. But Trump is reviled for being honest. Even Toronto's LGBT community prefer sweet lies to hard truths.
And what exactly is my side? I actually want to understand how you would group or characterize me based on my post. FYI - I edited my original comment while you were posting this one, to more accurately respond to your original point.   The reality is that I would suggest many folks out there (regardless of "side") would agree that there is a difference between a woman wearing a headscarf, and a jihadi suicide bomber. However, credible firsthand information shows that a huge segment of the muslim population while not extreme themselves, do not find actions of radicals to be extreme either.   This isn't really the subject at hand, so I will circle back to my central point. If individuals want to immigrate to Canada, they should be prepared to make religious/cultural sacrifices including most notably in the public sphere such as a school. Again, I welcome anyone to believe what they want in private (provided it doesn't violate the rights of an individual as defined in our Charter).
M-103 is only intended to lay the foundation for new laws to protect Islam. What ever the study finds about Islamophobia in Canada it will only  be shocking and horrible, and will be used as a pretext to implement draconian laws against anybody with alternate opinions about Islam. . It may even have a recommendations for Sharia law as the only viable solution to the egregious sufferings of Muslims in Canada. M103 is only a tool to wring concessions and privileges out of the rest of society, to build a separate and unaccountable Islamic power in Canada.
A Nativity scene is a public event. It is a decoration of a public space. Meant as such,  While I would personally not forbid it in pubic schools, it's still 'very public'.  [anti]Progressivism forgets that in some religions, like Islam, more suble than his own, a worshipper has a direct connection to his god, and doesn't need to gather with 5 members of his Youth Group and sing for Jesus, as your son might need to do, to offer an example.  Meanwhile, back to the topic, your son can also go Sing for Jesus, as long as he doesn't do coercive missionary work, and as long as he uses an unoccupied space. That's not public.  Every anti-Islam post in here is sophistry.
Actually, most are not.  Islam reveres Jesus as a prophet, celebrating it is quite compatible with Islam. I know Muslims who put up Xmas trees and decorations, have Santa Claus come for the children, etc.   The opposition comes from elsewhere...
let me guess: the guy in spain was a lone wolf, with no known reason to act violently, with no associates , family or friends who can  shed light on why he did it. Certainly uhe is not a Muslims ore assisted with islam in any way . Perhaps he was Republican?
I can't decide if this is satire or not. If it was satire then the target is those who equate Texans with Nazi's. If THEY are equating drowning Texans with Nazi's then it is editorializing at it's most vicious. But they are free to do either, and people will believe what they want to believe, as usual. They wanted attention and they got it. Now how about a clever cover about all those "peaceful Buddhists" in Myanmar engaging in genocide of Royhingya Muslims. THAT would take some courage.
Both Obama and his close friend Valerie Jarrett are closeted Muslims, IMO. Last year, Obama publicly wished all Muslims “Happy Ramadan from our family to yours” just hours after an Islamoterrorist gunned down 4 soldiers at a military base on the east coast.
Good realist evidence of the very unWestern bias/ethics that goes with fundamentalist Islam,    It's so similar to the dark ages in Europe that one wonders if religions can ever learn to be civil to those who don't 'believe'.  The judgmental god of Christianity or Islam does not fit 10's of millions of spiritual folks who envision a God of compassion, healing and forgiveness.  To Christians who preach hatred of all Muslim people, you really blur the lines of distinction between Christian and Muslim dogma, especially for those who aren't inclined to believe in any particularly religious context, (who can be wise and wonderful philosophers by the way).  We are all of the same family, an often dysfunctional family................
Whoops!  Looks like the Deniers are going to have to add the Insurance Companies to that list of conspiracy plotters pushing the "Climate Change Global Warming Scam" on the rest of us in order to, well, steal our money, or convert us all to Islam, or make the World One Big Socialist Lefty Nanny State....or some such nonsense.  Ned Ludd would be proud of these Science Haters.
Let me tell you: I watched Maher's appearance on Van Jones' show, 'The Messy Truth,' last week. Maher was amazingly concise on the Western-Islamic divide, as usual. I wonder what he'd have to say about M-103? My guess is that he'd metaphorically slice-and-dice it as effectively as he did Freeland's twaddle during her now infamous appearance on his show.
Part 2:  Similarly, if a candidate of any religious persuasion were to suggest that persons of other faiths, or no faith, must be given a diminished citizenship status in our republic, then that candidate likewise disregards the establishment clause of the first amendment (“prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”). It is not hard to see Trump’s “Muslim ban” executive order as such an edict.   There is a common misconception regarding the famous “separation clause” of the Constitution embodied in the First Amendment. Because it reads [in part], “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,” many people think that the founding fathers objected to government-established churches. I beg to differ. While many governments had previously supported one church or another, the founders’ objection was of church established government or, more to the point, government being unduly influenced – or even co-opted – by religious establishments.  HEAR  "unduly influenced govt"
Hardly an administrative issue, but you may well be right that there's not a lot in this decision to help people not in transit.  However, I like Laurence Tribe's view that Trump's promise to prioritize Christian over Muslim refugees when the 90-day ban lifts violates the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment.
The blood of American citizens will be on the hands of the Federal judges who keep blocking the travel bans.  Playing political correctness games is now costing American lives.  More vetting and deportation is necessary for our very survival. I'm sorry this is not all "give every muslim immigrant a hug and they will understand and love us"  the world has become a dangerous place. Sitting around in a circle singing kumbia is not the solution.
Since Trump was inadvertently elected he has declared war on Hollywood, Mexicans, Muslims, the NFL, NBA, MLB, the Gay community and Canada's portion of NAFTA he may  just as well declare war on North Korea officially too. There has never been a man more out of his league than Trump. The sooner a guy with three names comes along the better off we all will be.
It has nothing to do with Muslims! If it had been a jewish, Taoist or Mormon cemetery, the results would have been the same. It was only people who had adjoining property that were allowed to vote and those opposed, simply did not want to live beside a graveyard.  Since I plan to spend several centuries in a graveyard, I too, don't want to spend my "few" living years beside a cemetery!
Hope you or anyone you know doesnt have their rights ignored. Geez we would never hear the end of it.  Could it be that he is Muslim havent something to do withn your view?  eh?
Story is falling a little short.  Shooter was a MUSLIM who killed in the name of Allah.  He had an AK-47.  If the shooting occurred in the U.S. the gun type would be headline read.  I thought personal ownership of AK47 was illegal in Paris.  Yet all the criminals have guns.  Hmmm.  This is what happens when you allow mass, unvetted immigration.  It's a suicide of culture.  And where are the "moderate Muslims" that are speaking out?
Taqiyya (taqiya, taqiyah, taqiyyah) is a form of Islamic deception. The Quran (16:106 and 3:28) allows Muslims to lie in order to protect themselves or to protect the Muslim community.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F4wBeshTsw
beautiful story.  Oregoncraig in an earlier listing  pondered that it was a  "Christians and jews" collective who built the house.  It was and i'm sure the next time,  more faiths will become involved as well seeing it for what it is.  it is good works done by many  to contribute to a community of all.  talking to my muslim friends,  they, too, would have liked to help as part of the community here.  sajid, in particular, wants to learn more building techniques and saw it as a lost learning opportunity.
sky "Nobody attacked "Muslims" because they were Muslims," Look at it from a Muslim point of view: The West attacked Muslims. Muslims are responding.  It does not matter why the West attacked Muslims.
indeed, the atrocities carried out by the radical islamists are really not all that bad.
<- slowly shakes head. We have Saudi Arabia and Iran funding Islamic terrorism, and yet this author claims there is no correlation between Islam as a religion and terrorism that is conducted by "a tiny faction." The facts are clear, it is the major players governing these 2 counties who are waging a religious war through terrorism. Defeat ISIS today, and come tomorrow they will be replaced with another. the solution is simple; arm both of these countries to the hilt and let them genocide each other, and when they stand before their god their god will sort this out for them. But then Europe and America have an oil problem, and then they have commerce problem, and rather than deal with that once, for all, it's easier to sacrifice a few hundred thousand souls each year as the herd  needs thinned anyway.
No actually they really don't.  And its disingenuous to make the argument that 'Christians killed vs Muslims killed' if you are going to then ignore the religion piece.  But you are very good at setting up moving goal posts and changing the argument when you are losing.  You have LOTS of practice at that too.
Thomas Dye, two can play your game of attaching my name  in a narrative that is irrelevant and meaningless and nothing more than an insult. - But doing so results in meaningless and useless banter and trading insult thru a narrative. _ And this "I respect @Ruben Reyes' opinion etc. does not exculpate your prior insult . - But if you want to do an intelligent discussion, Thomas Dye.  (Do so without a narrative that has nothing to do with a discussion but only serves as an insult to one's opponent in a discussion). ------------------------ Is it not true that the Trump promise of a Muslim ban made in 2015 was -  in 2016 before Election 2016 changed to a promise to ban only Muslims from other countries?     And that promise Trump made before Election 2016 is what the new Travel Ban is all about?
she has to first, do something to resign for. speaking out against islamic terrorism is patriotic.  i applaud her efforts to keep the public informed.
Ask yourself why Syrians or other MidEast Muslims/Islamist want to come to America when Europe has an open door policy for them to thrive by? These Muslims/Islamist have a goal: To spread Sharia in a Christian society, the Western World's way of Life. Snowflakes Jaws will drop! It's not "if" but "when". Allahu Akbar! Yikes! Say goodbye to Women's Right, Equality LGBT's beware Say goodbye to your college party Millennials Criminals beware, you do a five finger job and you'll get your hands chopped off. Ai Sous!(dats the only good of Sharia, imo) Don't do what Monica done with Bubba, she'd be stoned in the middle of the Road while Bubba be smiling on his friends Jet of Harems.
This is interesting---If he's not going to build a wall (and Mexico is definitely NOT going to pay for it), and he's not going to ban Muslims (because he couldn't anyway, without a Constitutional re-write---same reason Hillary was never going to take our guns), and he's not going to prosecute Hillary (because there's nothing really to prosecute), and he's not going to do away with "Obama Care" (we'll have to see how serious the repubs ever were about this---it was, after all, one of their proposals), where'd his platform go?    Oh yeah, the TPP...Nafta...trade protectionism and bringing manufacturing jobs back.  Don't get me wrong---I think these are promising signs.  Having just "won" what is arguably the most important popularity contest on the planet, Don is now trying to reconcile himself with the millions of people who don't like him. He's billing himself as a deal-maker rather than an ideologue.
how does a philanthropist who takes donations from middle class and poorer people. live a . jet-setting playboy lifestyle -- he is known for his interest in beautiful women, fast cars, and race horses. and..have his multiple marriages, divorces, and extramarital affairs The Imam divorced his first wife and mother of his three children, Sarah Croker Poole – who assumed the Muslim name Begum Salimah – after 25 years of marriage in 1995. The former model received over $30 million as a divorce settlement, along with some $27 million worth of jewelry. then married Gabriele zu Leiningen in 1998, and the couple has a son together. However, six years into the marriage, his wife – who assumed the Muslim name of Begum Inaara -- filed for divorce citing the Imam's extramarital liaisons.  The couple is now officially separated, while the Imam is contesting Begum Inaara's claim for a divorce settlement worth nearly $80-million. -it stinks that he takes money from poor people and Candian taxpayers..
Exactly, Curt Sommer.   How does terrorism at the hands of people who are Muslim work out to be "in the name of religion"?  If the US sends a drone strike and the pilot is a Christian, is that also "in the name of religion"?   Or is it just that groups of people fight each other and often within the groups they share a religion?  So back to your question: Is it their religion or something else about the Middle-East that's forcing these extreme acts of terror?   You want to know the cause, rather than the symptom, right?
"False sense of security" is a fallacy.  Looks good but it is blatantly false.   Who the heck are they who can predict what Muslims seeking refuge in the US may or may not do?   The excuse that "nationalists from the 6 countries named in the executive order have killed zero terrorist attacks on US soil between 1975 and 2015" does not guarantee nor predict that Muslims in those 6 countries who hate the US won't be able to gain entry into the US.
"Questions and criticism about Islam are not Islamophobia. In fact, Muslims themselves engage in robust debates about modernity and Islamic practice. The cruel irony is that such debates are banned in countries that need it most."  Sadly, however, many in Canada's chattering classes reflexively consider criticism of Islam to amount to Islamophobia and the politicization of this mentality in M-103 increases the suspicion that rational discussion is being stifled. Perhaps the cruelest irony here is that this is happening in a democratic country like Canada.
Why?  It has absolutely nothing to do with the supposed story of Brit teachers afraid to teach the Blair/Bush  version of 9/11 to kids.  It about Muslims and war though so, likely you think you be on topic.  Booga booga.
I don't think you can discount how instrumental Qatar's support of the Muslim Brotherhood, which opposes dynastic monarchic rule, and of the influence of Al Jazeera, which is a relatively independent media outlet (at least in regional terms) are in Saudi Arabia's actions. Saudi Arabia views Qatar as undermining it's position as the major regional power. Trump's demand that Arab States take a stronger stance against terrorism just gave SA the excuse it needed to apply pressure against Qatar and try to get them to fall in line with their political agenda. Saudi Arabia's actions against Qatar are no more legitimate than the US/British led invasion of Iraq on the trumped up charges that they possessed weapons of mass destruction. It's all just smoke and mirrors.
"when Ehud Barak tried to negotiate an agreement with Arafat in 2000"  Hi mythical "generous offer" contained conditions that would have legitimized the status quo and left Israel in de facto control of all Palestinian territory. Even prominent Israeli academics and journalists said that, like everything Israel's government has brought to the table, it was designed to be rejected.  This only continues because Israel's government has made a conscious choice to perpetuate a military, political, and economic campaign to deny the Palestinians their right to self determination and steal their land and resources, in brazen defiance of the UN and systemic violation of the very laws intended to prevent such an injustice.  And the US underwrites this campaign and protects it from the law.  Guess you haven't seen how fanatical settlers and the Israeli authorities treat Christians, Muslims, or supporters of Palestinian rights.
apparently the Rohingyas have created a huge muslim ghetto next to the border with Bangladesh, they have not integrated themselves into Burmese society, Burma and India believe they are a security threat  Canada is so naive
AJL Certainly agree, Canada should stay out of any involvement.  There is a solution. That is to use the great capabilities in establishing Israel to correct that terrible mistake. One need only look at a map. A Jewish state does not belong in Arab/Muslim territory. That is so obvious that I feel silly making the statement. A Jewish state in Muslim territory. Nothing to do with rights. Just plain  silly.  A piece of land 1/48th the size of Texas, surrounded by friends. What a powerhouse that would be. A chance for the Chosen People to exploit their capabilities. .
Yeah, but Goodale won't let them ask any questions that might offend Muslim sensibilities.
I think anti-racism is already being taught to death in our schools. The teachers will simply have to explain: there are hindu whack-jobs, christian whack-jobs, sikh whack-jobs, muslim whack-jobs, jewish whack-jobs..not so many Zoroastrian and Buddhist whack jobs, and some regular garden variety whack jobs.. Kids simply do unto others...
The only troll is Amira herself, trolling for Islam and for western civilization's submission to the Koran. Her hijab is the sign she handed her fate to Allah. Giving up free will is just one thing Muslims ar expected to sacrifice for their religion. 10
Actually I've heard your brand of BS before...you like to use westerners lack of studies of the Quran to obfuscate the truth. Anyone interested in what the precious Arabic holy book says should read themselves and not rely on apologist lies about Islam. It is most certainly not a peaceful and tolerant faith but rather an edict of slavery and evil towards "non believers"
Also the fact that more than 200 Canadian Muslim have traveled to Syria in recent years to join ISIS in full knowledge of the fact ISIS and other Islamist terrorists have murdered hundreds of perfectly innocent people in Europe and N America in terrorist attacks the past two years. That's not mentioning the tens-of-thousands they've murdered in Middle East, Africa and Asia.
Speaking of politics and learning:   The threat of terrorism was a big part of the reason for why Trump won and why Hillary lost.  Yesterday, we had yet another horrible terrorist attack by a Muslim extremist.   8 people dead from someone brought here because of a "humanitarian" immigration policy.  And yet, that senseless and tragic (and preventable) event and the loss of innocent lives doesn't factor into MSW's essay, so piqued he is at our president.     Indeed, in respect to learning, some people never apparently never will.   Learn, that is.
There is a high school in London On that built a room for about 12 muslim students to use for prayer during the school day.  Oh, I guess I forgot to mention the school is part of the London District Catholic school board.
It's the delusional hyperbole of the comment that makes it funny. It as if this is the only place in Quebec where Muslims could possibly be buried. Freedom of speech through a democratic process seems to be a foreign concept to some =/
Is it not possible that those who are worried about the effect of Islam on Canada are not exhibiting an irrational fear, but some caution? Think about the majority of the news we receive about predominantly Muslim countries. We see beheadings, hear about abhorent treatment of women, read about treatment of other religions and terrible suicide bombings. This is almost certainly not the whole story of the Muslim world, but it is the main story we receive in Canada. Almost all of these items are antithetical to Canadians, including, I agree, the vast majority of Muslims. Still, given this diet, is the reaction of many Canadians surprising? Just a thought...
Not sure where the author is getting her numbers...here's the correct ones.  "A total of 38,901 Muslim refugees entered the U.S. in fiscal year 2016, making up almost half (46%) of the nearly 85,000 refugees who entered the country in that period, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the State Department’s Refugee Processing Center. That means the U.S. has admitted the highest number of Muslim refugees of any year since data on self-reported religious affiliations first became publicly available in 2002."  And, no, Canada "must" not open any more windows.   At the rate the snowflakes are screaming, there won't be any housing left, never mind windows.
Interesting. A lot of right wingers think Obama is not American, and is a practising Muslim. I guess they love Islam.  Oddly enough, the right wing nutbars don't ask white American Presidents for proof of citizenship.
Every country has to find a balance in its own context. Singapore was constantly threatened by a Muslim Malaysia for decades. She also had a Malay minority, which had to be accommodated.  Under a similar situation, Canada sent all the Japanese Canadians to concentration camps when there was a distant Japanese threat ( I doubt anyone seriously thought that the Japanese would land an invasion force in BC in 1941).
What is actually offensive is your pretense that the ban on Muslims is not religious bigotry. I keep saying that you are dishonest, and here you are proving that I am correct to say it.
Before you declare that this is "muslim hating islamophobia", perhaps you should come equipped with some actual facts.  Your statement that the whole town was invited to vote is patently false and calls into question your entire comment.
Yep.  "Shuaib and Malika Ahmed recently departed to a new frontier in the Alaskan tundra to establish an independent, self-sufficient, purely Islamic village." They haven't been able to do this yet, but that is their dream. Mmmmhmmm.
3. Whatever Clinton may be accused of (not charged, btw) she is entitled to a fair trial in a court of law.  What Trump campaigned on was putting her in jail without cause.  If you have a problem with Clinton or Notley, you vote against them.  That's what democracy is about.  What you're talking about is a lynch mob. 4. There's nothing wrong with the press.  Popular or not, they report the facts and 98% of what the government does you'd know nothing about if not for mainstream news networks.  If Trump succeeds in altering freedom of the press and libel laws you'll learn exactly what it means to be in the dark.  The point you failed to mention was scapegoating minority groups.  Harper's campaign against headscarves... the "Fair Elections Act"... the anti-Muslim snitch line... all policies introduced to target and marginalize a minority group.  Trump is simply taking it a step further by promising to deport millions of people.  All to appeal to the lowest common denominator.
The 6 muslim men murdered as they prayed did not provoke their deaths - nor did the mosques across Canada which have been vandalized or individual women pushed and yelled at on the streets of Canadian cities.
In fact, people in Europe are coming to realize that the nativist hate-based approach is counter-productive, ie: will just increase terrorism.  That's why, for instance, Marine Le Pen and her party fell flat in the recent French elections.  The answer is to hit ISIS hard, not the millions of muslims who are our neighbours.
|This hateful incident echoes the disturbing pattern of anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic, and anti-Muslim attacks in our state, and across the country. "  How convenient of you Mr. Inslee to omit the various attacks on American soil perpetuated by immigrants across the country towards American citizens.   Perhaps it could even be useful to list all the attacks perpetuated by immigrants upon European states as well?   Because those facts have become an all too familiar theme as well.
Again, we're talking about visitors, not hating on Muslims.
If only there were a way to see what adding a bunch of Muslims would look like.  Oh wait, there is.  Pick a European country and google it's name followed by "Muslim immigrants".  You'll see violence again women, increased terror attacks, and a drain on their social systems.  The UK is leaving the EU so they'll don't have to be forced to take any more people.  Wake up and do some research.
Such hypocrisy and feigned indignation. During his term, Obama is responsible for between 30,000 and 33,000  Muslims deaths since 2009 as indexed by the AFP. While most of these were considered terrorists, perhaps 20-25 % were innocent civilians ( so called collateral damage )  especially by drone strikes  . Trump has not killed a single Muslim .  Consider also the roles of Obama and Clinton in their illegal regime change in Libya and their similar attempts in Syria which resulted in millions of Muslim being uprooted as refugees flooding into Europe ,while in Ukraine they even over threw a democratically elected Govt just because they favored Russia.  It was Hillary's stated into to intensify these endless wars had she been elected.  Trump states that he wants to end these endless wars. Isn't that good ?  Beware of such fake news and unprincipled commentary. It's source is why Trump got elected..
Interesting that they would target an event that was overwhelmingly being attended by women and young girls.  There are virtually no male victims of this gruesome terror attack.  What does this say about these reactionary Muslims who believe in Jihad??
Muslim views discussed by Brigitte Gabriel.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry3NzkAOo3s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guXBTgAxhIw  http://www.israelvideonetwork.com/brigitte-gabriel-reveals-the-muslim-brotherhood-plan-for-america/  https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidnoriega/meet-the-charming-terrifying-face-of-the-anti-islam-lobby?utm_term=.xg3dOljA3#.cdpdGnQYW
A better description of Islamophobia might be the irrational fear that Islam is an intolerant force that will subvert the traditional values and freedoms of Canadians.  Other religions have come to Canada in the past. At the same time that we welcomed Muslims we also welcomed Buddhists, Sikhs and Hindus. They have not caused a stir like Islam.   Islam is different from other religions in that it explicitly discriminates against unbelievers. This is written in the Koran, or so I am told. I have read parts of the Koran but have only gotten to the parts where wife beating is allowed.  Muslims have a problem that only they can solve. They must forsake forever Sharia law and expressly reject those teachings of the Koran the declare war on unbelievers, accepting that Islam is not superior to any other religion.  Until they do this problem will not end.
Actually Mr Heisbourg, it has to do with the fact that UNESCO was and is being abused by its Muslim member states and their supporters in order to promote an anti-Semitic agenda, and that's simply unacceptable to the US Presidency (whoever the incumbent) and to all decent people. In this case, its simpler just to read the lines, rather than between them.  Pity though that UNESCO has to suffer for the outrages of certain members.
Posts talk about how Trump in 2017 is accomplishing what Hitler accomplished in the 1930s.  That reveals a shocking degree of pampered parochialism in their thinking.  Right now the TV is on, NBC from America. The first reports were these:  - Trump's bans against Muslim majority countries are causing chaos for travelers of many types - The tweet from Justin Trudeau is read out word for word ("... Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith...") - a Muslim mosque in Texas burned down last night, and investigators are probing it as possible hate crime, having arrested a local man for a hate crime a few years ago involving that mosque.  Hello?  Germany's 1930's press was no conduit of empathy and facts about minorities. Indeed, Goebbels, the government master of newspapers then, fired all Jewish journalists in 1933. Cartoons of Jews as rodents then appeared, and claims that Jews needed blood of Christians for rituals.  Get a grip. America is not 1930s Germany. Not even close.
While Muslims excoriate us about supposed Islamophobia, we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched homophobia, misogyny, Judeophobia, Christiophbia, Buddeaphobia Europhobia, Americanophibia, democratiophobia, Bibliophobia, iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other.
According to the motion M-130 approved by Liberal government, all of posters who are against illegal Muslim aliens crossing the borders illegal are potentially hate crimes. So, be careful when you post your comments.  That 's what M-130 is all about folks.
As a candidate, Trump called for a complete ban on Muslim entry. As President, he enacted a limited, geography based travel ban that does not enhance security. He chickened out.  Despite the criticism, his proposal was not bigoted nor was it racist, neither was it unconstitutional.  It should have been permanent and retroactive.   What did the Tsarhnaev brothers, Nidal Hasan, Syed Farook and Omar Mateen have in common with the New York bomber?  It was not national origin. Is anyone familiar with "the forgotten obligation?
On the contrary, it's you that makes it sound like the IRA were suddenly eliminated. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, there's a rump IRA wing still engaged in hostilities with the UK.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army  As for the British hostility towards the Irish, you again miss the point. The Brits and the Irish have always been at loggerheads, extending back hundreds of years. My point is that when the IRA spent 100 years attacking the UK, it didn't translate into increased hostility towards the Irish or Catholics. Compare that to today vis-a-vis Muslims in the West.
This article is more political correctness gone astray.  As a Japanese American, I see the issue a lot differently.  The Japanese people in America weren't the problem.  They were hard working members of the community that were rounded up and shipped off to internment camps because the Japanese from Japan attacked America.  Musilims OTOH are the problem regardless of where they were from.  You've got American citizens that are Muslim that are committing heinous acts against other Americans.  In WWII, Japanese Americans volunteered to fight FOR America.  Many fought and were injured or even killed defending our great nation.  What have the Muslims done for this country other than cry racism?  Cannot compare how the Japanese were treated to how the Muslims are being treated today.
Considering the present Catalonian quest for independence it is interesting to consider that if Fredinand and Isabela had not united the kingdoms of Castille and Aragon and were able to expell the Muslims from Iberia in 1492 they  wouldn't have  been able to finance Columbus' "discovery of America ". Given liberals' statement that they "are Muslims " perhaps they would be more comfortable if the Muslims had discovered and colonized Amerca and thus possibly have made that a reality.
It's not a matter of special rights or special categories - no more than it is with respect to anti-semitism.  There is currently a troubling increase in anti-muslim incidents in Canada, and addressing it was the purpose of M-103.  Sadly, the response by some Conservatives and many people on Globe comments are part of the problem.
You do of course recognize that the Islamic faith is anti-choice, right?  I'm trying not to laugh...really I'm trying.
I don't know what your supposed "huge percentage" amounts to, but in point of fact most Muslims do not believe in killing those who leave Islam and homosexuals. Most Muslims, like most people of other faiths, want to live in peace with their neighbors and raise their children without fear.  The decision to allow refugees into this country should be based on need, compassion and prudent judgment that a person intends to abide by the law of the land. That's a judgment that can, in justice, only be made on an individual basis. It can't be made based on wholesale bias for or against a particular group.
Muslims and Muslim nations have succeeded in intimidating UN countries into voting Muslim interests. The threat of international terrorism and its successes, including ISIS, have seen to this. In the words of Winston Churchill, an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last. The non-Muslim countries in the UN fit this definition perfectly.
What term would you prefer to use for people who automatically assume that all Muslim's are potential terrorists, that all want to impose Sharia law, that Muslim's should be banned from Christian countries ... these are real things, as a short trip through comments on this article will show. It seems a name for this belief system would be useful. Is 'homophobia' a term that is acceptable to you?
Are you trying to say that Islam is the equivalent of a kooky fringe cult?  There were like, 80 members of the Branch Davidians, there are *billions* of Muslims.  Besides that, no one is excusing these groups you list or trying to justify why they do what they do. No one is saying "Well its the West's fault that the LRA kidnaps and enslaves children, we made them do it!"
A few facts gleaned from on going coverage and prior knowledge. The 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia- not one of the listed countries. The ban is being applied to travelers with dual citizenship which means someone born in a banned country but raised in another and a citizen of that second country (such as Canada) are barred. It is being applied based on place of birth, not just where they are flying from. Long term holders of the right to permanent residency (green cards) cannot exit because they will be barred reentry. Even conservative think tanks are pointing out that no one in the U.S. has been killed by a refugee from these countries even though hundreds of thousands (perhaps millions) have been admitted. As many Christian refugees have been admitted as Muslims from the 7 countries, despite Trump's statement in the E.O.  When did so many people lose their courage and ability to deal with facts?
Yes, and isn't it interesting how quiet it's been about these guys? Now picture that they were three Muslims attempting to blow up the local Catholic church. . . .
Until Taqiya---(Arabic: تقیة‎‎ taqiyyah/taqīyah) an Arabic term referring to precautionary dissimulation or denial of religious belief and practice in the face of persecution, or simply put: legally (by Sharia law) condoned lying for self interest or self preservation --- is not publicly repudiated and taken out of Sharia Law, apologies like Mr. Khan's in themselves, by Muslim leaders in minority situation, cannot be taken at face value. There has to be more happening than simple verbal apologies. There have to be concrete actions ...
If you check the numbers, dad, there are more acts of terrorism done in the name of Christianity than there is in the name of Islam.’ And factually, that’s the truth.” _________________________  That's not true. They behead and maim people everyday in Countries that use Islam as law and the slavery of women in burkas is fascism at its highest level. Add further, the word Islam in Arabic means "submission"
1. I listed plenty of lies, since he became president. Go back to my original statement, or view the links I gave. You kind-of replied to only two of them:    a. We can know his motives about it being a Muslim ban. He has said it was.    b. He lied about the physical size of his inauguration crowd - you diverted to viewership.  Again, this about him being a pathological liar. When he makes claims in speeches, Facebook, or Twitter very often he states blatant lies or makes entirely baseless hearsay claims. I am wondering if you have the ability to understand what a fact is or isn't. Scary.  2. To this most recent statement what are you even trying to say? You must submit to his ideas while still holding your own, also federal law is a thing? You're not even making sense.  President Trump is not the law. He too must submit to the law. That is why a 'muslim ban' is illegal the same way murder is illegal. Neither I or him can break the law. Doesn't matter what we agree or disagree on.
Deflect? I don't think you know the meaning of the word. The original poster stated that past immigration had never brought as much crime as present immigration. That is an outright lie - and easily proven by statistics.  There were around 15,000 homicides in the US last year. How many do you think were done by Muslim immigrants?
Jay Edward, did you bother to read the article or the thread?  Newsreader claimed, wrongly of course, that no Muslims protest acts of terrorism.  I corrected him and now you are upset that I did.
.... Which, sure enough, happened again today with at least 27 more dead at a Baptist church in Texas. . But, of course, that doesn't count because the killing in Texas wasn't "terrorism". . I don't disagree with ChuckT's point, but I think all kinds of extremist religious government are prone to that same problem.  Think what happened during the St. Bartholemew's Day massacre in France; or after Castile drove the Moors out of Spain; or the religious cleansing of the 30 Years' War; or the endless pogroms against Jews in Eastern Europe/Western Asia; or the bloodbath at partition in India; or ... . The United States was founded on pluralism, and hence on freedom of and freedom from religion, precisely because unless the various colonies could agree to set their religious differences aside, they could never have worked together to end colonial rule by Britain. . That is what ended religious wars in the US. . It isn't just Islam that ha this problem.
Just so you know who writes these pieces: the author is the communication director of  National Council of Canadian Muslims. That's the new name, they used to be CAIR-CAN  - the Canadian arm of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a organization found (by FBI) to have funded Hamas. Mrs. Sheema Khan was the chair of CAIR-CAN.  Yesterday's two pieces are not "post truth" opinions but post-acts of terror perpetrated by jihadists (Berlin, Instanbul) meant to "sanitize" the image and pull a wool over your eyes. Innocent people get run over, shot or blow to bits NCCM says "look....Trump" or "blame islamophobia".
Our Prime Minister spent  private time with Aga Khan, one of the world leaders of Islam.  Our Prime Minister  prays openly in Montreal's Islamic mosques.  He stood up on stage, side by side, with the Muslim Brotherhood a few years back in Toronto.   He hustled, as fast as he could possibly go, to open the floodgates for  35,000 Syrian muslim 'refugees' last year for permanent residency in Canada.  We are seeing  Islamic prayers being allowed  in our public school system in Toronto.   Will Sophia soon start wearing a hijab?
What exactly do you mean by superstition? your more interested in slanderous talk than discussion. And I did not talk nor do I know them, those questions should be answered by the intelligence agency or the muslim community that reported them. Meanwhile you can carry on to live in your bubble of deep seated suspicions or 'superstitions'.
Yet they never have problems pronouncing our names bill john ryan, ken jason nice and easy but they want us to pronounce there names that are egotistical especially muslim names that go on forever. Pompous people who think long names make them more important son of and son of no one fucking cares who your fathers father was just take an order and shut up while us canadians have to put up with you, the countries you mentioned above Iran, Pakistan, citizens go on their daily lives with none of these problems from canadian people visiting or living their if they even wanted too, and if we tried to live our life like we do here they would just jail us or worse kill us.  So in essence take your culture and shove it where the sun don't shine, please and thank you.
I don't see a realistic threat of Orthodox Judaism  imposing their laws in Canada or the west anytime soon.  I could not care less if any religion is tolerant of me personally , or not. Within their temple and household walls they can preach and practice their wacky beliefs all they want..  Once outside however, the laws of this land must prevail.  Islam wants those laws, to be religious laws.  Try to follow the argument.
The logic goes: "seeing such overt displays for death makes people think of death. Death makes people uncomfortable.  People avoid what makes them uncomfortable. People avoid = lower demand = lower value".  Feel free to disagree and call people silly (they kinda are) but this is a known fact and has been for decades.   Has nothing to do with Quebeckers.  Or Muslims.
“...( )...The problem was the inadequate approach to the Centre Islamique, who wanted to have his cemetery WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE POPULATION.  I assure you that the inhabitants of Saint-Apollinaire are NOT AGAINST  a Muslim cemetery, them. They wanted TO SHARE the ground, because they also need this field” Le Devoir
Lela:  Before you start feeling too superior over muslims because you think Mohammed was a pedophile, you should remember that Jesus was first and foremost a Jew.  He self identified as Jewish, and had no conception of "Christianity".  He did not write or dictate the New Testament - which was written mostly based on letters and writings of his disciples.  So most of what we know about Jesus himself are things that the disciples wanted us to know, or decided that we should know - unlike Mohammad who actually dictated the Koran. Islam also has the Hadith, which is a detailed account of the sayings and life of Mohammad.  But we do know that Jewish girls during the time of Christ generally were betrothed very young - and that marriage was usually consummated  at puberty - which could be as young as 9, 10 or 11.  Almost all Jewish men of that era married - not to do so would be very unusual - so there is no reason at all to believe that Jesus did not marry a young child bride himself.
Yes it is an historic vote, as more Muslims vote democratically to sell themselves into Islamic slavery.  This will not end well either way. We can write Turkey off as a failed state for the next 10 years, perhaps  permanently.  At the current pace,  the same civil war that engulfed Syria , Afghanistan, Pakistan, , Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Egypt, Lebanon, will grasp Turkey,  and Europe and the west will be scolded for it.
I worry more about attacks by Christian extremists such as the KKK that are emboldened by the election of Trump than by Muslims.
all the Abrahamic religions, dependent on an indispensable Monotheism, are at their cores, incompatible with liberal democracy...it's a top down system, which any reading of the various religious texts would easily clarify. Which is why, during their heydays, all three were easily aligned with top down political and social  systems...kings, and Popes and emperors  and sheikhs, and princes and emirs...the religions lend themselves to acceptance of authoritative rule  The difference between Christianity , Judaism and Islam however is that Islam was never confronted with pressure to change, secularize and adapt to a new set of ideals through either a Renaissance or Enlightenment....the age of competitive Islamic scientific and cultural advancement generally stalled after ~ the 1200s...one might ask, where are the Islamic world's post golden age philosophers and scientists who have challenged the very central tenets of the religion and forced it to confront its ideological constructs.....
Muslim Arabia is huge and oil rich in many areas. Why cant these people be accepted by their own . Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Libya,Tunisia, Qatar, Turkey,Jordan,  Afghanistan,Morocco, etc can certainly pitch in to provide homes for people of their ilk ! Their Sharia Law, values, sexuality, violence, etc are not compatible with us. I wish them well, but not here in Alaska or the USA.
How is blocking immigrants from 7 Islamic countries a racist immigration ban.  How many other Islamic countries are not banned?  Since when is islam a race?
zuglo9,  Trump's ill advised Muslim ban has guaranteed that hardliners will be at an advantage in the upcoming Iranian election. Iran had negotiated a verifiable nuclear non-proliferation agreement during the Obama presidency and was also starting to engage in significant trade with the US. One indication of this was an order by Iran for $80 billion US worth of Boeing aircraft. This order will likely now be cancelled. How many US jobs will this cause? Iranians are justifiably outraged that the travel ban targeted Iran but left Saudi Arabia untouched. The missile test earlier this week was likely a reaction to the Muslim travel ban. The much larger number of missile tests today was likely a reaction to Trump's new sanctions. Iran cannot and does not want to attack the US. The US could attack Iran, but what would that accomplish for the average man and woman on the street.
Alceste, Paris voted 10% Le Pen Paris is  20 % Muslim ? 20 % other immigrants ? 50% urban leftists? - so why is that surprising?
What a mess a despot still in power, millions of sunnie Muslims  displaced, 100,000's dead, Europe overrun with Sunnie muslins, Christans dead as well,  and a country where they lived now cleared out. By the way none of the displaced are in oil rich sunnie kingdoms. They are/were people with intense love of family, tribal in mature and the love of their god, but misled by the leadership.  But this is the way it is over there. All Obama had to do was to say the despot king was the leader of the country and stay away, this was not going to be another Iraq, but he still had some advisors who though Saudie Araba was their friend. You must know and having lived over there for 6 years, the Arabs are only interested in your help if it will improve their own agenda, everything else is not true.
Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Immigration has already stated categorically that he will not open Canada's doors to Christians. That would be religion faith based immigration policy and against our secular moral standards. He said just a couple of weeks ago that Christians don't face the same dangers as other legitimate refugees. He will however welcome all Muslims fleeing Trump's persecution in the US.
Do we have another Motion coming protecting the rights of Scientology?    Oh my, how silly!  And yet beliefs are beliefs and nothing more.    Beliefs are a choice and nothing more.   Even if you direct your actions according to your beliefs, there are still others who believe differently and more so, whose laws may not support your actions if predicated on your beliefs.    Your beliefs are a choice, nothing more. We are not, therefore, required to do anything other than allow your beliefs as long as they don't affect anyone else.   If your beliefs affect others, then you don't get special dispensation, we don't have to adapt to you, it's up to you to reconcile your beliefs with reality.    I'm tired of this Islamic propaganda.
Bubbles, People can look it  up and find out you removed the word "socialist" from "National Socialist German Workers  Party"   Funny!  Yet very deceptive. .Do you really  think people don't have quick access to historical facts in this day and age?  The German workers party was SOCIALIST.  Look it up.  Hitler made it 'nationalist' and  the rest is history. As far as the rest of it.  That's all you got. Nothing. Context will prove Trump was not being racist like  Bill Maher, who you no doubt would hold up as a model citizen, yet  uses the "N" word and that's OK?  Or maybe because he apologized for using it, that makes it Ok?     In your world is that word acceptable?  How about Nancy Pelosi  whispering "Tell them your a Muslim" and it was 'caught' on a hot mike. What was up with that?
If the Arabs didn’t want to be ‘occupied’ and ‘humiliated’, then they should not have attempted to annihilate the Jews, and they certainly shouldn’t have launched their genocidal forces from our ancient heartland. If you are concerned about world peace and human rights, the pressure should be on the fascists and kings surrounding Israel committed to endless war. 11 million Muslims have been killed since 1948. Less than one percent of those unfortunate souls have been killed in conflict with Israel.
Your attempt to put it all on the Western or White races is racist in its own right. Go to China and their attitudes towards those who are not "the same" are similar... and have been for most of recorded history. Or Africa.  Some people will pint to teh Islamic states and say "you see,  blacks are accepted here"... which is perhaps true, ut tehn see what their attitudes are towards Jews or Christians... there will be "racist" elements to their  thinking on those criteria. Every religion somehow magically thinks that they are superior to the other religions..  it is all learned responses, but it exists in every society, of every colour, every race, every culture. The fact that babies don't seem to have any problem dealing with the differences is proof enough that they are learned cultural responses rather than innate.
What exactly is official Islam. They dont have the equivalent of the Catholic Church
They said that any religious group can ask for prayer time. All other religions should ask for their time at the same place and time as the Muslims.
This topic needs to be addressed by the media, government and great Muslims in the world. Present leader in Turkey is a disgrace to Turkish people and Muslim people!
Understanding Muslims. Listen to Brigitte Gabriel who was born in Lebanon to a Maronite Christian family. Copy the websites below and paste it to your browser & listen to what she says about Muslims. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guXBTgAxhIw http://www.israelvideonetwork.com/brigitte-gabriel-reveals-the-muslim-brotherhood-plan-for-america/ https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidnoriega/meet-the-charming-terrifying-face-of-the-anti-islam-lobby?utm_term=.xg3dOljA3#.cdpdGnQYW
Actually he should, he is a member of an insane cult with ritualistic practices and is in the wrong country at the wrong time. All religion is bad but the active cults like Islam and Catholicism are the worst. Their ideals and propaganda are ludicrous at best and dangerous to all involved. The Islamic belief in a so called prophet who was a pedophile and  murderer is only one example of the danger here. The Qur'an clearly states that "anyone not following the prophet is an infidel and must be destroyed". Now many Muslims will say they don't follow that protocol, however how in a religion or cult do you cherry pick what you believe and what you will ignore?
It is funny that he never once expressed his concerns for Coptic Christians being killed ...... that is a much more common occurrence yet our PM seems interested only in the plight of Muslims.
Werpor:  Question:  Do you know Muslims have lived in Canada since settlers first arrived on these shores?  Question: Do you know the oldest mosque in the country is in Edmonton, Alberta?  Question: What are Conservative supporters virtues and if one must add, values?
"Alas, the concrete effects of all of this naïveté, self-delusion, and outright dissimulation are very dangerous indeed, especially in the context of counterterrorism. The West has now reached the point where the very elites entrusted with defending it are increasingly unwilling even to acknowledge the nature of the threat posed by Islamism, despite the fact that Islamists all over the world are openly and indeed continually denouncing the West as a mortal enemy that must be defeated, subjugated, and ultimately converted to their strict, puritanical version of Islam."    http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/testimony/395.pdf
If  Toronto's  sponsorship is cut off, corporate sponsorship will also be at risk. Loblaws  Ford, TD Bank, ScotiaBank, Air Canada  and such will have to think hard if they want to be in bed with a triumphant BLM. But Pride is positioning itself to be funded exclusively  by public service   unions, OPSUE, CUPE, OSSTF, trade unions like UNIFOR, university based left wing /communist groups and now generous Islamic groups.
"Capital is flowing out of Canada " and then you say  gas and oil exports are leading growth . That would imply capital coming into the country. I think you Cons ought to go back to complaining about Muslims and Birth Control. You don't make sense on the economy and you might gain support with racists and holier than thous.
Why do Muslims emigrate to western countries? Is it because, on the whole, please don't howl, they recognize the superiority of western culture?  This is a civil question, despite the discomfort it may induce in some.
Once again the radical Islamists and Western xenophobes declare victory.
The only mess that was started here, is a small minority of anti-Muslim bigots have started complaining about a non-issue.   Friday prayers have been happening for over 20 years in Peel. I know because I was a highschool student over 20 years ago and I attended Friday prayers and it didn't make anyone lose their sleep.   The only folks making a problem about it now are those that have a bone to pick with Islam and Muslims. They are completely quiet on other religions in school (all religious holidays), they refuse to recognize that religious accommodations exist for ALL, they refuse to recognize the difference between why the the mandatory reading of the Lord's prayer was abolished vs. allowing Muslim kids to pray on their own time in a private space, and they refuse to understand the legal and ethical underpinnings of our human rights laws.
Let's say I walk into a Jewish Bakery, a Gay Bakery, a Muslim Bakery, and a Buddhist Bakery because I didn't know they were Jewish, Gay, Muslim, or Buddhist.....and I ask them to decorate a Christian Wedding Cake with "crosses" and "May Jesus Bless Our Marriage" written on it......and they decline because doing so goes against their religious beliefs or same-sex values. - Sure, I might be sad. But wouldn't I just find another bakery that (1) wants my business (2) will gladly create the "edible art work" I want? Of course I would.
Trump is against certain countries not a certain religion.  Countries Obama had flagged as well. By allowing Muslims into the country isn't that a Christian ideal? Christianity and Islam are not much different they often say they have the same god. Is this Hawaiian judge not a Christian?
And yet millions of Muslims have moved to the U.S. and still continue to and have for decades. Hmmm I wonder if it's reciprocated.
While the Globe brings us an arts and crafts story with a hate-Trump theme, a more informative media outlet offers international stories like:  Germany will look for alternatives to Turkey's Incirlik Airbase - Merkel  Asia hit by WannaCry virus at week’s start, disrupting govt services & business Losing my religion? Secular Brits now outnumber Christians, but Islam & Hinduism growing  Skyrocketing bitcoin raises fears of asset bubble
If you want a private room in public school to use as your mosque, pay rent for it.  The original issue of the Islamic prayer rooms in schools was a matter of truancy: students ran off after noon prayers at the local mosque (two blocks from the school) skipping the rest of the school day. The school had made accommodation to schedule classes for the students to not conflict with the prayers sessions. What should have been a parental disciplinary matter of making sure their kids returned to school collapsed into deception about accommodation.
now consider this scenario  a Muslim mosque in the West has a blast inside and 25 die  all hell will break lose Western leaders will all be on their knees offering apologies there would be riots in Western cities  any apologies from Egyptian leaders? and riots in Egypt protesting the blast?
The Latin word for fear is Timor.  The Greek word for fear is Phobos.  The Latin word for hatred is Odium.  The Greek word for hatred is Misos.  Islamophobia is Greek word for (  overwhelming and irrational) fear of Islam ( a particular belief system).  Hatred for Islam , in Greek, would be Islamomisia or Misoislam.  Hatred  of a Muslim would be , in Greek, Muslimmisia or Misomuslim.  Muslimphobia would be, in Greek, an( overwhelming and irrational ) fear of a Muslim( a follower of Islam) .  One should not confuse Latin with Greek and should not mix the two.  Homophobia in Greek translates as a ( overwhelming and irrational) fear of the same....Homo meaning " the same" in Greek.  Homo in Latin means mankind,  the genus.
Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslims have been spreading from Iraq and Syria into Lybia, Yemen and Afghanistan and have been influencing Muslims in Europe, in Africa, in North America and elsewhere.  The U.S. recently dropped a huge bomb on a Daesh ISIS/IL target in some attempt to wipe out Daesh (ISIS/IL) but can one wipe out an idelogy and a belief in Islam and the hadiths and the verses in the Qur'an that call for jihad (struggle) and for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers?  Look at the Jewish people. They and their beliefs have lasted for over 9,000 years despite discrimination, harrassment, war and horrible genocide.   Is that what we face with radical Islam? Will their beliefs last forever?  Come to think of it, who is going to change the views of Muslims as long they keep following Islam and reading and following the verses in the Qur'an that call for jihad (struggle) and for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers?
(Cont'd) That leadership must a) demonstrate a shared willingness and blatently obvious cohesion, b) educate: what will be in many cases diffuse and subtle insults to value and a divide to conquer approach: Muslims, Hispanics "suspected" and "alleged" to be a threat, for example as a wedge between their larger "safe" populations and between them and "we becoming great again" whose "safety" is being protected. c) be and teach vigilance whether in political centres, neighbourhoods, bus, subway, arena, school  d) diffused leadership and organization.   This era is such an opportunity to reflect upon what our values are and live them and stand with and for them, deepen them as we are more conscious of their fragility. Such vigalance even, hopefully, without threat is good for the soul of the individual and nation. The good people are more than Dems or Repubs.  Sadly, it seems that "the" church of our faith doesn't seem to have a spine in the game, I am more hopeful for the faithful.
The great buzz word of 2017,inclusivity.Does it include white males?I know it does not in Toronto's Gay Pride Parade if you're a cop.Does 'diversity'include white males?Don't think so.John Ibbitson rails against 'old white guys' all the time.If someone was to rail against 'young Black men' or 'young Muslim men',how would that scenario go with Canada's mainstream press?
A British survey showed that one out of 25 Muslims believed that Al Qaeda carried out the 911 attacks. "What we have here is a failure to communicate"
Don't  Gary and Gregor realize that in Canada they are forbidden from writing against religions like Islam and Christianity? The recent M 103 motion, endorsed by Canada's Liberal Government , clearly states that any criticism of a religion and its irrational dogma such as Islam is considered hateful. Therefore Gary and Gregor better watch out as they could be hauled before a Canadian Human Rights Commission and found guilty of hate against a religion.
How correct.  A Muslim candidate wouldn't get asked these questions.
What makes you think Muslims want violent fundamentalists to come here?  Why do you think they left their violent countries?
Hakim Ouansafi, president of the Muslim association, said the internment of Japanese, many of them American citizens, strikes close to home because what happened in the 1940s makes it “easier for what is happening to us as Muslims.”  I would like Ouansafi to explain exactly what is happening to Muslims in the U.S.
There are 15000 Muslims approximately in the US Armed Forces. 15000 served during World War II.  Some buried at Arlington: Army Captain Humayun Khan, who lured a suicide car bomb away from the men in his charge, saving their lives but giving up his own. Army Spc. Rasheed Sahib, an American Muslim from Guyana who was killed in Iraq. Army Spc. Omead Razani, died in Iraq.  Marine Staff Sgt. Kendall Damon Waters-Bey was killed in a helicopter crash on his way to duty in Iraq.  Other military cemetaries: Hassein Ahmed (Army, WWII)  Ibrahim Muhammad (Navy, WWII) Mahir Hasan (Army, Korea) Abul Fateh Umar Khan (Air Force, Korea)  All died fighting for your freedoms.  Happy Memorial Day Weekend.
The Crimean Tarters kidnapped Ukrainian and Russians and sold them on the slave markets in the Middle East. The Turks kidnapped Christian boys who were brought up from the age of 7 to serve in the Janissaries (infantry units). The slave trade is the reason why there are so many blond and blue eyed people in the Middle East.   Worse still, slavery continues in the Middle East to today’s date – although it no longer involves white children.  Type into Google the words “slavery Saudi Arabia” or another country and read what appears.  The Muslim countries have never apologized for the white slave trade. No compensation has ever been offered to the descendants of the victims.  No monument exists on the sites of the slave markets to commemorate the victims.    4. On 3 occasions, Muslims nearly conquered Europe. Twice the Turks reached the gates of Vienna.  Muammar Gaddafi, when he was Libyan leader, predicted that Muslims would conquer Europe through numbers and their birth rate.
They are fleeing Europe because of Muslim antisemitism, not European.
Looks like Jared supports Antifa.......  FYI, to anyone that thinks they might support them. I highly recommend that you cut ties immediately and just walk away from them. They are being heavily monitored, as much as Radical Islamic Terrorists.
Italy has been civilized for 3000 years? Since Alexander the Great lived 2300 years ago, could you tell me who his Italian contemporaries were? The Romulus brothers?  I would advise watching the Lost Kingdom on Netflix. In 900 A.D., the Northern Europeans Vikings were a uncivilized barbaric tribe.  They also ruled large parts of the UK. At that time, barns served as palaces. Food was game meat cooked on a fire. There were no arts, poetry, paintings, or any other markers of civilization.  The Indian culture was not stagnant when the British came. In terms of science, perhaps. In the arts, the Indo-Persian poetry, architecture, etc were world class. The Taj Mahal was built at this time, and is a perfect example.  The Muslims who converted the Indians were mainly Afghans and Central Asians, not Arabs.
Sher-e-Hindustan: The answer to your question is embedded in my comment. I believe that more than 40 Muslim-majority countries are signatory to the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, which was adopted as an alternative to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which prevails in the West and much of the rest of the world. The two approaches to human rights are vastly different. The Cairo Declaration focuses on adherence to sharia principles and law and the Universal Declaration emerges from a humanistic perspective.
you don't think americans are tortured when captured by muslims?
"A Muslim turned Christian" says it all in the context of the CPC. What side does Clement take in the case of the great Armenian massacre I wonder.
It's what the PC crowd like Chris in Ottawa or Sphere Music can't seem to understand.  While they run around and accuse those that criticize Islam with racism, with each new attack, each child killed in the name of Islam, drives more people to the right.  First it was Brexit, then Trump, and soon Le Pen and Merkel will get bounced.
These terrorists are driven by radical religious ideology, whether they come from a Muslim nation or are born in the country they attack is now meaningless due to decades of open borders both here and abroad. The San Bernardino and Orlando Muslim terrorists killers were both born right here in the USA. You think Hawaii is immune to Muslim terrorist attack because of the aloha spirit? I'll remind you that they just attacked and killed CHILDREN at a pop concert. If they can do that, there's nothing they're not capable of doing. Let's hope the level of your religious tolerance is never tested here in Hawaii.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said two days ago, "Climate change is one of the biggest risks to humanity." Innocent people are beingslaughtered all over the world, including in his own country and he's worried that the climate may change in the next 100 years?    His response to the recent attack, "This was a deliberate and cowardly attack, "I condemn it in the strongest terms," "There is no justification of such barbaric acts." Strange how the words Muslim or Islam or Islamic terrorists or Islamic extremists or anything relating to Islam is mentioned. Strange.
Of course, I'm probably just as right saying there were likely hundreds of Trump Supporters who wanted to attack the protesters at his rallies. Am I alone in understanding its a lame argument to speak of imagined of people that weren't arrested?   From your link: "The tweet came from the president’s official Twitter account, @POTUS, which is chiefly run by his staff, and not from his personal account, @realDonaldTrump, which he controls. Trump has faced criticism for staying quiet about the attack for so many days, even though he is quick to react to violent acts carried out by Muslim extremists."  Days later + it appears to be a staffer, not Trump. He might be concerned with important matters of state, golfing at Mar A Lago. He  shouldn't comment about "every murder"but he has made a big deal out of immigrants murdering American citizens, both those that actually happened and imagined. If he is going to speak against one, he should show integrity and speak against the other as well!
CONTINUED FROM ABOVE)  Today 1.8 million Palestinian Arab Muslims and Christians--that's TWICE the total population of Alaska plus 400,000 more--are penned behind concrete walls and concertina wire in an area equal to the distance between Anchorage town limit and Eagle River with about 5 miles on either side of the intervening stretch of Glen Highway.  These captives are routinely denied water and power, and are repeatedly subjected to aerial bombardment—like shooting fish in a barrel. When such outrages were visited on Ashkenazi Jews in Warsaw, Poland, their confinement was called a “GHETTO”, and those who orchestrated said outrages were hanged by the Nuremburg Tribunal for crimes against humanity.  And today the America REWARDS the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the Warsaw inmates with nearly $4 billion for doing the same to the Palestinians as the Nazis did to them.
Google "Ex muslim Sandra Solomon Why do Canadian imams want me dead"   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6KukdUzkg4
I have to wonder if this is not part of the reason why the definition of "Islamaphobia" is not defined?  Rest assured there are many in the Muslim community in Canada (and others) who have the reintroduction of blasphemy laws as their aim. This is part of a wider campaign by Muslim communities at the local and international level to declare any criticism of the religion of Islam and its prophet hate speech and to make it off-limits.   This is the issue and the real agenda here.    Just witness what happens in our country and elsewhere when Islam or their prophet is criticized...even with a cartoon!....the howls of the who want to shut this discussion down and preach violence reveals the hand at play.     So clarifying this issue to ensure that criticism of Islam is legitimate is required. This will also reveal any hidden agendas. Otherwise we are giving away what is most precious, and we are giving it away without a fight, and even praising those who want to take it from us.
"Obama dumps post-9/11 registry for some immigrant men, mostly Muslims" Most probably his own name was in it, hence his panic decision to dump the registry.
THatcher... The world through the UN agreed in 1947 that the Jewish people had the right to political self determination through a sovereign state...that the Jewish people have the right to govern themselves....at the same time India was partitioned to grant the same thing to Muslims in Pakistan....the hypocrisy is in the rejection of one partition by the people who advocated for and accept the second.  You may be right that in the future, states based on a common culture or religion will be anachronistic....but the entire Middle East is comprised of such states....and you want the tiniest one to go first and give up the protection of sovereignty....you might want to see how well the Ahmadi are treated in Pakistan, or the Kurds in Turkey, or the Yazidis in Iraq....etc...etc...etc...
I did, and what struck me was precisely " "Probably a Christian, judging from his name", meaning he wasn't talking about actual religious beliefs, but about ethnic origin. Which was compounded by the following "and that Canadian mass murderers are "usually white and Christian". Again, Canadian mass murderers haven't as a rule committed their crimes in the name of their religion, so how is that relevant?  Unless his intent is precisely to use the term not to designate a religious belief, but to create a parallel with the identification of "Muslim" as an ethnic group rather than a religion, so you can accuse critics of "racism".
Whether or not you chose his name because you're calling for another war against muslims should be easy to answer.  But you're not going to, are you?
Energy East is a nation building pipeline, providing all Canada access to a clean, stable, secure, supply of Canada OIL. It is the only pipeline that should be built, than the one to the China lunching crowd.  Any Canada Oil left we can sell it to the Americans at the international price instead of the made up in America price.  In the East (for you people in Canada the East is not Toronto/Montreal, it is Saint John, Halifax and Charlettown) we import a million barrels a day of Arab oil, think about it for a second, one million barrels of oil paid for at the international price and the money goes to the most corrupt people in history. The environmental damage cause by the money the Arabs get from us is not even mentioned the funding going into the Muslim civil war, and this make sense to people over a national pipeline to bring Canada oil to all of Canada.
Come on. It's a huge deal that Susan Rice had Trump connections unmasked and the information released with Obama's blessing to the broader intelligence community.  Rice has zero credibility for the truth - she was the bunny after all who blamed Benghazi on spontaneous Libyan anger at an anti-Islamic video. Next, masking Americans in intelligence sweeps is designed to protect incidental Americans turning up in the sweep.  It's rare that politicians ask that Americans be unmasked; even more incredible that it would be Trump transition people who were unmasked; and politically damaging that such unmasked information be released to the broader intelligence community.  This is exactly where the intelligence leaks came from: Obama and Rice initiating an intelligence information dump on Trump associates which under the political circumstances would naturally turn into a smear campaign against Trump's people - right in the very middle of transition.  Obama did this and Rice was the instrument.
Sweden and Germany are up to their butts in problems with Muslims, and their social welfare costs have caught up with them, too.  If the EU collapses, each country will throw up protectionist policies for their own industries, and the free trade between them will end.  Germany will be hurt most, because it has twice the production capacity that its own population can support.  Without exports, Germany is toast.  Sweden has become the rape capital of the world.  The Socialist Utopia is running into a brick wall, yet neither one of those countries calls themselves socialist.  Speaking of "doing fine," how is that little problem with Greece, the 26th wealthiest country in the world, working out?  They've failed to meet 15 of the 17 goals they agreed to for more EU funding.  We'll save Venezuela for another discussion.  The country with the largest oil reserves in the world is in total chaos because of its social programs.  They're in their third default, and no one wants to lend to them.
I would advise these Muslims to read their Quran word for word with understanding, not simply recite it without bothering to understand what the words mean. Most Muslims can recite the Quran in classical Arabic but have no idea what it says. Then after reading the Quran, read the Bible and see the difference.
Neither of your points are illegal. Muslims who didn't live in the town nor had the right to vote in the referendum also went door-to-door to get people to vote yes.
As this attack was by Islamic State against Egypt, not by Egyptians acting out of bigotry in the face of indifference from the government, unlike some other recent attacks, it doesn't put the legitimacy of the Egyptian government into question.  Hopefully, Copts and Muslims can live side-by-side peacefully in Egypt; if not, giving the Copts of Egypt the same ability to protect their own security as is enjoyed by the Jews of Israel, as the unchallangeable masters of the land should not be off the table. Somehow, the message has to be sent that the existence of Israel is no excuse for terrorism, in a loud, clear, and convincing manner.
Although it has been reported officially that the gunman killed himself as security forces stormed his hotel room, an inside source from the FBI reportedly has disclosed that the gunman was actually neutralized by security forces.  Deadmen tell no tales. As far as  the claims by ISIS that he was a recent convert to their Islamic Jihad, it may be creditable. In any case it would not take long for the National Security Agency (NSA) to be able to determine if the gunman had any contacts with ISIS or any of its sister Jihadi groups either abroad or within the US based on their interception of every email, phone contact and internet communication that occurs within the country or that is sent out and received from outside the country.  The only question is whether what they determine will ever be disseminated publicly. No matter as the narrative will be for confiscation of firearms as we all want to be safe don't we??  Question is who will protect you then from a rogue government.
Whelp, if I ever decide to take a Nigerian woman as a second wife, I'll have to make sure she's Muslim, inshaa Allah.  That whole post-clitoridectomy thing doesn't sound like it would offer much of a wild ride, and Christians seem to have more than their fair share of sexual hangups even WITHOUT surgical modification.  And your right.  It's a barbaric cultural practice that predates al-Islam, and was never practiced by the Most Noble Messenger (Saala Allahu alayhi wa Ah'liihi wa Salaam), his family (alayhimus-Salaam) or their followers (radi'Allahu anhum).  I suspect he would have been horrified at the very idea.  He admonished his followers: "Don't go into your wives like camels do (thinking only of your own pleasure), and "The best among you are those who are kindest to their wives."  Don't see any of that fitting with chitoridectomy.  At all.
My point is that Trump has given no indication that his promise to ban Muslims has "expired".  As far as I can tell, you made that up.  In fact, late last year Trump clearly indicated that he was "right all along", which is a pretty strong indication that he doesn't agree with you that the promise has "expired".  I think you're on your own here.  You seem unwilling to acknowledge that someone can achieve a goal in steps, rather than all at once.  My sense is that Muslim ban 2.0 is the first step.  I think that if Muslim ban 2.0 is successful, then we'll see another step sooner or later that will move us closer to a full Muslim ban.  Yes, all news is a mixture of fact and opinion.  Some news is relatively factual and some is relatively opinionated, but it is all a mixture.  The reason for this is that natural language is imprecise, so choices of words and phrasing are constant.  If you want just facts, you need to use a language like mathematics where definitions are precise.
Regardless of whether she was born in Canada or not, for her express such disdain for her country is sad and her hatred for white people downright racist.  And please do not give me that nonsense about "can't be racist against white people".  It empowers people like this one to make unconstitutional hate speeches such as she has done.  However, since she is Muslim, everyone is hesitant to call her out on it for fear of being labeled a racist.
Islam needs to clean up its own house before it starts lecturing others about hate.
I didn't know the Globe and Mail was widely read in the Muslim parts of the world.
I don' really believe they will lose any sleep if there are fewer visitors from the six majority-Muslim countries......  Or for that matter fewer visitors originating from the 10 Middle East airports that ban laptops by airline passengers....
Protecting Anglo Saxon language, culture and heritage is not racist, contrary to what the left, the Marxists, the Bureaucracy who stay employed by immigration, and the globalists say.  It is they who want to wipe out the white race. Underneath all this racist accusation is some kind of conspiracy of the left to destroy the white race. There is no other explanation, except stupidity, and the left will tell us they are brilliant and completely right 100% of the time.. So it couldn't be that Because who in their mind would deliberately import millions of Muslims who have 4 kids and mathematically overwhelm the west in a decade???? If you audit political contributions you will see minority families and minority groups are funding every politician and foundation..  hint hint....  Plato said democracy was the greatest danger to mankind as a system. The tyranny of the minority eventually overwhelms the state as they bend over to give minorities more rights than they deserve.
I agree that terrorists can strike anywhere, but I don't think open borders in the past or present are the cause, especially since we seem to have our own terrorists, such as the white supremacists, some of whom claim to be Christians, and have families that go back for generations in the US. It's possible that many of these terrorists use religion, any one that suits their needs, as a convenient excuse for releasing their anger, frustration, and hatred. If we focus too narrowly on Muslim terrorists, we may never find the real criminals, the people who are willing to kill children, then blame it on god, or anything else that suits their purpose.
How can any of them cut their ties with Islam?
The more revealing part of the the ICM Research survey was that 25% of British muslims wanted to live entirely under sharia law and not British law, and that 40% wanted to live under some parts of it. These numbers are rising from surveys of 10 years ago. One of the conclusions Philips drew was that as the number of muslims increases in the UK their desire to integrate declines and they start trying to recreate the society they came from. That should be a warning to Canada.
Assad was duly elected by the majority of Syrians in the last election.  The Americans have no business interfering there, and the rebels in Aleppo are essentially terrorists.  The conflict is brutal as war is - but the Middle East is a mess since Bush blew up Iraq.  The option to Assad is to let the extreme Islam rule, not a good option...
trudooooo is to busy giving his isis muslim buddy 55 million tax payer money away. Aga Kahn a muslim imam connected to isis, that's where trudooo went on vacation and it was a gift to trudooo. No wonder he tried not to let Canadians know where he and family went to vacation. That is a huge conflict of interest.
I think that by saying " we will give preference to Christians" it has become in effect a Muslim ban and that will be how it is seen overseas. The quote " the vetting process for the vetting of Refugees was not vetted" is probably how this administration will continue to work. Now 90% of the world is upset at us which will not be positive in the long run. We are a nation of emigrants and of imports, running the nation is not the same as running a scripted TV show. Now the stock market has also lost faith, so what's left of my 401 will slide over the cliff.
As pointed out in a column today, a few Muslim Egyptian police officers died protecting the Copts. You cannot expect religious based police due to terrorist attacks. Would you say Muslims in Quebec need their own police force after the massacre there? Nope. One has to depend on a secular police force for protection, that treats all its citizens equally.
WesternPatriot wrote:   "You always claim that terrorists killing in the name of Allah don't represent Islam, yet you claim a couple of people making anonymous threats prove white Canadians are bigots."  Here's logic:  The fact that some people make anonymous threats online or by email against muslims in no way means that "white Canadians are bigots."  It means that those people and their supporters are bigots.  Similarly, islamist fanatics who claim  to be killing in the name of Allah are terrorists.  In no way does that mean that all muslims are terrorists.  And it is not an excuse to demonize a million innocent Canadian muslims.
How could you possibly not mention the biggest slaughter of Muslims in North American history in your own country a matter of months ago??  How is it possible for anyone to be this nationalistic or intellectually dishonest?
Just remember that Canada refused to take hardly any ( 5000 ) of the jewish refugees in the second world war while the US too orders of magnitude higher.  So, we now have the MSM trying to brain wash people into thinking that the 325 refused temporary entry into the US will be a boon for Canada.  Hell, the US had 325,000 coming into the US every day.  And 40 muslim countries are not on the list.  and germany has banned all refugees from Nigeria.  last time I looked Nigeria was a muslim country..
isn't that what Trump's Muslim ban is about?
I really don't know why your post was deemed uncivil, all you did was advocate for the rights of women under muslim law and you used elegant and inoffensive language, but who  knows anymore these days what the "progressives" deem offensive and "uncivilized" and shut down.
Canada is a secular democracy. That essentially means religion has a minor  in the political institutions and boardrooms of the nation. The religious are free to believe and wear what they want, but not to impose their beliefs and customs on other people.   In a secular democracy, freedom from religion should be even more important than freedom of religion.    Journalists have always been very tolerant of people with minority customs but also very irreligious, agnostic, atheistic, humanistic and secular.   So, why are they now obsessing every day about the need of Canadians to accommodate Muslims, like Muslims, make Muslims feel at home, respect Muslims, give Muslims equality?   We should have created a balance between freedom of religion and freedom from religion long ago.   The discussion should have been closed years ago. Instead the controversy has picked up more importance. It's become obnoxious.    What's in it for the G & M to keep stoking the fires of Islamic controversy?
To the Hawaii AG: Are you sure you don't want to ban Muslims from countries listed by Trump (and Obama)?
It is not a matter of whether he was radicalized in America, self radicalized or a foreign agent, He was Muslim and other Muslims applaud his actions.
December 2015: Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, a married Pakistani couple, stormed a San Bernardino County government building with combat gear and rifles and opened fire on about 80 employees enjoying an office Christmas party. They killed 14 after pledging loyalty to ISIS. A third Muslim was charged with helping buy weapons. July 2015: Mohammad Abdulazeez opened fire on a military recruiting center and US Navy Reserve center in Chattanooga, Tenn., where he shot to death four Marines and a sailor. Obama refused to call it terrorism. May 2015: ISIS-directed Muslims Nadir Soofi and Elton Simpson opened fire on the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas, shooting a security guard before police took them down. April 2013: Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Muslim brothers from Chechnya, exploded a pair of pressure-cooker bombs at the Boston Marathon, killing three and wounding more than 260. At least 17 people lost limbs from the shrapnel.
Having as many children as Allah (Peace be upon him) allows is paramount in Islam. It augments the size of ummah (community) which is a source of pride and strength,  Thinking a large ummah leads to poverty and hunger is evil thought.
The dutch can kiss their country goodbye, as the left and islam take over!
Only a tiny minority of Muslim women wear the niqab?  If you say so.  Yet as I go about my daily business - to the local grocery store, the local Walmart, the local fast-food restaurant - I see women wearing niqabs every day.  Perhaps that "tiny minority" all live in my immediate neighbourhood?
airplane the Muslims to won't speak English
I agree general principles are useless if they are too general. We need to be more specific.  Even the most conservative imams argue they believe in gender equality, for example. They just think men and women are different but equal, Islam respects women more than western society does, etc.  The difference is more basic, in this case it is in the taken-for-granted principles of what is more important, women's equal participation in social life, no matter the consequences on "illicit" sexual behavior, or the need to prevent "illicit" sexual activity by any means necessary, even the most drastic curtailing of women's freedom.
Eleven countries including Muslim Turkey have banned the veil so far. The handful of EU member states that have gone that way (including the open compassionate Norway) is just the beginning. There are mostly two factors at play in this issue: a) the practicality of hiding faces in societies that rely on face interaction, b) the need to counteract the rise of Islamic fundamentalism within mostly secular societies. I submit that the above article present a flawed vision of Europe and the Western World.
Yes its all in our heads, fake news no doubt. If only it was true. The reality of Radical Islam is based on blood. Truly what planet do you live  on, how much more death and destruction in the name of ALLA must we witness??? Wake up, your in a coma.
There is nothing new about any of this. Since the end of the Second World War and possibly even before, maybe even as far back as the Crusades,  the country of Lebanon has been used as a proxy battleground for all of the competing interests active in the middle east. From domestic internal conflicts, civil wars between Christians and Muslims, regional middle east disputes, Iran and Saudi Arabia, Israel and everybody, and Russia and America playing the role of the big brothers, Lebanon somehow finds itself in the middle of the violence, as an assortment of factions fight to gain leverage for peace talks. Its too simple to lay the blame on the people of Lebanon or a weak government since both are really a victim external conflicting parties. What might make this more dangerous in 2017 is now that the United States has abdicated its role as the moral leader of international affairs these smaller conflicts no longer have any limits. And that could mean anything is possible.
There is no Muslim cemetery in Quebec.
If? If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.  Why not tie the "increased harassment" to the alt-left and their epic hate for Big Orange? Orange is far more diverse than black, brown or Muslim right?  According to anonymous sources at the DNC, ISIS endorsed Hillary and contributed millions to her campaign.
"Peace, order and good government", eh? That's it, the summation of real Canadian values?! That doesn't exclude honour killings, or does it? The reason that Trudeau objected to the Harper government's little epistle is that it appears to assume that Muslims might be inclined to go that route while in reality it is probably the last thing on the minds of most such potential immigrants. Nobody with any sense is going to admit that they were planning on killing their daughter if she hooked up with the wrong guy! People should be treated as individuals, not because of what town they came from and what religion they practice. At least the writer's right about Kellie Leitch but seems to be oblivious to the fact that the reason that she says the things that she does is that she knows it appeals to a segment of the Conservative base support and so did the wording that Harper was trying to insert - it had everything to do with pandering to lowest common denominator party support.
Young men radicalized. A radical Mormon will leave you a book. A  radical Buddhist will meditate on universal harmony A Radical Catholic will pray for you soul  A radical Protestant won't talk to you A radical Hindu will burn incense A racial Muslim will...well just read any newspaper on earth. .
The Democrats lost the US election because they constantly dismissed the legitimate concerns of Middle America. They labelled people who voiced non-politically correct opinions as being racists, sexists, xenophobes and deplorables. This intolerant Liberal behavior will no longer be accepted.  Rapid demographic change is a factor. People (especially in urban areas) who go from having no Muslim neighbors to having lots will perceive a great change. The fact that Muslims make up a disproportionately large amount of negative news involving global conflict also contributes to the perception of greater numbers. Trump and other members of the Alt-Right appeal to emotion because the Left blatantly ignores them.
"The sad fact is that American voters this November will probably be forced to choose between a Republican nominee who thinks the United States should ban Muslims from entering the country versus a Democratic nominee who thinks the United States has a right to invade Muslim countries; a Republican nominee who agrees with George W. Bush that it’s okay to torture prisoners in the name of fighting terrorism versus a Democratic nominee who agrees with Benjamin Netanyahu that it’s okay to bombard crowded civilian neighborhoods in the name of fighting terrorism; a Republican nominee who supports building a wall on the border to keep Mexicans out of the United States versus a Democratic nominee who supports Israel building a wall far beyond its border to keep Palestinians out of Palestine."  Pick Your Poison: Clinton Vs. Trump on Foreign Policy  http://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/06/16/pick-your-poison-clinton-vs-trump-foreign-policy
Khan is a Muslim Brotherhood activist who promotes Sharia Law and is trying to bring more Jihadists to the United States.  Do some research on him and learn more.
Islam is much more than a religion.  Islam is a comprehensive system - political, military, religious and dietary.  You cannot have Islam without sharia.  Therein lies the controversy.
On the other hand we have a pretty boy who tried to game how we vote towards his party having an edge forever more, his party brings in a bill against Islamophobia, His party is trying to get Fridays off and Trudeau only taking questions once a week, they are now playing with how our parliament has worked for ever, to stop or stifle the Opposition parties. He has 3 Ethics reviews going over his personal conduct.  Who is the most dangerous?
Yes but I see no sign of the federal Conservatives having a dialogue to develop rational, reasonable policies. They seem to be continuing down the same Harperesque dead end of hatred and austerity. As to the UCP in Alberta, we have kenney continuing to spew hatred against Muslims and Khadr in particular long after he ceased to be Citizenship and Immigration Minister. There's only one voice of reason in that leadership race and it's the guy who's calling for a clear split with the alt-right - he of course has no chance in today's extremist "Conservative" environment.
You need to be careful about shades of meaning. Nobody has the right to order a student to refrain from religious activity on their own time. However, everybody most certainly has the right to express the opinion that religion is irrational and religious activity is, at best, a waste of time; in that sense I DO have the right to tell a student on their own time what they should do, or not do.  I would also note that the author ended her column with a question, to wit "What are young Canadian Muslims supposed to do, other than have faith?" Questions call for answers, so I offered one.
Try as he might... Trump is not capable of making medical breakthroughs to solve the afflictions you mention.  Also Islamic Terrorism is a real threat. Look at life under ISIS to see how people are treated. Also terror attacks in the name of Islam far far far exceed any other religions' terror attacks.  Do you not remember the little boy crushed by that truck driven by radical jihadist in France?? Also Google search Bataclan dead bodies and see for yourself.  Or the Boston Marathon bombings...or countless others.  Islamic terror is not a big killer n the USA only because of the ocean that separates the hemispheres.
The same questions are being asked by millions of Europeans since German Chancellor Merkel opened the floodgates to mass illegal immigration from the Middle East in 2015, and of course expected the rest of Europe to play along with her Diktat without voicing any protests. Liberal leftist policy at its very best (Merkel is an ex-G.D.R girl), and a perfect recipe for a troubled future: look at the Muslim ghettos in Britain, France, Belgium,  the Netherlands and Sweden ("YouTube" is full of relevant videos on the subject) to get an idea of what to expect in Canada in the years ahead, if Mr Trudeau really gets going with his rose-tinted humanitarian ideals. Do not let this happen, ask your local MP's to say "no more" while you still can. Ironically, you may yet thank President Trump for that wall he intends to build.
diverdave, why walk when you can fly first class, over that wall. any terrorists worth their vest will get anywhere they want to, anytime they want to. this is an anti muslim, fire up the base act.
You're right about the meddling in Muslim countries. However, what is becoming the main problem now is the recruitment of home-grown Muslims to extremism, some of them converts to Islam. Given that we cannot undo the past, the best we can do is to reduce the attraction of extremism while urging our governments to keep their nose out of situations where there are likely to be innocent civilian casualties resulting from military action against legitimate extremist targets. Discriminatory policies against any racial or religious group and condoning discriminatory actions like islamophobia are negatives, not positives as you appear to state by your sneering at "global muliticoporatisn (whatever that is!), multiculturalism and multireligionism". Bundling in "the profiteers of the immigration and refugee business" is odd to say the least, as is stating that the Globe is somehow profiting from all this.
Multiculturalism should not mean that we (the West) tolerate another culture's intolerance. If we do in fact support diversity, woman's rights, and gay rights , then we cannot in good conscience give Islam a free pass on the grounds of multicultural sensitivity. And we need to say unambiguously to Muslims living in the West: If you want to live in our societies, to share in their material benefits, then you need to accept that our freedoms are not optional. They are the foundation of our way of life; of our civilization – a civilization that learned, slowly and painfully, not to burn heretics, but to honor them.
Apparantly,  that is one of the things that is offensive to ask of Muslims!
Who doe's Ahmed Hussen stand up against ? I hope he isn't another John McCallum  who wanted to change the Canadian fabric with copious amounts of Muslim Refugees . Let's just take it easy , and find out if the current crop of Refugees assimilates into the Canadian way of life . Why do we think that maybe we should have more stringent Immigration policies? - Is it because of the current crime rate increase in Ottawa , Is it because the CBC  found that a family in Windsor , Ontario has not got a job but only added another child to our Welfare Rolls! At least Mr. Trump has qualified individuals for his Cabinet - Unlike Trudeau - Since when doe's being a politician make you qualified for a Cabinet position ?
saith the muslim who says he would fight his fellow Americans in defense of muslims in the mid east.
Unless, of course, you're a Sunni Muslim wanting to ban the wrong kind of Muslims...
Islamophobia is perfectly understandable, even justifiable. Why?  Four reasons:  1. While many Muslims are nice people, invite 20 million to come here, and Canada will be a Muslim society with a Muslim government. Some Canadians are asking themselves: Do we want to live in a society similar to those in the Middle East? Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for the introduction of Sharia law.  2. The violent conflicts between Muslim groups in the Middle East are well known. Do we want to import those conflicts into Canada?  3. Many Canadians from Europe are familiar with the history of the "white slave trade". Between 1600 and 1830, 2.6 million white girls and boys were kidnapped and sold in the Middle East slave markets to serve as labourers, domestics and sex slaves in harems. The Barbary pirates in North Africa sailed as far north as Ireland & Iceland to kidnap white children.   (continued above)
In a perfect world the government should have no say in how people dress as long as they do not hurt others.  What gives us reason to pause in this instance is that respected Muslims like Mr. Fatah and Ms. Hirsi Ali remind us that the practice of covering women's faces is deeply symbolic of an anti western mindset.
You may have put your finger on why so many Muslims want to escape their oppressive regimes and find freedom in far less oppressive western countries. Secular or non-fundamentalist Muslims, like many Christians and Jews, exist throughout Europe and North America.
no james. we will judge Christ and Christians by the writings of the New Testament- and Muslims by their book(s).
Hey Non Carbo-- You DO realize that the reason Muslims might not top the list of causing disruptions for "being drunk" on planes is because.......wait for it.......they don't. drink. alcohol?  But hey- according to your logic, let's check them for that, anyway- because, you know, racism....
Do you think they might be Muslims? Is it possible they being in the Middle East after all?
In Muslim countries offices and businesses usually close early on Fridays to allow for prayers, they don't close for all of Friday. In Israel, they close almost everything down for Shabbat around 2 p.m. Friday. Having school end early on Friday would also work.
Did you ever hear of lynchings, the inquisition, Srebernica, residential schools, all justified by the Holy Book.  No religion has a monopoly on monstrous behaviour. Your obvious hatred of Muslims is part of that tradition. Flip your loyalty and ISIS will welcome you.
Trump has on a number of occasions very clearly obstructed justice. Does Trump care? Probably not as he has boasted about doing exactly that during the course of a nationally televised NBC interview. Trump is also guilty of abuse of power, neglect of the emoluments regulations, attempts to override the Constitution (the Muslim ban) and on and on. Heck, Trump's middle of the night and ungrammatical tweets could be regarded as literary crimes! And, as far as acting as a President is concerned, it's obvious that Agent Orange has no intention of behaving in a dignified manner or putting in the effort to come up to speed on important national and international issues. Perhaps Pence could even be an improvement although, admittedly, the jury is still out on that question.
The healthcare system he left us only halfway works if the law is broken.  So, you also deny that his foreign policy was a joke and a disaster?  How did ISIS get its foothold and the Muslim Brotherhood?
The fundamental problem is that the majority of otherwise peaceful and law-abiding Muslims are unwilling to acknowledge, much less repudiate, the theological warrant for intolerance and violence embedded in their own religious texts (Qur'an and Hadith).  Five things that are recognized as inherently harmful in Islam and only when they are repudiated and nullified will a true Muslim Reformation have been achieved:   1. Muhammad's semi-divine and infallible status along with the literalist reading of the Qur'an, particularly those parts that were revealed in Medina;  2. The investment in life after death instead of life before death;  3. Sharia, the body of legislation derived from the Qur'an,  the Hadith, and the rest of Islamic jurisprudence;  4. The practice of empowering individuals to enforce Islamic law by commanding right and forbidding wrong;  5. The imperative to wage jihad or holy war
I don't agree, HughRG, that this has nothing to do with the the fact that the people making the request are Muslims, though you might be right in that regard.  I do agree that some people want to distance themselves from things that, to them, represent death. But the people who voted must surely have considered for some time how this land would be used. That's what is happening in my neighbourhood. The City of Edmonton wants to use some city-owned land for infill, and developers want to create homes or commercial property on land they own, but they all come up against the NIMBY thing, over and over. Many people don't want more people. But they don't want a strip mall there, either. They don't even want a school, which is what the land was originally set aside for. The reasons most often given are inadequate infrastructure, loss of the value of their homes, and loss of green space.  All this considered, what could be better than a cemetery as a neighbour?
The article is very superficial.  In case of Partition of Sudan, it was Muslim North versus Christian South.  What is now?
As we watch yet again the frothing left slobbering with frothing spittle on all of us, I have a question that never gets asked nor will it ever get answered. You want anti Muslim people ( who have aright to be what they want to be and believe what they want to believe under our constitution - lets not forget this) haters (your word) hunted like criminals. Yet you never bring this up The Muslim culture and their religion Islam are like barbarians. They stone women like the middle ages They mercy kill women for some twisted belief that they have the right to They genital mutilate girls They refuse to admit that Islam is really a totalitarian political system with a small group of dictators running it) Iran, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc. They make women cover themselves and walk 15 feet behind men. Reconcile that Tell us why you condone this? Don't twist it - answer it
Actually, per QUR'AN, 'taqiyya' is permission to deny being Muslim to save one's life if admitting one's faith will get one killed.  So far Shi'a scholars have, on that basis, ruled that we can't practice taqiyya in the US because, despite the best efforts of hate-mongering nitwits like Dumbitchki it hasn't come to that yet.  For most of us.  Bet you can't even identify the passage in Qur'an where taqiyya was first authorized, because the most vocal revilers of my Book have never bothered to read it.  Apparently you apply Bill Watterson's 'the Calvin methodology of research' (as so succinctly described by Hobbes): "Why expend effort learning when ignorance is instantaneous?"  Next question.
Exactly. It is hilarious that Trump seems unable to understand that everything he has said and says now publicly about his Muslim ban attempt now becomes evidence for it's intent.   Clueless.
Wearing a burka is not prescribed in Islam.  It's a cultural tradition found in some Muslim nations.  Notley is wrong (again).  It's not "Islamaphobia" -that's a made-up word from the extreme left SJW crew.  Canadians and Western countries and cultures have reversed many traditions that were once cultural traditions in favour of progressive attitudes.  Is it too much to ask that others reverse some of their traditions that others find offensive?
2006 Republican President G.W. Bush's Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and a U.S. Delegation went to Libya to negotiate a U.S. Alliance Agreement with Libyan President Gaddaffi.  Terms and Conditions President Gaddaffi agreed to to become a U.S. Ally. Libyan Military must "Aggressively Fight Muslim Terrorists" (this would keep Muslims fighting only at U.S. Ally Libya, stabilizing the Entire Continent of Africa).  Must Stop Libyan Nuclear Program, turn in all Nuclear Centrifuges to U.S. (reason I was there, TDA).  Stop Chemical Weapons Program and turn in All Chemical Weapons to U.S. (reason I was there, TDA).   Must Implement United Nations and UA  (African Union) Approved Libyan Citizen's Rights (he did that with his "Green Book").  Libyan Oil sold only to U.S. European Allies.  November 2010, Democrat President Obama's Ordered Overthrow of U.S. Ally President Gaddaffi of Libya a U.S. Ally since 2006, Obama support of Non Libyan "Obama Libyan Rebels" of Al Quada's Ansar Al Shariah.
With any luck, we'll unravel Fields' motives faster than it took the Obama administration to discern the motives of a Muslim shouting "Allahu Akbar!" while gunning down soldiers at Fort Hood. (Six years.)   But so far, all we know is that Fields said he was "upset about black people" and wanted to kill as many as possible. On his Facebook page, he displayed a "White Power" poster and "liked" three organizations deemed "white separatist hate groups" by the Southern Poverty Law Center. A subsequent search of his home turned up bomb-making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition and a personal journal of combat tactics.   Actually, none of that is true. The paragraph above describes, down to the letter, what was known about Micah Xavier Johnson, the black man who murdered five Dallas cops a year ago during a Black Lives Matter demonstration.   Sole alteration to the facts is reversing the words "black" and "white."
Recep Tayyip Erdogan is now in charge of an Islamic Theocracy and he is the de facto Caliph. The country seems to be a 50/50 split. The next move is a purge of the intellectuals, educated and the nationalization of business organizations as the economy tanks. Is the Ottoman empire to be reborn or will there be a civil war? The EU will have more to worry about than Brexit as there is now the possibility of hundreds of thousands of the displaced leaving or being forced out of Turkey by an impetuous decree.
That's quite the post, sky Tell me, in regards to the actual topic at hand, which is providing space for Muslims students to observe their religious practice for a short period once a week - in case you'd forgotten - exactly how:  1 - is there a demand that "the majority relinquish their traditions" 2 - that they be made to "feel guilty" 3 - that this is a "demonstration of religious intolerance towards the majority culture" 4 - is the school being "changed in significant ways" 5 - does the religion go "against current values" 6 - does the religion demonstrate "contempt for the majority culture"  BTW, people exercising their constitutional rights to reasonable accommodation aren't really obliged to ask nicely.
All such Globe columns about Islamic matters are always written from the Muslim's point of view. And a radial view at that. No moderate Muslim who wants to maintain a separation of religion and school is given credence.   All objections by non Muslims are dismissed as mere hate, taking the side of Muslims against social secularism which would otherwise be considered for the common good.
Of course we shouldn't condemn all Muslim "refugees" for the acts of others. There must be at least ten or maybe even a dozen Muslims worldwide who have condemned all the terrorist attacks carried out by their co-religionists.
"The world is not made brand new every morning."  -- Justice David Souter Trump can try to make the executive order appear to be neutral, but he cannot take back his promise to ban all Muslims from entering the US.  The executive order takes a step toward fulfilling his promise.  By the way, a Muslim ban is unconstitutional because it is discriminatory on the basis of religion.
A Muslim follower of Islam attacked, shot, maimed and killed many innocent people in a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey.  There many verses in the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers.   For decades, Muslim followers of Islam have been attacking, maiming and killing innocent, civilian non believers in the Middle East, in other parts of Africa, in Europe, in Australia, in Asia and in North America.  Scholars say Jews, Christians and Muslims are all people of the Book, the Holy Bible. They have the same God of Abraham. Jews call that God YHWH or Yahweh, Christians call that God Jehova or Lord. Muslims call the same God Allah (peace be with him).   Which group is following God's will properly? Is it Jews, Christians or Muslims?
Would those be the same "jewish extremists" who were called islamophobic for flagging the video calling for death to jews?
The last time Canada experienced a tragedy involving a Muslim, the Liberals brought us the ill fated gun registry.  I can't imagine what ill fated legislation this will turn out.
Mead Treadwell said that some of Trump’s pronouncements about women and Muslims were “not great.”  Really Mead? Ya think?
And, by the way, Observer, to further reinforce my observation, it does not take long to see what folks said about Tom Clancy, the author I just mentioned who had the hideous gall to cast Islamist terrorists as bad guys:  "Islamophobia in English Novels" (from the Islamic Forum): "Islamophobia in English Novels. Presently I am reading... as a matter of fact, he reminded me of another bigot, Tom Clancy."  "Islamophobia in Literature"... "This page outlines several examples in which Islamophobia is present and perpetuated in popular novels and bestsellers"... "Tom Clancy.... perpetuates negativity towards Muslims and Islamophobia. "  Double standard. Clear and plain as the nose on your face.
RangerMC, As a candidate, Trump said he would ban all Muslims from entering the US, and the executive order is the first step toward doing that.  Don't you believe Trump?  You seem to believe everything else he says.  A draft report by the Homeland Security Department, based on statistics and reports, concludes that citizenship is likely an unreliable indicator of terrorist threat to the US.  Furthermore, people from  the 6 countries covered by the executive order committed very few acts of terror compared with people from other countries.  In fact, half of the people inspired by a foreign terrorist group to carry out an attack in the US were American citizens born in the US. Trump's executive order is ineffective in reducing terrorism.   Trump has come up empty in his effort to reduce terrorism and improve safety.  You say that there's nothing to "repeal or replace" it with.  It's Trump who should be repealed and replaced.
The G&M’s adopted policy, of thwarting any criticism of Islam or Muslims, is de facto sharia implemented right here in Canada. It could make you wonder if there are special stakeholders in this company with roots in countries like Qatar or Saudi Arabia.
Legislation stemming from M103 will empower the RCMP  and OPP to arrest anybody who offends Muslims in the news media or social media.  Whether in Facebook or Globe comment, to speak truth about Islamic terror and bloodletting will be  a crime.
formerlyrbfromcalgary, What you're doing is called deflecting the real issue. Even as you state how is that  with 0.5% of muslim population, Calgary has  already a muslim major, years ago, in Ontario, they were about pass a sharia law, if it wasn't for the prompt intervention of caring canadians. The usual Islam has nothing to do with it, what's happening in Europe will never happen in Canada, is pure intentional deflection from persons bent on changing Canada social and political structure to a new religion. True.
Going into the current decade with Christian bloodletting exceeded the word-limit.  Your fanatical United Methodist and Church of Christ despots murdered 3.3 million in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003.  Only comfort from the current election outcome is Frump is (possibly) a little less likely to deploy tactical nukes just because the Israelis want him to than Killary would have been, in that she repeatedly has made that pledge to her AIPAC handlers since at least 2005.  You Christians still have FAR more blood on your hands than we would if there were a HUNDRED groups like Da'esh running amok in the world.  And we know who unleashed 'em and those like 'em.  Frankenstein's monster is ever a reflection of its creator.  And that certainly isn't God.  Those who prescribe and implement US foreign policy and its corporate beneficiaries get credit for that.  Muslims' strand of the 'common thread' merely represents its victims. The western imperialist nations weave the rotten cloth.
Mohammad married a 6 year old. By Islamic  standards,  those Syrian girls are old maids.
--Why do the mainstream newspaper silence our free speech when we express our huge concerns regarding Islam and the massive flood of Islam into the West?  The main stream media just published your comment. So what is your point?
What is similar is that Americans have believed that the acts of the Japanese military can be blamed on the American Japanese and Japanese immigrants.   For Muslim Americans and Muslim immigrants some Americans believe that the acts of Isis can be blamed on them.   Many immigrants are here because their collaboration with the American military can be verified.   They have risked their lives and families to work with Americans to defeat the enemy. Yes American Japanese and American Muslims share similar problems.
Does Trudeau's deliberate evasion of specific criticism of Muslim murders in Spain and Finland speak the same volume?  If not, what's the difference?
Wow. that's quite a leap in logic there Demento. It's getting clearer and clearer that your issue is about multiculturalism rather than the concept of reasonable accommodation or rational thought. My point about your fictional Japanese was that if they had rational reasons then their concerns were justified, however if their reasons were irrational then they need to be called out for it. The excuses I've seen for people not wanting a muslim cemetery are all irrational, ignorant, and fearful with no basis in reality.  It's unfortunate that you can't see the difference between those concepts and are instead caught up in some self induced echo chamber of being offended about people being called out for their prejudices.
The point reasonable, intellectually honest, intelligent, people are making is that a 'muslim travel ban' isnt not going to prevent terror attacks on U.S. soil anymore that it would in Europe since the murderers did not get on a plane a month before and fly into Europe, they are European nationals whether born or naturalised.  But dont let that little fact stop the spread of misinformation, fear, and hate mongering, its worked so well for 45, why shouldnt his followers/ admirers continue.
Club Islam.   Playing goody goody two shoes with this monster , world wide pariah , is absolute dementia.
Nightclub (booze) on the European side of Istanbul and a nightclub frequented by foreigners.   Looks like ISIS or other Islamist terrorist outfit.
@ALbertD3  >>So, in saying that, am I an online troll? You didn't define it very clearly, just as M103 fails to clearly define Islamophobia. This is a dangerous game. . Spot on.  We have articles conveying 'Muslim victimhood'  and 'Canadian -phobias'  - most of the time  authored by a Muslim woman in a head-scarf.  Hold the outrage, before marking the post, and ask yourselves why is that a pattern? . Where are the Muslim male authors? Or non-covered Muslim female authors? Or opinions different than those having been relentlessly published in G&M?
We're all entitled to opinions, Hugh, but my own is that Wilders is a wingnut by any definition.  Anyone who wants to indiscriminately close places of worship and ban a book that ultimately counsels love and forgiveness is not acting rationally.  I get that many people have twisted Islam for political ends, but my experience is that they are far from the majority.  Trudeau may not be to your liking but with the exception of electoral reform he is pretty much doing what he said he would do.  Not unlike his predecessor, who abandoned Senate reform when he found out it was, like, hard.  A final thought.  Wingnuts do not belong to a political stripe.  Anyone who proposes idiotic policy that has no chance of working fits that bill, left, right, or centre.  Kathleen Wynne would be a shining example on the centre, whereas David Suzuki is a fitting left wing representation.
No "home-grown extremist" comes close to threatening my freedom to participate freely in society, as extremist Muslims do. The fact people like you don't see that is what scares the hell out of me.  The willingness of some to throw women under the bus in the name of  "diversity" and "ethnic relations" is frightening.
Please read the paper- Paris, Brussels, Holland, attacks on Jewish institutions, businesses and individuals. Not hard to find Roy. One doesn't have to be a bigot to look at hard truths and this is one. The last to presidents of France have had to go out of their way to reassure French Jews that they are welcome in France to the level of fear- and the fear is coming from attacks by radicalized Muslims. I don't condemn all Christians for outfits like the KKK and Westboro- but I'm not going to be willfully blind and deny they exist.
"he cares the most about The Constitution" That certainly shines through with his failed muslim ban.
Problem is with the earth's population increasing by 80 million people a year, at some very distant date having cemeteries will no longer be viable.  I think Christianity is nearing the point they could accept that and perhaps Jews, but Muslim's I am not so sure.   I say bury all faiths together or allow no more burial sites whatsoever as they are a waste of land space and have nothing to do with Allah and/or God.
Actually I don't know what I am. I am pro abortion, against  immigration, against organized conservative Religion like Christians, Muslims, pro environment, pro death penalty, anti LGBT agenda ...
So your point is what?   We have to be equal opportunity advocates to terrorism, and thus we should open the borders to every nation that has Muslim extremists? The better idea is to prevent extremism wherever we can. There is lots of Muslim extremism that isn't tied to Twitter comments, but actual bombs going off.  http://www.religionofpeace.com  That being so, it's better to not allow those terrorists into this nation.  (and whoever is triggered by this post and votes to delete it, stop being a baby)
Young men radicalized. A radical Mormon will leave you a book. A radical Buddhist will meditate on universal harmony A Radical Catholic will pray for you soul  A radical Protestant won't talk to you A radical Hindu will burn incense A racial Muslim will...well just read any newspaper on earth. .
Paulie, You seem to forget Obama was elected by a majority of voters, TWICE! He beat McCain by seven points and gave your pal Mittens a shellacking. His approval rating stands at 57% now. Where was your boy George W's at this point in his presidency?  Hilarious that you should mention Eric Cantor, who got sent packing, when he lost his primary.  Trump's election was also a repudiation of the Republican establishment, that you have spent your career shilling for. You're the one who condescends to ordinary working stiffs, who you believe you can manipulate with your  galling hypocrisy.   Since the election Trump has backpedaled on every promise. No wall. No Muslim ban. No prosecution of Clinton. No 45% tariff on China. No abolishing Obamacare on day one.  In Trump working class Americans are about to find out that once again, they have been promised one thing, then handed another, by a con man.
If you think Trump's trip is strange, nothing could be stranger than the spin this piece puts on reality. You condemn Trump for participating in a cultural event as if no other president ever did so on a state visit? You condemn Ivanka Trump's plea for support of a fund for entrepreneurial women. The Clintons did the same thing. But unlike the Clintons, who raised money for their own "foundation" (which also funded Bill's affluent life style), the fund Ivanka Trump gained support of is a World Bank fund which she has no control of and from which she gains no financial support. As for going to a country which supports terrorism, if you check the transcript of his speeches, he confronts the Saudis.  He tells them he respects their Islamic culture but the only way for peace is that THEY must weed out the radical factions. What a wierd concept for a president avowed by the press as a total xenophobe? But then Trump CAN'T do anything successfully....right????
Thank you for thoughtful response. 1. The tragedy is ongoing, it never stops, but you're right. Emotional responses are bad which is why I think the Muslim ban is silly. 2. I agree that the focus for gun reform should be handguns. Do you think magazine limits make sense? 3. The tragedy is ongoing, it never stops. Define tyranny? I agree, 2A should be revisited it is very poorly worded. The NRA only has part of it up in the lobby. 4. Not sure what Germany has to do with US.  5. Law abiding citizens will have no trouble with the gun show loophole being closed or magazine limits. The left is not interested in confiscation. 6. No doubt. If only the NRA didn't block research into gun violence so we could have a complete picture.  I think there is a lot room between where we are and where we could go from a gun regulation standpoint without infringing on the framers' intention.
Are there only Muslims in those countries? If no its not a racial thing. Watson and chin should get out of politics. Chin has no right abusing Limited Hawaii taxpayer funds...
I'm sorry but I have a huge issue with the Islam parents that want separate rooms for prayer.  Why is it, in Canada, that we bend to accommodate the smallest percentage of people.  It will require taxpayer dollars to accommodate that request.  Its a voluntary thing to decide to move to another country - if I moved to another country, I would expect to adapt to the way they live.  It would honestly NEVER occur to me to feel entitlement to demand there be changes made for me.   If you chose to move here and don't find it acceptable, perhaps you should decide to move somewhere else.
@Sher-e-Hindu  Oh, you love the Germans. They give you"white people are genocidal" talking point. Let's review a few historical facts - events taking place well after WWII:  Rwandans managed to outdo the Germans(rate). With machetes. Half a century after WWII. ( and I have seen your attempts to pin that on Christianity) . Pol Pot  - an undisputed champion. . China (do you need to bring that up?).  . Japan - WWII? . "How about those Serbs?" - I see you post time and again. . How about those Hindus, I'll ask in response. Under that watch of the current Indian PM. 21 century. . How about those millions Bengali - killed by Muslims? ...  But back to your point - or rather your usual attempt to deflect and distort:  Using you example - why aren't Jews blowing up stuff in Germany? Seeking repercussions?  It's not "everybody did" as an excuse. It is world history. But the hapless Left, and the  bigots of color that cherry pick facts and misplace context to justify Islam terrorism.
What is Islamophobia exactly?
You confuse political rule with civilization and culture. The Romans conquered Hellenistic kingdoms and empires by the 1st century BC, but Greek civilization and culture dominated and thrived in the Eastern Roman Empire and the Eastern Mediterranean  for 700 years after that,  centred in the great metropoli of Alexandria and Antioch and Byzantium, as well as lesser cities, and even continued in ways we tend to underestimate---the influence of Gibbon and British and German classicists and Romantics---in the Byzantine Empire.    (Think of it this way. It's not as if Indian civilization ended when Muslims from central Asia dominated  most of India militarily and politically from the 11th century onward, even if the heyday of Indian philosophy and science tended to be in the thousand years before then. )
The autopsy revealed that he had been drinking (0.93 grams of alcohol per liter of blood) and consuming drugs (cannabis and cocaine). As far as I know, the consumption of alcohol is a no-no for radical Muslims: they won't have access to Allah's promised 72 virgins when they die if they are boozers!
Islamaphobia is a left wing term created to imply systemic racism.  Notice in M103 that they also use the term Islamaphobia and imply that it is systemic therefore legislating guilt onto Canada.  This now paves the way for Social Justice Warriors to vent their outrage and demand that their left agendas be met without even an attempt to resist.  There is no such thing as Islamaphobia.  People may know little or perhaps even know a great deal about Islam but, what the left wants to do is force you to like it.  The mere fact that you might even think that Islam is not what it claims to be (The religion of peace) opens you to their vitreous attacks.  They make complex issues out of what is really quite simple.  Would you accept the doctrine of a warlord-pedophile who talks to angels, believes that he has the final word of god, wants to kill atheists, homosexuals and anyone who either leaves or turns their back on Islam?  If the answer is no then you don't have to like or accept Islam.
Did you notice that few terrorists hail from growing economies of Asia - China, Singapore, Korea, India, or even Japan.  All Jihadis come from failing economies.  When an individuals realize that they can not make it in a society because of prevailing Laws and wasteful socio-economics keep income distribution static, they turn to other solutions, notably religions because they preach frugality and how to survive in face of scarcity.  Today, the Muslim countries because of economic malaise are at the forefront of this phenomenon. As Western, notably American economy bites dust, people are turning to faith. Election of Trump who espouses extreme Protestant views is a clear symptom of this malaise.  If America is next, can Canada be far behind?
It's imperative that all Canadians both Muslim and non-Muslim read this book concerning Islamic reform:  "Heretic  Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now by Ayaan Hirsi Ali"  Go to your local library and get it.   It's not a book about bigotry, its a book that dissects Islam explaining why its the way it is and how it must go through a reformation.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali makes a powerful case that a religious Reformation is the only way to end the terrorism, sectarian warfare, and repression of women and minorities that each year claim thousands of lives throughout the Muslim world. With bracing candor, the brilliant, charismatic, and uncompromising author of the bestselling Infidel and Nomad argues that it is foolish to insist, as our leaders habitually do, that the violent acts of Islamic extremists can be divorced from the religious doctrine that inspires them. Instead we must confront the fact that they are driven by a political ideology embedded in Islam itself.  Fed. MP's must read it.
"Obscurantist language." "Tendentious neologism." "Special interest privileging." And should you fail to recognize M-103 as any of that, you are disingenuous.  This is the rhetoric of bigotry dressed up in two dollar words. And get this: it's "downright dangerous" to call it what it is. These are the tactics that every closet bigot employs. First the bigotry is cloaked in rhetorical ploys. And then an iron wall is erected around it, seeking to shut off any debate.  Bigotry is a character flaw with serious social ramifications. So the lengths that people will go to deny their bigotry are great. Nevertheless, bigotry's underlying vehemence always gives it away. "The motion is Orwellian. It is at its core an insidious form of thought policing." And that over a simple, non-binding motion in Parliament intended to express solidarity with Muslim Canadian citizens, as a result of a mass murder inflicted on them.
IMO, the author has inadvertently outlined the biggest problem we face to bettering the world which is the pernicious infection of political correctness.  It has sapped the will of Western leadership, especially in politics and education.  So we get snippets like "Europe struggles with mass migration and right-wing extremism"  No mention of the insidious Islamic extremism which has motivated the Right.  Another reminder of the millions of refugees in the Mid-East region but yet no acknowledgement that except for a tiny few, these people won't be going anywhere.  Have any Western leaders talked about over-population in Africa - given that it's their biggest problem? Or maybe it's easier to blame sub-Sahara droughts on Albertans driving SUVs.  Non-PC China is a huge economic and political force.  Non-PC Russia kicked sand in Obama's face and controls Syria. Non-PC Turkey is swinging to Islam.  The West better wake up.
Maya87 writes:  "one example - his regular declarations that he is a feminist yet his apparent fondness for accommodating the planet's religion that remains the most patriarchal and oppressive towards women everywhere."  --  Which one would that be?  Christianity, Judaism, Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Shinto, Tenrikyo, Cao Dai, Bahai?  They could all fit that description.
I'm so glad that this country has a constitution, and a bill of rights, and a checks and balance system including courts to interact with congress and the president. Otherwise, as politicians gain votes by pandering to fear and hatred, it's like next we're going to be insisting Muslims walk around with a yellow star; or we'll be patrolling Muslim neighborhoods in our own country as if our fear of terrorism justified that. Can we stop please? Can we solve problems without becoming a banana republic? Can we not abandon the principles that make this whole thing worth it? We're supposed to be different, and better. Are we?
Gun deaths ?  Oh smug holier than thou Canadian  it was Canada where Muslims were killed in a mosque in Quebec in Justin's Canada not in Trump's USA  so much for smugness
sky, we've had our differences but I agree 100% with what you're posting here about learning about other religions.  Although I do find it odd that your posts here seem to be counter to other posts you've made about Islam.
If we were permitted to remark that this was simply another Muslim following the Koran then I would agree.  However, such statements are likely to be censored so all that is left are observations like this. Perhaps we should start treating Islam like the way we treat the KKK?
What rubbish.  It's recognition of a horrible, racist tragedy.  Are you really too busy complaining about the UN and impending Sharia law to recognize the tragedy of innocents slaughtered at prayer for no reason than being Muslim?  Have you already so alienated all of the more than 1 billion Muslims in the world that you can't stomach an official condemnation of both the tragedy and the overt bigotry that motivated it? What is so wrong with a statement that that is un-Canadian when it is contrary to the Charter and all of our human rights codes as well as basic human decency? What's wrong with condemning slaughter and demanding just a few minutes of attention to it?  How much must you hate if you can't even bear that little time, that little effort.
action speaks louder than words, in some instances trump has denounced racism and bigotry but in other instances he appears to favor it.  he has been slow to denounce racism and bigotry groups, such as the kkk, neo-nazii's etc.  his prior actions in life and rhetoric during the campaign clearly shows his favor of white supremacist.  in reality he is also one.  his campaign slogan make America great again, is really make America white again.  but in reality he is making America worse, condemning minorities, muslims, women, lgbtq, etc.  he wants do divide America, he has not reached out to minorities.  he only goes to areas to campaign who supported him, he does not go the areas who did not support him and try unite them with the rest of his white America.  he claim that he will help the blacks in inner cities to give the job, better education and housing.  he had not absolutely nothing yet and likely will not.  he just lies and lies.  not to be trusted.
Is Muslim a race? Last I hear it was a religion and from what I have seen and read regrading negativity toward Christians my comment would be considered mild. This is my personal opinion and if you take a good look around the world you will see analogy playing out time and time again.
Let me guess: those foreign workers of course would not be coming from Europe, but from Pakistan, and other Islamic countries that Trudeau feels obligated to? And, of course they would be dirt cheap, so Trudeau and gang could continue lowering middle class wages - the agenda of the globalist elites. Why not retrain displaced oil business professionals (engineers, etc.) for the high tech industry? They are Canadians, out of jobs, so this makes much more sence.
Yes, the Shafia family is of course representative of the thousands of Muslims living in this country.  /sarcasm off  Cherry-picking isolated incidents is not a valid argument.
Freddie, something is wrong when you have to six entries just to answer one. Once more, I say that ethnic origins do not separate the Holy Lands, it is strictly religious faiths that separate the Holy Lands. And no matter who's seed is what, Jewish faith came first in that land, way before the Islamic faith who have taken control of the region.  You seem to get very anal into this problem but I think you can't see the tree in the forest. Once more, after all that you have written, you still haven't come with what you believes to be the proper solution to the problem. Since it is not about the "seed" of whoever but the faith of whoever, I am still waiting to see what your thoughts are on the proper way to handle this. I am asking for your opinion on this, Freddie......you must have a thought or two, eh?
I'm a agnostic and quite comfortable being so.  Many Christians are comfortable with their beliefs as well.  That's fine....no problem for me.  I don't condemn Christians for their beliefs, nor do I Muslims, Buddists, Hindu, Shinto, or athiests or whatever.  However, I do tire of those who are firmly convinced theirs is the "only true path" and all others must join them or be forever damned to Hell (with a capital H).  I don't care what Mr. Pence believes so long as those beliefs a) don't hurt anyone else and b) he doesn't attempt to force them on others.  Clearly, his political history shows he hasn't hesitated to support legislation which does, in fact, force his particular brand of "christian" beliefs on others.  Gary Crum
Fair enough question, 63.  What's the relevance of tRump's wife citizenship?  In case you've been asleep, tRump is waging a immigration war against Mexicans, Muslims, and any brown skin judicial officer that doesn't agree with him.  I want to know if wife number four gained her legal citizenship before or after marrying tRump and did she jump through the hoops that all other immigrants did to obtain theirs?  Me thinks tRump cut through the immigration process red tape and handed wife number four her citizenship papers like he was handing her a bribe rose.
"...from the single-issue party of angry white men..." And there it is!!! The only group of people who can openly be insulted in print and on television and for some reason it is not a hate crime, it is actually encouraged to disparage white people. Try calling BLM the angry black people movement, see how quickly you are fined and thrown in jail. Try saying ISIL is a Muslim terrorist group, see what happens to you. But white people,  come up with your most vile derogatory term no problem.
"I think this is good news for Europe" says a Minister in the former majority party now returned to office. Well, from the prospective of leftist globalist liberals it is. The pretense of being a center right party has long been dispelled with immigration policies that have allowed mass migration and the usurping of thousands of jobs by wander in migrants from both Eastern Europe and in more recent years at unprecedented rates from Africa and the Middle East.  Avowed progressive parties have championed non-vetted wander-ins to storm Europe in a flood  that has largely gone unchallenged in the Netherlands while France ,Germany and Sweden  reap the chaos and non assimilation. Wilder's challenge of Islamic migration, its dangers, high lighted by death threats upon himself are ignored through the mantra of the left who champion liberal believes without seeking responsible outcomes.
Mr. Ibbitson, we had Mr. Harper and his divisive brand of politics for 10 years.  We also had Ms. Leitch trying to succeed Mr. Harper with a very far right agenda.  In recent months, we have seen a rise in anti-Semitism, anti-African-Canadian graffiti, and anti-Muslim violence.    We in Canada may not have the "in-your-face" kind of polarization as exists in America.  But the problems we have here are no less hurtful and no less harmful.
And if you convert to Islam (either branch) and then decide it was a mistake, you are subject to the death penalty as an apostate.
. . . then there's the rest of the story: http://www.billionbibles.org/sharia/sharia-law.html  (c)According to Sharia law: • "A man can unilaterally divorce his wife; a woman needs her husband's consent to divorce. • A divorced wife loses custody of all children over 6 years of age or when they exceed it. • Testimonies of four male witnesses are required to prove rape against a woman. • A woman who has been raped cannot testify in court against her rapist(s) • A woman's testimony in court, allowed in property cases, carries ½ the weight of a man's. • A female heir inherits half of what a male heir inherits (see Errors in Quran) • A woman cannot drive a car, as it leads to fitnah (upheaval) • A woman cannot speak alone to a man who is not her husband or relative. • Meat to eat must come from animals that have been sacrificed to Allah - i.e., be "Halal". • Muslims should engage in Taqiyya and lie to non-Muslims to advance Islam."  So, as you can see -- Sharia Law is primitive & illegal..
"You must agree that if a motion denouncing islamophobia passed unanimously in Oct 2016, that another motion was not needed."  After a mass murder of Muslims was just committed, no rational person would agree with you.  "Hit the brake again!" "I already hit it." "It wasn't enough. We're going to crash!" "Not necessary. I'm sure you'll agree that.."
I'm appalled you would express such hateful comments about the Indigenous community.  Not to mention our Muslim friends...which, your comment could be construed as Islamophobia.  Careful...
Sigh--the Muslim brotherhood, amongst others,  have  contributed to the murdering of words, the meaning of words , the politicization of words, and the gullible non believers are going along ....is there an equivalent Christianityphobia ? Budhismphobia? Taoismphobia?  How is it possible to have an overwhelming and irrational fear of one belief system and not of another?  A phobia is a phobia and nothing but a phobia.  Hatred of a follower of a particular belief system is another thing altogether.  Hatred in Greek is Miseo and Miseo is Miseo.  There is a difference between hatred towards a belief system and hatred towards followers of a belief system.  The first could  be called miseoislam  and hatred towards Muslims would be miseomuslim.  Pass laws against hatred directed towards the followers of belief systems in general  if you have to, but to pass laws against hatred directed towards belief systems themselves is non compos mentis.
This post is islamophobic
Mostly by other Muslims.
Oh okay.  So as long as dudes shoot each other, but not due to radical Islam, you approve and nothing should be done about it.  You are neat!
Offer prayers?    No, CLOSE YOUR BORDERS to anyone from a radicalized country, and throw out anyone who is radicalized.   And take the danger seriously, before it's too late.  What cheek.  The same people who scolded us when we warned them about Islamic terrorism now "offer prayers."     Well, your prayers won't bring the dead back to life.
The refusal to support one specific group to the exclusion of others does not indicate anti muslim sentiment.  Rather,it indicates that Canadians are against racism against all groups.
First let me say thank you for your service. Military service is a noble sacrifice and the free world has many enemies abroad.  Glad u dont think less of people of other races but Trump clealy does. Heres a few clear examples: (1) He thinks Judge Curiel - born in Indiana - is incapable of objectivity because his parents were born in Mexico (2) Trump said a black casino employee was lazy cuz "laziness is a trait in blacks" (3) when 2 men in Boston were arrested for urinating in a Latino mans face and beating him with a pole they said “Trump was right-all these illegals need to be deported,” and instead of condemning their assault Trump praised them as "passionate" supporters and (4) he said he would "legally obligate" all muslims to register with a nat'l database that tracks them.  As far as vets, Trump doesnt like McCain cuz he was captured and he thinks the military is weak.  He also said he wont let any Muslims own guns, a pretty clear 2nd Amendment infringement.
>" BuzzFeed Canada spoke to 11 Muslim Canadians about the “Canadian values” debate going on in the Conservative leadership race. “I’m afraid that in their attempt to set strict parameters, politicians will really end up othering large groups of people and alienating citizens who don’t fit a rigid ideal of what the average white Canadian thinks everyone should be like,” Huda Sadoon said."  Who'da thought it?  A muslim racist.
DON'T DO IT GARNEAU.   The American-Anglo empire have declared war on Middle East Muslims for 25 years. Bombed the hell out of them. Make sure their world is in constant turmoil. Make sure they do not rise up to challenge Christianity. Canada have participated in these missions but only partially, under certain principles and restrictions. That's because Canada is not vassal of American-Anglo empire of conquest. We have relations with them only to serve our interests. We DO NOT conquer other people's lands, civilization, or their religions.   But you don't grind up an ancient civilization without blowback, retaliations. The American-Anglo blowback just keep getting bigger, no sign of ending. They keep putting up higher security walls, to the point of insanity. But they keep the bombing.   DO NOT join in their insanity. Keep our cautions but maintain good relations with the world's civilizations.   There is no need to ban electronics from anywhere. Check them carefully, but NO BAN.
Enough with the lies!  The coverings are not and have never been a religious requirement in islam!  Show everyone where in the koran it says this.
READES: Alaska is known to be a diversified State. Meaning Cultural Diversity, Equality and each Individual's beliefs to support a religion or not is our own constitutional civil right as a Citizen. Americans use adultery with laws protecting it - and Muslims use Sharia that does prescribe harsh punishments for acts like adultery. "You shall not commit adultery" is one of the Ten Commandment yet most churches usually excuse that sin with forgiveness. Now, the Jew I know doesn't eat pig meat, bread, and has Saturday Sabbath. Yes, all these traveling immigrants are still coming to America and about the First People, we've always been here.
You think you care more about all Americans than I and other "false face libbers"? Considering Trump's mocking denigration of war veterans, women in general, persons with disabilities, Mexicans, Muslims, and "losers", You must think "care" is "you're fired!". I haven't seen a single action from the Big Cheeseball that comes within a mile of "responsibility", unless you think that alienating our allies, our trading partners, our neighbor nations, and frightening the whole world with reckless bullying, is in some strange way "responsibility".  Now he has nominated a justice who believes the federal government has the final say in what you can do with your own body without legal penalty.  And once again, "the media" aren't unitary, aren't monolithic, don't conspire among themselves; they hold widely diverse views on every subject; yet you still insist that "the media" are a unitary, single minded entity. That's true in Russia, a totalitarian dictatorship. Not here.
National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) is the same group that had input on the TDSB's decision to included criticism of the politics and culture of Islam in the definition of "Islamaphobia" so the position taken by the author is hardly surprising, the NCCM at a minimum shows deference to ideas of political Islamism (the idea of society governed by Islamic law). There is a reason that Ataturk implemented strict rules of secularism in the founding of modern Turkey, because Islamists are never satisfied until they have absolute control. Turkey was an exception among majority Muslim countries as a beacon of secular progress for over 90 years, it has taken one Islamist government under 10 years to regress Turkey into an effective Dictatorship - no free press, hostility to liberal (western) values of gender equality and LGBT right, and unapologetic support for conservative fundamentalists. The Globe is inexcusable silent on the social regression synonymous with political Islamism.
Perhaps you should educate yourself a little bit. The Rohingya muslims have had "freedom fighters" in Myanmar for several years who are terrorists in that country just like they are in the rest of the world and are trying to turn Myanmar into another muslim caliphate. The Buddhists in Myanmar have had enough of terrorist acts and decided to have a mass expulsion of the  Rohingya and take back their country.
Multiculturalism or Religion?  Barbaric face-covering niqab/burqa, neither Koranic, nor Mohammedan, is not allowed during Hajj. Widely accepted graceful head-covering hijab is. Niqab has no place among civilized. Spooky, gives me the creeps.   Challenge you to find one among us 40,000,000 Syeds (Mohammed's progeny, ½ of them women) who dons a niqab.  Mohammed liberated women, gave them non-negotiable rights under Koranic Sharia. After him the Kaliphate counter revolution restored pre-Mohammedan barbarism. Within 70 days the Kaliph murdered Women's champion, Fatima, Mohammed's daughter. Gone were rights to property, to education, to choose mate and for how long, to freedom. Women now shackled, sent back to kitchens made Islam one-legged, and the lame win no races.  Niqab, a Kaliphate means to suppress women, is practiced only in Saudi Arabia. Ironically, it was later used in the Ottoman Kaliphate to save their more beautiful Turkish women from been ogled at by their Arab subjects, LOL.
This is appalling and is totally contrary to our Charter of Rights and Freedoms!    "...Quebec City Muslims say their community deserves the same rights as all other religious groups, which have their own sectarian burial grounds."  Absolutely! Did the First Nations get to have referenda on whether churches and cemeteries were built on treaty lands? Would anybody deny building a synagogue these days? And what is a referendum for 50-odd people going to decide anyway?  Just more xenophobic twaddle.
Ask any muslim, including the long and well established in Canada, what would they do to their daughters, if they were to decide to marry a christian boyfriend. That should clear your thoughts.
Bill Ayers is not a Muslim....
Why doesn't the Globe do a story about people who leave Islam and  convert  to other religions and the  death threats and murders they face?
ANDREW COHEN Trudeau's friendship with the Aga Khan should be celebrated, not hidden. There you are folks, for years a certain segment of society has been denying Islam will be one day, part of the Canadian political  system. Only in Europe, they insisted, never in Canada. Finally we've got the same left, Islamic apologists, coming out of the woods, Islam has nothing to do with terrorism they say. Slowly but surely the media will introduce us to the New World Order.  Canadians beware!
Don't worry- the peace-loving Muslims will be out in force today denouncing this attack.  RIGHT?
By the time boys become young men it is already too late. Their attitudes to society and particularly towards girls and women are shaped throughout elementary school and later in high school. A British headmistress in Trevor Phillips documentary "What British Muslims really think", which first premiered on channel 4 in Britain and now is on YouTube, describes experiences in her mostly Muslim high school. One student challenged her on not covering her hair. "Only skanks don't cover their hair" was his comment.  I disagree with the learned professor that the answer to this problem lies in more religion. I prefer Trevor Phillips conclusion, which is that schools should be more integrated, allowing children to mix with and understand each other better. He suggests that no one school should have more than 50% Muslims, which seems achievable since the Muslim population in Britain is around 7%.  He also has other sensible proposals regarding supervision of the Sharia system in Britain.
The United Nations in conjunction with governments around the globe, one is US State Dept. decides how many UN identified refugees from which countries will be allocated for relocation to the US. The State Dept. then contacts Non-Governmental Agencies (NGO's) like USCCB across the US for a distribution of that UN/State Dept. determined number. Some, of those NGO's are faith based some are not. The Refugee must pass through The UN/Fed establish resettlement guidelines to receive this aid.   UN to State Department to USCCB Office of Migration & Refugee Services to Catholic Charities USA. Other NGO's have their own interface with the State Department. Religious proselytizing by NGOs is not allowed.   The distraction to this complete cut off of ALL refugees was the EO on the Muslim/travel Ban.Everyone got caught up in that -- as was the intent. In the meantime, a national shut down of ALL refugees from any where went completely unnoticed, and unchallenged. No more bright light on a hill
Brought to you by the Wing Nut, Gun Loving, Pizza Gate, Nazi Loving, Muslim Hating Right. You should fully embrace this guy, since it appears he has crossed over to the dark side. He has passed the nut test and may now register as a Republican and NRA member.
The "written" travel ban is NOT a Muslim ban.  If the court wants to know, they should read it.  You should try reading what I said AGAIN and think before commenting
"A new breed of Republicans has taken over the GOP. It is a new breed which is seeking to sell to Americans a doctrine which is as old as mankind - the doctrine of racial division, the doctrine of racial prejudice, the doctrine of white supremacy". Jackie Robinson What I see today, the prejudice I see of the Muslim, The Need to say "Black Lives Matter", and think, how long ago did Jackie Robinson say this and it is true today.  What I read today, the need to rename a building, the letters to the editor, and all this happening now. Jackie was right.
Islamaphobia? islamaphobia?what about Chritianaphobia?Hinduphobia?Jewsphobia?Bhudistsphobia?Sikhsphobia? Its a very well known fact that muslims do Mock & Prosecute all non muslim religions and non-muslims communities all around the world.Many people including our Politicians are ignorant about this islamic Fanatics . All religions and commutes should be protected by the Bill #m103 (which is to be passed in the Canadian Parliament Today) not only one particular community and religion. Patriotics Of Canada please Help to stop this Catastrophe now before its too late . Help us.
"Religious leaders shocked by attack on Ramadan and Pentecost"  They should not be. It only shows how little they know about the contributing factors of these murderous attacks.   Western people are on average, extremely naive. No, hate and eye for an eye approach is certainly not the answer. Better knowledge of the real issues behind these events, however, would certainly help. But any open, public honest and realistic discussion on these issues is bay and large forbidden. It will be labelled as anti-Muslim. Yes, the stupefying political correctness strikes again. It is really tiring ...
if the democrats want to win they need to  1) Stop being pro-illegal immigration and start promoting legal immigration instead. Get tough on illegal immigrants who murder people. Instead of finding excuses or justifications. Promote legal immigration and stop encouraging or excusing illegal immigration.  2) Stop with the social justice warrior nonsense. This is just becoming attacks on free speech and killing the exchange of reasonable ideas that promote a country to grow intellectually.  3) Related to #2... but stop searching for things to be offended by  4) Stop hating/disrespecting the military. Even Obama warned his side of the spectrum to stop doing this in one of his final interviews.  5) ISIS/Al-Qaeda and Boko Harem are NOT your misunderstood friends. And everybody knows that All Muslims are not terrorists. But be realistic about the threat. and make this CLEAR to the public you feel this way  If they did this... then the Republicans would have nothing to stand on and would lose
I read an interview with a co worker from New Brunswick(where he worked in a hotel booking call center) who said that even then, he had a prayer rug at work and took regular  breaks for muslim prayers.  (Sorry, can't remember where I read that this morning)
He's long gone. What matters is what Muslims today say and do, and the vast majority are not terrorists.
Muslims need to assimilate into Canadian  culture.  This isn't helping.
I am sorry, but by insisting on a special law for Muslims, you are jumping on the 'Black Lives Matter' bandwagon, asking for special treatment. .  There is no need for special treatment, the current laws making racist behaviour/remarks unlawful serves all.
Its interesting that the very first thing you think about me is to call me prejudice.  I read her book because I wanted to understand what is happening within Islam to justify world  wide terrorism.  I think Ayaan Hirsi Ali explains it very well and gives an additional voice to organizations such as CAIR  and The National Council of Canadian Muslims.  I also read the Quran, because I really do want to understand Islam.    And as to the solution to the issue, which you just admitted there is one, it never hurts to try does it?   Sher-e-Hindustan, have you read her book, if not then do.   Its amazing how many people are so critical of her, yet have never read her book.   She really does want the best for Islam and she's risking her life  by stating her beliefs.   Ayaan Hirsi Ali currently has a fatwa of death placed on her head.    Talk about grit, that you have to admire.
The list of mistakes made in the Middle East is very long.     Let's face it, in our lifetime, the concerns for Middle Eastern foundational structures (church, state, family, education), has always been secondary to our national interest in oil.   Money bought political power in both regions, and it destroyed much hope for anything but elitist authoritarian regimes(fed by Western money).  It should be no surprise that the hypocrisy of past policy is seen clearly by those who live in these nations.   While we bleat about which party was most responsible, they both fell in line with our Economic Interest, not the welfare of those that lived an average life scraping out their daily bread.     Obama's mistake might have been in believing his real concern for the Muslim people would overcome his image as an American President that brings wealth to the few and death to many.   It's the false hope of those with good intentions to believe that 'nice' always wins.
....I support your decision not to travel to your work related commitments in Arizona and put your money where your mouth is. Good on you !! As a fellow Canadian I remain in shock and awe with the Trump Administration's heavy  handedness towards minorities, especially people of Muslim faith...... unacceptable !
Ruben you said < I can read from the suit a rally >  What suit what rally? / What does this have to do with Trump banning all Muslims?
If there is a ban on these devices as hand luggage, it should be a world-wide flight ban, rather than a departure location specific ban. If Homeland Security is willing to face the wrath of Americans, we might give credence to these seemingly extra-ordinary security measures as being necessary.   Terrorism is a global phenomenon; not a "Muslim departure location" specific one e.g. the attacks on Parliament and on soldiers in Quebec were done by "radicalized Canadians" inside Canada not by foreigners from outside Canada. Even the Air India bombing over 30 years ago had the device planted in Canada as the result of "radicalized" Canadian residents.  That being said, I am not sure I take much comfort from travelling with potentially unstable lithium batteries in the hold.
Since you invited dissent, Tom, I'm happy to provide some.   Lots of liberals didn't like many of Obama's policies - because by and large he was fairly conservative. I don't know a single liberal who approves of ISIS.  I also don't know a single Muslim who approves of it (and I know a lot of Muslims). I think fact checkers have conclusively shown that Clinton has been more truthful in her public comments than Trump is. The ACA is far from perfect - most liberals are more in favor of public option single payer - but then it was originally drafted by the heritage foundation. I don't think you are the most hateful person in the U.S. - there are probably millions of Trump supporters more hateful than you. I agree with you completely about the country being too polarized.  It's a shame.
Canada needs more muslims!
BTW, last December a talk-how host (CJAD, anglo) invited non-Christians to call in to say how they felt about Xmas, expecting a ot of complaints about feeling like outsiders, etc. It didn't happen, he was inundated with Sikhs, Hindus, Jews telling him they loved Xmas, had a Xmas tree, etc., no matter how much he tried to suggest the reverse...  It is really only a tiny subset of the monotheistic religions that considers it forbidden, a betrayal of their religion to celebrate other religions' holidays. Those people have every right not to do so, but they should stop trying to prevent everyone else from enjoying it.  I celebrated Eid with a family of Muslim friends, and Holi when I was in India, it didn't turn me Muslim or Hindu. Many Muslims from countries that once were moderate and peaceful, nostalgically tell of Muslims and Christians celebrating each others' holidays.
My, what a cleverly SUBTLE example of Muslim-bashing!  I don't think I've been subjected to such a devastatingly articulate rejoinder since...possibly the 7th grade.  I-I-I think I might just cry...
Trump invokes God like his presidency was  pre-ordained. I imagine he gets up each morning and, before he tweets, asks himself  "WWJDT" (What Would Jesus Do Today) So he says to himself.  How about driving out the money changers - well they were kind of like Mexicans so I'll do that. How about love thy neighbour - great as long as they aren't Muslim cause they aren't neighbourly. And what if I come across a woman being stoned for adultery - well I could cast the first stone since I haven't sinned or I could just grab her by ........
I don't think I do.  I wake up every morning get my kids to school and go to work.  Try to enjoy the weekends.   I am however happy we haven't lived the past 7.5 years under McCain and our dearest Sarah P.  I'm pretty sure mass murders would still be going on, just like they've always been.  The only take away from the most recent event is that someone on the terror watch list was allowed to walk into a store, buy an assault rifle with a whole truck load of ammo and unload.  An American citizen I might add.  Banning Muslims wouldn't have prevented that.  On that topic.  How do you test for radical Muslims?  Is that some sort of pee in the cup sort of thing?  Or do you just single out people with darker skin with names like Mohammad and Ali.   Hard to take you serious when your grammar and punctuation would be disappointing in my 6th grader.
So who is this guy who's offering the money?  The Canadian Press described him as "a self-proclaimed online journalist who regularly posts accolades to the superiority of white people, along with diatribes against immigration in general and Muslims in particular."  He posted an absolutely vile online video chuckling over prospects that someone might assassinate MP Iqra Khalid.  And now the Globe is giving him free publicity.
I don't understand why the opinions of the "anti-Trump media" are important here.    I was asking if Trump said his promise of a Muslim ban had "expired".  My point was that, when asked directly about this, Trump replied that his plans for a Muslim ban and Muslim registry had been "right all along."  He didn't say "Those plans have expired, I've decided to pivot to something else."  Can you explain your point?
"Limitless numbers of immigrants" nice use of reactionary buzzwords. Can we not discussing this rationally? And you do know that Muslims have been in Canada since Confederation so labelling them all as the migrants is simply willfull ignorance and a gross generalization.   You still haven't pointed out any actual affect this is having on Christian heritage.
It is very obvious that Trump's focus on a "Muslim Ban" has blinded him with regard to almost everything else, such that he now can't focus on anything.  Seems to me that the courts standing up to Trump have given the legislators and other institutions the spine they need to stand up to him on other issues.  For example the Health Care legislation is known to be dead on arrival in the Senate.
I believe there are no Muslims in that municipality.  So why should it have a Muslim cemetery?
This woman fails to address many of the concerns that outsiders have about these events, such as:  1) I note that she speaks only about a son.  Does she have a daughter?  Is she OK that girls are not allowed to participate equally in these school sponsored events?  What about trans-gendered or gay students?    2) It states: "The supervising teacher has to read through each sermon before it can be delivered, and my son assures me there is nothing “overly political or extreme.”".  Well that's nice.  Who is supervising the teacher on this?  (It could be that they are the biggest instigators of controversial rhetoric.)  And does not overtly political or extreme mean that it is somewhat political or extreme?  Is the teacher present to ensure what was prepared is the same sermon that is being delivered?  Would her son admit it if there was nasty rhetoric being preached?  Would all of the various factions within Islam agree to this particular sermon?  Too many unanswered questions for me.
Here's the thing, Scotty, if the United States spent one-tenth as much on tackling the above- mentioned problems as they do on their military (as much as the next 15 nations combined), or on walls, they could greatly reduce the deaths from these causes. Trump does not need to make medical breakthroughs. He needs to focus on real problems. Terrorism is way down the list.  As for France, where I spend a lot of time, you'll notice that they didn't ban people from the countries that Trump did. Maybe they are just braver than right-wing Americans? And despite the few recent attacks, where 234 people were killed, it is a small fraction of deaths from other causes such as traffic accidents, or even suicides. And that's despite the fact that France has six million Muslims in its population.  Brave up.
Really good point: it is actually the self-censorship (something covered very well by Noam Chomski in his Manufacturing Consent) that is the thing that shuts down debate and discussion. The Globe will just not cover anything involving Muslims because it will be too much of a headache. I know in my own work we avoid like the plague any discussion because it has no good outcome.
“then a fear of Islam i.e. 'Islamophobia' could rightly be called irrational”  Oh really, why don’t you try that one in Molenbeek or Mosul you sad !slamapolist?
Yes, that Saudi Arabia.  That's the country that Le Pen's policies mirror.  I didn't say that all Le Pen's supporters are [your term].  You did.  Making all-inclusive statements about people of any ideology or religion is just plain stupid.  It appears at this point that the person most French citizens are trusting to deal with the terrorist problem is Emmanuel Macron, not Marine Le Pen.  And the method does not include dehumanizing all muslims.  I realize you don't want to recognize that reality.  And by the way, 'no-go zones' do not exist, as even Fox News was forced to admit.  Another reality you don't want to recognize.
Erdogan is an unapologetic Islamist who holds a contempt for Turkey's secular constitution established by Ataturk. No free press, no freedom of association, no freedom of expression, hostility to gender equality... it has taken Erdogan under 8 years to reverse 70 years of progress in Turkey, highlighting the fundamental incompatibility of Islamism with liberal secularism. Once Islamists get a taste of power, any notion of moderation is thrown out the window in favour of absolute control over all levels of society. Watching Erdogan consolidate power was like watching a horrible car crash in slow motion,  he removed restrictions on public head-coverings, supported the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, re-started the civil war with the Kurds, built a Sultan's palace, supported Islamists in Syria, destroyed judicial independence, purged civil institutions, took over all independent media and finally he will amend the constitution for total control. Turkey looks like Iran circa 1979, pity.
Rational?? The attackers were deranged and  were reported by the muslim community to law enforcement agencies on two separate occasions! What does that tell you about the effectiveness of the intelligence agencies? Don't bring religion into this..
The original situation about a prayer room in a high school was a matter of truancy: every Friday the   Muslim students went off to noon prayers at the local mosque, 2 blocks away, but wouldn't return to school. The school made necessary accommodations by adjusting the schedules to fit their prayer times,  But it just wasn't enough for Muslims.  What should have been a matter of parental discipline became an uproar over religious persecution.
There was also an Islamist suicide attack in Mogadishu a few days ago, and today a suicide attack in Pakistan that is reported to have killed at least 40.
Of course!  The prior admin didn't feel that our enemies should be stopped.  He made gestures at appearing to defend our country, but by and large, his policies regarding the security of our nation were weak.  Our former president felt that the US should be taken down a notch or two.  His wife even alluded to that same sentiment in a speech.  Their pastor even preached that our chickens were coming home to roost.  As if the US was responsible for attracting the blowing up of buildings, runners, etc., or aircraft.  Why in Mr Obama's mind he felt that lowering the seas and sowing dissension amongst our citizens had priority over the security of our borders, our language and our culture.  Head scratchers.  Not ukus tho.  Maybe it was coaching from Ayers and Dorne.  maybe it was all the discussions w/ Muslim Brotherhood in the WH, who knows.
I don't mind Doug Ford being on the front page at all, but I have a question.  If he supports his Muslim brother, and stands against immigration screening based on personal values (we do screen immigrants extensively, a fact which the alt-right conveniently ignore), then why is he supporting Kelly Leitch?
and did any of these Sunni put up a fight for the genocide against the Christians and the Yezidis? Why are there no Jewish groups there? Has any one read about the genocide against the Armenians Christians by the Muslim Turks in the first world war, where Christian women were striped and had gas poured on them, forced to dance naked and lit in the streets, or 6-7 year old Christian girls raped on Christian Church alters by Muslim men. ( look it up) Why have pity on these people? Their religion is not a religion of peace.  Remember that Syria, Egypt, Iraq and Turkey were once peaceful Christian countries before they were overrun by Muslims
The only way to find a way out of this mess is to have a fact finding mission to several Muslim countries to see how they solved the integration problem with minorities. Have T.V. crews and live coverage of the investigation. Seems like the Liberal governments here are encouraging non integration at every turn as we didn't have this problem here a couple of years ago.
They only know and understand one principle, POWER and some of these ISLAMO's have no fear of their Lives giving it all up for Allah. Islam is a BAD Religion, your allowed to do watever, lie/deceit for the spreading of Islam. There's no Red Line for the True Islamist believer, Remember their saying, All non-believers are InFidels!  Please I'd like to HEAR/READ of ONE Islamist/Muslim denounce the saying: All non-believers are Infidels. Let me hear/read of 1 Islamist/Musim denounce lying/deceiving to spread the word of Islam?
Ahh yes, high fashion.  Can't wait to see the fashion runway shows, where modestly dressed Muslim women parade these masterpieces in public, while their husbands walk only a few strides ahead, scanning intensely for any infidels who may be experiencing below the waist stirrings as they gaze at these oh-so-chic-and-sexy dark ages retro fashions..
"That's just the way things roll"?    That's no reasoned justification at all.  Truth be told, I have a lot of respect for Middle Easterners, except to the extent that certain extremist Muslims support terror and the subjugation of women.  YOU could have written that sentence.   So the question really is whether it's rational to ban the entry of Muslims into this country until they are "super-vetted."  I say it's rational, and therefore not impermissibly discriminatory; you say it's discriminatory, and therefore irrational. Note the differences between our approaches.  I decide whether it's irrational first, and then decide whether it's impermissibly discriminatory.  You do the reverse.  No offense, but you think backwards.  The first question is whether it's rational to "super-vet" Muslims.  I say "Yes. because the most of the time Muslims are prominently in the news, it's because one of them has beheaded a bunch of Christians in the name of Islam, which the Quran supports.    cont'
Another publication mentioned that the "suspect" ranted and raved on Social media about being sick and tired about his Muslim brothers being killed and tortured------------------so rather than do something about it in his own community e.g.  trying to help or teach young men and women not to be radicalized by ISIS (that is killing many of his Muslim brothers) he decided to kill and injure those innocent young men and women at school
Yes, regardless of your apparent fatwa envy, YES, the Muslim should, by law, be denied the "right" to discriminate, just like a Christian, a Scientologist, or anyone else.    A business doesn't have religious convictions, and since he was acting as that business that must serve the public, what he did was against the law. Pretty simple.
The populist movement is here to stay, and it is a direct result of what David Horowitz characterizes as "The Unholy Alliance" between radical islam and the left, in his book by the same title.   What has given the Wilders and Le Pen's of this world a chance, is the same climate surrounding Serbia in the 90's. They witnessed firsthand, the destruction that a concentrated radical islamic populace could cause. Unfortunately for them, Soros money and the MSM conspired to frame a civil war as a one sided "ethnic cleansing" campaign. This won the hearts and mind of ignorant western civilians, and resulted in a disgusting bombing campaign.  The Serbs endured three decades of hatred, and the theft of their Jerusalem (Kosovo) based on their response to actions we see today: angry Muslims mass sexually assaulting women, destroying property, and abusing the system across the EU (Malmo Sweden, Rotterdam Holland, and Cologne Germany to name a few). Let's see how these nations deal.
" like with racism actual events taking place are leading indicators."  How about this actual event? The Democrats (who you constantly deride as the same as the KKK) elected and reelected the nation's first black president. Meanwhile the Conservatives and their echo chamber spent years trying undermine the legitimacy of the president by suggesting he was Muslim or born in Kenya or that he was racist against whites.   A reasonable person would think those "actual events" trump a few emails or problems encountered when trying to bring relief to some of the poorest people on the planet.
I don't understand how the Public school system can allow open Prayers by Muslim groups, while at the same time, persistently remove any notion/mentioning/symbol of Christianity. And to make it worse, Radicals Muslims  openly condemn Christians as Infidels/unworthy people. If Muslims have to be accommodated in Public schools, then all other religions should be. Which would make our Public system non-secular after all.
The town folk  just want to be left alone. They dont want big changes to their community. Islam means "submission" and Muslims " those who submit to Allah" will now work / to make the people of St. Apollinaire submit too.. They have all eternity to get their way.
If we were Iranian, or Iraqi, we might be using the same dialogue to blame the Western Powers for their murderous devotion to murdering our people and stealing our oil, all the while dominating our political system with hidden murders. Who pointed their weapons first and fired, the US or ISIS? Who radicalized Iraq, but George W. Bush and his Shock and Awe campaign?  Easy to demonize a stone age culture and religious perspective, but I just don't remember their drones hovering over our cities blowing up our civilians. And yes, the miserable murderer who killed 49 wonderful people had, from an early age, focused on the emotional pain and despair that was his lot in life. But then, that is so American, not just so Islam. We create our murderers, our nightmares. Religion has little to do with it, seeing as how religion is just another word for tribalism. Hugh Massengill, Eugene
" his administration has twice tried to impose a travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries" AP Fudge If their being Muslim was the critical factor, as implied by the text, it would have been applied to other Muslim countries. Better wording might have been "his administration has twice tried to impose a travel ban on several countries for which it argued there was no effective method for screening terrorists"
Hatred for anyone for their religious beliefs has no place in Canadian society. That includes Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jews, Christians, and those who practice other faiths. Religious freedom is a cornerstone of societal freedoms and must be protected. So you are correct that Anti-Muslim hatred has no place in Canada. The difficulty occurs though when you isolate and elevate one particular faith for special treatment - which is of course a passive form of discrimination. Lets stick with equal rights for all and special privileges for none!
Why should it take DJT two attempts (so far) to condemn these hate groups by name?  This utter lack of self awareness coupled with poor communication skills (no press conferences since february - wonder why?) is why he loses in the legislature (healthcare ban failed, muslim ban failed, no tax reform, no border wall anywhere in sight).  Losing when the deck is stacked in your favor would explain why his casinos keep going bankrupt.
Jack Bauer fiscal responsibility.... that would be bullying both of his neighbouring countries to submit to America's trade deal..... don't worry about Canada. responsible immigration...... build a wall, ban only certain ethnic groups. equal rights..... but not for LGBQT citizens. races..... except Muslims and Mexicans and Haitians. religion..... ask Steve Bannon. Evil?
Dana Kropf: "Spout all the good rhetoric, but the real truth eventually comes out, doesn’t it?" Wow, this one comes from out of the blue.  Who knew there was prejudice towards Mennonites, of all people,  in Eugene? If so, it's the first I've heard  of it.    Is this something Dorcas Smucker, the popular  Mennonite columnist for the RG, has expressed concerns about? I wonder how  Kropf knew these people waiting for this plane were FROM Eugene  specifically and not just flying to it.  Bigoted people exist everywhere, and my guess is they would have been just as rude had the woman been Muslim or anyone else who looked "different." Myself, it always makes me feel good to see those Mennonites  with their  traditional  head covering and long dresses as these gentle folk  add to the diversity of our community.
"A few days earlier, Ms. Le Pen was in Beirut, where she refused to don the head scarf handed to her in advance of a scheduled meeting with Lebanon’s Grand Mufti, a Sunni Muslim spiritual leader" > Take note ladies....a true feminist.
'where it's clear that Hilary Clinton was using that label for a small minority of Trump supporters'  check the video, say on youtube: 'You could put half of Trump supporters in what I call the basket of deplorables [laughter ]... right? ... the racists, sexists, homophobic, xenophobic, islamophobic, you name it. and unfortunately there are people like that " -Hillary Clinton  'Half' isn't a 'small minority'  stop believing and spreading left-wing falsehoods
Skyof I hope you can see the problem in trying to use your approach. 9-11 was a response to attacks on Palestinians. The crews of the planes were  primarily Saudis whose leader was in Afghanistan or Pakistan.    The use of Allahu Akbar by the crews of the 9-11 planes certainly suggests Muslim. Yes I agree it is as close to purely religious as an experience can be.
For the first time in my life I fear that our government could go in that direction.  I'm starting to understand how American Muslims, blacks, and other minorities have been feeling for a long time.
So far, Justin has thumbed his nose at students, seniors, veterans, the military, the middle class, doctors, small business people, farmers, while at the same time embracing Muslims, illegals and Syrians. Despite this the polls continue to show him in leading position. The definition of insanity is clearly proven.
Where were all the melting snowflakes crying foul when Obama banned muslims in 2011 and 2012? Bush 6 times. Clinton 6 times. Reagan 5 times. et al
Interesting comment about 'folks telling other people what to do', BurtEarnest.  Just for perspective, remember that the owner of the land in question - a local funeral director - wanted to sell the land to the Islamic Cultural Centre.  The result of this referendum is other people in the area telling him he can't do that.
"I have no idea if girls are allowed to lead the muslim school prayers. If not, they should be able to. I'm glad we're both feminists together. I'm not in favour of women wearing burqas, either.  But - and this is the key to it - if a religion's members are willing to have it that way, they have that right."  Sorry, that's not good enough.  If a religion's members are willing to have it that way (girls not being afforded the same privileges as boys), then should the Canadian state financially support them?   Clearly not.  All the more reason not to allow the space.  Some sects of Islam remove a girl's clitoris at a young age.  And, their members are willing to have it that way.  Should Canadians pay for these operations through their health care system?  By your logic yes.  But obviously that would be wrong.
Aung San Suu Kyi will explain the situation of the Islamist insurgency in Rakhine to Trudeau and Rae but we wont get that news.
More lies from 45: Like he would never play golf as President..or I will never leave the White House as President too busy working  100 day plan to defeat ISIS  A great plan to repeal and replace Obamacare in 100 days that covers everybody Mexico will pay for the border wall...then Mexico will pay later...then I want Congress to fund my wall I don't know who David Duke is, until audio recording of him talking about David Duke  I saw Muslims celebrating the collapse of the towers in New Jersey on 9/11 Claims that his detectives had "evidence" on Obama Birther controversy that will "Blow the thing wide open" Nobody loves the bible more than I do, except he never goes to church and doesn't know how to say 2nd Corinthians. Kim Jung Un is a "Smart Tough Cookie" he also invited him to come to the White House Obama and Bush never called families of Fallen Soldiers He had met Putin during the Miss Universe Pageant, then I have never met Putin, to I don't know Putin
AG Chin I watched your whole video and I am very impressed about how commited you are  and how you are willing to fight for peoples constitutional rights.  If I were muslim I would feel so good that you are out there fighting for our rights.  You explained it so well.  Any questions that I had about why this had to be done have been answered.  Thank you so much.
Why?  Are you being serious or being sarcastic?  "Omar Mateen ... the awkward man in black caused wholesale death. Chuckling and declaring allegiance to the Islamic State". NY Times
It 's not a ban. It 's just a disapproval  by people who don't want a cemetery at their back yard, noise, traffic & commotion. And, that 's common sense from average Canadians. The left media and their supporters really twisted the truth and made it Canadians against Muslim communities who lately constantly demand changes to fit  their religious and cultural customs, and play their games perfectly with the federal Liberal & JT 's supports.
How many are Islamists?
People remember where they were when Apollo 11 landed on the moon, when they heard about John Lennon being murdered, and where they watched the WTC fall after an attack by Muslim terrorists.  So, I find it implausible that Ms. Monsef's mother "didn't remember" what country she had her daughter in. The woman lied to her children.   And even if you buy into the "she wanted to protect her children" narrative, she still lied, and that lie was repeated to immigration authorities.  If Canadians can be held accountable for the wrong-doings of their predecessors (Japanese internment, residential schools...) surely a person like Ms. Monsef can be held accountable for the actions of her parent.
I agree with the "slave" being an elastic word. Social mobility has to be taken into context. A Muslim friend told me the first person to call the Azaan in Islam was a slave (haven't confirmed that story).   Janissaries in the Ottoman Empire were an another example of slaves that became the ruling class. It is more complex than slaves being moved from Africa to the Americas, where they were segregated for centuries.  As for abolishing, why not give the maximum credit to Japan or China which didn't have slavery? Like we do to Scandinavia for social progress today?
Thanks @LesterP.   I doubt the White House intruder was @Ruben Reyes, who was busy commenting on CB while Trump's "friend" was being held by authorities.  In any event, I respect @Ruben Reyes' opinions, even when I disagree with them, as I do in this thread.  I see the EO as a step toward Trump's campaign promise of a Muslim ban, which I believe to be unconstitutional.
Seems to me there's a lot of "new-think" in this article & some of the comments. Accusing Trump of abusing the Constitution (after BO's 8 years of severely anti-Constitutional executive acts & pro-muslim, anti-American acts & words), Trump being a Facist, & all the epithetic phrases -- is a blatant attempt to besmirch president-elect Trump & block his Nationalistic goals. Hopefully most Americans will give Trump & his administration at least a modicum of the indulgence they demonstrated for BO.
M103 is supposedly just a motion/consultation/education process. Fine.   But I believe it will lead to laws that criminalize speech/writing even when it tells the truth.    Islamophobia is an invention of the Organization of Islamic Countries, and the naive and pampered West is getting fooled into not looking critically at an ideology, more than just a religion, that deserves a very critical look.
The "liberal media" may have given "Islam" and all religions a free pass but it always condemend terrorist acts committed by anyone in their opinion pieces. So why wouldn't they condemn whoever perpetrated the tragedy in Spain?
"It was suddenly clear to so many that the overheated rhetoric about Muslim immigrants..."  Oh yes, it suddenly came clear to government officials and intellectuals like Charles Taylor. But how can you fault them? It was a total bolt out of the blue. Never before, in all mankind's history, has overheated rhetoric coupled with marginalization of a minority caused any grief. And considering this was in Quebec, with its enviable history of religious tolerance towards minorities, who could have seen it coming?
"Because you simply don't get it. If it was you or yours you would be howling like a mad dog but because it was some Muslim kid you think its okay. Well its not."  No you clearly don't get it. ME & MINE do not enlist our battle ready teenage offspring to journey halfway around the world into a volatile war zone in order to SPECIFICALLY wage an insane holy crusade against Canadian men & women and our US allies. That my friend is called treason and at the very least should be punishable by deportation.
Muslims excoriate us about supposed Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, Christophbia, Europhobia, Americanophobia, democraceaophobia, iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal wars of extermination between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects are the cause of all the civil wars and bloody genocide going on across the Muslin world. Even ISIS , Taliban and Al Quada have no western equivalent. It is worse than anything expressed in the west, even by Trump
"It is extremely disappointing that the Prime Minister will not support Indigenous peoples, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, Christians and other faith groups who believe there is truth in their religion," he said on Facebook.  What a naked demagoguery by the leader of the Conservative Party!  How about those scientists, who belong to the above mentioned faith groups and contributed to the advancement of humankind? Are they also traitors of their faith-based communities?
Pakistan is not on the EO and neither is Russia or Chechnya where the Tsarnaev boys came from.  The thing is I think Bush after 9/11 and Obama did a good job of protecting us from malicious travelers.    You responded with a list of people with Muslim names who carried out despicable attacks in the US, as if this were proof that Bush and Obama hadn't done a good job of protecting us from malicious travelers.  But your list is fake news.  None of the people on your list were travelers.  Most were native born US citizens or legal residents. None of them would have been subject to the EO.  A list like yours is designed to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt about Muslims.  It runs counter to the principles that unite our great nation--we don't discriminate based on creed.  Please find some other way to support the EO.
Sending troops: " to Mali " ........  The deeper context to all such conflicts is that they are self inflicted - nobody is shipping in terrorists, child soldiers, weapons, money .... in a flying saucer from Alpha Centauri !  These conflict zones are a collective of vendettas: tribal, sectarian ( multitudes of Muslim and Christian factions ), overpopulation and diminishing resources / starvation, marginal ecosystems, petro cash kleptocracy, proxy wars, ...... dating back to Methusela ........   They are deep cultural and ecological based civil wars without any simple single factor solutions to peace. Naively sending a military force and expecting miracles of " peace keeping " and good governance is merely asking to be shot at by both sides - usually several - depending on the war lords du jour ......  If you do intervene be prepared to stay for generations.
JVys: "islamophobia is a term that was invented in the 1990's by the muslim brotherhood to shut down all criticism of islam!"  OED example: "1923 Jrnl. Theol. Stud. 25 101 Certain writers in particular are blamed for their ‘Islamophobia’."
There are plenty of North Americans who blame all Muslims for ISIS. One of them even became the President of the USA, and instituted a Muslim ban.
"It seems the rise of populous politics has instilled a false consensus that somehow verbal assault of Muslims is okay"  I think the person who verbally assaulted you was ignorant and has impulse control issues.  I disagree with your blanket statements. Trump gets elected in the US and within minutes I hear this "the whole world suddenly turned on muslims, it become acceptable to attack muslims, people feel justified in attacking muslims".  These idiots existed 1, 5, 10 years ago, it's not new. There was no consensus, 1 idiot and everyone else in the situation let him know he was in the wrong. How many people do you meet everyday who do not verbally assault anyone? There was and is no consensus that exists now. This supposed consensus has not just materialized (since it does not exist).   We are just more sensitive to idiots since we see one featured so prominently in the news. But society is and remains for the most part tolerant. And I believe becoming more so with each generation
While Greece got the ball rolling on the "Europe as we have known it is disappearing" issue, Merkel's acceptance of many thousands of so-called economic migrants (AKA Syrian refugees) is the straw that will break the camel's back.  It will also result in her defeat in the upcoming German elections.  As Canada is finding, what European countries have known for years, these particular refugees/economic migrants (mostly young able-bodied, self-entitled young men) of Islamic heritage do not easily integrate with western social values.  Rather than adapt, they demand the continuance of the social customs of their country of origin.  The result is an overwhelming burden on each country's social support infrastructure from healthcare to welfare et al much to the detriment of regular citizens needs which in turn leads to civil unrest.
Islamophobia is not racism for one, and actually a misnomer if anything.  You never hear about Christianophobia, or Buddismophobia, or Hebrewophobia?  Moreover, the more the government tries to restrict opinion and free-speech, which is termed "hate speech" the more the masses will push back.  Nationalism and populism is growing all over the planet as we watch the Muslim faith enter Western lands.  The Muslim faith is a religion of submission through violence,  due to the cultural Marxist agenda of Leftist governements and mainstream media, Canadians are being forced to pander to migrant people.
When a  mass murder is committed by anyone the deaths are the horrific results.  Trying to analysis a specific group as the one most likely involved requires full and complete information not simply pick one set of culprits. There have been 844 death in mass shooting in the US in the last 50 years https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/mass-shootings-in-america/    While the overall number of shooters is 132 there are several common factors of who apply to more than one shooter.  Muslims were involved involved with no more incidents that wackos killing abortion providers.  The need to prevent these killings is obvious.  Focusing on one group while sidestepping other common factors has proven to be fruitless as the shooting by non-Muslims far exceeds those committed by Muslims.  I want the system that looks at all the information and takes more than one factor into consideration.  Vetting Muslim refugees is but one step.  Lets not look at others potential common factors.
Lets bring more of them into our country so they can do this here. TIME TO WAKE UP PEOPLE and understand radical islam is evil! How many have to die before you liberals understand that???
Well if Justine actually ever says he puts Canada first Natives will be outraged,  Quebec would be upset. feminist would call it misogynist, Muslims would call it Islamophobic  and trans-people will say it smacks of a gender insult..
my censored comment from here: funny how comments, civil comments on mass migration or forced islam are deleted. This is a civil comment, leave it up haters: 'It does not matter what your excuse is, we do not want religion in public schools. Period. Adapt to our ways. or leave for a place that is more religious and thus suitable for you. The powers that be are being nice to you because they represent the aspirations of corporate christianity - Anglicism, Catholicism who have always sought more and more footprint into the public sphere. We will never accede to your demands. STOP IT! Stop forcing your religion on others by holding services and practices in public schools. Using the police is a sick and twisted policy that will only create more hatred against muslims. Stop doing it. Keep religion private, period. We won't roll over for religious fascism which is what your DEMANDS represent.'
First  of all it was a travel ban on countries that the Obama administration deemed high risks for bringing terrorists into their country not a "Muslim" ban.  Second of all.......I miss Harper as well.
It's imperative that all Canadians both Muslim and non-Muslim read this book concerning Islamic reform:  "Heretic  Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now by Ayaan Hirsi Ali"  Go to your local library and get it.   It's not a book about bigotry, its a book that dissects Islam explaining why its the way it is and how it must go through a reformation.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali makes a powerful case that a religious Reformation is the only way to end the terrorism, sectarian warfare, and repression of women and minorities that each year claim thousands of lives throughout the Muslim world. With bracing candor, the brilliant, charismatic, and uncompromising author of the bestselling Infidel and Nomad argues that it is foolish to insist, as our leaders habitually do, that the violent acts of Islamic extremists can be divorced from the religious doctrine that inspires them. Instead we must confront the fact that they are driven by a political ideology embedded in Islam itself.  Fed. MP's must read it.
Another naive post....  Chad has banned people from wearing the full-face veil, following two suicide bomb attacks. Chad's government accused Nigerian militant Islamist group Boko Haram of the bombings which killed more than 20 people.  Cameroon has banned the wearing of full-face Islamic veil, including the burka, in the Far North region, following two suicide bomb attacks.
Art-  Yes, this commenting system can be confusing.  I'm afraid I'm not sure I  get your point about 9-11.  I agree it was about retaliation, not "our freedoms", but it does not follow that "it says that the US can go anywhere with impunity".  Muslim terrorists are attacking, or joining ISIS,  not because the US "attacked Muslims", but because some Muslims interpret the world in those terms, although it makes no logical sense.  The M.E. is in the throes of internal religious conflicts, intervening in those conflicts may be a bd idea, but it isn't "attacking Muslims", it is attacking certain factions.
...(cont'd from above)...  ...(later issuing an executive order arbitrarily banning travellers to the US from 7 Muslim countries) and actively participated in the disenfranchisement of black voters in record numbers during the 2016 Presidential Election.   I could go on but it might begin to appear a bit repetitive!   In short, not only is Donald Trump a long-standing, devout racist…he's a bonafide BIGOT!
So you're saying all Muslims do? Really?
Through this decision...why is the Netherlands embracing Islam? Why are European leaders embracing Islam? Why are Canada's leaders embracing Islam?  Why does the media continually embrace Islam?  Why is no country, or elected leader,  standing up to the relentless flow of Islam into Western countries? Are we trying to destroy everything Christian?
More Awesome vetting:  Vice President Tareck El Aissami, a child of Syrian Muslim immigrants to Venezuela, reportedly spearheaded the passport scheme, with the illegal delivery of at least 10,000 Venezuelan passports to citizens of Syria, Iran, and other Middle East nations...PanAm Post  El Aissami is a known entity in the world of US intelligence. He is allegedly a part of Venezuela's state drug-trafficking network and has ties to Iran, Syria, and Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah.
And by the way, there is no "Palestinian" land, as there are no Palestinians - they are Jordanians and Egyptians, who were not welcomed in either country, huddled under an umbrella and named Palestinians by the terrorist Arafat, who cleverly realized that he'd get no traction for his cause of pushing every Jew into the sea in favour of "displaced" Arab Muslims that their home countries didn't want.
I wish the author had included in the story as to why Muslims can't be buried in non-denominational public cemeteries.
I didn't see Indonesia (which, I believe has the largest Muslim population of any country) on the ban list.  I also didn't see the word "Muslim."
Lucky Trudeau. Looks like his friend Trump is doing everything possible to make Trudeau look good. First it was Trump stimulus program which will no doubt extend into Canada and now a ban on high tech personnel from Muslim countries or TFWs as we call them in Canada .
François Jourdan, French islamologue; “...Islam is very frozen for many centuries and basically lack of freedom - today, it must be said clearly that we cannot build a society of one religion, Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist... or atheist.  This phase of human history is now overtaken by religious freedom and human rights. Secularism requires not the ban but the discretion of all religions in the public space as other citizens have the right to have another way of life.  This isn't the Koranic trend where Islam does not consider itself as other religions and must...DOMINATE !...” So, He said; “...Secularism requires not the BAN but the DISCREATION OF ALL RELIGION in the public space...as others Citizens have the right to have ANOTHER WAY OF LIFE”, oui ? Islam does not consider itself as OTHER religions and MUST... DOMINATE !... DOMINATE, don’t you get it Canadians ???...
I know many Muslims, Jews and others that dont celebrate.
Mark is doing his usual best in an attempt to guilt trip Canadians. Perhaps he should attempt to guilt trip the rich Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait etc to do more for their religious brethren. Why come to the filthy decadent infidel West?
Unfortunately, there is a need, without a common set of descriptions, then people will very much misinterpret what is being said.  In this case, the common usage of homophobic refers to basically anyone who either doesn't like, or somehow discriminates against gays.  Much as racist has become the go-to phrase for folks who dislike Muslims, though that one is a bit of a stretch, but it has become a common usage of the term.
What a BS article.  Frankly, public schools are places where religion was never supposed to be part of the combination.  Parents were tricked.  I dont believe for a minute that parents were informed with proper documentation when religion was introduced over the years in public schools.  It sounds like Margaret Wente thinks honour killings is ok, beheading is ok.  Margaret Wente, do you know that there were 32,000 terrorist attacks by muslims since 9/11 in the western world??  Over 200,000 people died and over 200,000 were gravely injured.  Islam is a heavy burden to carry for humanity.
We've elected a minority president twice. There are minorities of every kind in elective offices. There are minorities prospering in every profession under the sun. We are the only country on earth famous for being a melting pot of all the world's peoples.  It is you who should investigate what it's like being a minority in other countries. How is it for Christians in majority Muslim countries?  In many they can't even openly worship. How is it to be a poor gringo south of the border? How about a poor white in most African countries?  The rich ones all have to have their own private security service. There is no better place for any ethnic or religious minority than right here. This is where this topic has gotten too, propaganda-wise: people making assertions that everyone knows are just plain false but in our twisted PC culture they are given credence nonetheless.
I guess she should be in sackcloth and ashes?  Funny when Muslim women want to cover themselves out of modesty, bros like you get your manties in a twist. When a woman dresses with confidence, you alt-right twits ALSO get your manties bunched.  Know what? Worry about your own stained Harley shirts, and let women dress themselves.
Irrelevant.  The British killed Stern in 1942.  The rest DID go to trial for blowing up trains, police stations and carrying out mass murders and assassinations, and were convicted of terrorism in 1948.  They were PARDONED by the Israeli government, and Rabin was subsequently elected prime minister.  That's what happened, no matter how much you try to tiptoe around the inconvenient FACTS.  And I don't have to reinstate the mindset which brought about the holocaust.  You and your ilk have already succeeded at that, and are carrying it out against Muslims as we speak.  "Master race" and "chosen people" are different words for the same lie.
Do not forget that in the case of many immigrants in Europe it was a result of their own country having been colonialised by one or the other country - Pakistan was created, as an Islamic state, out of the partition of the UK's Indian Empire, at independence in August 1947  - As Morocco was a French colony, after their independence both the UK and France accepted for quite some time immigrants from the colony, thus a substantial muslim population was created in these countries.
Up until 9/11, I don't think most Americans even gave Muslims a second thought, I know I didn't.
Just curious, are the owners of the G&M Muslim or is the paper indebted to a Muslim organization?  A lot of pro Islam pieces in this paper lately.
"The Trump administration argued that the courts should not look beyond the text of the revised order, which doesn’t mention religion. It said that the countries were not chosen because they are predominantly Muslim but because they present terrorism risks."  https://www.conservativereview.com/articles/ramadan-begins-with-ambush-slaughter-of-egyptian-christians?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=052617crcontentemail&utm_campaign=newslettertraffic  I wonder which law degree producing schools teach that a judge should "look beyond the text" of a law to render a judgement.  Hmm...administrative state.
How Canada can respond to the carnage in Myanmar - How the Organization of the Islamic Conference can respond to the carnage in Myanmar 57 countries - The Christian West saved Bosnian and Kosovo Muslims from Christian Serbia and saved Syrian refugees - why is it always the West? - Charity begins at home
In the United States, the richest and most powerful supporters of the Democratic Party have been Jewish Americans. The Republicans are well aware that if they sway the support of the Jews, they can dominate the Democrats for generations. This is why they are very pro Israel.  Donald Trump is torn between different goals. He can support the hawkish Netanyahu government but that would further devastate America's relationship with the world's Muslim community. The moderates in the State department are trying to rein him in.  I've noticed that there has been a shift in the attitude to Israel and the Palestinians. Decades ago, the Palestinians were invisible to North Americans and nobody cared about them. Nowadays, most people agree that they exist and they deserve some form of fair treatment.
I reject the entire premise and everything that  this person has to say on a matter that she cannot make any objective assessments of. Is that not civil? She writes very inaccurate articles that should have been edited out before they make prime time where they don't belong because they are too subjective and full of conjecture that cannot meet the threshold of good journalism. I guess you have to give a voice to the enablers of Islamic incidents are far to numerous to censor. In fact, there are thousands of incidents that would have been warnings, but Khan is too busy excusing mass murder worldwide by railing against a drunken misfit that killed one person.
A person's faith in an integral part of their identity and attacking it produces a visceral reaction. Demonizing Islam only helps alienate ordinary Muslims, the very ones needed to combat Islamist extremism. Wittingly or not, the "Islam-is-evil" crowd is effectively ISIS's ideological accomplice, whose stated objective is to erase the "grey zone" that separates everyday Muslims from violent jihadis.   Depraved and dangerous, ISIS needs to be confronted. Not by agreeing with it (that Islam and democracy are incompatible or that ISIS is true to the Quran) but precisely the opposite.  Still, Wahhabism (that ISIS adheres to) may be followed by a small minority, but are undeniable part of it. So it is equally inaccurate to say this extremism has "nothing to do with Islam".    Revealingly, Saudi Arabia was the first visit Trump made during his presidency, signing a $100 billion arms deal with these relentless Wahhabi-exporters. Rant all he wants against terrorism, Trump is funding extremism.
All columns and reporting about such matter is always written from the Muslims' point of view. And a radial view at that. No moderate Muslim who wants to maintain a separation of religion and school is given credence.   And, all objections non Muslims are dismissed as simpleminded hate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeXVP7TlSxY  Muslim Feminism for real.
Excellent article.  I think we all know that Israel never really wanted peace. When you run an Occupation for decades, its been almost 50 years now....and bring in hundreds of thousands of Jewish "settlers" on expropriated land every year it's beyond conjecture what the end game really is. It is the expropriation of the lands in question for religious purposes.   I do not think that history will regard what Israel did as being moral or just nor what various elements of the Jewish diaspora has done to suppress debate or present disinformation or to deflect criticism by continually bringing up past transgressions against the Jewish people (as though acts of the past somehow gives you the right to commit immoral acts now in return ).  The other conclusion we can draw from this sorry and regretful situation is the role that the Jewish and Muslim religion has played in directing immoral behaviour. There can be no doubt that religion makes otherwise moral people commit immoral acts.
I don't have to show you anything. YOU need to qualify your wild conflation of Biblical teaching with the Taliban's following of Islamic Law, and I'm not interested in your misandrist goddess worship. You have man issues.  Hint: Old and New Covenant are two different things.  A few points of contention of a 21st century leftist isn't it. It would require a comparative study of scriptures - something you've never done.
The commenters posting here seemingly have little knowledge of Islam.   I estimate there are only about 5-10% of Muslims that I consider friendly.  The friendly include: 1. Kurds, who treat women as equals, include Jews in society and commerce, and field all-women infantry battalions.  I have read that when Daesh (ISIS)fighters see them coming, they flee and scatter. 2. Ismailis, the only group (eg. "denomination") with a leader, the Harvard-educated Aga Khan IV. 3. Ahmadi, of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.  A much loved Ahmadi Shopkeeper in Glasgow, who sent Easter Greetings to his customers, was Executed by a Sunni (or Shia) Muslim extremist. 4. Sufi, found in all Muslim societies, but in large groups in Turkey and Indonesia.  Jones is a Sufi.  An American Sufi leader visited about 200 U.S. Mosques and then testified to Congress that about 90% were advocating JIHAD, "peaceful", as in Germany and Sweden, the Rape Capitals of Europe, or violent, like the Saudi Sunni Salafis of 9/11.
What country is "my country" referring to?  And how did Canada become "your" country?  I didn't mind the Lord's prayer.  And it wasn't Muslims that asked that it not be recited in school, your beef is with your fellow "brother".    Many schools have other religious/prayer groups at school.  Heck, don't we have a publicly funded catholic schools system?    It's probably useless to have a rational discussion on here anyway.
Islamophobia- the fear of Islam perpetrated from the many terrorist activities associated with this religion and culture. That’s basically it.
Even though he is not in the WH any longer, there is no reason Trump can't pick up the phone and get advise and direction from him. I think Kelly is the right man to try and manage the president a bit more but I'm more troubled that McMaster is still around. He's a muslim Barry  man and that is nothing but bad news. Time will tell if this was a good move or not.
Yes, I agree totally, but  Christianity went through an enlightenment and reformation, while Islam hasn't.  Islam considers the Qur'an the absolute Word of God; Islam is a religion that is in dire need of both enlightenment and reformation.   Both have to be lead by moderate Muslims such as Imam Tawhidi,  Canadian Muslim Raheel Raza, along with Ayaan Hirsi Ali; you should support them in their efforts towards the peaceful reformation of Islam.
The 2nd Amendment was written when guns were muzzel loaders not when they fired 50 rounds/min. Americans want to give up their freedom for safety? Let them. Mexicans and muslims should stand back and let the poor white women and men fight for the freedom they seem to want. None of #45's kids or grandkids will be joining the military.
"burning down schools and denying them an education and basic human rights."  Why do you mention that rather than the Female Airforce Major flying combat missions against Isis, or the all female crew who fly Commercial aircraft? Do you not consider them educated Muslim women? How about the thousands of Muslim women getting an education in our universities.
Isn't it fantastic how the liberal progressives Will shout you down call you a racist misogynist deplorable if you say a word about somebody with dark skin who happens to be Muslim. But when they do it it's completely okay I guess when they make fun of a Muslim guy it's not racist or misogynist because their views are always correct and always proper because they're perfect and never do anything wrong so therefore they're never branded racist misogynist of deplorable they can say and do whatever they want because according to them they're doing the right thing which means you can go have a protest against Free Speech they have really lost their mind you are actually going to go anti protesting against free speech last time I checked that makes you communist. I'm an independent it just sounds so funny to me to hear people say I'm going to go protest at a freedom of speech rally. If somebody told me that that would happen even five years ago I would have laughed and said yeah right.
Yes true, they are like the great Octopus like the Rolling Stone Article says.  They didn't support him at all during the election.  As far as Mnuchin goes, I feel you need an insider in some capacity but no question there are some concerns.    I know Trump has businesses in SA and I feel that is in part a big reason why he hasn't banned people from SA because the hardcore Wahhabism comes from there.  It is tangled, I gather the US Pentagon sells enormous amounts of weapons to SA.  It really comes down to "the greater project for israel"  We will see where Trump really stands.  Obama and Bush were compliant to a T.  Cause massive unrest and war in the ME, Obama made the USAF essentially the Air Force of ISIS which is really a CIA/Mossad/Saudi op.  Push arabs out of their homelands, flood white Christian secular nations with Islamists while at the same time expand the land dramatically for Israel.  Also the more muslims the more likely jews will leave and return to Israel.  Its biblical
A gentle reminder that we're talking about visitors, not hating on Muslims.  Hasan was born in Arlington, VA.  He was a natural born US citizen.  Muhammad was born Carlos Leon Bledsoe in Tennessee.  He was a natural born US citizen.  Neither of them were traveling to the US.
Orally, one judge suggested the Administration could slow processing of Visas while updating the program for security. He questioned why the Visa Program evaluation report was not completed because it was already due under the first Executive Order.  In 2011, the Obama Administration updated the vetting for Iraqi refugees, slowing entry from 18,251 in 2010 to 6,339 in 2011.   Judge Watson's ruling that the Order is not discriminatory on its face, but is invalid due to implied intention has unintended consequences. Can the courts now halt drone attacks in the Mideast based on Trump's implied ill will towards Muslims?  Is Trump hostile towards Muslims? He said at the National Prayer meeting, "We have seen peace-loving Muslims brutalized, victimized, murdered, and oppressed by ISIS killers." He said his tour of the National Museum of African American History and Culture “was a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms.”
Of course these people marching in opposition to Sharia Law have a right to do so, but it appears to me that this is a thinly veiled attempt by these groups to express their hate and intolerance toward Muslims rather than an effort to defend the Constitution and the American court system.  And no, I don't support Sharia Law, but I do reject hate and intolerance.
Chilling article. I didn't think they would be creating a database on people and businesses and writers who question islam.
I guess AG Chin wanted to 'get it right' and contracted our $150K (of his discretionary funding) for those big-shot mainland lawyers.  Wonder while he's on the phone he can get some tips on our problems here at home that he and the rest of the Gov 's cabinet are having trouble with.  Small stuff compared to a temporary ban on (the tourists) of six Muslim countries...Hawaii's homeless (ignored), our state budget and failing economy (ignored), the cost of living (ignored), our failing hospitals (ignored), lack of available health care, (ignored), traffic (ignored), rail and the roads (ignored), HPD leadership (ignored), our state's education (ignored), the sad state of our schools and even the cost of education for our kids (all ignored).  Maybe that's the plan - to make us less attractive?
Once again, a great representative for the Islam faith. And a pretty typical one, too.
Trump doesn't need medical breakthroughs. Universal health care will save tens of thousands of lives every year. But since that involves spending tax dollars on health instead of weapons, the Republicans will veto that.  As for the number of dead, remember the Rwandan genocide? Led by Catholics Priests in many places. Srebrenica? Orchestrated by Serbian Christians. Chechnya? Led by Putin and co. The Rohingya? Buddhist monks are doing that.  I have lived in 4 Muslim countries, and understand their siege mentality. The problem is that they don't want to strengthen themselves through education and technology, and prefer to blame foreigners for their woes. Progressive ones like UAE and Qatar show the world that they can have world class cities and companies. So that is the model to be encouraged.
Really? Did you demand that Trump prove that Obama was a Kenyan Muslim?
Why are no feminist thought leaders agitating to educate men in Muslim majority countries not to beat their wives? So let's say this man didn't meet the Canadian values test and had to stay in his home country. His wife was still getting a beating -- no matter where they lived. Time to step up and shine a light on the real war on women.
"If the true concern with M-103 is that the term “Islamophobia” lacks clarity, the correct response is to call for a definition of that term. Here is one: the irrational fear of Muslims."   Totally WRONG. Unbelievable! Coming from a lawyer? It's about the SUPERSTITION (Islam) NOT the PEOPLE (Muslim). Don't the Liberals get it?   “phobia” means  an irrational or abnormal fear  That's why rational people don't use the discredited word islamophobia. It is RATIONAL to reject the superstition. It's perfectly RATIONAL to criticize and reject this superstition with its misogyny, gender separation, paternalistic culture, hatred of the other, imposition of irrational faith based ideas and fiction.
Com Cruise didn't say anything about Muslims - but you clearly think that there is a problem with Muslims. I am an immigrant, I had to change some attitudes and behaviours to adapt to Canada, all immigrants must in order to find peace here.
Modern terrorism was started in India/Pakistan in 1947 when centuries old hatreds between Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs caused mass murder, ethnic cleansing and genocide between Muslims traveling through Hindu lands to reach West Pakistan.
It is amazing how twisted the thought process gets when a writer is so determined to not blame Islam for the deadly actions done in its honour. You need a road map to get from A to B.
Muslim prayer times are not determined by the moon. Any assertion to such effect is not grounded on any facts at all.   Muslim prayer times are determined by the time of day. Dawn, early afternoon, later afternoon, post-sunset, and night-time.   In the workplace, there is zero disruption due to Muslim employees praying. We use our lunch or coffee breaks to go pray, and it doesn't disturb anyone else. We are using our own time (not company time) to pray. You use your own time to go smoke, or eat, or call a friend, or do whatever you like.
Omar KHadr bragged that killing Sgt Speer was the happiest day of his life.  TRudeau gave the millions to this convicted Muslim terrorist so that the widow couldn't get a penny.  71% of Canadians disagree with how this sneaky deal was made.  PL donate to www.speerkids.com for the education of the kids that this illegal combatant not "child soldier" made fatHerless.  The only child victims here are Taryn and Tanner.
If the middle east if the Islamic countries gave up their weapons there would be peace,  if Israel gave up there weapons they would no longer exist,  kind of makes you think about Trump's policies doesn't it.
You are confusing Grenada with Granada. Granada was conquered by Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492---the last Muslim kingdom in Spain to be  the be taken back in the Reconquista.  Grenada is an island in the Caribbean.
Unfair comment. Islam, and its 1.5 billion adherents, are NOT busy killing Christians this weekend. However, in an ironic twist, we Christians are also guilty of killing Muslims "The US has said it carried out an airstrike in Syria against an al-Qaida meeting but denied deliberately targeting a mosque where 46 people were reportedly killed." - 17 March. 2017, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/17/syria-mosque-airstrike-kills-dozens-of-civilians-near-aleppo
There is a good Daily Mirror piece about it, dated 24 May 2017, titled: 'He supports terrorism': Salman Abedi's Muslim peers warned cops about Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi 5 years ago -- The same article states that another of the terrorist's own parents reported him to the authorities.
In the early hours after the shootings, it was reported that two people had been detained, one with a muslim sounding name and the other with a non muslim name.  It is a fact that both of them were arrested, and this is what the media reported in the early chaos.  The media could not have known that after questioning one would later be released.  How could the media have known this?
Ishmail Elshikh and his mother-in-law is a false narrative! Mrs. Elshikh is a US citizen who has already petitioned for her mother.  Dr. Elshikh does not have any direct petitionable connection to his mother-in-law!  Dr. Elshikh chose to move his family to the US AND he chose to separate them from his wife's family. They decided his opportunities in the US outweighed any family relationships. They knew the choices. They cannot have both (or not yet!)  There are thousands of legal would-be immigrants that have waited their turn; some for a year, or 10 or even 20 years!  Eventually they get reunited. But there are several hundreds (maybe thousands) that never made it due to the death of a petitioner or the petitioned! How does one remedy this? How can they make things right for them?  Shame on Dr. Elshikh/AG Chin for trying to make this into a muslim ban. Shame for AG Chin on trying to get a petitioner ahead of the line when so many more are waiting legally (and patiently!)
So well put, in a nice well thought out and CIVIL comment.  And as a Muslim, I totally agree!
Women not shopping for a day to protest what?? This is perhaps related to the questionable assertion that they earn less? To say their median income is lower than the median income for men does not in any way evidence that women working in the same jobs are paid less than their male counterparts.  Women demanding equal rights -- is this another anti-Muslim thing?
"The Muslim woman might get in trouble at home if a stranger like you smiles at her."  Then she shouldn't tell anyone!
Funny how you can have BLM causing problems, muslim groups protesting for their rights, latino groups, asian groups, LGBTQ groups, indigenous groups, no whites day on school campus, all other groups ok except for whites, and all this is acceptable. As soon as a group of white people want to stand up for their rights they are "supremacists." I think the supremacists are all the other groups trying marginalize whites into oblivion.
I have twice noted issues between my family and SA Indians in my life. When Muslim businessmen refused me a seat in their offices, despite requesting business mentoring. Also, my son and an Indian colleague were refused, by her parents (northern Hindus) permission to see a movie together or to share coffee together after work. The lass was locked up to keep them apart and had her mobile phone and computer taken away; she obviously lost her student job due to the extreme punishment. There was a disparity between those who came to SA. It was mainly Muslim traders who paid their own way, seeing trading opportunities here. Indentured labourers arrived under completely different circumstances; some had their berths paid for by the sugar cane companies for whom they worked and some brought entire families with them. The debt had to be paid back from their salaries; rooms and salaries were meant only for single men, causing great dissatisfaction. I grew up among Indians...
I noted in the picture the Muslim women were obeying their rules and sitting by themselves behind the men of their family to show subservience.  Maybe all Canadian women should adopt this attitude ;-)
Trump finally took down his anti-Muslim language from his website. Trump's "generals" Mattis, McMasters, and Kelley have been advising him to do that. Army and Marines trying to bring Muslim translators and officers who fought alongside the US in Middle East theaters were working with Mattis on this and it was embarrassing and infuriating to him that Bannon and Miller wrote the order without his approval.  We are increasing our troops in Yemen, Syria, in African countries Djibouti and Somalia, and planning significant additional troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. These are all Islamic countries and we are fighting alongside Muslims. Anti-Muslim policies and Presidential statements do not help the military do their job.
Jack, tell us what taqiyya is and why we infidels need to believe what any muslim says to us.
Thanks for that, Rich, but my comment mentioned people on Europe, and France in particular (as did the one I was replying to.)  The "our" in my expression "the millions of muslims who are our neighbours" didn't just refer to Canada.
So we agree that Brevik, while describing himself as Christian, doesn't really seem like one and that other Christians have no connection to him.  Yet when an extremist Muslims does something horrific, some posters here call on Muslims as a whole to take responsibility for that person and those actions.  Why can they not see the inherent logical inconsistency happening here?
Once again, you label anybody who questions Islam a hate monger.
For Mr. Cox, the frequency of racist harassment doesn’t make it any less painful. “I don’t think anybody will ever be numb to it,” he said.  Also, in a post-election SPLC survey of 10,000 educators, 90 percent said the climate at their schools had been negatively affected by the campaign. Eighty percent described heightened anxiety and fear among students, particularly immigrants, Muslims and African Americans. Numerous teachers reported the use of slurs, derogatory language and extremist symbols in their classrooms.  on the flip side: In contrast to the growth of hate groups, antigovernment “Patriot” groups saw a 38 percent decline – plummeting from 998 groups in 2015 to 623 last year. Composed of armed militiamen and others who see the federal government as their enemy, the “Patriot” movement over the past few decades has flourished under Democratic administrations but declined dramatically when President George W. Bush occupied the White House.
Things aren't as easy as the author makes out. Even Angela Merkel has stated that the face veil is incompatible with Muslim integration in Germany. It's not welcome in Germany any more. It's already banned. People are not tolerating Islamist extremism anymore. That's great news.
Never mind "the elites" needing a crash course in populism, the most threatened group are non-white Canadians.  If anything, non-white Canadians should take steps to protect their persons and property from the Euro-Canadian populists.  One look no further than Bissonette to see what Euro-Canadian populists are capable of doing to unarmed people in a house of prayer.  Today, the target may be muslims, but tomorrow?  Blacks? Natives? Asians?   Likewise, the LGBTQ community should do the same thing, as they seem to be seen as a threat by these populists as well.  Watch your children, and watch out for those who exhibit the classic "lynch mob" mentality that was so prevalent in yesteryear.  More than anything, non-white Canadians should guard against the divide and conquer tactics where these populists will try to enlist communities of color to fight each other on behalf of the populists.
1. Cozying up to the Russians....your former leader, remember, "after the elections I'll have more flexibility", while Russia annexed territory. That wasn't Trump. Russia, and other world leaders would prefer any Democrat over Trump, but that helps them, not you. 2. "Inciting nuclear war" Would you like Trump to continue with the policies of previous Presidents? Recall Clinton giving NK Billions so they would develop nuclear weapons? And what did Obama do to stop NK from developing nuclear weapons? It's your friends who have allowed NK to become a menace, not Trump.  3. Immigration....Really? You believe open borders, Obama's influx of Muslim refugees, Clinton's policies of immigrant expansion, all protect you better than Trump's initiatives?  4. Trump's accomplishments....stop only watching MSNBC or the Communist News Networks. I can think of over 70 accomplishments.  Right now you're better off than you were a year ago, unless you're a Democrat politician. Trump threatens status quo.
Sure, right after Islam does....
Unlike the sorority running the current state dept. Trump, like Putin, sees that Islamic terror as the greatest existential threat to western civilization and cooperation to destroy them is a good thing. Second you keep using the word "FREE"...you must know by now that nothing is FREE. Someone is always picking up the tab. Government subsidizing anything be it student loans, healthcare, etc, causes costs to skyrocket and quality to drop, every time...you should give the rest of your income (if you have any) and give it to the IRS. Then maybe I'll throw in a few more of my hard earned dollars to pay for "FREE" stuff for you.
"there was hardly a day when the country was not in disruption over the Commies behind every tree and the killings, beatings and utter hatred of anyone not Caucasian." It makes me wonder if the travel ban will result in radicalizing American Muslims.  EOs like these don't do anything to protect America from citizens and LPRs who find their hopes and dreams interfered with if not crushed.  That belief in the American dream gone with the ink drying on paper.  A sense of persecution and prejudice based upon one's immutable character of religion.  It lends credence and plausibility to the propaganda of extremists that reach anyone with a smartphone or an internet connection.
It is hard to fathom how any sane person could support the $10.5 million tax  dollars given  to convicted murderer, terrorist and traitor Khadr. Now we find out other Muslims are getting settlements without the settlements being made public? Our democracy needs a good shot of medicine. I really think we need a election to clean up the mess. How can anyone have faith in this government?
The Globe knows the fate of Charlie Hebdo is going to happen at the Globe's own offices if criticism of Islam is allowed to go too far. Next, there may be images of Mohammad. We can't have that. @;(>
"Let it be known to all that Islam commands all Muslims even in war time to protect places of worship," read a statement issued June 7 by the National Ulama Conference of the Philippines, which represents the Muslim leaders.  This precisely the kind of news the mainstream media ignores.
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;  Establishment Clause - This clause prohibits a joining between government and religion, such as no official state religion, no preference by government of one faith over another or religion generally, no taxes to support religion, and no government support for religious worship or practice.  Free Exercise Clause – This clause provides each individual with the right to freely practice the religion of his or her choosing. It ensures the autonomy houses of worship and other religious institutions from government in matters of internal governance and religious law. It prohibits government from enacting laws that specifically target religion.  Basically, keep your govt out of my religion and keep your religion out of my govt.   Beware that Islam does not allow for this.
Islam requires a dramatic reformation - every country in the world (without exception) "governed" by Islamic law is highlighted by social regression, authoritarianism, and misogyny. Just look at every country that has the death penalty for homosexuality - all majority Muslim countries. Gender equality, freedom of expression (including the freedom to make fun of religions through satire and comedy), and freedom of sexual orientation have absolutely nothing to do with cultural relativism - they are values synonymous with universal human rights and advanced civilized societies.  The idea of society governed by Islamic law is synonymous with social regression, without exception - the idea of Islamism (or political Islam) should be opposed accordingly.
How does a Muslim woman quietly riding a public bus create any harm, or risk of harm, to the broader public good? She doesn't.   Would the author draw the same conclusion if for “Muslim woman” in the above extract we substitute “person wearing a KKK hood”.  I suspect he might not. And, presumably, it would be on the grounds that KKK garb is a potent symbol of a racist ideology. And, as such, the wearing of it in public  does create at least the risk of harm in a society that professes to abhor racism in all its forms.   Surely, there is a parallel argument that garb that conceals a woman's face is a potent symbol of a misogynistic mentality that cannot be tolerated in a country that proclaims the equality of men and women.   So I suggest, with respect to the author, that there is indeed an argument that women who go about their business with their face masked do create a risk of harm to the broader public good.
An 'authentic' Christian, Muslim or Jew simply does not commit acts of terror.  Acts of terror have, however, been committed in the name of all three faith communities.  Leaders of some Islamic countries who identify themselves as Muslim are no doubt violent people, just as supposed Christian leaders who invade other countries using lies about 'WMDs' to justify their violence are only using religion as a pretext.
"You on the other hand supported businesses that discriminate against gay people based on their Christian religion."  Would you feel the same had those "Christian"  bakers been Muslim?  https://youtu.be/RgWIhYAtan4
The reason why Obama did not use the term "radical Islamic terrorism" is because ISIS and other terrorist groups are not Islamic. They merely use the religion as an excuse to murder innocent people. When you call them "Islamic terrorists" you are falling for their trick and are helping them to recruit new members by making terrorism a religious issue.  Then the only thing ISIS recruiters have to do is approach Muslims and say, "Look at how America hates our faith and wants to kill all of us. It's obvious we must fight to protect our faith and everyone we care about!"
And under Condi Rice 3,000 American civilians died on 9/11 in the name of Muslim terrorist chanting Allah Akbar.
Thanks Amrit writing about his issue, nowday's bashing and actually victimizing innocent Muslims become a national pass time of in India. A good read here :  https://www.dailyo.in/politics/hadiya-case-nia-love-jihad-supreme-court-kerala-hc-inter-religious-marriage/story/1/20386.html
..and Muslims,  They are the official most favored religion .  He will tour mosques coast to coast but will not meet with Baptists or Presbyterians at all.
You wish to continue to indulge in your hatred caused by irrational fears of Muslims without ever being called out for it.  Well, you still have every freedom to spew Islamaphobia (and that's exactly what you're defending here) but others have every right to continue to call it for what it is.  You and others continue to whine that you're not Islamaphobic and yet you never seem to be able to raise any non-bigoted, intelligent arguments about Islam.  In fact, you almost certainly haven't read the Qoran either so please, tell us, what fact-based, reason-based arguments do you have then????????  M103 is a motion.  Your hysterical response to it just highlights your irrationality even more.
Please take a look at  the direction of the Liberal party - Do we want our country run by MP's  that follow the beliefs of Islam - Or the beliefs of Judeo/Christian values that our country was founded on ? In the past election we elected 10 MP's that were Muslim (and the Prime Minister hired a Muslim for his Press Secretary) . When he takes a vacation he visits an island owned by a Muslim . If you read the Quran 5:51  "Do not take Jews and Christians as Allies ".  Do we really want our country to go in this direction ? Why are we bringing in more Refugees from the Middle East when we have not seen assimilation from the current group ie; One year later in the CBC article regarding a family in Windsor , Ontario - They don't have a job - the only thing that changed is that they have another Child !
ISIS is on the run and Muslims are getting sick of their ideology. Last thing needed is Trump stirring up antiwestern feeling.
It's a dubious story because it's childishly simplistic. Rome is a huge ecclesiastical shark-pool full of different factions, interests, alliances and ambitions. In the Roman shark pond, Burke is a tiny little guppy. Thinking the whole shark-pond is magically run by Ray Burke is a sign that someone is reading from a very small, uninformed American bubble.  Bannon is in a highly-visible powerful position, but he is not Trump's puppet-master. If Bannon were fired, the Trump administration's policies toward immigrants and Muslims and the clash of civilizations would not change one bit. Bannon is a devotee of the nationalistic movement, but he doesn't run it.  The Bannon-and-Burke story depends on cartoonish thinking: it's like a plot for a movie from the 1950's, in which the entire Wild West is inhabited by one sheriff, his deputy, one saloon-keeper, two bad guys, four horses and eight recurring bystanders. In reality Rome does not have a small cast and neither does DC.
Not convinced Paddock was the perp. This has all the tell tale signs of Islamists at play.
"Muslims have some very unique rules for preparation, dare I say superstitious? e.g washing the body three times and if more washing is necessary it always has to be an odd number of times."  Of what relevance is how people prefer to have their bodies prepared for burial? If you want to be buried in a clown suit, that's your choice.  You want examples of irrational thinking around being buried? "I'm a veteran. I want to be buried in a military cemetery." "Bury me with my favourite jewels." "I want to be buried here under the shade of this tree. And look, the view is so nice."
While I agree with your idea about the national referendum, I don't agree with the direct "Muslim" label. We'd never get it past the courts.  Identify countries where "Groups who hate Western democratic values, including ISIS, Hamas, Hezbola, Al Quaida, etc. - thrive."  We need to cover more than Trump did with his exceutive order.  It's not only about countries having a central government to provide info that we can vet.
I really,  really,  believe that Homeland Security cannot vet the number of proposed refugees that the Obama administration is talking about in the time available.  In 2015, one month prior the  San Bernadino debacle a HS spokesman said: "the U.S. refuge application process  takes 18-24 months. He said the U.S. vetting process includes an initial screening by the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, security checks by the both the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a medical screening, an in-person interview, and additional security vetting for young Syrian and Iraqi males."  As of November 2015  "governors in at least 17 states have moved to suspend or restrict the refugee resettlement, including Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,  Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin."  No doubt all of them are Muslim hating conservatives...or maybe not.
I did respond, and it is my true belief that someone like you, rarely having missed to mark down, before responding to,  any 'dissenting post' , is simply an 'average person'.  To my point - the usual reaction of someone who would not want to discuss Islam ids to to shut down criticism -  playing the the racist, bigotry and what have you card.  Now - about that debate? Isn't that covered by the Carter of rights , freedom of religion, tolerance?  Didn't see you response to that.
Muslims in this country are entitled to full religious freedom within the law. This does not mean that anyone has to agree with their religion. It does not mean that we are obliged to import them as refugees or immigrants. It does not mean that we are required to act in accordance with their "sensitivities".   I believe that the hope of many people in voting for Trump was that he would shut down the floodgates, before we ended up in a situation like Europe. Europe is rapidly reaching the point that they will either tolerate wholesale rape and destruction by their "migrants" or they will have to do something unpalatable to solve the problem. We will not have to do something unpalatable. All we have to do is cut off Muslim migration and integrate our current Muslims to be responsible Americans.
Who said we don't monitor all extremists, Islamic and far right haters.  Both need to be fought with equal vigor.  the fact that you don't see that tells us where you are on the political spectrum.  NO, we won't let the far right haters off the hook.  And NO, we won't stop fighting terrorism either.  You don't need to be a liberal or on the left to see that both must be resisted.
It's like Barack Hassan Obama refusing to say "Radical Islamic Terrorism" or "The War on Terror".
Fact check: Trump and his spokespeople called it a ban. Fact check: Obama's  ID of those countries was for one extra interview before entering the US for travel. Fact check: there have been zero fatal attacks in America from those 7 countries. Fact check: the EO "does not include any countries from which radicalized Muslims have actually killed Americans in the U.S. since Sept. 11, 2001." Fact check: essentially the EO prioritizes Christian refugees.
That is crazy talk.  She is definitely not a terrorist.  But might as well be a PR contractor for them.  She feeds their recruitment narrative that we will never truly accept Muslims.
Have no worries as President Trump will issue an executive order outlawing the American Civil Liberties Union and the Federal Judge that caused this big mess. Remember, during the election President Trump said time and again that he was going to ban Muslims until they were able to figure what was going on. He is doing exactly what he said he would do. Got to love a politician that sticks to his promises!
Fraudulent foreign affairs expert and Nazi fascist Sebastian Gorka was purged from the White House yesterday, but his wife is still an official with the Department of Homeland Security. Like her husband, Katharine Gorka is steeped in the world of Frank Gaffney and professional Islamophobia. "Our pillow talk is the Islamic State and Al Qaeda," Sebastian once quipped before David Horowitz's hate group. They have promoted anti-Muslim conspiracy theories together for years. Their collaborative efforts helped shape Donald Trump's policy approach to Islam, including his emphatic use of the words "radical Islamic terrorism." Mrs. Gorka met with DHS officials during the transition to argue against the Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) program funding for organizations that oppose right wing domestic terror groups. Mrs. Gorka is protecting Nazis and supremacists from within the government thanks to Trump.
There wasn't much the British government could do about Butts until he actually committed violent acts. He was a fundamentalist (extremist) Muslim, yes, but that's not against the law. There are tens of thousands of fundamentalist Muslims in the UK. You can't follow them all around. A recent poll found half of Muslims in the UK wanted gays imprisoned. There is strong support for Sharia and other extremist elements of Islam. There is probably the same support here in Canada, but no one has dared to ask Canadian Muslims direct questions about such things.
Already did.  The concept was revealed in Qur'an after a young Muslim in the hands of the idolaters refused to renounce his faith and was killed for it.  Allah gave us permission to falsely renounce our faith to save our lives--that's what 'taqiyya' means.  And the consensus of Shi'a Ulema (religious authorities) at any rate have ruled those of us living in America can't use taqiyya to hide our faith because MOST of us aren't losing our lives here because of it.  Yet.  But a few have.  At least since the 1970's.
Interesting.  Here is an experiment.  Remove "Catholic" and replace with "Muslim".  Say that these emails came from a senior Republican staffer for Donald Trump.  All other words remain the same. Consider the outrage that would be coming from MSW about the intolerance of the Republicans.
Our country is a work in progress...we have hated Catholics, Jews, any race but white, Eastern Europeans, and double hated them, left them to die, if they were Eastern European and Jewish. But each time we learn, sort of...'course it seems to rear it's ugly head again and again...think the past election. Now we hate Muslims...oh we call them Islamic to hide our shame...Little d was so proud today, Radical Islamic Terrorists, he spewed like the hateful vomit of which he is so proud. And his followers love it, lap it up. If you want to see how Germany lost control of their democracy watch his latest circus...really, really scary! Each generation gets better...now we have LGBT at the newest whipping post as they too seek rights and respect...baby steps, two forward and one back...it's progress...and love and real Christian values.
If she is serious, shouldn't she be extending her criticism to places like Saudi Arabia and others in the Middle East?  Saudi Arabia supports and promotes an islamic ideology that is not that different form ISIS. Saudi Arabia crucifies people, publicly beheads people, bans non-muslims from some cities, bans all non-muslim religions, removes hands as a from of punishment, executes gays and denies women basic rights and supports islamic extremists around the globe.  How will she de-radicalize when the government supports places like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other dictatorships that follow and actively support an extreme version of islam.?
As we have seen over and over again--the latest major examples the federal election here, in Canada, and the Presidential election in the U.S.--politicians will say anything that they feel will get them votes.    So, the Quebec Premier isn't distinguishing between terrorists and the greater number of Muslims in his province, hmm?  Uh-oh.  What's he know (or sense) that the rest of us don't? Yikes!  But wait!    It wouldn't be the first time that a politician has said something designed to get votes and been completely wrong.  La Pen's defeat in France is a really good example.
You are referring to Islam and Muslims who force women to cover their faces. Well I agree with you, but you seem to blame all men for it. Trudeau would be as guilty for allowing more of them in.
Or look at Fox News' apology for saying look at them all:  "A correction now: Over the course of this last week we have made some regrettable errors on air regarding the Muslim population in Europe, particularly with regard to England and France.   "Now, this applies especially to discussions of so-called ‘no-go zones,’ areas where non-Muslims allegedly aren’t allowed in and police supposedly won’t go.   "To be clear, there is no formal designation of these zones in either country and no credible information to support the assertion there are specific areas in these countries that exclude individuals based solely on their religion. There are certainly areas of high crime in Europe as there are in the United States and other countries — where police and visitors enter with caution.   "We deeply regret the errors and apologize to any and all who may have taken offense, including the people of France and England."
What a cliche': you only heard of Bannon last October when Leftist media groups told you that he was "bad"-- and you still don't know anything about him except he once ran an organization that didn't report what you wanted to hear and did from WaPo. Jeez. Ok- I'll bite: What, specifically (and constructively), do you not like about Bannon? Hint: if your answer involves the word "racist" or "Islam," then it is evidence-free and fed by some Leftist Pundit, and therefore invalid.
Really! Timothy McVay and  Dylnn Roof  were not Muslim and the were terrorist.  Nor were most  of the others involved with mass shootings across the country. http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/16/us/20-deadliest-mass-shootings-in-u-s-history-fast-facts/ might enlighten you with facts you have not considered.
One Muslim neighbor and a mosque and you have no problems.  Splendid, what are we worried about then?  Let'em ALL in !  Show'em our Aloha!  They couldn't care less about our "Aloha".  All it takes is one crazy with some fertilizer and some diesel, or one crazy with a knife or a gun to make everyone realize what this TEMPORARY (it's only 120 days!) ban is trying to do.  Better you stay in Manoa, feed your cats.  Oh, and make room for all the illegal immigrants, because we're going to send them all to Manoa.
Lots of organizations help those who are down and out, including Christian and entirely secular organizations. It can get blurry whether or not some of these organizations help people in order to be in a position to proselytize to those down on their luck or if they do it strictly out of a charitable impulse.  A different approach to charity is that of the Islamic faith called Zakat--the third pillar of Islam. Zakat consists of the compulsory giving of a set proportion of one's wealth to charity and is considered a type of worship and of self-purification. Freeing oneself from the love of possessions and greed, from the love of money and from love of oneself are some of the major goals of this ritual giving. What's interesting about this approach is the focus on how giving edifies the giver rather than the receiver. Sometimes it seems like the Christian approach has more to do with providing social status to the giver. In Zakat, the donations are frequently private or anonymous.
Muslims and liberals excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of Christianity, Europe. Israel, and America. Islam's destructive iconoclasm is destroying historic treasures,   burning churches and ancient holy sites across the ME They even have Islamophobia against each other as Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects, ISIS , Taliban and Al Qaeda  try to exterminate each other.  It is worse than anything expressed in St Apollinaire and we are told to avert our eyes.
Yes, of course not all Muslims should be painted with he same brush, that goes without saying, however if a show of solidarity needs to happen one would expect that our Canadian Muslims would perhaps show their outrage and disapproval when atrocious acts are perpetrated on their own fellow Muslims in certain regions of the world.  I would also suggest that Canadian Muslims would do well to adapt to the Canadian way of life;  then Canadians would most definitely show solidarity towards them.
With 32,000 terrorist attacks by muslims to the rest of the world there is nothing irrational about disliking or having aversion to islam.  Those terrorist attacks are real and obviously a HUGE warning that there is something very badly wrong with the followers of islam.  Why are MPs ignoring the facts:  the police reports across the country clearly show that highest hate crimes are against jews at the rate of 29% and that hate crimes against muslims is much lower on the scale with 11%. There is nothing of a warning that says that something  should be done to protect muslims.  On the contrary, if any motion should be put forward, it should be protecting jews against hate crimes.
Are you positive Obama was not born in Kenya?  The Obama administration DID bug the WH, and Trumps administration, before and after the election.  I saw the Muslims cheering also, you must have been on another channel, cnn?  And now, after a year of 'investigations' by a special counsel and 2 congressional committees, looking for 'collusion' between our good American President and Russia, we find that HRC and Obama had their hands in a deal with Uranium One, a Russian company, to control 20% of America's uranium, no investigation needed, (The Clinton Foundation was given $140 MILLION in donations from the same group, Bill Clinton was paid hundreds of thousands to speak to the same bunch)  it's there for ALL to see, and yet, the 'free press' says not a word.  America is in big trouble, her statehood is in jeopardy.
NUKE the Rothschild-Bauer FORCED occupation of Israel. Talmudic infant killing blood drinking Jews created the Democrat, Socialist, Communist, and Liberal all to destabilise nations. Now we have Jew funded factions like Antifa'g popping up all over America. The Jews primary enemy has become the Moslem! Jews demoralised America over the last 100 years with Satanic Qabalist Hollywood. They RAPE our children. Their music "industry" screams modern slavery. Besides this TRUTH.... Why fight JEW Battles? Whites and Blacks usually get along... The Crypto-Jews ran the transatlantic slave trade. So why are White non-slave owner Americans in 2017 under attack? One answer.... Devious Evil JEWS.  Don't be fooled.... I am a Jewish anti-semite. I like being an anti-semite. When you study Jewish history for 47 years like I have you KNOW damn well who the enemy of humanity is. I am Judeo-Christian. I am on the right side. All blessings be to Jesus Christ and G🕍d!! #AmericaFirst #SimonOfTrentsRevenge
There is a lack of flow in this new format, but there was also a lack of flow when the moderators sat on 20 minutes of comments before posting them.  I think that they should reserve this new format for the stories that they used to routinely pre moderate, e.g. muslim, gay, FN related stories.
So, what I've learned from you is that - much to my surprise - virtually half of all British Muslims do NOT feel that homosexuality should be illegal ... which is amazing when you consider that many British Muslims are first or second generation immigrants from countries and/or cultures where homosexuality (where it is recognized as existing at all) is not only criminal but often a capital offense.   Think where "white-bread" Canadians were on this issue only a generation or so ago.  Very encouraging, in my opinion.  No, not all Muslims are "sweet, smiley and integrated", but - as too many events (in Norway, the U.S. and other places) have shown - the fact is that not all non-Muslims are sweet, smiley or integrated either.
Christmas and the Lord's prayer are not "banished from schools". They simply can't be forced on students, just as Islam can't be forced on students. The Peel board is simply making accommodations for Muslim students to pray on their own, as Christian and other students have always been allowed to do. Perhaps you should stop and think before spreading disinformation, especially when it puts people at risk.
Why the hang up about "public declarations of official faith", sky? You keep repeating that concept but don't explain why it's relevant. If a Catholic wears a crucifix or a Jew a yarmulke, is that a "public declaration of faith"? Is that a problem for you? If so, why?  Accommodating Muslim students or any religious group in a school is not a state endorsement of a particular religion, it's simply a reasonable reaction to living in a modern diverse country. What is it that you're so afraid of?
Yes, "freedom of religion" in the Charter is open to interpretation, argyle5663.  Luckily we have an entire system designed to do exactly that: the courts.  When it comes to such reasonable accommodations as allowing muslim students the use of a classroom once a week for prayers, there really is no legal conflict.
I have no issue with Muslim Canadians practicing their faith.    What I think would help with the Muslim experience within Canada, is for them to strongly denounce any violence perpetrated by extremists within their community.   It seems they go completely silent during those times, which sends a message that you may actually support it.     I'm a white, Irish decent, United Church Canadian.   If someone from my community seriously victimized someone because of their faith or non violent beliefs, I would denounce that act at every opportunity.   That's how you build trust in a multi cultural country.     Silence isn't golden.
Given that a previous anti-Islamophobia motion passed on Oct 26/16, I find it hard to believe that M103 will have the impact that you claim. Did similar motions against antisemitism also have a similar affect? Do you think that islamophobic comments were somehow acceptable prior to M103 passing?  I do understand your concern, I just feel it's misplaced.
My previous post was an iPhone error.  It was a commentary on his banning Muslims. He equates Muslim and Mideast terrorism as one in the same.  Many equate Islam with its origins forgetting more than half the world practices Islam .  Islam is Abrahamic. Does that name sound familiar. People equate Islam with barbaric laws forgetting if they practiced religion as the bible puts it we would be stoning adulterers. Where I work ther are a diverse people and though I don't agree with their policy concerning medical absence I admire the diversity. One I work directly with is from the Middle East . When he is asked if he practices Islam his answer amuses me. He looks with tolerant amusement at peoples misconceptions and shakes his head. No I do not practice Islam.  To this date he hasn't blown himself up for which I am extremely grateful since I work right next to him.
According to the Southern  Poverty Law Center.  There have been 867 hate incidents since the election.  Anti-Immigrant (200), Anti-Black (187), Anti-Semitic (100), Anti-LGBT (95). Anti-Muslim (49), Anti-Woman (40) and the rest a mix of others.  I find it interesting that Mr. Blair doesn't even mention anti-Semitic incidents in this piece despite the fact that hate crimes against Jews account for the 3rd highest amount of reported hate crimes and highest of all hate crimes against religious minorities.  Granted most of this article was simply quotes by others and Mr. Blair does have a link to a BBC piece that documents it all, including the anti-Semitic incidents.  I only point this out because it is further evidence of what appears to be long-standing bias at Civil Beat, something I have been complaining about for years.  Civil Beat is blind to anti-Semitism, even more so when the offender is an immediate family member of a top CB reporter.
Especially if a Muslim refused service to a Christian on that basis.
You are DEAD wrong - I did not vote for Trump - but respect the office and will submit to him because we as a nation need to, do you like living in a constant state of dissatisfaction ? (apparently you do), I couldn't stand Obama either, but hey, he is POTUS and i have to make the best of it and trust we have a system of checks and balances in place to keep him in line (which we do)  The law the way it is written is NOT a Muslim Ban - I don't care what he said 4 months ago. You are claiming to know his "intent" which is why this appeal will be overturned, and I don't care what Guliani said - the ORDER was not written as a Muslim Ban, you cannot PROVE intent in this matter.  The inauguration was probably the most "Viewed" (maybe not attended) but Viewed in history of you factor the hand held's in possession   Let's compare lies of the last 5 Presidents, then we can grade on a curve, OK ?
For once a better headline for this story than the one on the CBC that states that the "Liberals" paid out this money - as if they were somehow robbing the taxpayer to appease those pesky Muslims again. As with Maher Arar and Omar Khadr, these payments were inevitable.  My respect for Jean Chretien has taken a battering with all this implication of Canadian federal involvement in the mistreatment of these men on Chretien's watch.
they are protected by the ACLU aren't they. I have a physical disability and am always called upon to get screened, NO ACLU help for me. D@mn, I'm not Richard the Shoe bomber, I have no choice but to walk the way I do. These Muslims have choices to don or not to don on the robes and headress! Again, I have no option but to walk the way I do.
You know he's right when he's got a complaint from CAIR ! You know there had to be someone in the pipeline , get over it ! If only our politicians put our safety first instead of looking for votes , and trying to change Canada !  We should seriously stand back and take a look at our Immigration policies! We should be helping those in need of protection because of their religious beliefs first ! If you look at the face of our government it seems to be more and more Muslim , and now a Muslim Refugee is in charge of Immigration ?
Japan is the only country that had nuclear bombs dropped on them.  Any Muslim countries had that happen?  Japanese Americans formed their own battalion and died by the thousands defending America and became the most decorated unit in U.S. History.  Did Muslims do that?  Japanese Americans had their homes and business taken away without due process and put in internment camps.  Decades later they received an apology from the U.S. Gov't and $20,000 (what an insult).  Anything like that happened to Muslims?  Muslims using the experience of the Japanese Americans to bring sympathy to their plight is wrong headed.  Unfortunately, there are Japanese Americans who make that comparison too...Like our feckless Governor and AG (not Japanese American I know).
What is the difference between the preaching and practice of Muhammad and the acts of the Islamic State?  What are the ayat and ahadith used to justify those acts? How do they differ from the Bible?    What prt of the Aqeeda of Islam motivates Muslims to genocidal conquest?
What we really need to talk about is how a certain religion treats women as second class citizens (will not lot them drive, makes them wear head scarves, doesn't let them out without their brother or father) and we need to talk about a certain religion that thinks it is OK to throw gays off buildings.  That religion is Islam.  So, let's talk about it!
ISIS says that the US is an enemy of Islam, and Trump seems to want to prove them right.
Trump did not ban Muslims from entering the US. He did not ban Saudis, Qataris, and Turks even though they are Muslim extremists and exported terrorists to Syria and Iraq. Trump showed his real intentions and banned specifically those Muslim countries that are clearly anti-Israel or pro-Iran.
Motley, yet again, this is, thank God, America and not Saudi Arabia.   Lets' look at what AMERICAN Islamic leaders have to say about the Orlando  massacre:  “Our hearts, thoughts, and prayers are with the victims and their families... This is a hate crime, plain and simple. We condemn it in the strongest possible terms. It violates our principles as Americans and as Muslims,” Nihad Awad, CAIR's National Executive Director, said on Sunday. "We will not give into hate. We will not give into fear,” he added.  Awad insisted that Daesh is an outlawed group which doesn’t represent Muslims. "You do not speak for us. You do not represent us. You are an aberration, you are an outlaw ... they don't speak for our faith. They never belonged to this beautiful faith," he said. "  Do you have a problem with this Motley? I don't.
The hits just keep coming for Donald's ill-fated Muslim travel ban.  Keep pushing that boulder up the hill, Donald!
the Islamic world never went though a Reformation, a Renaissance or an Enlightenment as varied means to stress the its religious, cultural, scientific, and economic norms...there are no Islamic equivalents to Martin Luther, Leonardo, Galileo, Spinoza, Decartes, Voltaire, Locke, Kant, Bentham, Smith, Darwin etc etc....the West was forced to confront its social and religious structures...the Islamic world, for the most part, has not...it desperately needs to do so...how that will come about...I have no idea, but I place some hope in the young and technology
One in three U.S. Muslims fear for their safety? Considering the numbers of reactionaries in white, Christian America, and the saturation of gun ownership, I'm surprised that the numbers of fearful people isn't much higher. Muslims in the U.S. shouldn't have to live their lives in fear.
Corporate media peddling corporate welfare stories - there are multi-million dollar multi nationals in each of these countries - where are they? Why is a "wealthy" country such as Canada not being recognized as being hopelessly in debt so not wealthy at all.  The inconvenient truth that the media does not want to publish about South Sudan is that the largely Christian populations are being pushed into Islam: how about identifying this part of that conflict.   Why are people fleeing conflict zones rather than taking a stand? If western democracies eliminated social and financial benefits for anyone who is not a citizen, deterred the economic migration, then outcomes would change. More finances could be directed at assisting those first safe countries and enabling the displaced citizenry to take a stand against the conflict.
No, students are being forced to pledge their allegiance to Islam in front of their schoolmates.  Freedom of religion should also mean freedom FROM religion. There should be some place where Muslim children aren't forced to practice their parent's ideology.
Your side in the context of this article is composed of people who don't approve of the Peel Board's decision to provide a room for muslim students to pray during school time.  Am I wrong, AI1144?  There is a lot of jumping to conclusions going on.  I just wrote: "disagreeing with the notion of public money being spent on prayer rooms does not make one 'anti-muslim.' "  Does that sound like I was calling you a racist xenophobe?  But there are racist xenophobes around.  Case in point: the person who equated a scarf-wearing muslim woman to a terrorist.   Do you think  racist xenophobes are eager to engage in rational conversation?  I don't.
Notice that the Israeli policy does not ban people by country or by religion. It works like Obama's order which bans terrorists no matter where they come from and not just from the 6 countries. Obama's order did look at travel to possible sites of terrorist training camps-- so a Canadian could be banned if he or she travelled to sites of terrorist training camps. Vetting under the Obama policy took years and involved very tight criteria. Trump can do the same or make his criteria tighter, he just needs to stop banning people from the 6 Muslim countries.
If you think that homosexuality is mostly persecuted in Muslim countries, you. have. no. idea.
We split church and state for a reason nutbar. Trump's win was for common sense not religious fruitcakes. We just let in 10 million religious nuts.   no mas. We just got through 30 years of  horrible and destructive socialism.  Secular religious zealots need not apply. We are going middle of road dude. Nutbar religious freaks of any religion are gonna airplaned to the sahara so watch your tongue. We gonna let you all fight in the desert, we are airplane all the socialists too so they can cuddle with their Muslim friends they love so much Let us know who wins.
Quelle une groupe charmante supporting nasty blowhard bellicose mostly failed businessman Kevie baby.   Mike Harris, whose very name brings fear to about 2/3 of the citizens of the Province he polarized for personal ends. Marjorie LeBreton scribe of Mulroney and up to her neck in the senate scandal, until even Helmet hair Harper dumped her as slightly toxic. The rest mostly unheard of.   Woops forgot all about Tim Uppal, not quite finished highschool and a banker? Wow? What Bank? Tell us all so we can put our money elsewhere.  And how can we forget Mr. Uppal as Minister of Multiculturalism, wearing religious garb in the House of Commons.,yer top-o-the-line public forum in Canada,  and proposing that muslim women could not wear religious garb as a lesser public forum...a citizenship hearing. So dumb that he could not see the contradiction between what he wears and what pearls of low wisdom came out of his mouth.    A motley crew if ever there was one.   And Aquilini of Vancouver. Scary.
the judge and the AG in Hawaii and the press like to lie about the travel ban against muslims the travel ban is only for those six countries that have no government where we can vet them because they have no record on those people from those terrorist countries it will not hurt our tourist industry by doing this band, and students from those terrorist countries I would not let them in until we can be sure they are not terrorist sneaking into this country disguise as foreign students coming to UH on the foreign exchange, but these judges don't care, well you know what they keep blocking these presidential orders from these terrorist countries and if some of them do terrorist attacks on us the blood will be on the hands of this judge and the AG of Hawaii and the lying press and of course Obama since he is behind all this.
Wow, talk about having blinders on! Trump has failed in each of his major policy attempts, whether they were attempted through executive order (his "Muslim ban" - his words!) or his promise to repeal ACA ("Obamacare"). I support the Democrats doing everything they can to protect us while we have this harmful person in the White House! (and I don't appreciate your use of infantile language, "dims," really not witty).
Wow, she'd make a good Muslim! :)
What Palestinians?  You are aware there is and never has been a country called Palestine or a Palestinian people?  Palestine was what people just called the entire region, like today we call Canada and the U.S., North America.  The land was always Israel!  You are aware that even the koran says Israel belongs to the Israeli's?  So who is really stealing from whom?
Hmm.  Sandy Hook Elementary School - children murdered by a heavily armed white guy. Murders at a Sikh Temple in Wisconsin by a racist white guy who couldn't tell Sikhs from Muslims. Murders at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado by a "Christian" anti-abortion white guy.   Murder of 9 blacks in a church in North Carolina by a white kid proving "white supremecists" are anything but. Murder of 3 people at random at a Jewish community center and retirement home in Overland Park by a new-Nazi who'd been active in the Klan.
It would appear that the religion of Islam covers a wide spectrum of beliefs with different interpretations. Some of the sects within it are very peacefully while others, like ISIL, are not. It also appears that the various sects each feel that the others have misinterpreted the true meaning of the faith. This really an issue for Muslims to resolve however,  if it is to fit into the 21st century the religion of Islam is badly in need of a major overhaul.  In the interim perhaps we could make a dent in this kind of thing if we dealt with the mosques and educational institutions which preach a very conservative version of Islam, (salafism/Wahhabism/Muslim Brotherhood organizations for example) as these are the groups that are preaching a more conservative, one prone to a more violent interpretation
Oh, I fully agree.  What we also need to do is give room for people to make different decisions and choices -as long as no one is hurt.  I think Francis, in his comments about accompanying people where they are and listening - is addressing more than just the lgbt, transgender, gender ideology (whatever that is) issues.  We need this attitude in how we deal with our fellow pew sitters, within our families, and with our neighbors.  I live not too far from that county in Georgia that is just going bananas over the idea that Muslims may build a mosque and have a cemetery.  Most of those who are so up-in-arms don't know a single Muslim, much less those who live in the county and want a place to worship and meet together with those who believe as they do.  Funny, when I was growing up here in Georgia, I was one of the few Catholics, and some parents would not let their kids play with me or my siblings, we were called "papists" by some.  Some things never change  But Pope Francis is trying.
>>Muslims and Christians co-existed historically more than Germans and the French. Europe has had continuous wars from the 1st century to the mid 20th centur... . Ah, those "bad Westerners Christians".. fighting each other throughout the centuries , while Muslims were busy spreading peace all around the world.
Section 212(f) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 states: “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.”  And one source says "the past six presidents have all used the executive power to bar different classes of immigrants".  So I guess U.S. president Trump can do it. We'll see what the U.S. courts have to say.  By the way,  Trump is banning people from only 7 Muslim countries from entering the U.S.A.   It's not a ban on Muslims. Trump isn't banning all Muslims from entering the U.S.A.
A lot of people were blinded by the flood response. I'll give Nenshi some credit on that even though the apparatus was well up and running by the time he returned from his Toronto "look at me I'm a Muslim Mayor tour".
Trump has absolutely ZERO justifiable reason of ANY kind for signing this "executive order" that either temporarily or permanently, imposes a "ban" targeting only human beings entering the USA that specifically come from predominately Muslim countries PERIOD!!  In fact, Trump and his crackpot supporters, have ZERO frigging evidentiary proof, that A) ANY terror-related attacks whatsoever have been carried-out on US soil by foreign nationals from ANY of the countries listed in the order; and that B) there is NO proof whatsoever indicating the current "vetting" process employed by the US for refugees and others wanting to enter the USA, IS at all "flawed" in anyway and  supposedly requires further frigging  "enhanced vetting" - whatever that even means - PERIOD!!
Hoseloader is apparently getting his information about Muslims from sources that promote alternative facts.  In reality, Muslim immigrants make significant contributions to the fabric of American culture.  The US is still developing as a nation, and one key to development is the ability to incorporate different cultures because they lead to new ideas.  Without new ideas, any country will stagnate.  The Roman Empire, for example, would not have been nearly as great if it did not incorporate new cultures.  Roman citizenship was granted to those who were conquered!  Hoseloader's rant reveals the dark side of America that, if dominant, will prevent America from attaining its highest potential.
Well, that requires a warrant, which sounds reasonable and in line with how rights can normally be superseded in particular cases given an overriding consideration. The big question is whether it is possible for generalized warrants to be issued that cover classes of people instead of individuals, like all Muslims, or everyone in a postal code, or everyone who visits a certain website, or everyone in a particular city, Toronto, say... Generalized warrants is how mass surveillance in the US has been legally justified in recent years, so it would be interesting to know if the Liberals are planning on doing this in Canada.
It is the dark side.  Most of us here have found a way to remain Catholics despite their efforts to demean our thinking, but they have just about forced me out.  It is an unkind, rigid church.  Puzzling how anyone can force another person to believe exactly what they believe, especially when the arguments are so simplistic.  There is no nuance or compassion.  It's ironic that most of them hate muslims.
Meh. Just Trump haterz is all. Very little merit to the court ban.  + possibly (possibly, I am not admitting it is true) there may be something poorly written in the ban that puts it at odds with the law.  +  possibly the way the ban is written is overstepping a prez's authority vis-a-vis the other branches or the Constitution. Maybe...  - This is really about hating Trump. Not about any supposed merits or caring about some disaffected segment of the population. You know in your heart I speak truth.  -  They say the law is discriminatory and racist because Trup said "ban muslims" at a previous time. Poppycock. The two largest - and many more little ones  - muslim countries in the world are not banned. So who cares HOW or WHAT Trump said when he first thought-out-loud about this law? The FACT is that in real-life practice this law is NOT racist.  - Besides, muslim, islam - and not even 'arab' - are a race. So one cannot be racist for speaking disparagingly about those groups.
Yeah, they're starting to feel the pain of embracing Islam in Europe.
From the article:  "There is no evidence that the president harbors racist views."  What?  Is this obscure irony? Was the author in a coma throughout the 2016 campaign and the eight years preceding it? There is MUCH sickening evidence from the campaign and the birther movement that he is a dyed in the wool racist -- ask the rapist Mexicans, the biased Hispanic judge, the Muslim community including the Gold Star family, the African-American community.  Ask the Obama family.  Ask the millions of refugees and/or potential immigrants.  Ask anyone who isn't a rich white man, or a woman who ranks a 10 on DJT's hotness scale.  Anyone who hasn't recognized Trump's racism during the campaign or the eight miserable months since the inauguration is simply refusing to see him for who he really is.  There are no excuses remaining to characterize the truth about him, and that truth is ugly and completely contrary to a person holding the office of POTUS.
46% of American voters are total suckers : Jeff Sessions came straight out of the Washington swamp. . Trump's emergency plan to ban Muslims is a failure. Trump's secret plan to defeat ISIS is to use Obama`s plan. Trump's secret plan to replace Obama Care with something much better, is not to call it Obama Care. . Plus, best of all ................ Mexico told Trump where to shove his wall.
we as a society do that all the time.  isn't that what Trump's Muslim ban is about?
" Does that mean holocaust deniers? Radical Islamic terrorist's speakers? Hate based religions?"   When I was at Duck U, the KKK, Gus Hall, (American Communist Party) SDS (terrorist 'liberals') and other nut jobs managed to find their way to the free speech area in front of the Erb Memorial Union building.    Holocaust deniers in Germany can go to jail.  Those in Iran are Presidents.    Having them at Duck U will not result in the end of civilization.
I guess ISIS isn't that bad then, since the first thing ISIS does, after they murder their opponents and take-over the territory, is force all women to wear a burka.   "Nobody has a right to tell you what you can think, say, wear, view on the internet, talk about. These are fundamental human rights."  Have you not noticed that that is exactly what the Islamists do, i.e. tell you what to think, wear, view on the internet and talk about?  "The burka is about preserving femininity. It is a type of feminism to preserve the women."  That's just ludicrous.
Holy Mother Church had its collaborators during its time in Germany with Hitler. Here's the biggest one in America. It seems Abp Chaput only reason for his overwhelming support of the president is that the president is against abortion. Yes, Abortion is an absolute evil. BUT there are a whole lot more evils that this administration is perpetrating. When they starting killing Muslims bishop, are you stilling going to be singing Trump's praises, just because he claims to be against abortion? Abortion is your red herring that will send you and all of America to hell.
I find this odd. We've all grown up with the idea that politicians whitewash their words and make vague promises we don't really believe, so they present a false face that's better than who they really are. That's what we expect of politicians. The supporters believe what they say, detractors don't.   And then with Donald Trump, we have the reverse of the normal. The detractors believe what he says, and the supporters don't. When his words are mean spirited, as he lashes out against Mexicans, Muslims, women, and others; promises to deport 11 million people; suggests giving nuclear weapons to allies; or says women should be punished for having abortions, supporters say its just politics and media strategy.  The detractors believe him, but his supporters don't.   Is that true? And if so, why is it?
Because Muslims haven't been electing insane people. I count Trump, Pence, Palin, Bachmann, and a bunch of others who shouldn't be allowed on municipal councils, let alone Governorships and Presidencies. Bobby Jindal (ex-governor of Louisiana)conducted an exorcism once. He also asked Indian Americans (his ethnic group, which had generously supported his election bid) not to wear Indian outfits at his inauguration, so that his Bible thumping supporters were not upset. He is a converted Catholic, and showed more religious fanaticism than any Muslim elected official.
Why Allan, the one word I changed in my post was "Christian". And it kept getting censored, yet when I changed it to Muslim or Islam, the post wasn't censored. Isn't that amazing?  This post censored 3x already....why is "christian" a dirty word to the progressive left?
The authorities in the UK apparently knew of this person (Manchester bomber) and had been monitoring him.  This seems usual in these types of cases.  Every time, the authorities were aware of the person and were watching them to some extent.    This may be something that has to be looked at a little closer.  Perhaps instead of calling these atrocities "terrorist attacks" we might instead label them as mentally ill people, who were known to authorities, causing harm to themselves and others, which harm was preventable.  Such people probably should be involuntarily committed, for their own safety.  Instead what we have is "counter terrorism" efforts, against a person who is already dead, and a search for some sort of intelligent design or planning, for what is likely simply a mentally ill person acting in a scary and dangerous way.  We then have a specific religion singled out (in this case Islam) to describe the actions of a mentally ill person.    Food for thought.....
This is actually a salient point; especially since it is being framed as a "matter of respect" I would like to know what the local demographics are... if there really is no Muslim community in this municipality, the NIMBYs aren't the locals.
Let's do a before and after shall we?  Before the election...  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau stood by his comments comparing a requirement for Muslim women to remove their face veils during citizenship ceremonies to Canada's rejection of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany. Trudeau was pressed by reporters about accusing the sitting prime minister of fomenting bigotry following the weekly Liberal caucus meeting on Parliament Hill.  -----------------------------  After Quebecs ban...  Trudeau ‘respects’ Quebec for taking position on veil-ban but questions remain  “In Quebec and Canada we are not necessarily used to seeing a woman with a veil,” Trudeau told reporters. “That makes us uncomfortable. We wonder why she is doing that, is she required to do that?  ------------  Why anyone can support this odious little man is beyond rational comprehension.
A central pillar of Islam is that somebody who leaves their faith...an Apostate...must be shunned by their friends and family. A powerful incentive not to integrate...
I'll still take the odds of clubbing in Istanbul over clubbing in Anchorage: Occasional, large acts of violence in a city of nearly 15 million as opposed to nearly continuos violence in a city of 300,000. Glad we're a Christian nation and not a Muslim nation.
I haven't been banned for a few months so again I will pose the question as to why the Globe repeatedly offers space for the proselytization of Islam by this author? It't not like the columns are well rounded or varying in subject or content. I think that's a fair question. Someone hitting the flag button....3,2,1...
Islam is in there too...shhhhhh...Justin forgot to mention it during his press release.
I find them insufferably whiny, actually. I suppose if you buy their narrative of indignant victimhood then it's worth reading, but if you don't believe that the Muslims, socialists, transgenders, university students, mainstream media, technocrats, Soros,  etc are out to get you, then it kind of falls flat.
The funny thing is the people who you claim were  looked down on are now also doing the looking down!! === The latest quote of blasphemy for French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen ,she  has  denounced radical Islam as  “a monstrous totalitarian ideology that has declared war on our nation, on reason, on civilization,”  This is in response to the  deadly Kalashnikov attack on police officers in Paris. https://theunprogressive.com/marine-le-pen-islamism-has-declared-war-on-our-nation-on-reason-on-civilization/
The scimtar of islam is the seat of anti-christ [1 john 2:22] which has co-opted the nations in the west, and, now even the vatican.  These are flooding into Ireland strategically; logistically utilizing a surgical military precision.  Even as muslim countries continue to dictate political demands; threatening to activate terror cells within the west.  Erdogan  for example declares it will not be safe to walk the streets in Europe, the very same day Ireland was  ringing Church bells celebrating the terror in London.  [visualize a Ireland in a few years with cascading terror events; and, torture dungeons established for online horror]
"the Heritage Committee should devise a precise definition.  Questions and criticism about Islam are not Islamophobia. In fact, Muslims themselves engage in robust debates about modernity and Islamic practice.  ... Are they Islamophobic? Of course not. They are entitled to their opinion. Such a critical view is understandable, given discriminatory gender practices in some Muslim cultures. Furthermore, subordination of women is often justified by theology. We need to be able to have frank discussions without the fear of being branded an "Islamophobe."  A balance must be found between protection of free speech and protection from bigotry and hatred."  Well said, Ms. Khan. Now if only our government (and the Globe censors) agreed with that sensible view.
Jeremy Joseph Christian (b. 5/1/82) was a right wing extremist, "skinhead." He was excluded after speaking at an April Alt-right rally because of his use of racist epithets, his anti-Muslim rants, his Nazi salutes, and his carrying a baseball bat. It was hard for the "wingers" to pretend they were non-violent when he epitomized racial and religious hatred. He didn't have a gun because he had been previously convicted of and did prison time for assault, robbery and kidnap and it would have been an instant trip to the pokey on federal charges, if he had. He was a long time registered Libertarian.
Your "opinion" is pretty simplistic and not logical and quite uncivil. "your apparent fatwa envy" is not just incomprehensible but ad hominem. I used muslim because of the known "religious" beliefs of muslims that homosexuals must be killed. To date, muslims get to discriminate against anyone not muslim, whether in business or not and never get sued by the state or any gay person. No "regulation" which a state admin reg expanding on the federal "anti-discrimination law"  is, gets to violate and/or supercede the 1st amendment rights of citizens.  Your "opinion" of his business is flawed. Solely owned "corporations" are not "public" and since he is an individual owner, incorporated for tax purposes and not engaged in interstate commerce, "public accommodation" regs do not apply to him, however "against" the law you erroneously believe him to be. The baker acted on his convictions under his 1st amendment rights.
Turkey hosts 2 million Syrians, many of whom are Christian. Lebanon hosts over a million. Jordan hosts another two million. There are Sunnis, Shias, Druze, Christians, Alawites, etc in that group. I don't think the border guards only allow Muslims in to those countries.  I have lived in 4 Muslim countries, and learned to read, write and speak Arabic. Out of respect for my host country. Have you?
Slovak need to look at the many times his far-left liberal Muslim President Barack Hussein Obama has stepped over the U.S. Constitution.  What bothers me, is why the Republican party hasn't made any "noise" for calls of Obama impeachment during his tenure  like the Democrats are calling for against President Trump?  The Democrats continue to have this "hangover Presidential loss" in their mental illness attitude towards President Trump who is trying to make America great again for Americans and only Americans.  For our country, and only for our country.        The Liberals are just pist-off that our President Trump is removing all that is considered "political correctness" and into "common sense."  Obama had the homosexual colors light up in the White house, while President Trump change that lighting to blue in honor of our Police force whom Obama condemened continously during 8 years tenure.
Women have often accepted the teaching of their male religious leaders, whether Catholic, Muslim, Hindu, or other, and accepted that they were inferior and should be relegated to the back of the room, etc.  Women accepted that they were secondary to men and shouldn't have the vote or go to university or be doctors, etc., that it was their responsibility to make sure they didn't get raped.   Women accepted that Mohammed wanted them to be "modest" and not show their face or hair, or interact with unrelated men.  It took modern feminism to change that.
Its not as simple as looking at the Doctrine of Islam... Have you had a look at the Old Testament, the cornerstone of Judaism and a big part of Christianity?   My favourite is when God ordered the last 2 tribes of Israel who had not yet found a home after 40 years of wandering in the desert, to exterminate the"peaceful.... people of Laisch" ..... alas, some took pity on these people, against God's wishes, and  were punished. Reading that caused me to turn my back on "organized religion".  But  few people  subscribe  to such nonsense anymore within Judaism or Christianity...  within Islam there are  numerous elements who take primitive biblical nonsense seriously, and it seems to be far more prevalent than I had imagined...  I am possibly revising   my opinions based on the actions I  read about and the rationale advanced by those committing these acts of violence.
You're right. There are significant differences as well as similarities with Hitler, notably the lack of a coherent ideology. And as you say, Trump's inconsistent. I suppose it's an effect of ignorance, impressionability and impulsiveness. Courtiers like Bannon and Conway will have considerable influence, which is alarming. Trump does have a long history of bigotry that could become programmatic (such as the "Muslim registry"). The most striking similarity with Hitler, which inspired that article, is Trump's identification of the nation's destiny with himself. And Hitler is said to have been susceptible to flattery.  I wonder about the base. They are pretty invested in him, and they, too, are ideologically free-form, tossing conservative principle to the winds to embrace a demagogue who appalled traditional conservatives. I expect Trump'll toss some sacrificial lambs their way to keep them in line, and they'll blame their ongoing dissatisfactions on Obama.
Unbelievable. In a road rage incident an Illegal Economic migrant kills an American and the reporter implies the killing is a hate crime, orchestrated by Trump, against Muslims.
"I'm not sure what it is, but it isn't information." I think some teenage boys might disagree with you...  So I can't read/view anything at the library for entertainment?  Only strictly for 'information'?  You've made several statements above such as "A Muslim is not offensive" and "There isn't danger in a pro-gun site".  My question to you: Who gave you the authority to determine what I think is offensive or dangerous?  See, that's what the First amendment is all about.  You don't get that authority.  The First Amendment can't be abridged by "common sense".  Just like the Second Amendment, the First Amendment can be twisted into some really distorted and senseless meanings.  Example: public protests at military funerals like what those asshats at Hillsboro Baptist Church were doing.  That said, I don't condone porn in public spaces and support the librarians.
U.S. Defense Secretary Mattis,  Do the Democrats of the Democratic Republic of North Korea believe that they can survive a Nuclear War, can their Under Mountain Cities built using Prison Camp Labor withstand the current U.S. Nuclear Weapons.  We know what happened with the Muslim Nation of Iran, allowed by Obama to create ICBMs, proven after Iran launched some into space orbit, what makes the Democratic Republic of North Korea any different, as far as U.S. Actions and the Results.  Will the U.S. Nuclear attack the Muslim Nation of Iran's Under Mountain Cities with multiple nuclear attacks at the same location to dig down to get to them, to destroy their new 21st Century Nuclear Centrifuges, IRBMs, MRBMs, ICBMs.  What actions is the U.S. going to do, to stop anybody from obtaining the Nation of Niger's Highest Grade of Uranium Ore.  Three dead U.S. Army Special Forces.  Al Quada Niger and Obama's Supported "Islamic Democracy Movement"  aka Islamic State Sahel are there.  continued.
Muslim bakeries aren't following American law.  You should file a lawsuit against them.
This is touted as "priority for Christians" - even by Trump and the White House, but reading the text of the order, it says “Upon the resumption of USRAP [US Refugee Admissions Program] admissions, the secretary of state, in consultation with the secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual’s country of nationality.”  So the order doesn't actually give priority to Christians - just religious minorities.  I wonder if it will apply to minority islamic sects (of which there are many) who face persecution.  I also wonder if it will apply outside of the 7 countries, to the persecuted islamic minorities in China, Burma, the Philippines and other places?
Bill, that's an important question. Obviously I can't and would never say that you or anybody else I've never met is or isn't racist. However, to answer your question as a liberal, the problem is that we see clear patterns of behavior and thought, frequently repeated. We see speaking in code. We see rationalizations for a Muslim ban, a wall, and multiple incidents of people in authority being much tougher on people of color than on whites, for example. This is all wrapped up in case-specific arguments. But show me somebody who likes Trump, approves of a Muslim ban, criticizes BLM, disapproves of DACA, and equates Antifa to KKK and nazis, and I'll say there's a very high likelihood that this person is a racist bigot. No proof, but when we see the whole package, we certainly suspect. And it's a generalization, nothing specific to you, because I've never met you.
"reduce government spending."  His plans are to increase Government spending - Just rounding up all the illegals and documenting all the Muslims will be huge, massive.
So with all these liberal post on here, are you guys saying we all have to kneel now for Muslim inequality and open borders .?
The issue is, "Does the President's Executive Order meet Constitutional Muster?"  The answer is YES.  Notice how the FakeNews.com God and all of his zombies try everything they can to stay away from that question.  "SEE? IT'S A MUSLIM BAN.  IT'S A TRAVEL BAN."  Man, this brings back the campaign all over again.  Lots of weeping and gnashing of teeth on the horizon.
Colorado is full of conservatives, it's one of the largest homes of veterans. And you'd be surprised how many are closet conservatives nowadays with liberals attempting to bring fantastical concepts such as "celebrating LGBT Islam" to the forefront of their party's platform...
They got it all wrong. These are different times and a different scenario. Are we banging on every Muslim door in the US today? Donald's banning Travel from anti-American Muslim Countries. You have to be screened thoroughly to travel to the US if at all from there. BIG difference today with the lesson learned from '41. These pc Liberals are so sheltered in Hawaii. I wonder what they'd think being in the WTC in 911 or having lived, born and raised in the Mideast. She should live in the Chicago Hood and feel the everyday experience of the "at the wrong place at the wrong time" gangbanging hood which could be on any street or home she'd reside in. Another Story spewing a false narrative from the Liberal SA Media
Thank Fox News, Breitbart, stormfront, Infowars, am radio and my crazy Uncle Larry for spreading conspiracies and fake news for years.   That's pretty negative and why we are so divided as a country.  The difference now is that it's our actual intelligence agencies that have been uncovering  these lies and connections.  Benghazi, IRS, Fast and Furious, pizzagate, climategate, False Flags, Planned Parenthood, acorn, Jade Helm, plan 21, Hillary's emails, Hillary's Health, Vincent Foster, Seth rich, coming to get your guns, Whitewater, Clinton Foundation, uranium, New Black Panthers, birth certificate, death panels, presidents a Muslim, crowd size, popular vote, george soros, illegals voting, president wiretapping, william ayres, reverend wright, etc.  All conflated into conspiracies to get people to blame and Hate because trickle down economics, anti-science and pro discrimination are a hard sell to the general populace.
Of course you like your own post, Let me tell you - after all, how many people manage to sneak in a coy 'Obama's a secret muslim' dig?
No one in the Prime Minister's office was thrilled about paying Khadr $10 million. No one. Not the prime minister, not the attorney general, not a single government official could have been happy about paying him a single penny, let alone a billion of them.  So we can safely bet that the decision to make the payment — and issue the apology that comes with it — was based on the best legal advice available.  At the end of the day, it’s likely a far better deal for the taxpayer than what might have come out of a trial.   So no one should think we’re paying Omar Khadr because he’s a good guy. We’re not paying him because anyone in the Government of Canada subscribes to the hateful views his family have propagated through the perversion of Islam. We’re paying him because we’re a country governed by laws — where we all have rights, or none of us do.
Let's talk about 'homegrown terrorist'.  The news is starting to come out that the shooter had been a frequent visitor to that gay nightclub.  He'd done extensive posting on various known gay social sights.........wait......wanting to 'hook up'.  Many of those who'd known him......knew he was struggling w/his own sexuality.    I can imagine the pain this murderer was going thru.  Perhaps there were extreme homophobic attitudes w/in his family.  Society has been angry and combative towards the transgender bathrooms for those who identify w/a sexuality other than who they were at birth.  In 1978, Harvey Milk gave a speech on LGBT and it's worth a listen.  He was murdered you know, for being a gay man.  So the FBI now have phones that were freely given by patrons of Pulse that back up their claims (and they were the closest to this murderer) that all of this death  was not Islamic based, nor was it about religion.  I am humbled and so sad that a homophobic society is still thriving. l2g
The "relevance" of our Lord's "message to islam is that there is no salvation outside of the Catholic Church.
In the quest for truth every question and statement needs to be simplified to its most unambiguous form. The truth becomes apparent.  The premise of this statement is that "every Muslim wants to drag us back to bad times".  There is no evidence or logic supporting that statement. It is simply a misdirection towards fear.  Immigration resolves conflicts between peoples when truth is valued. That is what drives good Constitutions.  Conflict comes from anywhere truth isn't valued.
Just update your facts, Canadians are not allowed to immigrate to the middle east if you are Christian even fellow Muslims from Paksitan are given a hard time in Saudi Arabia. Canadians work in that area. Next Europe Greece, Italy has been so called civilized for over 3000 years. Northern Europe since 900 AD which would be over 1200 years not the 600 years. Over wise yes China and India had superior culture before Western Europe. The problem was it became stagnet and did not grow any further. Muslims (Arabs) came to the Sub Continent of India and converted Pakistan, Afgan and parts of India to the Muslim faith. This happened in the 10 century. Question is why did India and Pakistan give up its culture and religion to the Arab invaders?
Trudeau, his family and a few friends spent the New Year as the guest of the Aga Khan on the religious leader’s private island in the Bahamas.The Aga Khan, who is the spiritual guide of the world’s 15 million Ismaili Muslims.  He converted after all.
On 11 October 2017 the Supreme Court tossed out an appeals court ruling that struck down Trump’s temporary travel ban targeting eight Muslim-majority nations that are known terrorist hotbeds.   It signified that Trump and his administration had been within the law and the Constitution when taking action to protect America. The Justices were unanimous in their ruling in a case from Maryland brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued to stop the ban.  Trump 1, Travel Ban challengers 0.  I can’t imagine Judge Chuang’s issuing a ruling different from the Supreme Court’s ruling on a very similar case.  It will be Trump 2, Travel Ban challengers 0.
Gene, the democrats are not in charge.  The republicans are.  Even here in Alaska. Second, the nation was not founded on Judeo/Christian principals.  Third, when Obama was elected he was accused of being everything from the AntiChrist to a Muslim operative.  Fourth, Hillary never said she was against Christianity.
"Are you equally outraged at whomever it was who instigated the Portland nutburger with their "message" of anti-Muslim hatred? " Hmmm; according to the MSM accounts of the Portland slasher's background , he was a staunch supporter of Bernie and Jill's candidacy for the Highest Office in the Land. Maybe his "listening", in some part,prompted his behavior?
Trump To Do List:   1. Eliminate"Deep State"   2. Stop Chemtrails   3. Close FEMA Concentration Camps in abandon WalMart   4. Expose 3 million illegal voters   5. Give back all firearms confiscated by Obama.   6. Prove Obama a foreign born muslim   7. Lock her up   8. Provide best Healthcare (this will be easy)
The best advice that Obama gave Trump when they first met was "Words matter". Well Trumps words seem to have prevented his second attempt at a travel ban disguised as a Muslim ban. Why is it so important for Trump to initiate a ban anyway? The United States border has always been well protected and monitored. After 9/11 attacks,  the scrutiny at the border was greater than it had ever been. If you had a muslim/middle eastern sounding name you were automatically flagged at the border. I've seen it so many times since 2001. Brown looking family gets hauled in and questioned by border security. Nobody gets upset and no one is surprised by this.  Trump has failed to feed into the negative stereotype of his followers. For now. Yet Trump has no issue doing business in Saudi Arabia. Where's the integrity?
Calm down liberals. Trump isn't going to trample on women's rights, civil rights, gay rights, or implement slavery........after all..... he isn't practicing radical islam
One of the few things that Muslim scholars and Jewish scholars have agreed on is that the Berbers are the people of Goliath.  Those folks were living in Canaan when Bani Israel arrived.  When I get time I'll find the passages in Genesis that acknowledge the Arabs were already there when Bani Israel moved in.
Aaronavilla, you say “Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon (rushed the race-motivated muslim ban EO that was shot down by the courts for being unconstitutional within a week).”  From where did you get your information?  Oh, wait, I know, it was from a CNN report.  Great source. It is your opinion that they rushed the EO and that it is a race-motivated Muslim ban.  Let me correct what I just wrote. I do not believe it is your opinion; I believe you simply are parroting what the anti-Trump media says.  It may interest you to know the EO was not shot down by the courts for being unconstitutional. The court’s ruling applies only to immigrants who were already in the U.S. or on their way here when Trump signed the EO.  The ruling does not affect other aspects of the EO and does nothing for the thousands of refugees overseas from several terror-prone countries with coincidentally have Muslim majorities.  The legal battles are not over and I believe Trump’s ultimately prevail.   More to follow.
Dear Muslims;  Welcome to the community of progressive left wing religious intolerance.  You are joining a group of Christians, Catholics and Jewish who for decades have been shunned, scorned, ridiculed, mocked and marginalized by the secular progressive community in Canada.  These leftwing progressives have worked very hard to shut down religion and religious practice in public spaces and public institutions.  So this act of inclusion, by joining this prestigious club of the hated, will help support your struggle that so many religions in Canada have experienced before you.     Pay no attention to our social justice leaders, who are using tragedies to ram though pet personal agendas that seek to further divide through inequality and prioritizing which religions are more important then others.  Stay strong, be of good courage and you will succeed beyond the hate.   Thank You;  Freedom of Religion
Obama: Russia elected Trump.  Trump: Obama is a Muslim Kenyan.  Ain't America great?
You're quite right, Chuckunfiltered, but so you don't get misconstrued as biased, be an equal opportunity anti-religionist. The ideas you oppose here are in Christian and Judaist ideological DNA too. Christianity has simply had more time to adapt to Western secularism. It will come, with Islam. Especially since such apps allow people to look for other less controlled individuals. :) Technology always carries liberating and oppressive possibilities.
Regarding: "They categorized the continued displacement of Christians from the Middle East as "a genocidal project, a humanitarian catastrophe and a plague of the earth's civilization."" - In every way the Muslims in the USA must assist in easing the persecution of non-Muslim religions in these lands. - Men and women of good will, Muslims, Jews, and Christians all must work to free the lands for the exercise of the 4 freedoms, especially for the freedom of worship / religion, and the freedom to congregate.
Does Borg or Kung believe in the Virgin Birth of Jesus, which is what Muslims believe?
The cartoon you posted on and what your are insinuating in your comment.  Two died on a Portland train defending a young Muslim woman.  AM radio and Fox pump out fear and loathing at an alarming rate. A Muslim girl gotten beaten to death in VA this past week but no one says anything about that. A black soldier was murdered in Maryland and it is being investigated as a hate crime.   The "Democrat" was an angry white man and domestic abuser who shouldn't have been able to buy a gun.   Alex Jones says HRC was a demon.  Coulter said NYC would be better without Jewish people.  Palin put targets on people's heads in a flyer. Trump invited Nugent to the white house.  Spare me with the pearl clutching.
My son shouldn't have to be afraid during THOSE Muslim prayers at school either.
It's better if it isn't tied to a religion.  Would you want a Muslim orginazation?
I only wish America could recognize the threat fundamental Islam represents.  The PRIMARY concern and edict for all Muslims is to convert or kill All of the infidels. Unfortunately, there are two types of Muslims (shiite & sunni) and each think the other infidels. So you don't just have to be a muslim you have yo be the RIGHT kind of muslim and  THAT depends on where you are at. That's wack.
Some Christian and Muslim regimes were more tolerant than others, depending on a host of political and social factors. Trying to say Christianity was intrinsically worse than Islam  is silly.  What made Christianity dangerous was when it became a state religion in a time of conquests.  Islam intrinsically is *supposed* to be a state religion, its leader led conquests and advocated them himself. Not so Jesus or his early disciples.  Judaism was nonviolent when Jews were tiny minorities, as soon as they got a chance, they also made their religion the state religion and entered into wars of conquest.
Those above principles I hold myself. Remove Millions of People who came here ILLEGALLY.  Admitting we fundamentally have a problem with the radical tenants of the Islamic ideology (it doesn't jive with freedoms, it adheres to complete control and forces submission on a global scale and desires to wipe out infidels, anyone who does not believe and submit), I don't think AC units are the biggest threat to the globe, when we are facing Iran with nukes (brilliant idea that was!) and other serious threats and that why expanding torture isn't a bad idea when you look at methods used by those savages in Isis, beheading children, drowning and burning people alive in cages, and Heaven forbid, we make people hold up their end of agreements! We need strong leadership that gives the finger to Politically Correctness which paves the way to not addressing the real issues for fear of offending someone. Done with this liberal nonsense. Wake up and smell the Coffee.
I am with Ibbotson on this.  Ms. Payette's transgression is serious.  And it is even more serious that neither she nor the prime minister can see it.    Ms Payette needs to learn, and fast, that being GG does not give you the right to pontificate on the beliefs of others and insult the significant minority of Canadians with strong religious beliefs - Christians, Jews, Muslims and others should not be mocked by their GG.  Lesson #1 for all incoming GG's. It is not about you. It is about Canada.
I just can't imagine why such hatred for muslims. Look how well they have integrated in Europe. In Germany the muslims were giving free hugs to hundreds of women during New Years celebrations. Britain is another success story. Rotherham UK is so happy with the co mingling between Britons and Muslims they banned all the islamophobes and far right groups from even entering parts of the city. In Edmonton, Alberta the muslims have integrated so well that some have embraced the mixed sex swimming pools. Something that would be forbidden in most muslim countries. So before you form an opinion just look at all the success stories out there.
Your obsession with "single parenthood" as the source of western society's problems is interesting, Sher. A previous comment of yours pointing out that in Muslim societies there is "zero chance" of that happening indicates you consider the radical restrictions on women necessary for that to be a good thing. Your defence of "family values" at all cost, even women's freedom,  makes the most conservative evangelical sound like a raving feminist.  Yes, "the west" has always taken for granted that women would participate fully in social life, even at the risk of their getting pregnant "illicitly", unlike societies where women were kept secluded to prevent that possibility.   Cultures with strong values of family, discipline, hard work, education, respect for authority and hierarchy, desire for social status and social respect through economic and educational success, etc., do very well in the west, their cultures are very compatible with ours, those are not the issue.
And how does that explain Muslims killing Muslims???
Just as we do with all other Hate Acts by an individual, label the driver. But don't label everyone. it is like saying the former National Guard soldier Mohamed Jalloh represents all of the Muslims. No. Not even close.    https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/national-guard-soldier-isis-plot-fort-hood
I think the term originated with the idea that the information itself wasn't wrong, but that it gave an incorrect impression. Like I might say, "Ten Muslims were killed by a subway bomber today," which implies that Muslims were the target, when 100 non-Muslims were also killed.  Or another example might be, "It's 100 degrees today!" which implies that's very hot, when in reality it's normal for this time of year at that location.
These conversation often turn into a debate listing past historical centuries old offenses from less progressive eras. The vast majority of Muslims are ordinary people of good will concerned about their children and friends having a better life. The terrorists are a small segment of people claiming to be Muslims. They have an old theocratic empire version of Islam, and are willing to use violence to achieve that goal. This was well discussed in Islam and the Future of Tolerance: A Dialogue by Harris and Nawaz. Snipets of the book  are available at Google Books:  https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&id=9mZSrgEACAAJ&q=theocracy#v=onepage&q=percent&f=false
And by "pro-family" you mean "anti-American Christian and Islamic hate groups which are abjectly Republican."
I don't have a problem with Canada helping any disenfranchised group anywhere.Especially gays in a Muslim-majority country.I just wonder if Trudeau's motives are purely altruistic or just another underhanded ploy to garner a bigger chunk of the gay vote in 2019?
This is not true. Christianity is not banned. Anyone can ask to have their Christian beliefs accommodated. What has been dropped is Christian rites as part of the official curriculum. And the Muslims aren't asking to be part of the official curriculum.
Duke you didn't see the latest new, Trump is saying its not a Muslim Ban, its just temporary to fix the screening process. Also UK PM May went straight to Turkey to sign a 100 million defence deal. Last time I checked Turkey is a Muslim majority country. So much for theWest syaing no to Islam.  The bigots are out in Full force today.
A)  Traditional Islam permits polygyny   B)  For every traditional Islamic male with four wives there are three Islamic males with no wives C)  Most radicalized young men have been raised in traditional Islamic households or in communities with a traditional Islamic culture D) Some influential Koranic teachers suggest that death encountered advancing Islam offers a next life with multiple brides - as virtually all male behavior is directed by attempts to maximize reproductive encounters with reproductively viable young women it is not hard to connect the dots - just look at the sexual slavery within ISIS camps and at the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping in Nigeria
Your comments demonstrate your own bigotry towards Jews, Muslims, and certain Christians when you state that "Freedom of Religion in Eugene appears to be applicable primarily to the Christian religions of a particular class (which class?) and, currently, to the Jewish and Muslim religions."
I hope he is also fighting against Westaphobia, and the continued killings of western people by Islam.
We can talk about Islamophobia as long as the writer agrees to an open, candid dialogue regarding what it is about Islam that so appeals to lunatics bent on murder and mass destruction. It is time to face the vastly more difficult questions first, Shaista.
I've considered (and attended services) of Catholic, Lutheran, Episcopalian, Unitarian, Baptist (at least four kinds) , Jehovah Witness, LDS, Church of Christ, Church of the Nazarene, and several other Christian denominations whose names I do not recall.  I've studied a little of the theology and beliefs of Judaism,  Zen Buddhist, Tantric Yoga, Muslim (Sunni, Shi'a and Sufi), and Hindu faiths.    None of that journey showed me that "all spiritual roads lead to Jesus".
Funny, I'm trying to imagine him being allowed to pontificate on his beliefs before the legislature if he was a Muslim, too.  Same page, different book?
The problem of defining 'Islamophobia' should never have arisen. It began as a palpable effort to limit the rights of Canadians, including Canadian Muslims, to criticise a specific religion. This should never have come to a vote in Parliament. The right to freedom of thought and speech should have remained paramount, and should have stopped the motion in its tracks. The fact that it did not demonstrates the inability of the present government to respect the rights of Canadians. There are lots of reasons for criticising any religion, and no religion should be explicitly protected by any motion of the Canadian Parliament. Islam should not be protected by any motion or law other than laws that already exist regarding hate speech. There is no such thing as Islamophobia, as the failed efforts to define it testify. M103 should be struck from the books, without further consideration. Put the matter to sleep once and for all.
Ms Kahn's primary complaint seems to be based on the fact that we are not all Muslims. If she had her way, we would be.
(most effective way to prevent radicalization starts at the community level) No. To prevent radicalization government has to stop interfering in Muslim countries. Note that every western country which has been attacked by Muslims had previously attacked Muslims. I would put the start with the taking over of land in Palestine. That was an attack on Muslims. They retaliated. No matter how justified the Jewish people were in taking land in Palestine, they should expect retaliation.  (Ms. Freeland concluded by saying that Canada stands “shoulder to shoulder” with Israel and supports its right to its security and to live in peace). That of course is an impossibility in its current position, with porous borders providing access to Israel`s enemies world wide.
Who benefits? Hint: It ain't the Muslim community or European international social plurality. One could even say that this plays directly into UKIP's profoundly wicked and disingenuous hands and strategy, just like the last 'incident' before the British vote a few months ago. Hmm!
My heart goes out to all of the victims and their families.  Unfortunately there are people who think that being anything but not straight is the worst thing you can do, so they don't think the slaughter is that horrible.   On the other hand, there are people convinced that this is an act of terrorism and that means that everyone who is Muslim, etc is a criminal that deserves punishment.   Hate results in tragedy. Please don't let this tragedy turn into more generic discrimination. This was a sick person who would've done something horrible no matter what. His victims and his background do not define the problem.   We should be mourning as a nation. We can't figure out how to deal with all of these competing opinions...gun control, sexual orientation, religion, terrorism. Try to respect each other, even if we disagree.
Obviously NBC "News" has entered Bizarro world with this Tweet which completely distorts the facts:  NBC News PR  ✔@NBCNewsPR "Can you rule out a registry for Muslims?" asks @ChuckTodd.   "I'm not going to rule out anything..." says @Reince on @MeetThePress #MTP 4:09 AM - 20 Nov 2016  The actual comment was as follows:  "Look I'm not going to rule out anything, we're not going to have a registry based on a religion. But what I think what we're trying to do is say that there are some people, certainly not all people... there are some people that are radicalized. And there are some people that have to be prevented from coming into this country."  Not all fake news comes from Macedonia...
"Approval" is not "completion." The Dakota pipeline has its own legal battles to clear. Courts can stop the wall as fast as it stopped the Muslim ban. Trump is powerless over court decisions. Environmental laws do have to be followed despite Trump's pandering.
The recent story of CNN staging a false Muslim protest vs ISIS in London is a prime example.  The media for the most part has degenerated into a propaganda machine intent on control of the minds of the people. As such they seek to enslave humanity.  They need to be treated as the enemy of the people.
I first read Ayaan Hirsi Ali with an open mind. But something was fishy about her narrative and conclusions, and with more reading I found out about her poor track record...a pathological pattern of lying and manipulation. I'm not saying she's wrong about everything she's written, but she just is NOT a reliable source; aside from her personal dishonesty, she employs a number of logical fallacies in her writing.   If you are genuinely interested in Islam and its sociological impact, find better sources. If they either praise or condemn Islam in absolutist terms, the source is rubbish, move on. If anyone believes they have legitimate concerns about Islam and genuinely wants to discuss it online, you won't be elevating the conversation any or convincing discerning readers by using disreputable sources like Ali. It's unfortunate some high profile thought leaders jumped on her bandwagon at a critical time, lending her the appearance of credibility to continue her disinformation campaign.
We are different. We are not killing others because they are not adherents to our religious beliefs. When you are dealing with scum like this, you cannot show them any mercy. They would not show you any if the tables were reversed. Learn from history.  When the last time the Islamic fundamentalists went on a jihad against the West, they were stopped by Christian warriors who were not afraid to be as merciless as they were.  The thing that history shows us about these islamic fundamentalist is that they see being merciful as weakness. This is part of the culture.  You do not give them an inch, no matter what.
I am not trying 'so hard' as accepting the facts of the ORIGINAL STORY that Ms.Flowers wrote above all this back-and-forth. The victims of the Holocaust, primarilly (though not only) Ashkenazi Jews had nowhere else to go. They established themselves in Israel and protected themselves in so doing.  You do not ask permission to survive.  You can argue about what Scripture says till the cows come home. Ultimately you can justify anything through Scripture. I take it as a great comfort that so many Israelis (according to you are atheists). My reaction: "Can you blame them?"  They have built a nation with Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Ba'hai, Agnostic, Atheist elements and races that encompass Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardi Jews, Arabs, Armenians, Africans, Hispanics (yes!). They have world class science centers and educational institutions there open to all. The idea of putting someone on trial for heresy is laughable in that environment.  I hope they defend the hell out of it.
Why do they keep going on about the fact that he was "white"?  Is that some kind of code for "not muslim"?  Surely the Canadian media are aware that  Canada has seen terrorist attacks carried out in St Jean Richelieu by a white man who was a muslim convert, and that many young "white men" have converted and joined ISIS.  If this perp is christian or otherwise not muslim, just say so.
If a Muslim or a foreigner overseas commits murder in the name of his or her religious views, we call the Muslim or foreigner a terrorist. But, if a Christian man commits murder in the name of "saving the babies", we call him crazy. Why the double standard? From the moment he was captured, Mr. Dear has said he committed the crime. He has said abortion is murder, and that he committed the crime to "save the babies". He has had to do this while being told to shut up, and while the authorities in El Paso County -- home of a huge number of conservative Christian organizations -- insist he must be crazy. Who are the El Paso County officials protecting? Are they concerned that if Robert Dear pleads guilty and is allowed to make a statement justifying his action, people will see what the logical end result of constantly pronouncing that abortion is murder and calling abortion doctors murderers is? Let Mr. Dear plead guilty. Let this pro-life true believer speak. Then imprison him for life.
Merkel Is done, like burnt toast, allowing over one million Muslim refugees stream into a Western Culture is beyond reason...!
Your first reference which is completely incredible fake news supports your anti muslim narrative, However your second reference completely contradicts your first reference saying at this time there is no evidence of him taking a muslim name and starting a internet account. If the NRA stopped working as hard as they can to ensure there are absolutely no gun regulations, and the republicans stopped making sure there where no funds for the few regulatory departments we have to do their job, things like this would not happen. Society has dropped the ball on gun regulation, and mental illness. Your solution seems to be to do nothing other than spread hate and anti muslim messages. Typical Religious cognitive Dissonance.
No threat to secularism. Ya right. Have a look at Europe. Every person studying the rise of Islam in the West has concluded that they do not assimilate.   Is the Globe not only making comments less user friendly but also making it impossible to type for a reaon. Wy dontyou just kill comments and gt it ove with. You rally don't want t har othr vies
You should have no difficulty answering those questions yourself. Critical analysis, including satire and comedy, of Islamic beliefs, customs, and politics is absolutely fair game. However critical analysis, by definition, must be balanced. Otherwise it's neither an analysis nor a critique. It's just a screed, a condemnation of an entire group of people by focusing on negative traits that all peoples share.  The worst examples of genocide and crimes against humanity were all preceded by a certain form of "critical analysis."  What was lacking in those analyses was balance, and a fundamental commitment to the equality and humanity of all people.  Whether it's a phobia- an extreme and irrational fear; or anti-Muslim bigotry- ie, prejudicial beliefs about all Muslims, that's a proper thing for the government to speak out against. The government should do the same were any other identifiable group being targeted. Indeed it has on occasions that fell far short of six people being murdered.
Shocking numbers. The government has deliberately drained the nation's savings to bailout the economy after the crash. And now, they hope importing Muslims and Africans will juice the economy. Based on Europe's experience, they will be disappointed. A balance needs to be struck again. A radical downsizing of the public sector is required so that taxes can come down and people can have more money to save. It is taxes the are taking the money that could have been saved.
This temporary banning of people from these countries is misguided.  but Trump's opposition is clearly fanning the flames of outrage by calling it a "Muslim Ban".  If it was in fact a Muslim ban then Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan would have all been included.  (less then 10% of the World's Muslim population is included in the ban) They weren't.   so NO it's NOT a "Muslim Ban". It's still not a good strategy.... but the hysterical reaction isn't helping anything. This is all just Trump theater.
This is coming to Canada eventually. The number of muslims who believe the women was wrong to wear the skirt  is growing and there is nothing any politician, feminist  or newspaper   can or will do to defend a woman's rights to dress as she wishes .
I'm struggling to understand what your comment has to do with the article  The article gave an update on hate crimes, and noted hate crimes against Muslims increased last year  How does your comment relate to this?  Are you somehow disagreeing?  I don't know even know what you're trying to say.
So you're saying that even when people are being targeted for a specific human trait- be it their race, or sexuality or anything else, the government shouldn't address that matter directly. Instead it should issue a generic plea for everyone to play nice.  So when gays are being targeted and murdered, the government shouldn't condemn violence against gays. And if Jews were being targeted and murdered, the government shouldn't condemn anti-Semitism. No matter how bad it gets against a specific group, you feel the government should just issue a bland statement against discrimination of any kind.  I believe that's insufficient. When we see violence and hatred directed against gays we condemn violence and hatred towards gays, while denouncing discrimination in general. When we see Jews being targeted by violence and hatred we condemn violence and hatred against Jews, while denouncing all forms of discrimination. That's what M-103 does concerning violence and hatred towards Muslims.
Start with proper perspective : . Terrorists kill about 38 Americans/year. Lightning kills about 50 Americans/year. . By contrast, there are 31,000 US gun deaths/year (i.e., 85/day). There is a mass shooting (4+ dead)/week. . Terrorism does not die because we kill terrorists.  It dies when nobody wants to replace the dead terrorist leaders.  Drying up the supply of recruits is about ideology, not SWAT teams. . More important, Saudi Arabia is the source of the ideology, and the money. . Terrorism thrives on injustice. If you would have justice, you must do justice yourself. Remove the injustice. . Establishing secular democracy in Saudi is the first step to ending Islamic terrorism.  Until we face that truth, nothing else matters. . Until then, . The best defense is relentless, firm, patient defense of civil liberties and democratic institutions. . Second best is in ending dependence on oil: No oil = no money. No money = no terrorism. . Third best is drying up internet radicalisation.
You obviously haven't been to the Middle East.  Diversity has a very different meaning when we are talking about the Middle East. It isn't another part of Europe George.   When you go to the Middle East one of the first things you find out is just how much our Canadian (and Western) values are actually despised and completely rejected. They are happy to take the free money, accommodation, and education for life... but will not buy into the idea of Canada. forget Women's rights, gay rights, secular government, or the rights of their daughters. Period. Forget any real integration.   In other words, we will be used.   If you don't believe me then get the facts. Read the Casey Report out of the UK. Read the PEW Centre polling data on attitudes in the Middle East and for Muslims in the West.. Read the reports on the experiences in Australia, France, Germany, and the UK.  There isn't much positive....and there are huge warning signs.
There appears to be some confusion between mandating universal participation in religious events (the Lord's Prayer, Christmas and Easter events) for all students as opposed to simply accommodating specific students' needs for their religious practices (prayer rooms).  I would oppose any attempt to mandate religious participation by all students in any public school. On the other hand, I see no reason not to allow students (Muslim, Christian, Jewish, whatever) to use an unoccupied classroom as a place for prayer.  I don't see what is accomplished by screaming at others or throwing a temper tantrum. Religious accommodation has no impact on the greater student body and is largely unnoticed by people who do not participate. If Christian or Jewish students request an equally reasonable religious accommodation and it does not get approved, I will happily protest with you.  Up to now, I've seen no rational reason to oppose this accommodation except naked religious hatred.
Richard, the Charter applies to all levels of governments - local as well as provincial and federal.  It applies to zoning bylaws as much as federal, provincial and territorial legislation.  There is a significant amount of evidence about the involvement of a single-issue (anti-muslim) group La Meute (the Wolf Pack) in the referendum.  In other words, yes there was evidence of an attack on freedom of religion, one of Canada's fundamental rights.  That would be why Julius Grey, one of Quebec and Canada's leading constitutional lawyers, thinks the Islamic Centre would probably win a court challenge of the Saint-Apollinaire referendum, if it chose to file one.  See:      http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/st-apollinaire-mayor-wont-reopen-debate-over-muslim-cemetery
If I cared about getting religion out of school, I'd start with the Catholic School Board, not a prayer club. To me, this is where the "keep religion out of school" argument falls down. I don't see anyone showing up at Catholic School Board meetings to tear up bibles and scream insults.  This isn't about religious accommodation. This is about people who hate Islam.
Not an argument.  - But i'll give you some more examples: In the east women are not taken seriously by courts and in the west men are not taken seriously. In Canada female circumcision is abhorrent but male circumcision is 'healthy.'  The West is Christian and the East is Muslim, similar religions a with a staunch 'book of rules.'
The comments about Muslims being rejected for their clothing and skin color really are a play to the lowest common denominator of society. Entire populations are now wary of Muslims for the simple reason that in many cases they bring attitudes that still belong in the stone ages, and all the hand-over-heart, hand wringing and finger pointing by illogical liberals has run its course.  They are now quickly becoming unwelcome as the public wakes up the fact they are living through another social engineering experiment courtest of the left. Again.
Your ignorance is showing. That was written in 1836 by Chief Justice Joseph Story. Islam was known as mohammedism in various spellings and muslims were known as mosselmen in 1802. At the Time of the Founding, Roman Catholicism was not in favor, as it was part of (though split from) the theocracy of the British Empire, one of the main reasons the Revolution was fought, since Protestants fled to the New World for religious freedom. It was the theocracy and pope and rule from Rome the Founders rejected, hence the quote from Justice Story in 1836 in his still revered in law schools Commentaries on the Constitution.
You Mean things were  peaceful before the rohingya Muslims decided to illegally enter Myanmar. Now Myanmar wants them gone again after the crime has increased. I have a friend who works in around that area of Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand. He's seen an increase in Muslim religion there and says there definitely bad news. Crimes go up and they have zero respect for the land and culture. They entered illegally and now should be forced out in silence. Enough of this persecuted BS we have to listen too. They entered illegally and made a mockery of laws and order, time to be punished.
1. I did list several, which are ones I listed easily since he became president. Did you not read? Seriously?  2. Obama and Clinton have nothing to do with what we're talking about here. I don't hold blind 100% allegiance to any candidate (like you seem to). I have plenty of criticisms about Obama and Clinton. But in regards to them – neither are pathological liars, which Trump literally is. Obama and Clinton didn't lie about objective reality, easily debunked statistics, make baseless claims, or lie about where they were or things they said within days or weeks of the events. I'm only referring to his behavior since becoming president!  We're talking about a man who says "We need a ban on all Muslims" and then months later says "This isn't a Muslim ban". That is a flat out lie - or at the very least the most toxic form of political spin I have ever encountered. The video I linked to has Rudy Giuliani saying "Trump came to me and asked how can we do a Muslim ban legally?"
If the country adopts Shari'a Law after the Muslims become the majority, absolutely!  And all those LGBT people will be beheaded when identified.  Examine the Criminal Code and the executions in Saudi Arabia for a preview.
Funny how Aziz doesn't mention talking about Muslims who kill non Muslims in London Paris Brussels and more - as Muslim Privilege, hate and what have you. You can tell she works for Al Jazeera as her world view is distorted - BTW islamaphobia is NOT seen in the west - no one fears it - people are rejecting it in their countries precisely because of attitudes like Aziz.
The alt-left protestors are America's version of radical Islamic terrorism.  And Hillary supports them .... http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/04/politics/clinton-pac-resistance-trump/
They did surveys back just after 9/11 to find how many Muslims supported Osama bin Laden. the percentage was surprisingly high. Ditto the percentage of Muslims who did not like the US.   This support for "freedom fighters" has always been strong among indigenous people everywhere subjected to invasions, oppression, colonization, torture, occupations, etc. (The Irish Catholics in Northern Ireland, The Spanish (and their North American supporters) in the fight against Franco's Fascists in Spain, etc.)   Don't expect this bit about Be-Nice-To-Muslims and take a Muslim to tea to stop freedom fighters who want occupying forces to leave their countries of origin and stop killing their family back home.
zuglo9, I too come across younger and older muslims, many ordinary people, what worries, is most of them , regardless of education, accept and pursue the implement of Islam and their own culture. I don't know to what extent you interact with them, but mine had brought me to their intent. You either don't mind or should question as to the future political-cultural change coming to Canada.
Thank you for writing the truth and shaming the "Joseph Goebbels propaganda Washington Post machine".  Next story please: why is Jew Jeff Bezo's, who owns the Washington Post and Amazon, supporting ISIS and Islamic terrorists?  All who vow to kill Jews and wipe Israel off the map?  Same with many in the mainstream media, especially CNN owned/run by Jew Jeff Zucker.   What is it with these Jews who want harm to come to Israel?
"According to the annual Ipsos poll, Perils of Perception, Canadians think that Muslims make up 17 per cent of Canada’s population. The reality is far lower, at 3 per cent."  Poll questioning is subject to bias too, babe.
I do not support this Pope either.  I always joke my Pope is German.  This Pope wants to be a politician more than a spiritual leader.  His latest comments saying their is no Muslim Terrorist, that it is just the poor(caused by global warming) are the problem.  Then he said in the next sentence that even though the science is skewed by ideology and pre concieved notions, that you still have to accept it.  Mother Church will be awaiting with open arms, when this Globalist Leftist uprising is squashed and spirituality once again becomes the focus Your are welcomed back anytime
The uncomfortable truth is that outside of the western world, western style dating is frowned upon.  This article showcases an Islamic dating app, but it is the norm in many non-western countries too. There are many for Christians and Hindus in India, where most marriages are arranged. The profiles of suitors are in many cases setup by the parents who choose. Such apps also make navigating cultural nuances with pan-religious/ethnic groups easy. For example, Hindu dating apps allow for specification of caste. Islamic dating apps allow specification of language, since many languages are represented in the pan-Islamic world.  In such cultures, asking a soul mate out for dinner or for a movie is a great way to alienate oneself from his/her family, and possibly, even killed. This conservatism is more prevalent in Islamic countries and hyper-conservative places like India.  Just ask the Shafia sisters. Oh wait, they were murdered by conservative representatives from these cultures.
From 2010 to 2030, the general population of Canada is expected to increase by 18%. However, according the Pew Forum survey The Future of the Global Muslim Population , during that same time period the Muslim population of Canada will increase by 183 percent — i.e., 10 times faster than the general population.
You are totally right. BetsyD is a breath of fresh hot air. Liberals have ruined the media AND education with their one-sided bias for actual facts that are based on boring stuff like "empirical evidence" and "historical records".  But today we celebrate freedom from the stranglehold these actual facts have had on our children's education. With Betsy DeVos in charge, our children will finally learn alternative facts like: the incredible record-breaking turnout for Trumps inauguration that never happened; Obamas profound and non-existant Muslim faith and his made-up Kenyan birth; the massacre of innocent fictional people in Bowling Green; and most importantly, the ongoing deluge of domestic terrorist attacks the mainstream media refuses to cover merely because they are the imaginary concoctions of our president's addled mind. Thank you elksheriff69 for bravely standing up to CBs pro-truth bias by boldly posting your anonymous, evidence-free criticism of this article. You are incredible!
What's the beef? If Muslim students want to pray, let them pray. Who cares?
Kerala is a Muslim majority state? I guess in your world 25 percent must make a majority?
"the Globe continues to ignore political Islam, accepting cultural relativism as a valid excuse for misogyny and homophobia."  . . . Exactly Chuck -- Well Said.  / ..
The only reason we don't read all the hatred spewed out from Muslims is because most of us in the west don't read the languages they speak in.   Anyone who travels in the Middle East or knows history (and it is NOT being taught in schools) understands how horrible Islam is to minorities or anything not from Islam. Breitbart is doing a whole 3-part series on the world dominated by Islam. Quite the eye opener.   The author of this piece should focus more on the moss growing in her own backyard.
The religion of Islam doesn't say Muslim women must cover their faces. It's not a requirement of the religion of Islam. It's not a part of the religion.   And many Muslim women don't cover their faces in public.  And some Muslim countries, like Azerbaijan, Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey, don't allow women to wear niqabs to cover their faces.  And Saudi Arabia doesn't let Muslim women wear niqabs to cover their faces while on the Haj in Mecca. Wouldn't that be the time place to practice Islam?  So, if covering the face is not a part of or a requirement of the religion of Islam, how can Muslims argue it's a religious right in Canada?  Maybe the courts in Canada should finally make a decision whether the religion of Islam really requires Muslim women to cover their faces.
I am waiting for the usual army of Islam  apologists to remind us how beautiful,  wonder  and peaceful Islam is. I keep forgetting.
Hmmm...suspect not identified. Which means it definitely WASN'T a REFUGEE. Couldn't be a MUSLIM...
From what I can gather from the article - I'd say this is true, but only to an extent. There are, after all, around 1,8 billion Muslims - around 1,5 billion Sunnis. Surely, 1,5 billion people cannot be the problem; the problem are the few thousands who use Islam for their own agenda to justify their barbaric actions. There are equally bad people who use Buddhism (see Burma) or Christianity (see Central African Republic or Lord's Resistance Army or Irish Republican Army) to justify horrific atrocities.   If religion is just an excuse for despicable actions - and it seems like it is - then looking at the underlying reasons behind despicable actions could be a better strategy, perhaps.
Somebody on the board wrote that the reason, the reason the West is having mass slaughters by Islamists in its restaurants, its Christmas markets, its music halls and its subways...  ... is that the West has spent a great many dollars bombing and regime changing in Muslim countries, and so their warriors attack our restaurants and our markets and our music halls.  Uh, hello?  The last time I checked the history books, the United States had bombed and shot up Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Grenada, among many others. And Germany had bombed and shot up Poland, France, England and many others.  But hey, guess what? We did not see dozens of Vietnamese and Korean suicide bombers attacking American restaurants in the 1960s and 70s , and we did not see dozens of British and French suicide bombers blowing up Berlin nightclubs and dance halls in the same period.  Sorry, but no, the Islamists are NOT like everybody else before. They target civilians like no other force in modern history.
That was the critical difference between Trump's ban on 6 countries and Obama's list of 7 countries for vetting people from all countries who may have visited any of the 7 countries. But Obama did not have a complete ban on any countries and that plus the statements that we were going to ban Muslims and Muslim countries from coming to the US. That is why Trump's ban ran into constitutional issues-- he could have just had a vetting list instead of a total van on everyone from a country. Also remember that the Court ordered "block" on the van is only temporary until the actual case is completed by trial (and any appeals from the trial).
All three were young men in their 20s?  Maybe they were Hakim Ouansafi's homeboys from the localmosque, protesting the SCOTUS ruling on the travel ban?  Brother Abdullah was aiming for Aloha Tower but Brother Ahmed was screaming "ALLAHU AKBAR!!!" so loudly that he suddenly fainted, slumped over the plane's steering wheel and they went down a little too early.  Did the Imam teach them??  You need to breathe properly when screaming while at the same time concentrating on flying the plane.
Saunders also needs to be taken to task for religion-baiting with this line: "public employees who were “Globalists and Islamists” (terms that, in Mr. Higgins’s ideological circles, generally refer to Jews and Muslims).  Yikes, how did that pass the G&M editorial sniff test. Doug Saunders clearly knows that the first 2 are economic and geo-politically driven ideologies and the second 2 are religions. Certainly most Globalists are not Jews and relatively few of a billion or so Muslims are Islamists. But for some reason he wants us to conflate the two. Why?
Imagine using the adjective "toxic" in front on any other cultural group.  You wouldn't get away with it!  Toxic Islam; Toxic Jews; Toxic Christians; Toxic Homosexuals;  Toxic Feminists; Toxic Chinese... and on and on.  I suggest that there is no good reason that you should get away with saying Toxic Masculinity!  It's as inappropriate as all of those other categories listed above!
People will only take so much terrorism before they are driven mad.  This is all part of the Takfiri islamist strategy to "weaponize" the Muslim immigrant in countries without Sharia compliant governments as takfiri terrorism drives non muslim populations to see all muslims as dangerous.  So the real question as always is the behavior and attitudes of the Muslim immigrant communities towards this takfiri mobilization.  So far the opposition has been ineffective and half hearted.  I am sorry that it falls on this generation of the Ummah, but we are not always able to choose the challenges we face, individually or collectively.  Time to work on it Ms Aziz.    Stop the takfiri terrorism and the violent response will evaporate like a puddle in the desert.
LOL.  Go to a pentecost church or a mennonite church.  They wear long dresses and can't cut their hair short.        But a hijab has NOTHING to do with the husband, Islam is about modesty before god, the husband has zero to do with it.
No lady, religious bigots, which is what all you believers are to us non-believers absolutely get ZERO say in how we act and think towards believers who are PREJUDICED and hateful to us nonbelievers. This is getting out of hand. I swear columns like this only lead to more hatred of Muslims because this is Muslim Supremacy in action. YOU DO NOT GET TO DEFINE WHAT WE CAN SAY OR THINK ABOUT ANY RELIGION! M103 IS RELIGIOUS TYRANNY, PERIOD!
Am I being manipulated?  No I didn't drink the Hillary Kool aide nor do I watch the racist nightly news with Lester Holt.  I sure enjoy paying 35% taxes, working for 5 months a year to satisfy my tax bill so that a bunch of Syrians can come to this country on my dime.  There's nothing I like better than being harassed by TSA then seeing a bunch of Muslims in burkas working in the airport.  We need to leave these people over in the sand box, or we'll become a terrorist training ground.
1) Yes, but not because I am afraid of visitors from the countries named in Muslim Ban III.  2) A key part of Hawai`i's challenge is that there is no "finding" that travelers from the countries listed in Muslim Ban III are especially dangerous.
What did china, Japan and Russia do to upset you? They don't want them any more than we do. Send them to a muslim country, where they can practice their faith in peace and harmony. I hear Syria is looking for immigrants.
"Remove the plank from your own eye before talking about splinters in others" @Sheema Khan tell us what your community is doing for not making the same mistake over and over on different subjects such as... (1) the Montréal Shafia Family’s tragedy/ 3 sisters and 1st wife murders in 2009 were found dead inside a car that was discovered underwater in Kingston, Ontario/ Québécois are Very Drastic & will never let another & do everything that tragedy of Shafia Family happened again !) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpiF35L9tI0 (2) TVA Nouvelles/ Montréal le 26 janvier 2016; Hamza Chaoui (see Google for info) is one of Québec's best-known radical imams. He is known by his many controversial statements. Islam, according to him, is incompatible with democracy, as parliaments may consist "a disbeliever, a homosexual or an atheist who says the lack of Allah." (more to come...if not "censured")
First of all, these are not legal immigrants; legal immigrants don't have these problems.  So, the people with these problems here brought them on themselves.  You buy a ticket to a theater performance and go in and find someone who snuck in sitting in your sit.  What would bishop Seitz do and say about that?   Second, we have a right to determine who comes into our country.  What's coming in from the southern countries would never have been allowed to come in from Europe in the late 19th century and early 20th century.  So, the immigrants who  came into our county back then, who helped make America great, were selected, and wanted to become Americans.  That's not the character of illegals coming in; they are selfish and only thinking of what they want.  Those Hispanic/Latino citizens who voted last Nov. voted 74% for pro-abortion Hillary, and 19% for pro-life Trump.  We don't need more Catholics like that.  And his calling Muslims are brothers & sisters shows how naive he is.
"“Enough is enough,” British Prime Minister Theresa May said in a speech over the weekend- We shouldn’t have to applaud a no-brainer statement. However, the truth is we’ve become so used to lacklustre, almost apologetic responses to terror from our politicians" The Toronto Sun. The opinion of the left is in contrast with many others in North America and around the world.   "Trump tweets-Tacky and cruel"? NY Post: "May, in essence, called for more of what Britain and the West have already been doing: more ideological combat with radical Islamism, more efforts to deny the enemy “safe spaces” online and in the real world-" "As President Trump noted in Riyadh, the toll from Islamist terror has been far, far higher in the Muslim world than in the West — because the threat comes from one side of a civil war within Islam." Enough said.
Not so sure about that - whether or not it's terrorism depends on the shooter's motive.  Was he trying to influence government/the people to act in a certain way or was he simply saying that he hates Muslims.
No one is addressing her distinction between open and closed criticisms. Some on the right and center left are obsessed about Islam disproportional to any threat, feeding fear mongering about behavior of Muslims which could lead to discrimination. Before anyone gets worked up too much about free speech issues hate speech laws in Canada are only restricting a narrow range of hate. We don't have overly broad denigration laws which could tread on constructive discussion.
The Reform Haters look anywhere they can to trash Canada even when they dream-up facts.    The government has been very clear on their position from the beginning.  People can't help those who do not stay informed.  "obvious appeaser of radical Islam".  Do you have even one shred of evidence for this nonsense or is hate simply enough for you?
Most people saw that accepting a million refugees who were predomently Muslim and from troubled countries in such a short space of time was reckless at best and treasonous at worse. I expect German voters to make things right next election....if not too late..
Try to keep this in mind,  -	Donald Trump did not steal your money.  -	Donald Trump did not raise your taxes.  -	Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food.  -	Trump is not stirring a race war.  -	Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims.  -	Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian ,Al-Qaeda.  -	Trump did not arm ISIS and then exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East.  -	Trump did not sell 20% of our uranium to Russia.  -	Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran's nuclear weapons program.  -	Trump did not give our military secrets to China (Israel did)  -	Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia.  -	Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans.  -	Trump did not cripple our economy.  -	Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars.  -	Trump did not ruin our credit, twice.  -	Trump did not steal your rights!  The Democrats did!!!
Makes one wonder how much the Globe and Pail is receiving in "donations" for their "charity" from the muslim organizations.
You mean, of course, I should stop telling unpleasant truths about you.   The countries that Trump did not ban Muslims from are the ones he has business dealings with.
Yes….one only has to look at countries such as USA, Austria, France, Germany, Netherlands, Greece and Italy to recognize that the "progressive liberal" dream of mass Islamic immigration is turning into a nightmare for the traditionalists living in those countries.   2019 cannot come quickly enough for some of us…...
(Part one of two) Support for Democratic candidates during the same period, on the other hand, has come from "Hispanic Catholics, the religiously unaffiliated, Jewish Americans and African-American Protestants," he (Robert Jones, of The (Pontifical) (administratively censured) Catholic University of America) said.   This slight to Black Catholics is unseemly.  As of 7:23 this morning, Steven Shea, xswzaq9, 2Be4Peace, extend the unseemliness to non-white immigrants and Muslims .  As Philippians 3:6) remonstrated, “in zeal I persecuted the (Black Catholic) Church.”  “In just the same way, I tell you there will be rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents” (Luke 15:10).  The problem rests in what hearts seek.  “Let hearts rejoice who search for the Lord” (Psalm 105:3b).

"(Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam) "  Christianity: apparently so good, they had to name it twice!
It's not surprising that M-103 has the support of political Islamists, in addition to the smug self-titled "progressives" who are wilfully ignorant to the realities of societies governed by Islamic law - no free speech, no gender equality, and a violent hostility to any critical analysis of Islam. A  political belief system that is only common in countries highlighted by authoritarianism and misogyny, without exception. Demanding that women cover their hair under the threat of beatings by "morality police" is not a function of cultural relativism, it is a function of a regressive belief system that is fundamentally incompatible with advanced civilizations.
Turkish national, Turkish national.  Turkey is predominately Muslim.  Who is this guy?  How did he enter the US?  What was he doing here?  Details, please.
The recent shooting in Quebec has shown that non-Muslim Canadians are capable of terrorist acts and it's not the first example of this.  Question:  Why do I not see non-Muslim Canadians gathering in millions to protect against these people who are giving their community a bad name? Wouldn't that be an opportunity, especially with what's going on in the world today, to uphold the fact that the majority of non-Muslim Canadians are in fact good and decent people? You see them protesting against other things, which is rightfully so, but would they send a stronger message to the world by outright condemning non-Muslim terrorists and doing it in crowds of millions or more to show the world that they are in fact in solidarity with the majority of people in the world?
Doesn't that mean that you hate anti-Muslims? My Canada is a Christian nation and Islam has no place in public schools as apparently Christianity has no place in public schools. This pandering to one group over another by politicians and school board members is what the problem is. They should assimilate to our way of life not the other way around.
Keep voting Democrat, Democrats Support those U.S. Laws that Require U.S. Citizens living at Hawaii to Pay A Paradise Tax (punishment for Living at "Paradise") then the expensive Shipping and Handling are Added, Stopped Hawaii from being the Main Port of Entry to the U.S. result loss of 50,000 Middle Class Jobs.  This caused the Cost of Everything to go Up, caused the Hawaii Homeless Crisis.  Democrats Eliminated the U.S. Laws that Protected the U.S., caused the 2008 Great Recession.  Democrats Caused the Osama Bin Laden 1993 First World Trade Center Attack with U.S. Airstrikes and U.S. Cruise Missile Attacks against the Muslims at Baghdad Iraq, and the Second Osama Bin Laden Attack of the World Trade Center with the 1996, 1998, Democrat President Clinton 1998 Declared War Against Iraq that also caused the War At Afghanistan.  The Stupid at the Hawaii Public Schools caused by Democrat's U.S. Labor Union Owned Teachers and Professors regardless of the large amounts of our money thrown.
I get it, your looking for a reaction. You don't paint with a broad brush all those who supported DT due to a small minority of those who voted for him now do you? Why, with that kind of thinking then all Muslims are terrorist, that all democrats support restrictions on free speech. That all dems. support the use of violence towards others. Fact is there were some who voted for BHO due to his skin color so with your thinking all dems. are in fact racist right? Or do you only believe that freedom of expression applies to just the things you agree with? Racist are despicable, and both parties have their share of them but guess what confused, it still is a free country despite those who want to restrict it to just a PC Nation.
Everybody else i.e. non-Muslims, has been fearing for their security at least since 9/11. So who cares that Muslims are starting to fear for theirs. In fact, it's about time.
How frequently do 'white and/or Christians' go 'off the rails' in relation to Islamic terrorist events?
Give Arab Muslim immigrants a rousing welcome and welcome their culture. We have plenty opportunity for them to make a point of converting us to  Islam.
Three nice boys, Arab muslims all - what could go wrong.
It is quite sad to see a prominent churchman like Bishop Barron who has a big public following avoid holding big shots on Capitol Hill to the same standard by which he critiques other people with far, far less power and influence.  His attack on Griffin's hateful display of alleged humour, for example, was quite justified in its own right, but Bishop Barron has ignored equally repugnant displays in both word and deed by President Trump.  Indeed President Trump has attacked freedom of religion, incited violence, and demeaned women for more than six months non-stop.  There is no doubt that the President's hateful rhetoric has 'inspired' an upswing in anti-Semitic violence against both Jews and Muslims but, so far as I know, Bishop Barron has not condemned the President for his very anti-Christians attacks on other people.  Such double-standards reduce Barron, and others who take the same approach, to disciples of convenience who choose not to proclaim the Gospel to the powerful ...
CONT'D HERE   OR HOW ABOUT when Obama said words to this effect on Letterman "It's like -- it was like Special Olympics or something," (Doh!) maybe you were thinking of when Obama gave to the British Prime Minister a bunch of incorrectly formatted DVD's or when he embarrassed himself and the USA in front of the queen when he gave her his ipod that curiously contained 50 show tunes (go figure) or his apology tour when he apologized for American transgressions around the world, yet failed to ask Muslim states to hold their "extremists" accountable for their global terrorist actions. or remember right after Obama was elected and during just one month he nominated 5 people with serious legal problems and had to be withdrawn...how about his $100,000 "date night " in New York  after just a few months in office...lets not forget what a fool he looked like by his overuse of his teleprompter when among other things he introduces himself... is that what you mean?
?? - pal give your head a shake - horrific behavior is horrific behavior and the prosecution of criminal activity is always appropriate - I mere point out the interesting Canadian dichotomy of allowing public scorn to be heaped upon accused Christian communities whilst not allowing the comment boards to function following various Islamic honor killings and after the uncovering of first nations fiscal chicanery - - Canadian 'sacred cows' would seem to include most belief systems other than orthodox Christianity it would seem
And we do, we do!  Only Mr McGee is quoting George Orwell here, so I guess he dozed off comfortably last night..  Those are the three slogans of Oceania and they do an outstanding job of demonstrating the concept of doublethink.  I somehow doubt the US will have telescreens or Thought Police (well, maybe for Muslims) but revisionist history,  ceaseless military conflict, and unending propaganda all sound like things Trump might support.
When we see Muslims agreeing to burials next to Jews, Catholics, native Indians, etc. than we'll know they are serious about integration.
if your an American going in to a Muslim country like Indonesia they will do anything to get you arrested just to extort money and we in Hawaii get our oil from them lets all get out of that country do not visit it no more and lets get our oil from the US and don't do business with Indonesia any more and they will lose money, that's why never deal with these Muslims in Indonesia. why don't his friends surfing buddies and other people go ask Obama to try and help him, Obamas step father is Indonesian might have pull there.
The "T" word here is "Taquiyya".  The other word is "kitman".  "In Shi'a Islam, taqiya is a form of religious lie, or a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual can deny his faith or commit otherwise illegal or blasphemous acts,"   "A related concept is known as kitman "concealment; dissimulation by omission".  Both are permitted against enemies.    Yarden Mariuma writes: "Taqiyya is an Islamic juridical term whose shifting meaning relates to when a Muslim is allowed, under Sharia law, to lie. A concept whose meaning has varied significantly among Islamic sects, scholars, countries, and political regimes,
Because we Canadians give them a great country to live in, we are in no way responsible for their behavior. There may be a way to keep us safe without accepting the behaviour of individuals. One thing I noticed in the Manchester bomber was that his father was also a radical Muslims, imagine training your own children to blow themselves up in the name of your god, it is nuts. If this pattern is true; one defense would be to round  up everybody they know, Family, friends everybody in the contact list and get them locked up or deported.  It has to be clear to these young people there are consequences that occur, beyond blowing yourself up. Confiscate the entire families money, deport them all, and make sure they never return. Their action has to have consequences bigger than government money wasted to discourage the behaviour. This is what I learned, I am responsible for my actions, and these consequences have to be severe, so quit pandering to them.
If you are John Kelly's position you WILL have to ban laptops on ALL flights originating from anywhere in the world and landing in the USA. Even domestic flights. He doesn't want one American to die from terrorism, and our thinking is the same. Believe it or not, he IS going to do it in the near future. I guess my choices are put a cable lock on my laptop and attach it to a steel cable ring drilled into my suitcase, UPS my laptop ahead to my hotel via UPS or Fedex, or just leave it at home. Use the hotel laptop or visit a computer coffee shop which will have spy malware. Could use your cell phone internet and email service and real voice call back home. Seriously the terrorists ARE winning by disrupting our peace of mind. They are seriously good at what they do. Maybe Trump is right to stop Muslims trying to immigrate into our homeland. This is the new reality. Sad, but true.
Just watching The 700 Club it appears Pat Robertson can't wait for a holy war against Muslims as well.
Not a very difficult decision to make but you didn't comment about the beginning's of Islam and it's relationship to other religious communities
The biggest religious freedom issue is the Muslim ban just stopped by the 9th Circuit.  I don't suspect the bishops will ever say it that way.  The Contraception flap ended when Valarie Jarrett got Obama elected for a second term.  All that was left was forcing agreement by a newly radicalized wing of the Church, which the Supreme Court did.  The Church needs to quit rejecting federal power in this area.  Catholic Churches in Alabama still get bombed.  Flynn will only be ousted if he embarrasses the President - and then only if the President realizes that he has been had.  Embarrassing the Vice President is always a good thing from the President's point of view, especially since Trump can obviously be declared disabled by Pence if the Cabinet goes along.  The Democrats should have looked more at the race of the VP candidate than the voters.  Corey Booker would have put HRC over the top.  Time to focus on economics with a wide left turn to Cooperative and Democratic Socialism.
Here's an idea:  let all religions hold their own services and prayer sessions in the school's prayer room. In the spirit of inclusion, tolerance, and brotherly love, sharing the space  will bring people together and build the a better world.  No peace loving Muslim could ever object to  praying in the same room as Jews. Would they? Let's all share.   It is public property after all.
So the guy who killed six Muslims in the mosque in Quebec was offended by their fashion sense? It was obviously some sort of rational fear, according to you?
Have they really?  The Christian body-count just since WWII is orders of magnitude greater than several centuries of Muslim warfare.  Shall I provide examples?
No one is trying to impose sharia law on anyone.  Muslims have made good, hard working, entrepreneurial citizens.  As a native-American female, I have been in America for 11,000 years.  (Mandans of the Great Plains.)  I never asked you for your documents before you emigrated to my country.  Go back home!
Jerry, this is utterly false. Arabs have no freedoms in ZIONIST ISRAEL. You must be a troll. I have been to ISRAEL/ Palestine. Israel illegally settles on seized Arab land, shoots and terrorizes childrens, walls off cities such as Bethlehem,,denying GAZA women with breast cancer treatment in ISRAEL occupied hospitals. ChristianPeacemaker teams posted Dec. 6-12 photos of intimidations of Arabs in the old city, Jewish settlers arrogant actions on Palestinian farms, routine home invasions. In Hebron CHRISTIAN Peacemakers walk Palestinian children to school to try to protect from IDF harassment. Tulsi please don't fund these Israeli terrorists! The latest is ISRAEL,removing CHRISTIAN & Muslim names from holy sites.Mitri Raheb presentation at National Press Club YOUTUBE.COM
What the world is facing is a population explosion presently the world has 7.3 billion people by 2097 it will be 11.3 billion. Thats a 60% increase in people! Majority of the growth will occur in Africa, Muslim world and Sub Continent of India. Average fertility rate in Japan and Denmark is 1.8 compare that to Nigeria  which is 9 children. Bangledeish is 7 children. We have a shortage of fresh water, certain species in the sea are being depleted. Huge amounts of pollution that will be created (carbon gases etcc) All three parties silent on this issue. Even more strange Green Party refuses to talk about this issue.
The only reason the term islamophobia, which was created by the muslim brotherhood in the 1990's, is included is to shut down all criticism of islam!  Wake up Canada!  trudeau is on the side of islam not Canada!
Those Canadian values include tolerance of others Balatonian. Your other posts vilifying Muslims because of the Ottoman Turks indicates that you do not share those values and have not left your old country's prejudices behind. How do you rationalize that with your comment here.
Obviously what he said was an awkward way of complimenting 'Africa' on what he thinks is improvement and downright success in their economies.  I say 'obviously' because it only takes a slight amount of common sense and a tiny bit more of maturity to know that. Very similar to his comments on illegal immigrants being transformed in the media to include all immigrants. Or the media changing his travel restrictions on 4 countries that can't or will not vet their traveling citizens to Trump's war against Muslims.  I'm not a Trump supporter or a vehement detractor and with no Canadian loyalties in any political party and not being a believer in Canada's monopoly on virtue, I'm in the group that reads the articles and posts as they are, not through the filters of fragile psyches.
Not true! 270 Million est killed by Mulism, 80 million Hindus alone! Check your facts !
Maybe they do and they support it. From my understanding of Islam, it is the ultimate "stand by (or maybe behind) your man" ideology.
Time to split up Canada. I see you are trying out your new way for voting for the next election . Iran are starting to run our Country and justin is a believer of muslim.Do you beat your wife. Just asking. I will head to be with Brad. If and when we split.
So, for those who were wondering during the M-103 debate what was the definition of islamophobia, you now have your answer.
Sher-e-Hindustan: You may have a broad understanding of the Middle East and Islam, but my observation is that your comments on the topic at hand suggest a rather constricted understanding of the West. As for the UAE's citizenship requirements, which you now appear to agree are very restrictive by Western standards as so few Westerners are able to become UAE citizens, I researched the issue online.
Since Sept 11th, 2001 there have been 28 incidents in the U.S. that were considered terrorist acts that resulted in a death.  25 of the 28 were perpetrated by 32 Americans that resulted in 145 deaths.  One attack was by an American and his Pakistani wife that resulted in 14 deaths.  The remaining two attacks were perpetrated by 1 Egyptian and 1 Kuwaiti and resulted in 7 deaths. . ZERO attacks in the U.S. by someone from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  So is this "winning" or is this just so much baloney fear mongering to pacify a certain ideologically aligned group of people? . P.S. 65% of the 28 terrorist acts mentioned had nothing to do with Islam or Muslims.  Many of the terrorists were anti-government and/or neo-Nazis.  A majority grew up as Christians.  So given the numbers, who should we really be targeting?
Le Pen is slowly seducing voters   Perhaps voters are simply waking up to the fact that their French culture is of value after all. Muslims already tried to blow up the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, and enter the Louvre with machetes. Is Le Pen wrong to think that the heritage of buildings  and art works  are worthy of protection from iconoclasts and foreign xenophobes?
It DOESN'T MATTER what the excuse they use, when groups coalesce to target other groups for murder, rape and robbery, the real reason is always either fear (of loss of status, of loss of territory, of loss of power or of the unknown) or envy (faster horses, younger women, older whiskey, more money). The Muslim attacks on Muslim villages in Algeria back in the 90s didn't get as much press as the Muslim attacks in Afghanistan more recently, but they were very similar. Groups of Muslim men attacked villages, raped and kidnapped the young women, stole the treasures and claimed it was because of religious impurity. Tim McVeigh and Dylan Roof were victims of the same kind of radicalization that the Jihadists are using and went forward with exactly the same kind of blank-faced, mindless, mechanical ferocity to protect what they thought was under attack from what they had been taught was the enemy. Christians didn't raise a huge outcry because they hadn't taken part in that radicalization.
Good article.    Maybe we can also go for deeper issues.   Such as:  Most religious people were born into their religion and had no choice.   For example, it wasn't long ago that Catholics were `indoctrinated' to have large families.   Now, many Muslim families are 5, 7, 9 children.   Most importantly, let's talk about those religions such as Islamic doctrine passages that incite hatred and even death for non-believers.   Now, Let Us Just Imagine a world where silly religious `dressings' are peeled away and discarded so just their core essence remains - That of the Golden Rule, which is basic in one form or another to all religions.   Now, Just Keep Imagining That and let's make That happen.
There are good Muslims and bad Muslims.  There are good Christians and bad Christians.  There are good atheists and bad atheists.  Hate speech is illegal, whether uttered by Muslims, Christians or anyone else.  Police prosecute those engaged in hate speech.  It is generally seen as a good thing when people report instances of hate speech.  I haven't seen the video; however, I glean from the G&M's article that the reward is offered for those showing someone engaged in hate speech.  Since hate speech is illegal, and since reporting it is seen as a public duty, I fail to see why someone offering a reward for the public to report an instance of hate speech is such a bad thing.
Critics allege that Aisha was just six years old when she was betrothed to Muhammad. They base this on a saying attributed to Aisha herself (Sahih Bukhari volume 5, book 58, number 234), and the debate on this issue is further complicated by the fact that some Muslims believe this to be a historically accurate account. Although most Muslims would not consider marrying off their nine-year-old daughters, those who accept this saying argue that since the Qur'an states that marriage is void unless entered into by consenting adults, Aisha must have entered puberty early. They point out that, in seventh-century Arabia, adulthood was defined as the onset of puberty. (This much is true, and was also the case in Europe: five centuries after Muhammad's marriage to Aisha, 33-year-old King John of England married 12-year-old Isabella of Angoulême.)
At this point there isn't an accepted, legal definition of Islamophobia and M-103 doesn't change anything.  This article, which portrays Muslims and their accepted Islamic practice of child marriage in a negative light, could therefore be deemed to be Islamophobic.  Under Sharia law, it would be considered blasphemous.    The legislation that may be passed as a result of M-103 might make it impossible to publish an article like this.  To avoid a lawsuit, the Globe would self-censor and spike this article so as not to offend Muslim sensibilities.
(Part one of two)  Speaking via video feed from Los Angeles, Mr. Bannon, a Catholic, held forth against rampant secularization, the existential threat of Islam, and a capitalism that had drifted from the moral foundations of Christianity.—Dennis Coday  “O bless the Lord, my soul!” (Psalm 104:1a).  Meaning that blessing the Lord is not easy these days in the company of Bannon.    “Except the tree of knowledge of good and evil.  From that tree you shall not eat; the moment you eat from it you are surely doomed to die” (Genesis 2:17).  The knowledge of good and evil, unanchored by truth, seems to have come forth from both Rome and Washington.  “The link of Bannon/Burke and the alt-right is the `deplorable’ road to authoritarianism disaster of church and state.”—dennism looks like just that link to the tree of knowledge of good and evil.  “Your word, O Lord, is truth:  consecrate us in the truth” (See John 17:17b, 17a).  “The things that come out from within are what defile” (Mark 7:14).
Frederick, you seem to explain your religion very well. So what would it take to bring peace to the many places across the world where large numbers of Muslims are not getting along with other cultures. What can the Hindus, the Buddists, Middle East Christians, Jews,  Indonesians, Chechnyans, Europeans, Americans, Nigerians, Ohio State Students, etc do, so that they can rest easy that the bombs and mass shootings in the name of Islam will be relegated to the past? Also, do you think the moderate Muslim population does enough to purge its religion of the radicals? Do you agree that Islam has a problem with radicalization? I think one mistake they make is to form enclaves in a host country with little social interaction with others. Not in all cases but that is the perception. Sincere questions.
News update. The young Muslim girl who was killed in VA, was killed by an illegal immigrant. A Dreamer, 22 year old. It appears it has nothing to do with hate, but with road rage.  Yes, there are nuts on both side, however the left excuse and deflect their nuts, while they do everything they can to attach the nuts of the right to Trump, talk radio, Alex Jones, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, or Rush. All I'm doing to pointing out who the nuts on the left support. It's the left that is blinded by ideology.
When you say speaking in code, you are adding your own meaning to what is said, not what is actually said.  Many criticize BLM  for being racist itself.  How else to describe an organization that gets upset when it is stated that ALL lives matter.  As far as equating Antifa to the KKK and Nazis, when they stop acting like the KKK and the Nazis, that is when they will stop being equated with them.  Even the FBI describes the AntiFa as a terrorist organization.  Also, have you ever thought that some Muslims SHOULD be banned from this country?   Would you have invited Osama bin Laden into this country?  Or any of the ISIS fighters?  That is what Trump is trying to do with his so-called Muslim ban.  Also, it is interesting that if he was banning Muslims, he left a significant number of nations off the list, did he not? It is also interesting that the left never mentions the racist activities of persons of color.
Since you ask, I disagree with your belief that every muslim wants to create a parallel legal /social system in Canada based on extreme sharia law.  And that just isn't true, Martel.  But mostly I disagreed for this reason....  I just finished reading a personal story by two very nice people that ends "let’s shake hands, sit, look eye-to-eye, smile, listen with open hearts and curious minds and get to know each other better. It will be a good start."   ... and then read your belligerent attempt to pick a fight.  Based on your online name, I assume that's why you come on Globe comments.  But this article is not the place.
.  BurntErnest,  you are wasting your time with Alceste.  His only role in these forums is to deflect and qualify anyone questioning anything Islam  as a non-Canadian, bigot, supremacist: . "... no doubt that a lot of participants in Globe comments despised this writer merely by seeing her hijab, but that isn't representative of Canadians." . Background: ------ . The above quote is a new "talking point" for him, which he adopted since last week. It was result of me questioning the motives of the G&M (and other media)  publishing "opinions" of only (practically) hijabed women. As if the Westerners should be  brainwashed that only a hijabed woman can be a true Muslim woman.   I find it interesting that the bulk of the  media doe not publish Muslims, critical of Islam, and calling for a reform - a hard look as to the state of Islam today. They do not publish Muslims, critical of the hapless left who is used as a Trojan horse to advance political Islam agenda in Western democracies.
Good God, I've seen those and other sites like them...pure alt-right horse sh*t.  Why not add Infowars, or are they still too busy chasing Pizzagate?  According to the article, POTUS has no legal authority to order wiretaps.  Have these fake sites got a workaround for that, or do they just assume that if the DoJ ordered taps, that the Kenyay Muslim gun-grabbing anti-American  terrorist loving tyrant MUST be behind it?
It was time 20 years ago for this to stop.  Ironically, one of the groups that is most hurt by unrestrained immigration is immigrants who've worked here and contributed to Canadian society for decades.  Just like peaceful Muslims face racism and a backlash against them because of terrorists.  Multiculturalism as it's interpreted in Canada must end now.  Canadians should demand what's best for Canadians.
"What other people?"   Those are anti-Trump news reports - not opinions. News reports  Such as  "Trump shifts Muslim ban",   "Trump has pivoted", "Changing Muslim Ban" Those are reports coming from anti-Trump media such as NBC and HuffingtonPost, whom Trump has accused of being the Opposition Media that opposes him along with the Democrats.
How much do you actually know about Islam?
Like I said little man, I was born into the military!!  Army Airborne Cbt Eng, 68-70 + 4 more brothers Army, Air Force + one of them continuing into law enforcement for 15+ years and then into the Air Marshall's after 9/11, remember?  You and yours have nothing on us about suiting up and strapping on!  Again a little history, the KKK, along with Jim Crow was all Dems, the party of slavery!!  The difference is little man I oppose "all" supremacist and I have respect for all citizens that behave rationally, carrying their own weight, support those they bring into the world and don't blame everyone else for their failures because they lack personal responsibility and accountability. Don't force different life styles down my throat, shut up and man up. I do not support late terms abortions, that's a human being, treated like spare parts.  Sit through one if you can stomach it!  I don't believe in a hyphenated American; African American, white-American, Muslim-American all BS! American 1st
the moslems invaded israel and built their sign of conquer on what they believed to be the temple mount. that land of israel was given to abraham, isaac, and jacob. the book is not a trilogy- the Lamb of God is the beginning and the end. you call the God of the Jews and Christians 'ha-satan'? yet you claim to be  the final chapter? so interesting.
There was a "golden age" of the Moors in Spain, yes, but it didn't last. By the 11th century, the Almoravids and the Almohads had destroyed it, and the Jews and Christians were forced to convert or emigrate.  The Spanish and the Portuguese were particularly violent conquerors, yes, but they also were reacting to the previous Moorish conquest. It was a time of conquests back and forth, with civilisations basing their identities on religion, a bad idea that transformed ordinary conquest into religious wars.  The overseas colonial conquests started...The Christians killed more because they had access to more overseas territory,if the Muslims had gotten there first, it would probably have been them.  The new movie Silence depicts another religious conflict, this time the Japanese reaction to Christian missionaries, and that turned bloody too. The Japanese were not welcoming of new religions...
So far, not a single news outlet correctly reported the ban. NyTimes, MSNBC, CNN keep calling it a "muslim ban", when it does not ban based on religion, but based on nationality. All mainstream media are peddling a fake narrative, because they hate Trump and are trying to distort the executive order. There is no muslim ban.
ISIS has killed far more Muslims than Christians.
I found part of your comment to be very interesting, specifically;  "History has long shown us that when a religious portion of any given citizenry comes under the thumb of the non religious population of that very same citizenry horrible things happen."  In case you weren't aware of this let me show you a truth you may have overlooked, using your own words...  "History has long shown us that when a *non*-religious portion of any given citizenry comes under the thumb of the *religious* population of that very same citizenry horrible things happen."  I believe the Spanish Inquisition would be considered close to that. Many of the 'Christian' religions have long held pagans, witches, and wiccans to be quite loathsome, and terrible things happened to them. I think the current situation in Turkey, with the Muslim officials taking action against the secular military, falls under that banner. I can offer more examples if you'd like...............
So, you must have felt the same when Obama did it!  http://www.heraldsun.com.au/blogs/andrew-bolt/muslim-ban-hypocrisy-left-said-nothing-when-obama-also-halted-visas/news-story/17c901096824ecd0a2e3a4d1e5ded377
Allan  Ross, get serious how many Christians in Canada? how many Muslims? Or Buddhists for that matter  why shouldn't Christian civilization and culture be "pervasive" in Canada? what is your problem? Don't like "pervasive" Christian culture you can migrate to the Middle East
Margaret Wente versus Conrad Black  leftist deference to Muslims ...exaggerated tolerance.  "Much of the present leftist deference to Muslims is really implicitly a ridiculing and defaming of all religions, in the guise of exaggerated tolerance."  "The Enlightenment has mutated, and this threatens our civilization" - Conrad Black - National Post - March 31, 2017
Aren't most from Gujarat Muslim?? ... but why blame them in particular.... the Guptas aren't Muslim, or some of those involved with State Capture and happen to be of Indian descent.
Furthermore Allan, Catholic schools actually not only teach Catholicism, but also a basic understanding of other world religions. Not only that, but my children's Catholic school (and many others) also sponsored several Syrian familes. Additionally, ANYONE is welcome to attend a Catholic school regardless of their religion providing they are willing to accept the fact that a Catholic religion class is part of the curriculum ....which, may I remind you of above sentence, INCLUDES teaching and exploring about other faiths, and they check that 'little tax allocation box' . It's curious you know, how many non-Catholics now attend Catholic schools. Could it be because the parents and their children actually would like to say a prayer? Would like to have a Christmas concert? Would like to freely express and show their faith? Funny how that is huh? They can't do it in their own public school, but Muslims can? Alrighty then!
Time for Muslims t get with the program and understand that religion should not be mixed with other institutions, being political, educational, or commercial. You are free to pray for God in a setting that does not offend others, and where you do not give the impression that you have rights other religions do not. What if Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and  decided to pray in schools?
"How could you possibly not mention the biggest slaughter of Muslims in North American history"???  32 Muslims were killed in the 9/11 attacks: 26 men and six women. Not a matter of months ago but years ago!
>>Duke Charles Martel >>Are you a muslim Alceste? . To that question, Alceste has a canned answer - "Are you a White Supremacist?".. or "At least I am not a White Supremacist?" Either way - it is pretty telling how he feels about himself. And what does he equates being Muslim with. Now, to the apprentice who would be given the task of "censoring" this post - read twice.. Just because there are some words in it that may scare you into censorship, there is nothing offensive, or false in it, it is based on actual posts ( go search your database).
Kaepernick has better stats than most of the backups in the league, and some starters as well. His past performance on the field suggests that he could step in on numerous rosters and outperform that team's current backup.   NFL apologists who defend the shield are quick to point out as well that the Kaepernick blackballing has nothing to do with race, using RGIII as their evidence. Hey, look Robert Griffin doesn't have a job, either, ignoring the fact that RGIII stinks as a player.  In my view, owners are reluctant to employ Kaepernick not only because of potential distractions, but also because they don't want to upset their sponsers and fans. No, you would not want to upset those Old Glory fans, the ones who still think Obama is a Muslim from Kenya, and Kaepernick a Muslim terrorist sympathizer.
Muslims and liberals excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of  Christianity, Europe and America, destructive  iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal wars between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects,   ISIS , Taliban and Al Quada are the root causes of most of the wars  and social chaos happening around the world today. It is worse than anything expressed in the west, even by Trump or LePen
Many Muslims walked into Germany. As is currently happening here.  Germany is now paying the price.  Will that happen here? Why not?   Will bill M103, that specifically lists the word "islamophobia", silence our voices?
Islam is no more deserving of respect than any other idea or philosophy. People deserve respect. Islam, like other religions, is tribal and destructive. I will not be silenced in my criticism of these archaic and barbaric ideologies.
Is anyone asking for protection frm westernphobia, or anti-western bigotry? No. That's already covered in the constitution, as is islamophobia or anti-muslim bigotry.
These people are still living in the 2nd century. We shouldn't have anything to do with them until they recognize basic human rights and stop breeding Islamic terrorism.
I ask Jane a question and theSA deleted it playing GOD with my post. so here it goes again. How can you overlook the Muslim Faith and the role that the women plays in that belief and side with them on anything? Yeah, Japanese women are subservants to males I guess in the Japanese society but they got rights to dress the way they want, to drive a car, to date men, etc. How do you feel of the Muslim/Islam faith and how they treat your fellow HUMAN being, a woman?
"In 2030, 2031, and 2032 Ramadan happens in December again!"  Guess what, vivavivaldi, Muslims should celebrate it anyway that they want (short of imposing jihad).  And Jews tend to enjoy the season even though they don't believe that Jesus was God incarnate.  My sister-in-law is an atheist and she celebrates the Winter Solstice.  Why?  Because this is America, where people are free to celebrate what they want (Cinco de Mayo) when they want.  But no one should be told that saying Merry Christmas is wrong unless you support national socialism.
"In the name of Islam" doesn't mean these people are fighting a religious war. You call the Planned Parenthood shooter a psychopath, but he shot a cop and two other people just because they were there - he didn't break in on an abortion in progress.  Look up these names  Michael F. Griffin Rev. Paul Jennings Hill John Salvi Eric Rudolph James Kopp Scott Roeder  Murder at or because of abortion, which is legal here. "Rev." as in Presbyterian until they excommunicated him when he started advocating violence against abortion - on religious grounds.  You'll probably say they were all unstable. Yet why don't you notice the same about the others who are mentally unstable enough to find a reason, pick up a gun or bomb, and start randomly killing?  Islam, like Christianity and Judaism all descends from Abraham, and anyone who looks in the Bible finds enough bloodthirstiness to twist that into a "cause" too. When they lose it.
If one has to conceal one's face and body (as shown in the accompanying photo), then one is isolating oneself from society. As Prof. Mohammed Qadeer of Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario once observed the wearer is symbolizing distrust for fellow citizens, implying "I am violated if you look at me."   In 2015, Raheel Gaza wrote, "As a Muslim mother who never saw a niqab while I was growing up in Karachi, Pakistan, I am astonished to see Canada's judiciary caving in to Islamists who have nothing but contempt for Canada's values of gender equality." She has lived in Canada for 27 years and fears such developments, saying she must fight for a safe place from the "medieval theocratic adherents of my faith." Why must women be 'swathed' to hide their identities while their male counterparts wear jeans and shirts?  It is unhealthy for Canada to divide itself with new exclusionary 'rights'. Let's stick to a set of MODERN gender neutral HUMAN rights that apply to all Canadians.
Since this columnist opened the topic of muslim residents in the context of a "post truth" environment, let us see if the G&M can tolerate some actual response.  There is nothing irrational about Canadian responses to seeing so many muslims in their traditional garb, most often women in hijab and too often, and disturbingly women in full veil and tent mode.   Another truth is that just about all the now many thousands of mass murder terrorist attacks around the globe are on behalf of allah.  This columnist would no doubt deflect by claiming this has nothing to do with islam, a notion easily dismissed by reading the quran and hadith which are indeed, very disturbing at best.  So, the only post-truth in this context is that a woman, for example, in traditional islamic garb can be a spokesperson for civil rights and human progress.  Another piece of post-truthiness is that islam is a religion of peace.  Yet another is that all contributions to diversity are beneficial.
Of course, you can point out equally ugly things in the Bible.  The huge difference is that we don't act on them.  We don't take Muslims who've just converted to Christianity down to the beach and cut their heads off.   Or strap bombs to 15-year-olds, drive trucks into crowds, blow up metros and large buildings full of innocent people.   Who does those things?  You can answer.  It's not racist to tell the truth.  Who does those things?   And though they do those things, it's supposed to be "hateful" to ban them for a short time only, so we can separate those who do violence in the name of Islam from those who don't.  That's irrational.  There's a real threat of catastrophic proportions posed by a real sub-set of Muslims, and you would suffer this risk than offend the good Muslims.  All that's asked for is a temporary ban similar to the ones passed by Carter and Obama.  But no, for Trump to do it is racist. for Obama and Carter to do it isn't.  Irrational.
Yeah ... you also said that about Trump's first Muslim ban.  How did that work out?
It is just the usual government and media determination to force acceptance of islam and islamic violence on the public.  If we dont mention it, it isnt a problem.  I listened to the coverage of this incident on the CBC today and there was no mention of the islamic aspect.
Keep on ranting about "Hindus" and "Muslims" in India and Pakistan.  Smart people call it "what-about-it-try" ,as in "well what about...this... or that".   It's a form of deflection that no longer works.
AS a "root cause", I might suggest the high level of consanguineous marriage among Muslims, which probably leads to various kinds of cognitive deficit. Marry your first cousin in generation 1, your kid has an extra zit. Marry your cousin in generation 20....?
It's amazing some thank Trump for more jobs.  The good economic state he "inherited" thanks to Obama.  Just for starters his attempted racist ban on Muslims has lost more money to travel and other industry than anything he has done has helped.  Those using the term "globalist" are completely out of touch with the reality in the world.  Transportation and communication technologies have but dissolved aspects of borders, distance and cultural difference between countries.  European and American governments, religions, and corporations have pushed western "culture" and economics down the throats of others whether or not it was wanted.  We are a global community.  It's a "dominator society" that perpetuates conquest of others and does not participate in a getting along with others in a global community perspective.  There are no more isolated ball parks.  It's a global park and we're all players. The problem is that not everyone plays by the rules and respects the rights of others.
When the good Muslims Head to Iraq and Syria and all other hotspots in huge numbers to snuff out the bad within, we can talk. To parade them across the stage with no answers is not going to get it. What was Hilary's point? A lot of other folks have given the ultimate. Perhaps we should keep this out of politics.
Actually I do understand them. Their origin goes back to the BNA act and was intended to ensure that the Catholic minority in Upper Canada was able to maintain their religion in the  face of a Protestant majority. Not unlike Muslims facing a Christian majority today wouldn't you say?  Although the difference is that Muslims aren't asking for a whole separate school system, they are asking for a room, one day a week. And what's even better is that the Muslim students are part of the same diverse school as all the other kids from all different backgrounds, and they are all learning the same subjects side by side. They aren't having their education framed in a religious context unlike publicly funded Catholic schools today.  You do know that the checkbox on your property tax is only to indicate which board you vote for in municipal elections right? It has nothing to do with where your tax dollars go.  How's that? No research necessary.
Mr. Trump's already begun implementing his stated goals to (1) create a Muslim registry in the U.S. (much like what happened in Germany under Hitler with Jews, Hungarian gypsies, & intellectuals); (2) isolate America by reneging on trade agreements with nations, which will raise prices here (we don't produce everything); (3) break up NATO alliances which provide mutual security and limit nuclear weapons; (4) squash the free press and dissent; (5) abolish Obamacare, leaving millions uninsured, many of whom will die without care; (6) resume the Keystone & Dakota pipelines; (7) deregulate car and air pollution standards & deregulate  controls on risky Wall Street trading; (8) deny climate change and the erosion of the ozone layer; (9) privatize Medicare & Social Security & eliminate Medicaid.(Not enough space for more.) If Americans are passive and remain stubbornly uninformed until something bad happens to THEM, then it will be too late for us all.  We get the government we deserve.
O wise one! Did I say the Muslims were not fighting each other? They were. But they didn't kill the Jews by the thousands or millions either.
You need to learn and understand what "separation of church and state" is.  Secondly, your post is inappropriate; Change Catholic to Islamic and face the repercussions from the left.
Your son should not be praying in school hours. Take him to Masjid after school hours on a Friday to pray along with you. Oh, I forgot you being a woman won't be allowed to pray in the same room as him!            Why don't you persue your activism against the Imam and the Sharia or whatever law which won't permit you pray in the Masjid along with him instead of writing opinion pieces in the 'progressive' newspapers like the G & M.          How about if Hindu students, Buddhist, Sikh, Christian children etc. start demanding  facilities and privileges as you are doing? The liberal apologists for the Muslims did not think of that when the school boards gave these special religious privileges to pacify Muslim parents as you played the victim card. Hindus do special prayers to their gods and goddesses on Tuesdays and other religions also have special assignments for prayers.  Keep religion in your homes and masjids and don't stick out like a sore thumb.
Compare, then, the number killed by Muslims over the last 100 years or so and the number killed by Christians in the same timeframe. What's your answer?
The same thing we are doing now.     It's so strange to read the comments on this story.   Some here seem convinced there's a mass movement of marches and riots against immigrants, or a crime ways of assaults against them, or public opinion polls that express racist sentiments against Muslims.    All of these notions are fantasy.
Another Radial Islamic atrocitiy.
Iraq may have been an enemy of the US under Saddam Hussein but is currently one of America's key allies in fighting ISIS. It is Iraqi troops who are doing most of the hard work and taking the casualties. Telling Iraqis that we want you to  fight ISIS for us but we don't want you in our country is insanity. It is already creating a major backlash in Iraq which will hurt the fight against ISIS. In any case, no citizen of Iraq has been involved in any terrorist act in the U.S and neither have citizens of other countries on the list. By far the biggest terrorist threat in the U.S. has been and will continue to be self-radicalized Americans. The anti-Muslim attitude of the Trump regime will just increase this risk.
A must see: Heated argument erupts as Australia's Muslim leaders address Manchester attack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRPzkB5mr1U
Hardly a century old:  crg.berkeley.edu/content/islamophobia/defining-islamophobia The term "Islamophobia" was first introduced as a concept in a 1991 Runnymede Trust Report and defined as "unfounded hostility towards Muslims, and therefore fear or dislike of all or most Muslims."
Have you ever heard of "perception is reality"?  Emotions are not based on reality: that's why they are called emotions.  Emotions drive how we react to the world around us.  Hopefully there is some fundamental rationality and decency in our emotions but that is not always guaranteed, psychologists will tell you.  To react, to show emotions contrary to the politically correct leftist and globalist dogma of the so called elites who are in government today does not make one a racist or a bully.  This article attempting to portray Canadians as a bunch of xenophobic racists is pure gibberish.  Canadians, who are largely decent and tolerant folks are just saying that they are uncomfortable with the Muslim symbolism all around them.  Their perception is based on what they see and what it means to them.  Statistically the numbers may be small but the evidence is everywhere and it says to Canadians, loud and clear: we want to remain different, we don't want to integrate in looks or in culture!
"We need to talk about Islamophobia, white supremacy and far-right terrorism."  Too late. You missed your window of opportunity of about six hours without an Islamist terrorist attack.  It's been two days since the London attack on Muslims which killed one.  Since then we have had an Islamist terrorist attack in Paris and today an Islamist terrorist attack in Brussels. Not counting yesterday or the day before when there was an Islamist terrorist attack in Mogadishu, Somalia that killed about 50 innocent people.
Events like this are exactly what one expects from the Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric and actions.  Stephen J. Remington
The fundamental problem is that the majority of otherwise peaceful and law-abiding Muslims are unwilling to acknowledge, much less repudiate, the theological warrant for intolerance and violence embedded in their own religious texts (Qur'an and Hadith). The West needs to challenge and debate the very substance of Islamic thought and practice.  We need to hold Islam accountable for the acts of its most violent adherents and demand that it reform or disavow the key beliefs that are used to justify those acts.   The West needs to support moderate Islamic reformists like Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Canadian Muslim reformist Raheel Raza,  Imam Tawhidi, and Maajid Nawaz who give peaceful alternatives to one of the most important issues of our time.
HRC emulates a Matador. She attacks Trump personally ... & like a bull he charges the cape, while the matador stands, smiling, safely to the side, avoiding discussion of issues of real substance.    IF Trump can't listen to his coaches for a change, he will surely sink his own ship ... & all Americans go down.    Clinton promises more government growth, more muslim refugees, porous borders, more corruption via the Clinton Foundation & other avenues. We'll see Obamacare remain, increased influence of islam in the USA, more terrorism, a weaker military, rise of Iranian nuclear power, just a more horribly compounded mess for us Americans.     Of course when she finally leaves office, its likely that she & Bill will try to steal the dishes, silverware & furniture as they did when they left before.
Race, Islam..... these words get thrown around a lot, just keep in mind, Islam is not a race. Don't confuse the two.
What possible evidence do you have that Islam (or Hinduism or any of the 10,000+ religions found in recorded history) is a false religion but that Christianity is not?  It can't be from your God since you have no evidence that your God exists.
My post said: "I am looking for any learned opinions on why the left supports radical islam."  I didn't ask why the left supports all muslims, nor do I even know that to be the case.  I asked why the left supports radical islam specifically.
Seriously, Islam has made a LOT of bad press in the last 20 years. These Islamic communities should lighten up about flaunting their "Islamic clothing" in north america, where we have many young people who have given up their lives fighting Islamic extremism.
Out of curiosity, what differentiated the Orlando shooter from the shooter in Ft. Lauderdale last week?  Or the shooter in Cancun yesterday?  How come only one of the three was branded a "terrorist" while the other two were just "gunmen"?  The Ft. Lauderdale shooter was called a mentally unstable individual, but the Orlando shooter was a deranged terrorist inspired by ISIS?  Why, just becuase he was brown or a Muslim?  These double standards are outrageous and need to stop.
So funny most U.S. Citizens get their "Opinions" from the Democratic Party's $5 Billion A Year Propaganda Machine that is funded by U.S. and International Corporations.   And even worse were Brainwashed by the Democratic Party's U.S. Labor Union Owned Teachers and Professors.  Facts what I learned from having to deal with the Muslims since 1982, as well as formal training and education (University and Madrasa not at the U.S.).  Muslims have a Culture of War.  The Holy Koran was written by Mohammad as a Military Commander demanding 100% Support from All People to Support his Large Armies that were conquering "The Known World".  109 Suras of the 114 Suras of the Holy Koran are the Written Declared War Against Christians, Jews, Unbelievers (Kafir).  The Celebration of Ramadan is the Celebration of the Defeats and Massacres of Christians, Jews, Unbelievers.  Sura 2 All Muslims must join the Jihad against the Christians, Jews, Unbelievers, no excuses, as proof of being a Muslim.
Muslim Ban, Build a Wall, Deportation squads, and you think the fact that he mail ordered a bride, a white woman from eastern Europe it shows he is not biased?  Trump admits to having not heard the comments but still reacts angrily on twitter.   Your double standard is pretty well actualized in your post.
"A man not to be admired?"  I admire no man or woman that belongs to any of the racist hate organizations that are listed on the Southern Poverty Law Center's website.   And Ali has been a member of the extremist Nation of Islam sect since 1964, when Malcolm X welcomed him in, and gave Ali his new Islamic name.  Is everyone here really that ignorant about the kind of fanatical extremist religious sect the Nation of islam is?   You really don't care that he belonged to a group that is in favor of segregation, is against miscegenation, is anti-semitic, and condemns the LGBT community as sinful??  Please go to this link and do some reading about them:  https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam
We have good reason to fear Islam.
What do you expect ?......There are 57 Muslim Countries in the UN that gang up against the only democracy in the middle east a tiny country called Israel....On top of that it is well know that Obama orchestrated the whole resolution, it's no secret that Biden was calling Ukrainian PM for example, and demanding that Ukraine support this resolution. So how can you be surprised that this one sided resolution passed?  There is no such thing as "Palestinian territory" international conventions are binding only on those who signed them, namely the "contracting parties." But neither the PLO nor the Palestinian Authority have ever signed these texts. On top of that international laws put forward by the Palestinians are acts signed between States, and the obligations or prohibitions contained therein are relevant to States. Neither the Palestinian Authority nor the PLO are States, therefore, none of these legal documents apply.
Good points, oldgit.  I agree that the preoccupations of the majority of muslims are similar to those of non muslim Canadians (earning a living and raising a family) and that M-103 is setting them up as targets.  Further, I believe that they are being used by the less numerous radicals in their midst, as well as the Liberal enablers of the radicals, to further an agenda that is not good for either non muslims or moderate muslims.
I'd rather be friends with Goldman Sachs than Radical Islam-take your pick.
Janet Claire, Islam does not preach mass murder of innocent people.  You have fallen for alternative facts.
Two words - "Islamic Terrorism"  This is the third "accident" in two months.  The first two have been found related to ISI - sponsorship as per the culprits caught near the Nepal border.  I see lot of "First World" smugness here.
Your charity is inspiring.  I hope this Somali immigrant finds her place in our white, privileged country, that took in her and her extended family and gave them benefits which I assume they are still receiving. Sad she feels so unwelcome, but Muslims need to take a hard look at the ideology they are following and the death and destruction Islam has left in its path since its founding and the commands found in their "holy" book to kill all the kuffar. So if people in the US are fearful, it's probably because they know the history of the Muslim conquest and the Hijra, which you as a Catholic seem to not be aware of. We also need to be charitable to our President who understands this threat. And where is the charity and acceptance of Muslim refugees in the rich gulf states? Not one of their own Muslim brethren have they taken in. May our Lord protect us and our country from evil. I hope this immigrant  Is inspired by your Christian charity and accepts Christ into her heart.
She married a foreign national, in whose culture the children are his, not hers. Her predicament is not unique. In fact more and more Canadian women are marrying Muslim men than ever before and are finding out the hard way that she is the loser. You can't fix Sharia law.
You are correct, Shawn. It is not the police that members of the LGBTQ community need to fear.  Trevor Phillips, a former head of the equality and human rights commission (Britain), recently produced a documentary, "What British Muslims really think", that premiered on Channel 4 recently in GB. It reports the findings of a large-scale survey of British muslims. One of the findings is that 52%  feel that homosexuality should be illegal. Other results of the survey, reported in "The Spectator" - a respected British publication - here: https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/04/why-do-we-pretend-that-all-muslims-are-sweet-smiley-and-integrated/ I don't expect this to pass the "civility" test of the G&M but at some point we have to start a debate based on fact rather than fantasy. Censoring the messenger won't work for ever.
1. That particular cross is not 75 years old. The cross that is there is not the original cross. The standing cross has been there since the late 60's. 2. If Becket has led you to believe that they represent religious freedom for people of all faiths, you've been bamboozled. Simply took at their case database; clearly they represent just one faith. I doubt Becket would represent Satanists' or Muslims' efforts to put up their own monuments alongside Christian ones that stand on public ground. 3. The plaintiffs (some of whom are local) would be happy if the cross were moved to private property for Christians to enjoy; it doesn't have to be destroyed. 4. This case is not about the "right to remember." 5. Thanks for wasting public funds fighting a losing battle. This case has already cost us over $130,000. "Pro bono" representation will not cover AHA attorney fees if Pensacola loses this case.
Me neither.  Another thing I'm not going to do is think all muslims are like that - no more than I'm going to think all Americans are like Stephen Paddock or all Canadians like Jim Keegstra.
I think Couillard was right to link Islam and terrorism and to suggest that in Canada Muslims should be more involved in preventing terror.  I believe that Couillard's message is also a call for Canadian Muslims to try harder to integrate the Canadian society and Canadian culture,
Canada no longer has the population to support high-risk, long-term overseas commitments. The country is aging rapidly and Islamisizing rapidly. In particular, getting involved in the messy business of fighting radical Islam poses very serious consequences for Canada back home. The policing and security services costs alone will be hefty.   If there is a threat, it could be argued it is in the North, where the battle for resources is underway (though, to be fair, Canadians have more in common with Russians than with Africans). .
My Uncle died in WW11.  To protect the values that are enshrined in our constitution.  The value that I was specifically referring to is freedom of religion. Trump is prejudiced against Muslims.  His rhetoric is what encourages acts such as the killings at the Quebec City mosque.  He encourages irrational hatred. Regarding my phrase "any price" - there could well be a price, but I do not think it will be great.  And those that may lose their jobs will find other ones.  Canada has a lot to offer the world.  We don't need to be so dependent on the US for our prosperity. And I really don't think Americans will have much of a stomach to subsides their industries to provide jobs that the marker cannot justify. We are all blessed to live in this country
A few questions: 1) the travel to the  USA restriction only coves 15 percent of all Muslims.  So how is it religious discrimination? 2) Are non- US citizens protected the constitution or the bill of rights?
First off, I have to say I lived in Waterloo by the university where if you were white and male you definitely were a minority-and I have no problem with that.  But I have to say ''excellent point', like many pundits, the advice offered here would best be utilized by the writer of this piece.  I certainly 'get' the fear that minorities have, there can be serious repercussions.  However, apart from a very small number of cases we are a remarkably peaceful society.  Because some body says "it  seems like muslims are everywhere"  doesn't necessarily even indicate a fear, let alone that the speaker wants to lobby for draconian public policy (or that their government would listen).   The 'false perception' clearly affects this writer as much as, or more, than the people she uses in her example.
Similar to the "bomb threat" against muslims in Montreal this week which was attributed to the far right.  Turns out that the guy who sent the threats is a Montrealer originally from Lebanon with no links to the right.
History?  Tomás de Torquemada is lurking there, safeguarding Catholic orthodoxy. The witch hunts of Europe are aflame there, and Muslims didn't set them. You can hear the gurgling of waterboarding there, but Muslims are the victims. You can see crucifixions there, planted by the Romans. The Soviets are there. The Nazis. The Chinese showing you that the death of a thousand cuts is a real thing. The Huron and Iroquois are there, too.  History.
A superficial piece obfuscating some basic realities. This isn't about tactics - it's about the long game. As long as the Arab world is divided,  Israel is safe.  Don't discount that.  But this  strategy is mostly about trying to further isolate a dominant Iran which is in Israel's interests. That is the long game.  Qatar is a side show in comparison .   Turkey is run a by a  government  that is all but in name  the Muslim Brotherhood.     Interesting that Iran, Russia and Turkey have a solution to bring stability to Syria which they are  implementing.  Zones of control  - which THEY control.   The US regional strategy has been put on hold. So the Americans  counter with this lame isolation tactic.  So what will Israel and the US do when they  have  no more "friends" in the region they can manipulate?   Rely on that  staunch advocate of women's equality and human rights: Saudi Arabia? The primary supporter of global terrorism as has been the case since at least the 1980t
Peter Campbell... there is a difference.  "This is the Canadian way. We do not actively force people to become "like us", we simply assimilate them into our culture without a ripple."  --- The difference is YOU are forcing people to be different from what they want to be.  I mean... Remove your Niqab or else.  Remove your hijab, or else... (i.e. no employment). Hate crimes have gone up. True, some Ontario Muslims were against Sex-ed...but the bigger majority was okay with it. Were you living under a rock??
With France and the Free World now in shock and mourning, the aftermath of this horrific tragedy is all but guaranteed to play out in this fashion:  1) France will once again witness what EU policy has done to them regarding the forced acceptance on non-vetted Islamic extremists into their villages and communities. One of hundreds of reasons why Britain left the EU will once again become clear.  2) While other world leaders will, this U.S. President and his administration will instead continue their cowardly rhetoric of not calling terrorism or our enemy by its rightful attribute and title: “Muslim and Islamic Terrorism and Jihadism.” They will be bolstered by Leftist media.  3) Any subsequent pushes by anti-Second Amendment zealots for gun control will include the lie that “No other western country has the level of mass gun violence the U.S. has”- and they will omit this attack, and the fact that France's nor any country's draconian firearm restrictions do nothing to stop criminals.
Sigh.  Yes, DB-TA, protecting unpopular citizens like muslims from a government decision - in this case government decision by referendum.  That's exactly the kind of thing that Constitutions do, in Canada and elsewhere.
Muslims are determined to establish themselves in our Christian world. They want to reap the rewards of our labour. Don't give them an inch, or they will take a mile. This is so very serious. Please people, open your eyes. protect your children.
Please stop calling this group Islamic State...there are other names out there such as Daesh....
Just like all Muslims are not terrorists, so too it holds that not all Trump supporters are White supremacists and just because you are a White Nationalists, that doesn't make you a NAZI.  Take Mexico for instance, in their constitution they actually have a clause that says 'Mexico, has to remain, Mexican.'  Are Mexicans racists?  Japan has a very strict immigration policy and no question, they will maintain their homogeneity.  Certainly not the levels we see in ONLY White Nations, where 1/4 of mothers in Germany and the UK are foreign born and counting.  Why hasn't the G&M covered the racists attacks on Whites in the UK? The college professor? The white mother where her baby was spit on and told white people shouldn't breed? The NO WHITES ALLOWED after 8 pm in Birmingham UK.    There is big money in War and big money in Trafficking: UN, Catholic church, Turkey's President , all under the guise of Diversity.  NGO's working around the clock breeds white Nationalism,  and yes be proud.
It's your buds over at Stormfront, "Lars." Join Date: Oct 2013 Location: Germany Posts: 3,616 "Freedom lover" Portland: Two stabbed to death on train while protecting Muslims I like it. Two incidents in one day reported here on SF of people reacting to the encroaching menace of islam'. First, the guy who tore up the koran, and now this warrior who defended American cultural norms. Are we seeing the beginning of an uprising against the plague of islam, an uprising which will spread like wildfire into white lands in Europe? Hell, I hope so. Remember, it isn't always the German's who have to take the lead in pro white matters. I hope this time the first dawn of resistance emanates from the world's superpower, the USA  And: RONA Renegade posted: Forum Member Video of Jeremy Christian righteously pxxxxd off White American at a Free Speech rally.

I agree he should be release. Let's give him the opportunity to be "the best" Muslim he can be in Turkey. Wonder if his one way ticket is still valid?
Jack, Not paranoid at all.  What Mr. Schwab is doing, in his own words, is exactly what he and others on the left accuse conservatives of every time a person of the Islamic faith blows up a bldg. or runs people over.  He is equating ALL Trump supporters with the actions of ONE sick individual last Saturday in Charlottesville.  He has put every single Trump supporter behind the wheel of  that murder weapon.  How different is that from labeling all Muslims terrorists, due to the actions of one,  or  some Muslims?. Please explain if you think you can..   It is no different. .  If Mr. Schwab didn't have double standards, he wouldn't have any standards at all.  I have the common sense to know that  most Muslims are not terrorists.   Mr. Schwab, on the other hand,  condemns  every single Trump supporter and in doing so he proves he hasn't any common sense, only hatred of his fellow humans he believes are  deplorable. I do not  expect an apology from this man.
Just watch the hearings for yourself-- Republican Chair and Democrat Minority. The Russians generated fake news specifically the pedophile pizza shop, Obama the Muslim, Hillary has Parkinson's and many more traced to Russians. The term "fake news" was started by the Russians. Watch or get transcripts of the hearings.
It is Quran BTW - Read the verses in the Quran and take them in context, they are commands to the followers, stated plainly and clearly,  and I noticed you still dodge the question about the commands of Christ, there aren't any verses. The Lutheran Church as a whole is just about on par with the Russian Orthodox church - Dead Orthodoxy filled with unbelievers because they still baptize babies and have filled the Church up with Apostates. Go ahead and label me a "loon" I don't need a kooky website to address a simple issue, I read the OT in context, you have demonstrated your biblical ignorance.
Proven to be right about his 2015 Muslim ban is a comment and not a promise.
Thank you, Sister. How I wish today's conservative Catholics would educate themselves about the immigrant, post-immigrant  lives of their American-Catholic ancestors.    They adopt the very hating and bigoted beliefs and tactics that were used against their  Catholic great grandparents.  They enthusiastically align with the Religious Right who proclaimed "No Irish Need Apply" or "Dago  Go Home." They have traded Hate Micks for Hate Gays, Hate Libs, Hate Feminists,  Hate Dems, and Hate Muslims---and see no irony!   "Hate sin but love sinners" is always the convenient mantra of those who get to define "sin." And being a Catholic was/is a great sin to  2017 "allies for the cause" not  long ago (Tuesday?)  Grandma O'Brien and Grandpa Marinelli (Al Smith too) wonder why many Catholics have adopted the very thinking that degraded them.   Conservative Catholics eagerly sought and got arranged marriages of convenience (I see Phyllis Schlafly-Donald Trump).    There will be a morning after.
Why does love have to require touching strangers?   There are other major religious cultures (Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam) where the people express fellowship without needing to hold hands or kiss.  Paul's letters don't define my practice of Christianity.     And Jesus was betrayed with a kiss.
Andy Holleman, do you agree that is ok to establish a Muslim-only village? That sounds unconstitutional.
Obama put restrictions on that exact set of countries. Contrary to the lies from the left, including WaPo editorials that did not even mention Obama policies, Trump did not put extra restrictions on any country that Obama did not also put extra restrictions on.  Most Muslim majority countries are not on Trump's list, the ones that are the ones unable or unwilling to give us proper credible background in the immigrants. We have a good track record in getting background and cooperation from police and intelligence services in Jordan or Turkey on immigrants. We have imperfect but some measure of effort at least in them assisting us finding out  whether the immigrants are known terrorists, murderers, pedophiles, or even that they are who they say they are. No such thing currently exists in Syria, iran etc.
I would be interested in knowing what was really behind this volte face  Couillard had been so unquestioningly supportive of the muslim community for years that it defied logic and brought him scorn, but he refused to budge.
Burn in h3II muslim pos!
What is your point?  Is is that you deny the homeowners lacked the right to vote on a zoning issue?  Or is it that the prospect of possible influence by La Meute invalidates the homeowners' rights?  Or is it that even a suspicion of anti-Muslim sentiment is enough to invalidate the homeowners' rights?
What the world is facing is a population problem presently 7.2 billion people by 2097 it will be 11.1 billion people. Majority of the growth in the Muslim world and Africa. Average size family in Denmark and Japan is less then 2. In Nigeria highest in the world it is 12 children. Pakistan is 10 and Egypt is 9. What the world needs is more responsible nations and more birth control. One more time Birth Control, again Birth Control.
that sounds a lot like Churchill and others putting a lot of Jewish people into Muslim Palestine, doesn't it? ----------------------- Muslim Palestine? Islam was founded in 7th century so how old is "Muslim" Palestine? and when was there ever an independent Palestine, never  Jews have been in Palestine for over 4,000 years and even in the 20th Century before the  UNITED NATIONS (not Churchill) founded Israel  If Chris knows his history he might not be so sympathetic to those who start wars of annihilation and then pose as victims
I am sure you do. The vilification of Muslims is something Harper enthusiastically encouraged in the last election.. Most of us are happy every day that dismal creature is gone.
Not all cultures are equal. Case in point, Christ preached, ‘love thy neighbor’. The Qu’ran on the other hand with its Sword Verse (ayat as-sayf), the fifth verse of the ninth sura, preaches a completely different set of ideas. Why is there even a discussion about whether or not Muslims are allowed to use Canadian schools for their ideological purposes? Why this ideology is allowed at all in Canadian society I guess would be another discussion.
Is there any topic the G&M opinion writers can scribble about without including a virtue-signaling  gratuitous swipe at the current US administration: "As creepy and unsettling as U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence is ...."? Where is a program of women as breeders, enslaved and auctioned off at markets, actually being carried out? Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). But nobody waxing on about Atwood's tale ever mentions it. Think about it.
Over the last 1200 years until this very day, millions and millions of Muslims have been killed by members of other Muslim sects and groups. This has been going on even before the "west" , US and UK existed.
As usual, this discussion quickly  degenerated in to the usual knee-jerk reactions for and against guns and Muslims.  Only Listening to Grasshoppers seemed  to focus on the tragic deaths themselves--could it be that it's because folks assumed the victims were mostly LGBT?  L2G:  "My deepest condolences to the victims, family and loved ones. Then the YouTube star and XVoice runner up, young Christina Grimmie, 23, shot and killed in Fla..........I’m just sick to my stomach. It’s all too much.     To those lost may you rest in peace and may God have mercy on their souls. l2g".  .................................Thank you L2G
Not "Muslim religion", but Islam, lol. Not Wahhabism, but radical Salafism. Wahhabism is just a doctrine, a strict interpretation of Islamic teachings, which is officially entrenched in the Saudi state. It's not that extreme, per se, as to inspire terrorist acts. But radical Salafism is, indeed.
Show me where I've defended Islam.
Yet, we all now know that there never was any valid reason for the United States to invade and take over Iraq, wasting $1 Trillion dollars in the process, as well as a 4,452 American lives, with over 32,000 wounded, many crippled for life.   And then there are all of the mentally damaged veterans from that unnecessary war, killing themselves via suicide, and even sometimes suicide by cop.  People who defend America's invasion and occupation of Iraq are indeed the most crazy folks on earth.   Not only did it harm our own country badly, but it totally disrupted the balance of power being Sunni and Shia Muslims in the region, bringing about the Syrian Civil War, the creation of ISIS, and the deaths of countless thousands of Muslims, plus endless suffering to the region.  George W Bush was clearly the worst President the USA ever had.   If Gore had been elected instead, our country would be so better off today than it currently is.
His relationship with the press cannot be a sign of "fascism" by any coherent definition of the word.  Now, if he advocates for laws banning freedom of press and prosecuting reporters for news he happens not to like, as did Abraham Lincoln, you'll be cooking with gas. Of course the Federal courts in their present state would make short shrift of that.  Abraham Lincoln, btw, comes closer to a "fascist" than Trump based on what he actually did.  The only "Muslim Registry" proposed was basically the same on proposed after 9-11 of Muslims in the United States based on country of origin. There was never a proposal that American citizens register their religion with government for a registry.
"Many radical environmentalists can accurately be labeled “nature mystics.” And many of them express affinity with religions they generally consider more nature-beneficient than occidental religions, such as those originating in Asia such as Buddhism and Daoism, religious beliefs or practices surviving among the world’s remnant indigenous peoples, or being revitalized or invented anew, such as PAGANISM and WICCA. Paganism and Wicca are considered to be (or to be inspired by) the Aboriginal nature religions of the Western world, which have been long suppressed by imperial Christianity and Islam."
SICKNESS IS AS SICKNESS DOES: NOW, THE MULTICULT ACCUSE CANADIANS OF BEING MENTALLY ILL IF THEY OBJECT TO THE AGENDA OF OUR LIBERAL ISLAMIC COALITION GOVERNMENT! KARIM ACHAB, a linguistics professor at the University of Ottawa, said any word with "phobia," such as claustrophobia, sociophobia or homophobia, implies a disorder and suggests people who have a negative opinion about Islam and who are vocal about it SHOULD BE SEEKING MEDICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP.
Wrong! It's the Muslim communities who usually notify the authorities when a young man is radicalized. They warned the authirities about the Manchester bombers way before they planted that bomb.
Reply to PRAYFoRMOJO:  You have to remember just how creative the extremists are.  Their fellow extremists (al_qaeda) turned huge American planes into flying bombs aimed at the 9-11 New York Trade Centre.  They used remote controlled garage openers to make bomb triggers for IEDs ("improvised" explosive devices).  Recently the Islamist State have used those heavily armored troop carriers that U.S. forces left behind in the Middle East. They load those vehicles with explosives and turn them into almost unstoppable mobile bombs. Not only are the extremists creative, they are well funded.  (Your basement experiments might be more successful if you received funding from billionaire patrons.)
Hundreds of new species of algae can't be threatening Hawaii.  Thousands of new immigrants arrive in Hawaii every year and its not threatening either.  Micros, Muslims ,  more people from China,  allova people stay coming.  If people not threatening then how is algae threatening?
Axel  A majority of Muslims consider Aga Khan and the Ismailis to be heretics.   Knowledge of Islam doesn't seem to be your forte. Please read some more.
Married to a Muslim Turkish woman? You lead with that and then expect anything else you say to be taken seriously? Yowsa.
I think it best left as "religious discrimination"..... Why should "Islam" be set on a pedestal..... That attitude really does get quite tiresome.....
The question remains is if there is fear of Islam in western Societies and whether that fear id justified.  It obviously is.......................  https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/site/the-list.aspx  Of course we are also fearful of China of which we have many in Canada.  So should we pass another resolution banning Chinaphobia.  How about the Russians and Russophobia ?  Surely, Trump is feared by many here in Canada.  How about Trumpophobia ?  And then there are those Leaf Fans..
That's because you live in an affluent society. In Nigeria, there have been a number of huge explosions where local people have actually breached gasoline and oil pipes to steal the contents. You're not going to hear an announcement from a minaret in Canada about spilled oil/gasoline either! This isn't a Muslim vs Christian thing, it's a poor vs comfortable thing. In Nigeria, Christians and animists get killed in the fireballs with equal opportunity to Muslims.
Anyone going to mention these were Muslims? From Africa?
10 percent of Indonesia is Christian, 1.7 percent is Hindu, 0.7 percent is Buddhist. 87 percent are Muslim https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Indonesia#Religions  While Jews make up 1.2 percent of the US population, and control a good section of the US economy, there still is no Jewish public holiday. Because in Christian countries, non Christian holidays are not allowed. It is enough that non Christians are allowed to live in the country, and allowed to practice their religion.In Indonesia, all religions are given equal respect by the law.  For every Saudi Arabia, there is a tolerant Muslim country like Indonesia. In fact, Indonesian has 6 times more Muslims than Saudi Arabia.  Something most people on this forum know nothing about.
Duckling.....  How many Muslim refugees are living under your roof?
British Teachers “Scared” To Teach Students About 9/11, Worried They Will “Offend” Muslim Parents /Telegraph
Journal de Montréal/ Lundi, 6 février 2017; Fatima Houda-Pepin “Is there are racists in Québec? The answer is Yes.   Is Québec a racist society? The answer is No.  The ball is now in the camp of the Muslim communities themselves. Extremists feed off each other to their mutual hatred. We cannot combat racism if you can't fight hate speech and violent jihad against the "unbelievers". Like the people of Québec, Québec Muslims must show their humanity by denouncing violence committed in their name and in the name of Islam. We cannot continually ask others to do what we reject for ourselves.” - «…Because they predate the birth of Islam, these clothes (chador, burqa and niqab) are NOT religious symbols, but signs of the enslavement of women...( )... man-woman equality is a legacy of the “Quiet Revolution”. Today, we'll give in on it?... » Et Vlan ! pour ton ignorance crasse pipi Shaun !
Excellent post - (If LA ever got the Olympics, I can only imagine the traffic)...If I lived in a US city, I wouldn't want the Olympics (Muslim ban or not)...the world has changed a lot.
I would take Saunders' argument that the level of terrorism in Britain does not merit the obssessive harping on it by the media. I would if the writer did not think it important to point that some of the Islamist terrorists were converts from Christian families. That of course looks like another agenda, one that simply wants make the incidents seem like something else than what they are.  It falls right in with the now routine misidentification by authorities of the perps of the of these attacks. The man with an axe in Duesseldorf's  was thought to be from "former Yugoslavia". He was from Kosovo, a country that the EU recognizes as sovereign since 2008. Khalid Masood, the assassin of Westminster was first described as "Asian". Have you seen the picture of the man?  So, what significance is the finding that some of the terrorists converted to Islam from Christian upbringing?  As far as I am concerned there is none, but I can see that for Mr. Saunders it's a way to beat around the bush.
What about IRA terrorists? They're not Muslim. What about Basque terrorists? They're not Muslim. What about FARC terrorists in Columbia? They're not Muslim. What about the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka? They're not Muslim. You're just plain wrong, as usual.
Like anti-semitism, except directed at muslims instead of jews.
Every time I see someone from the media interview a Islamic Imam or representative, it is always the same thing, they say Islam is a "religion of peace" yet when asked about what they think about gay people or the subjugation of women, they deflect or try to use double speak.  I personally do not see near enough backlash from Muslims on these events.  I know the moderates are probably scared too be too vocal, although pew polls suggest even the "moderates" still believe things like cartoonists portraying Mohammed should be killed.   If only we were blessed with more courageous muslims like Ayaan Hirsi Ali.  Of course the radical muslims, and the vast majority of moderate muslims who still believe in Sharia, killing of gays, and destroying western values, even if they do not act on it, can count on the regressive left of North America, many of which you will see on here on these boards like Sphere Music, to continue to provide them shelter while freedom in America slips away.
Confronting a presidency that has welcomed being described as “disruptive,” McElroy said “we must all become disruptors” but also rebuilders. “We must disrupt those who would seek to send troops into our streets to deport the undocumented, to rip mothers and fathers from their families. We must disrupt those who portray refugees as enemies rather than our brothers and sisters in terrible need. We must disrupt those who train us to see Muslim men, women and children as forces of fear rather than as children of God. We must disrupt those who seek to rob our medical care, especially from the poor. We must disrupt those who would take even food stamps and nutrition assistance from the mouths of children.”  Bishop McElroy has emerged as the leader who has arrived at exactly the right time.  Hopefully, he will get the red hat in the next consistory.
How did you get here?  Wacko Muslim attacks crowd with vehicle and butcher knife - and you are ragging on gun owners.  You have issues.
Does it matter to the innocent victims the precise reason and nature of the actions that caused their deaths? Muslims have a long ways to go to catch up to Western Christians.
That's fine as long as you're okay if the vouchers go to Our Lady of the Rockies school, or Adonai Gadol Yeshivah, or Jameh Madrassa, or Mahabodhi Buddhist Academy, or Gaia School of the Goddesses, or Hitchens School of Free-thinkers. As long as the education meets state standards. In Greeley, two city councilpeople are appalled that the local Muslim residents would dare to apply for a zoning change to build a mosque. Some people are all for freedom of religion -- as long as the religion is one they like.
Our perceptions often disagree about the motives of the reporters... we can only look at what they wrote. I don't see them calling this an anti-Muslim hate crime, but they merely reported the facts: the man was yelling slurs at apparently Muslim women, and then when others intervened they were killed. As you yourself point out, they reported on the variety of the ranting. They also quoted the police chief who used the term "hate speech"... should they have not reported this in order to minimize the importance of the anti-Muslim slurs? Tomorrow you will probably read how the attacker was recently at a rally giving Nazi salutes and yelling racial slurs... will this also be considered needless slanting of the story?
How would they get a foothold?. .. Unless the entire country suddenly became fundamentalist Muslims.   A single seat belonging to a fringe party is hardly going to sway anything politically in Canada.  Unless of course the parliament does not also work on a vote system.
I believe the Trump administration made a big mistake by its strict definition of family members allowed to visit the U.S. from the six Muslim-majority countries.   It knew or should have known opponents would pounce on a narrow definition and, therefore, should have expanded it a bit to deflect challenges and have a better chance of overcoming inevitable appeals in court.  Moreover, the relatives to be allowed in were not coming as permanent residents; they were coming as visitors for no longer than 6 months with a B1/B2 tourist visas.  Why fall on your sword over that?  Those coming to visit still had to be vetted by consular officials issuing tourist visas.  It would have been easy for the State Department to quietly tighten or enhance the vetting process in the six countries to make it a bit more difficult for people to obtain visas, thus minimizing the number of people coming and make it a non-issue.
Censorship to defend Islam is the norm in western media. They submit to Allah, to do what is commanded in the Koran, without even knowing it.
Only Trump identified Mateen, the killer of 50 gay people in Orland, as a Muslim and a terrorist . All other politicians, LGBT community leaders  and media white washed it as simply a grievous crime with no apparent background.  Only  Trump was honest yet the LGBT world  hate him for it.
Eh.  I know your so-called "God's Word" better than you and I'm not a Christian, but a Muslim.  Let's talk Scripture.
Screen them?They let in 70% of the ones running from that !st world country USA,many like the guy in the Edmonton incident don't even provide a birthday so immigration has to give them Jan  1 as their birthday.If they do not even know these people's birthdays how can we call them vetted properly?a Muslim was on an Edmonton radio show who has traveled the world currently living in Australia,he said Canada's borders were the easiest to get in and said he fears for our future.
Canada has a history of socialism and Marxism. For 150 years it has been the same. The missionaries came to Canada to populate the country with Christians. The settlers who were released from prison in Europe with the agreement they would change, become good Christians and live in Canada. - What has changed since 150 years ago? Nothing. They are still trying to push Marxism on natives, on new and old immigrants. They everyone should be the same and Christian (but they do recognize the Jews and Muslims as equal.) It is a caste system. - Canada continues to enslaves the natives with socialism. The right thing to do is free them, once and for all, but giving them their own land, their own country. Let them have their own government, laws and let them solve their own problems.
For 3 percent of the population, they sure take up a lot of the oxygen. I wonder if the author, when discussing fake news, is referring to the reports of attacks on Muslim women that when investigated turned out to be lies.
I suspect Trump haters will be calling this an obvious effort against Muslims to freely practice their religion. What if there happened to be religious information on any of these electronics? Placing these devices in the cargo hold is clearly unconstitutional.
You know what I want to see? A Canada wide REFERENDUM on muslim immigration. I want the PEOPLE to have their say on a very, very important issue for the future of our children and what kind of country they will inherit.
So what exactly are you saying? Drop support for Israel? Pull all forces out of the middle East? Give in to terrorists demands?  Radical religious ideology is what drives them to terrorism. They justify their actions by saying God wants it that way. You cant negotiate with a Muslim who's going to cut your head off or burn you alive because you belong to the wrong religion?  A large part of the Muslim world has declared war on us and we don't know which of them is the enemy. Isn't it prudent to prevent any of them from coming into the country until the war is over? How many Japanese or Germans immigrated to the US during WWII?  Common sense I would think but apparently common sense isn't so common anymore.
It seems off-kilter that permanent lawful residents of the US holding passports from one of those Muslim nations would be denied re-entry to the US.    Weren't they given sufficient clearances from the FBI prior to their adjustment to permanent resident status?    President Trump is now going to learn the hard way that executive powers must be exercised in a reasonable fashion.    Applicants aggrieved from returning to the US may just be the tip of the iceberg when the US Federal Courts become involved.  I'd hate to be The Donald when his voting base realizes they've been sold a bill of goods.    Right Ms. Conway?
Since you've a 'moral problem' (really, no one can be that pedantic about semantics; I like exactitude too but I'm not anal about it) you should consult a dictionary: 'Western': 'situated in the west, or directed towards or facing the west; relating to or characteristic of the West or its inhabitants, or (historical) of or originating from the non-Communist states of Europe and North America' (Oxford online). 'Westernise': '(a country, person, or system) to adopt, influenced or in the process of being influenced by the cultural, economic, or political systems of Europe and North America' (ibid). Cape Town, with it 'cosmopolitan, European' feel is not Mogadishu, except townships and squatter camps. Its presentation is clearly westernised or western (second meaning) relating to/characteristic of the West. QED. You said 'non-Anglican cultures'. Do you mean Catholic, Muslim? You meant 'Anglo', of course. Since you're 'morally' conflicted by such things, confess to the PC police.
It is obvious it was  Trudeau's intention to ENRICH Khadr, not merely compensate him. $1 million would still have been sufficient compensation but wouldn't have been sufficient for Trudeau's desire to curry favour with Canada's Muslims. Trudeau has a personal connection to Khadr that is verges on collusion.
Tell me how you feel about Allah & Mohammad please, your Muslim brothers want your take on this subject.
Hoseloader, Discrimination takes different forms.  Internment camps was one way.  An executive order that takes a step toward banning all Muslims from entering the US is another.
There are acts of violence, mass killings, terrorism, radical Islamist terrorism all over the World. Every Continent, every Country. Some countries have the strongest gun control laws in the World. It is nearly impossible for law abiding citizens to purchase or own a gun in some European countries including France and Belgium. Yet from Norway to Mexico to Russia, to the Middle East, to Africa, to Central and Eastern Europe, mass killings, including terrorist attacks, have put the World under siege. President Obama said there was nothing unique about America.  Obama's failed policies allow illegal immigration,  and fail to properly vet legal immigration.   Obama's denial of the reality of radicalization of American Muslims have made America a shooting range for radicalized and inspired Islamic killers. Deal with the Mexican Cartels and Islamic radicalized Muslim killers. Deal with the mentally insane.  Stop living in denial.   Terrorism is killing Americans.
You're lying, of course, as you always do.  The most successful law firms and attorneys in the country offer their service pro bono to the ACLU in the volunteer attorney program.   It's a long tradition of honoring the rule of law.  You remain mired in your prideful and willful spectacular ignorance, which is sad for an adult.    The fact is, obviously, that you don't know any successful attorneys who work for large firms, and you know it.  Not one.   After the failed initial Trump Muslim ban, I took a paid year leave of absence to fight Trump and his unconstitutional policies.  Our firm has 1,200 attorneys, so pro bono work isn't noticed in the bottom line.  None of this makes sense to you, I'm sure.  You know absolutely nothing about the subjects you nevertheless choose to comment on.  It's a strange way for an adult to act.  Your obsession with me - that prompts your feeble mind to think about me and write about me every single day here - should be a concern to you and your family.
Did President Obama, also?  When he issued a similar order back in 2011? that also did not include high population Muslim countries?
Green is right about the indoctrination of Islam in our public school system and in college campuses across our country they include the Muslim student association or[MSA], CAIR and other Islamic organizations who have infiltrated our miserable house [USA] as they believe in bringing our miserable house down and also Israel which they are trying to do we have to combat this, these organizations are fronts for the Muslim brotherhood who pay these organizations to do Jihad in our academics, want proof go to Youtube and type in jihad in academia and watch the film all this was found on blueprints when we raided the Holy Land Foundation in 2007 a terrorist front in the USA and you will learn what the fifth column in the US is doing, this has been going on for over 20 years and you can see it happening right now.
You loved Charlie Hebdo when it was mocking Muslims, but now that Charlie Hebdo is mocking Texans, you're outrage. I'm laughing my head off at you. Charlie Hebdo mocks everything.
2,360,000 acres never before managed by BLM ! Oh wonderful! BO arrogantly stumbles along, desperately trying to create a "legacy".  Well, he has already created a huge legacy - the worst president in history! His obvious disdain for Christians, for independent Americans, for reasonable requirements like showing his Birth Cert right away then producing a phony one, the list is long. I hope that serious investigations of this street muslim misanthrope's actions will be undertaken & lead to prosecution & public condemnation, humiliation, crippling fines & prison for this massive fraud, but I doubt anything like that will take place as all gubmut types, both L & R would prefer to keep us citizens in blinders to their blunders.
Gee whiz, concern about the reality of Islamic terrorism, and the 13 million plus illegal aliens and the attendant huge loss of jobs for American citizens is "nativism"?
The cultural practices need to first be understood by Canadians before any serious debate can take place. As has been the experience in Europe, many of these practices are carried over into the West, despite them being against the law. This include female genital mutilation, child brides and even using boys as a sexual substitute (in Islamic schools, for example).  If we do not openly discuss these things now, we will face - 5, 10 years from now - the very same scandals that we have had with the Christian brothers, native residential schools etc.
Largest is Indonesia with 62% of the world's Muslims.  They aren't on the list either.
Bart People in various parts of the world can act in concert or independently. There need not be a connection between violence in western countries and violence anywhere else. There is a connection between attacks on western  countries by Muslims -  the countries being attacked had previously attacked Muslims.
Read history. Mohammedan Mecca was dirt poor, still defeated the only two super-powers then - Persia and Rome. And went on to conquer India and rule over it for 700 years.  England was the poorest in Europe, still went on to create the Empire on which the sun never set. The Anglos ruled over much of the world, enslaving Hindustan just like Muslims did before them.  With knowledge like that what claim do you have to be a sher? There are 800 million who live in Hindustan below 1$ a day, which is also the defecation and rape capital of the world. With origin like that I would hide my origins not flaunt them. Oh btw, I was born in Hindustan, but not terribly proud of it. Luckily I lived there only 4 months, thanks God.
Gosh it's a shame that people don't write what you expect or want them too. Must be a minefield every time you open a book or newspaper.   You're the one who started labelling people as conservative and liberal not me, so don't be surprised when that doesn't work out as you expect either.   It's clear where you stand. You expect Muslims to follow your expectations and be clear about their loyalties. Not to rock the boat and show proper deference to the dominant culture.
A drop??!!  We spend more than a trillion on Medicair and Medicaid at the state and federal level combined.  Its so large of an expenditure you wish to pawn it off on the feds.  Losing a war is a lot more expensive than fighting it.  Europe is likely to become a Muslim Nation because we left Iraq.    Defending our nation is a constitutional mandate. Paying for someone's health care is NOT.    People can get a job and pay their own medical premiums without government. Its pretty darned hard to defend our nation without government involvement.
Clearly Obama's leadership in not calling out Muslims worked since this woman(wife) came forward n to the FBI and turned him in. Oh, she didn't? Must be because of Trump's comments????
Wrong. That major Muslim org has publicly said that it subscribes to the Ontario Human Rights Commission's definition of Islamophobia (which is not the one initially used by the TDSB) and has clearly stated what Islamophobia is several times - and it doesn't include what you say.  Fact check, buddy, before you rant.
Anti-religious bigotry against some groups of Christians appears to be acceptable in Eugene.    "Freedom of Religion" in Eugene appears to be applicable primarily to the Christian religions of a particular class and, currently, to the  Jewish and Muslim religions.    As an agnostic, I am personally unaffected, but disagree with the hypocrites involved.
Well good for Nike, bad for women who wanna feel free of that religious suppression, since now it's easier than ever to follow the teachings of political Islam.
Notice how the whole tone of this article is basically geared towards encouraging the public feel sorry for inconvenienced passengers from the so-called "muslim world" rather than the existing (and many more potential) victims of terrorism in the West? Well, BOO Fkn*%#&@ HOO!
I think it is really important to have 2 strong political parties in Canada. Hope the Conservatives get their act together. Instead of continually talking about Canadian values ( i.e. let's make sure we don't allow too many muslims into our country) why are they not talking about the economy.
How about  - An off-hand comment repudiating decades of US-China relations; - A campaign to keep Muslims out of the country that began with comments on the campaign trail and has so far manifested itself in a clumsy, ham-handed, and possibly illegal travel ban; - A complete disdain for ethics laws, and especially those involving conflicts of interest with his family's businesses; - A clear lack of understanding of the rules and function of government; - Upending the National Security Council  by replacing the Joint Chiefs of Staff with a political hack who has a fetish for the apocalypse; - Skipping intelligence briefings to tweet commentary about his daughter's business failings; - Continuing allegations regarding ties to the Russian government - ties that may be he result of blackmail.  Ad Nauseum.  Are you willing to discuss any of these?
Both of those countries had high murder rates when they were at "peace", and the wars there were caused by Islamic fundamentalists. Keep deflecting and spinning...
Perhaps China's censorship of the internet to prevent it's Muslim populace from becoming organised and radicalised is a good idea.  Americans that suggest that they will protect free speech with their lives is becoming factual.
I guess the Lebanese muslim PhD student at Concordia who called in a phony anti-Muslim bomb threat at that university was also Trump's fault? Or the Somalian guy in Edmonton video-taped putting white supremacist pamphlets in people's mailboxes?  Some of these race-based threats are genuine and need to be dealt with severely, but a lot of them are phony ploys by sick leftists who want to further cleave society along ethnic lines. Both groups of people are totally sick.
Canada's Muslim communities  supplied ISIS with many solders, and raised millions for it,  but Muslim here in Canada will be angry if I remind them of that.  Aleppo "fell"   if you side with ISIS. But  it was "liberated" if you side with Assad.    But both sides in the war are Muslim.   So which   side is good in a war of Islamic extremism?   We are not supposed to say that because that is politically incorrect.  We are supposed to believed the taqiyya we are told and to shut  up. We should be celebrating the defeat of ISIS but that is not the story here.
Trump didn't ban Muslims. He issued a temporary ban on people from seven countries which are predominantly Muslim.
That's like saying Europeans are predisposed to genocide. They aren't, and Muslims aren't predisposed to terrorism. Modern terrorism was started in Europe by various kind of ethnic and leftist groups. The IRA, Red Brigades, ETA, etc.
The most frightening belief systems are those that are apocalyptic...in the original Abrahamic belief system , Judaism , the belief is there will be a Messiah that will deliver the faithful to a purely good new era overseen by god; Christianity , the second to arise from the Abrahamic tradition, believers that there will be an apocalypse , Armageddon, with Jesus ( the second coming) returning to earth and leading the pious , the saved, to heaven(Newton calculated that it would occur in 2060); the third of the Abrahamic tradition, Islam, that there will be a Day of Judgement, the annihilation of all life, followed by resurrection and judgement by Allah/ God.  There are other belief systems with their end of the world predictions.  The problem rises that there are fanatical believers , who, thanks to the era of nuclear weapons , who are now in a position to precipitate the predicted apocalypses....
"Belgium would not have prevented the bombings by taking either candidate’s advice — the blow was delivered from within."  By Muslims permitted to re-enter Belgium after many went to Syria and returned.    Trump and Cruz recommend keeping them out of the US, not out of Belgium.   That will help us avoid "a blow delivered from within".
From another Globe editorial by a Muslim community representative today:  "And somehow we couldn’t do enough when police told community representatives that a pig’s head thrown at the same mosque wasn’t considered a hate crime – because the perpetrator was depressed. Or that the torching of another mosque wasn’t a hate crime because the perpetrator was drunk."  Are we to believe that the above actually happened? That police let someone off because the perpetrators were drunk or depressed?  This propaganda/sympathy campaign has gotten out of control.
Third  and last continuation How far will it go? Last year a Hydro worker lost his job because,  not on a workday, after being badgered by a reporter, he admitted he found an off-colour joke funny. This year Jordan-Peterson, an acknowledged first class researcher at UofT, lost his funding after refusing to go along with expanded pronouns. I don't agree with a lot of what this guy said but this response is astonishing and frightening. We got a motion from the government that "Islamophobia" is wrong. Well there are lots of Canadians who have valid reasons to fear Islam - gay, trans and female people. I think both Christianity and Islam are worrisome and now the government is telling me I shouldn't have those feelings. We have a national newspaper tell a very one sided socio-political story and within weeks the government says "Oh, here, have $100M to promote your political views." $100M! Wow! I used to support the left, now I feel I can't. Certainly not the academic left.
Maybe you should do a simple google search on how many terrorist attacks across the world are carried out by radicalized Muslims...
Shall we google how many Christians have charged with violence vs Muslims in america for the last decade and see what happens?
What's the matter Globe & Mail, you can't reveal who's opinion this is? How is it the Conservatives fault again when it was the Liberals that brought this motion forward? The Conservatives brought forward their own motion that includes discrimination against ALL religions including Muslims but its their fault for wanting equality? Huh?
Terrorism is when adjoining countries routinely lob missiles indiscriminately over your borders, with the intention of killing as many people as possible. Terrorism is when people from one nationality stab  innocent people of another nationality on the street with screwdrivers. Terrorism is when people from an adjoining country sneak into your country through tunnels and murder a sleeping mother and her 5 children because they are Jews and not Muslims. Terrorism is when suicide bombers blow themselves up in restaurants with the objective of killing as many people as possible. Terrorism is when someone drives a large vehicle towards innocent pedestrians or at bus shelters to indiscriminately kill people they've never met.   Building houses on disputed lands is not terrorism - Canada has built a country on lands whose title is disputed by its indigenous peoples.   Your hyperbole would perhaps be tempered if the subject of your derision were white Christians, and not Jews.
We have on the planet ISIL, a murderous group self-proclaiming Islam while torturing and murdering citizens in barbaric and cruel ways. Some courageous and principled Muslims have denounced ISIL thus  endangering their own safety and freedom to travel. I am a mathematician serving the Crown *in Ottawa, and illegally and repeatedly distinguished here by the Globe and Mail award of a "Delete" button, after Hugh Winsor, Margaret Gardiner and Rosemary were also illegally editorially silenced in the broadsheet. My associates* are manslaughtered *with Ottawa  police and (majority) judicial complicity.

You cant get out much. This summer I was visiting the Peterborough locks when I had to bypass part of the museum display because the room was commandeered by Muslims at prayer with their shoes off and the woman in the back.  Sometimes it is necessary for religions to morph into the reality of the modern world and the culture of where they reside.
The backlash is against political Islam, not Muslims.
It is interesting to note that Blaine originally proposed the amendment to get support of Roman Catholics by removing controversy about schools. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaine_Amendment  To see who might be bigoted, substitute Muslim or Voodoo for the religion.
If your article is indeed fact ask yourself WHY??? Most groups of immigrants come to our country and become part of it...capitalists, earn money, make a living, exist peacefully for the most part. Some integrate, some don't... Muslims as a group are loud, pushy and in-your-face as if they are owed by the country they chose to immigrate to...always in the news, and going on and on about how badly they are treated.  So drop your burka and take a long hard look in the mirror! The problems is looking at you!
Looking back, was it really a good idea to have Al Sharpton, Black lives Matter (pigs in a blanket, fry'em like bacon), Muslim Brotherhood, on and on, visiting the WH dozens of time? At a time of rampant terrorism, was it a good idea to exacerbate the racial divide? Common sense will prevail in the SC. We're lucky Trump was elected.
Macron made it quite clear at the French Council of the Muslim faith that he expects everyone to uphold the values of the French republic over religious ones--a position that many in Canada would label right wing, fascist. or, yes, "Islamophobic."
Islamophobia appears as the name we apply to what we presume is a singular, common mental cause of unwanted behaviour towards Muslim members of our community. Instead, I do not think there is one, but rather many causes of this behaviour.  Feathering out all these causes will be a vague and, likely, fruitless endeavour.  Let us instead focus on dealing with unwanted behavior and modeling desirable behaviour.  The more we do what is right, the more likely we will end up thinking rightly.
al Qaeda wasn't Islamic?  "...Al-Qaeda (/ælˈkaɪdə/ or /ˌælkɑːˈiːdə/; Arabic: القاعدة‎‎ al-qāʿidah, Arabic: [ælqɑːʕɪdɐ], translation: "The Base", "The Foundation" or "The Fundament" and alternatively spelled al-Qaida, al-Qæda and sometimes al-Qa'ida) is a militant Sunni Islamist multi-national organization founded in 1988[27] by Osama bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam,[28] and several other Arab volunteers who fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s.[29][30][31]...."  Sure was.  Maybe it got diluted by partnering with other "sources", but it definitely had Islamic roots.  Islam was the common thread of people in the middle east, much as Jews used Judaism when their culture and people were scattered.  Is terrorism a religious act?  Certainly not for all.  But, for some, it is.  It doesn't mean we should define the religion from the extremists, though.
On the issue of prayers and burials, maybe it's something the Muslims could give way on a little. For example, why do Muslim children have to pray at school? Why can't they pray at home with their families? Schools are supposed to be secular.  It need not always be us non-Muslims that do the accommodating.
"Muslims use Sharia that does prescribe harsh punishments for acts like adultery." Wow, that's the understatement of the year! But remember those harsh punishments are usually reserved for the women, because they are the nasty ones who lead men astray. Take a look at this video. I like to watch these things because they keep me from becoming naive and gullible. And off-guard.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv-72DSpaE
Where is the Globe's coverage of the Muslim from Canada who tried to kill an American security guard in Flint Michigan? Did  he have it coming?
The citizens of  almost countless Muslim countries have gone through and are going through similar experiences. Drones are especially disgusting ways of killing innocents. What did they do to deserve such treatment?   What did the West do to deserve the treatment it is getting? Palestine, Iraq, Libya, Sicily are the most obvious.   The least we can do is remove Western troops from Muslim countries. What are they doing there?
Rogue Chimp's comment was civil and in no way contravened the forum rules. But it was enlightening. It used the identical words spoken here against Muslims, but replaced Muslims with White Christians. You can imagine that got a lot of response from the bigots.
No we are not hunting for racism. The blatant open racism is increased. Every single one of my friends that belong to a minority says the same. Comments out and about, people not making room for them and being talked "over". It has increased markantly over the last 2 years. Just be a silent observer hanging behind a mixed couple if you don't believe it or walk behind a female wearing a scarf because she is a Muslim. You will hear the most horrible things
Qatar is in a tough spot but if Sunny Ways came out in support of them it would be a big help. It is even worst that the Donald called out Iran for fuding Shia Muslim nut bars, while the whole word knows that Saudi Arabia is funding billions to the Sunni Muslim nut bars. If we remember 19 of the 20 Muslim nut bars that flew into the World Trade Center, Pentagon and the field were from Saudi. The Donald never said a word, he was so duped by the Saudi's, as was Obama.  Cleary it is time to call our the real nut bar funder who spreads hate through out the world.. Saudi Aribia.
Connecting Islam to terrorism in the name of Islam makes about as much  sense as blaming all Christians for the Clan, or the IRA, or the Crusades. And by that I mean that it makes no sense at all. Is Couillard caving to xenophobia?
Why doesn't the Globe & Mail do their research on NCCM before quoting them? They used to be called CAIR-CAN, linked to the Muslim  Brotherhood. Why are the Liberals and the media allowing them to control the narrative in Canada?
According to verses in the Bible, Christians and other people who follow the Bible are supposed to pray at least 3 times a day, in the morning, at noon and in the mid afternoon and people who follow the Bible should be allowed to pray whenever they feel the need.  If Muslims can have prayer rooms in our public schools, maybe people who follow the Bible should demand chapels or prayer rooms in our public schools.  And maybe people of other religions should also demand shrines or prayer rooms in our public schools.
Gary,  A flawed dismissal.   Cigarette companies used candy cigarettes to capture later behavior.  While sublimating mock violence against selected political candidates as "bashing" fun isn't horrific in and of one incident, anymore than kids playing "adult" by "smoking" candy cigarettes is. But condoning this as "cute" helps perpetuate that physical bashing of an individual is OK.   When Trump is President, will it be "cute" to have a Mexican piñata and a Muslim piñata instead?  What's wrong with a pig or a donkey, for criminee's sake?  -- Paul
As one of the dispicable few, I was wondering if all of us conservatives fall into the category of......"coal roller preacher grandkids hoodlums in Homer". I think you would better serve your point of view, or your perception of reality by following your own advise to us and spend some time in Yemen, Oman, Saudi Arabia, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, for example. I have, and your pie in the sky idea of "live and let live" absolutely doesn't exist in those and other Muslim locations. I know.... I've worked and lived there.......
Gary, you are looking at this through the eyes of a Liberal. If Trump "appealed to right-wing zealots" (Not just right-wing -but Zealots yet- read KKK ) it was an unavoidable consequence to speaking the Truth. The Facts Are that we DO Need to address and FIX some serious problems that have been created by, (perhaps) well meaning individuals, but without a full understanding of the consequences of those actions. A metaphor of  having a Front (or in this case a Back) Door on your Home, and then be required by the Govt. to leave the door OFF, is simply an assault on the Liberties and Sovereignty of Us All.  Re: Muslim Immigration "Ban"- only after a thorough Vetting.  Gary, You are purposely redefining what Trump has said "in your own image." You are Not being intellectually honest.
I think we have to remember that this Motion is a long way from mandating behaviour. We should also remember that for some reason every year there are a number of instances involving the Jewish faith and people , but there is no Motion on this before Parliament.If people are discriminated against be they Muslims, Jews, etc we have laws to deal with this, without adding a further layer for a specific group. Every year, someplace in Canada, Christian cemeteries are vandalized, which seems on par with the graffiti at mosques across this country. We deal with this without divising a specific strategy for a specific group. As I said from the outset mandating behaviour towards a specific religion, is not I believe the goal of this committee. If it is, it will change before it ever is finalized.
The problem with this motion is lack of clarity. The OED defines 'Islamophobia' as "Intense dislike or fear of Islam, esp. as a political force; hostility or prejudice towards Muslims"; Merriam-Webster gives the following definition:  irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against Islam or people who practice Islam.   It is the reference to Islam that is problematic. Islam is not a race, ethnicity, or nationality; it is a set of religious beliefs. Criticism of a set of religious beliefs--Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, or Islam--is not the same as prejudice or bigotry to adherents of those beliefs.   It seems to me that the use of this term is an unnecessary distraction from a very important issue, the growing prejudice and hostility towards Muslims in Canada. This bill should be amended, replacing the term 'Islamophobia' with the phrase 'prejudice or hostility towards Muslims'.
Liberals will decide that they will lose the next election without support from Quebec, so the Muslim vote will be sacrificed. But they will continue to speak out on behalf of Muslims in western Canada and hopefully pick up some of their votes...
If I understand this correctly, Trump is a bigot for taking the bait. The Clinton campaign finds a guy that makes his living importing people. A guy that then goes on stage to talk about his son in the same vein as Cindy Sheehan(remember her?). The crowd, what was left of it cheered him on, but booed General Allen and other military folks. This guy then talks about how Trump never sacrificed like they have. Funny, he never mentioned that Clinton never sacrificed either. Trump and Clinton are both rich and neither of their kids spent a minute in uniform, unless it was for cosplay. But I forgot, Trump is a racist. Right, I mean that is what this is all about. Not honoring the American Muslims that serve in the military and go in harms way. Nor do they get around to mentioning the foreign nationals that serve in the military to gain citizenship. They did have 2 folks that were in the country illegally though. All kind of heavy handed, over the top pandering and folks are eating up.
TC, you know there are Muslim immigrants in Anchorage, correct?  You know there aren't suicide bombings in Ann Arbor, Michigan?  The immigrants I know work twice as hard as the average Joe, and that is where fear comes from.
Trump's travel ban that targets Muslim countries?  Pay attention.
Gary, Since the VP is a politician, I think he is going to try and legislate as much of his beliefs as he can get away with; same as an agnostic, muslim, jew, atheist, whatever.  Its up to the rest of us to support/temper/stop that ability.
After the attacks by Muslims in Britain, some people think Islamic jihadists might attack again in Canada.  That's interesting.  How come the Globe & Mail isn't reporting about the Muslim woman wearing a niqab who attacked people at a Canadian Tire store in Toronto just recently on June 5, 2017 and who pulled a knife on police? It was in the Global News.
Exactly. And how about the half a million Iraqi Muslim children killed by the US in the 90's - who the US Secretary of State publicly referred to (on CNN and ABC no less) as "worth killing"?  Both "sides" in this MIC wet dream of "perpetual war" are equally evil - yet no mention of this in the article above.  I wonder why?
Chucky  How many of these countries where "free expression and..." have you lived in? I have lived in 4 Muslim countries, and don't depend on Fox News for information. Pravda was about as truthful as Fox News. The difference was that the Russians knew Pravda was lying all the time.  A problem that I see in many people on this forum is that they are "experts" on Islam, while knowing a very unidimensional aspect of Islamic culture,history, politics or economics. Quick, tell the name of the President of the world's largest Islamic country (without googling it)? Now tell me the name of the President of the world's largest Christian country. Easy, right?
While cultural factors do play a role, Islam is unique: first, in demanding a close relationship between church and state; second, in justifying violence (as a norm) when religious goals are frustrated.  To compare current (21st century) Muslim practice/justification of violence (from sacred texts never officially repudiated or rejected) with centuries old Christian violence is a complete anachronism and, as such, nonsensical.
NO We need to finally talk openly of Islamic terrorism and its ramifications in regard to the massive  influx of muslims into Canada!
I'm not concerned with the actions of Muslims. They're not the ones actively working to deny transgender people their civil rights in the US.  "How am I denying anyone "the ability to live their life the same way everybody else gets to."???" Simple. By supporting the conservative agenda of denying essential health care to any transgender person, you are violating the rights of transgender people. By supporting the act of restricting which restroom  transgender people are able to use, you are not only denying transgender civil rights, you are also interfering with the medical and mental health of every transgender affected by your actions.
A billion Muslims beg to differ. There is no such thing as true or false religion because God is not here in Their true form. None are compelled. The freedom of the will to chose among the options provided by the intellect applies to this question. Religion is a human grouping, better explained by sociology than theology. Now, the Wahabi branch of Islam is a sexually repressed misogynistic homophobic cult. The difference between their sexual views and some Trads is a propensity for violence not seen since the Inquisition. In other words, we are in no position to throw stones, although we can hunt down Wahabi fanatics.
The problem is the Charter of rights can be over written by laws. As we see with Trudeau and Harper, the Charter is nothing but paper these days, a joke. We have already seen speech criminalized. The Charter was suppose to protect us from Harper's and even Trudeau's! Save us money, save us time, give us freedom, real freedom. What it did was give special rights to 'god' the Christians(jews and muslims), The French and the Natives. Pushing the rest of us as second caste citizens.
"Canada, always femnist! Ha!"  Here's another fallacious false dichotomy, that a country is either "always feminist", or it isn't at all.  There is no dichotomy, only a continuum, and Canada is one of the most gender egalitarian, Muslim countries among the least.
Absolutely.  I am getting very tired of articles that make sweeping generalizations about groups - Jews, Muslims, Albertans and so on and so on.  As Oscar Wilde once said - people are either boring or charming.  We need more nice people, more civil people, more manners and a higher level of discussion.  Now.  Can we talk about how we get there?
I really detest the media using the term Islamophobia. A phobia is an extreme or irrational fear of or aversion to something. In spite of all the terrorist attacks in the world, that is not the feeling of the vast majority of Canadians towards Muslims in general. Sure, we might be a little stand-offish - even suspicious - to those who are intolerant to our customs of Human Rights, Women's Rights and open democracy - but hey, what the heck is wrong with that? Our attitudes don't come close to an irrational fear.
Trista, there is an inherent QUALITY to these events that separates them from the statistics of "murders, assualts and killings", i.e. they are done in the name of the religion of Islam, which has a certain penchant for this sort of thing all over the world.  Even so, if you're interested in statistics, you need to use weighted statistics, so your point is really quite embarrassing.
St. Denis is super welcoming for young women in shorts and t-shirts... I notice you completely ignored Sweden's issues and the public advisory to maintain an "arm's length" from strangers in Cologne - but that type of cultural segregation could never happen in Canada, because it's 2017... I don't get it, political Islamism is unapologetic in terms of hostility to female empowerment and virtually every other "progressive" cause (LGBT rights, freedom of expression, maternal health, reproductive rights, etc.) but western feminists and liberal activists are inexcusably silent on the misogyny and subjugation that is commonplace in every country "governed" by political Islam. Especially in countries where it's staring us in the face, like women clubbed by morality police in Tehran for dancing to "Happy" or wearing ripped jeans. This isn't about Muslims, it's about the culture of political Islamism and it's the same all over the world so why should we "accommodate" it in Canada?
I would like to have Muslims forced to learn about loving Christians and respecting women in school.    How many stories has the media hidden from the news?   I would also like to see no prayer rooms in public schools, if the Lords Prayer is such a no no, why the pandering to a religion that has persecuted Christians forever?   This country is so messed up.
What is the Organization of the Islamic Conference doing?  57 Muslim countries  -  must the Christian West now fight Buddhist Burma to protect Muslims?  -  Christians (NATO) already fought Christians (Serbians) to protect Muslims in Bosnia and Kosova what thanks?  -  now let Muslims fight to protect Muslims
Looks like it was another Islamist terrorist attack in Germany.  This time it was an attempt to blow-up the German football/soccer team Borussia Dortmund.  The terrorists attempted to blow-up the team's bus on its way to the stadium to play a game against FC Monaco.  There are tens-of-thousands of Muslims in Europe traveling to Syria and Iraq to join Islamist terrorist groups ISIS and al Qaeda. If you read the German online newspaper Deutsche Welle you'll find that almost every day they report on arrests and raids on apartments in Germany, Austria, Sweden, France, etc, where the anti-terrorist police find guns, ammo, bomb-making material and ISIS flags.
Nor will you hear about Muslim slaughtering Muslims that they consider Infidels...even when a Muslim Canadian is blamed: http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/luckily-i-escaped-man-accused-of-role-in-pakistan-mosque-attack-tells-of-his-return-to-canada  Or when mainstream Muslims kill Suffi Muslims: http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/more-70-killed-suicide-attack-muslim-shrine-pakistan-n721876
Taqiyya is the Islamic practice of pious deception. It can take the form of concealing the full truth (omission) or telling non-believers only what they want to hear (concealment). Taqiyya is as basic to Islam as the Ten Commandments are to Christianity. Taqiyya is the "Fifth Column of the Islam", to protect Allah, Muhammad and the Koran from skeptics and critics. It is anathema to all other religions. It is hard for non-Muslims to understand that it actually exists and is used regularly to demonize us.   Even the Globe's picture  portrays her as the woebegotten victim.
His actions are inconsistent with Christianity. If a Muslim, Hindu, Jew or whatever acts in a way that's inconsistent with their religion I will call that out also.
Instead of apologizing for being an American to all those Arab leaders like Obama did, he called the Islamic Terrorists what they are and agreed with the King of Saudi Arabia that they should be destroyed.  Of course, so many of the terrorists are being supported by the Theocratic Shi'a regime of Iran, it wasn't too hard for the Sunnis in the room to agree.  That's practical politics rather than intellectual pandering to the intelligentsia in this country by refusing to acknowledge that terrorists are terrorists.    I remember when that Muslim doctor shot and killed all those soldiers at Fort Hood and the Obama sycophants and administrators tried to call it 'work-place violence' instead of Islamic Terrorism.  I look forward to his execution.
Here is my view on the situation that isn't popular with left nor right:  We need to start dealing with this terrorism issue for what it is really is. Terrorists come from one religion. Not Islam broadly, but Salafism. When is the last time a Shite has attacked us in the west? Has never happened. When is the last time that a Ismalli attacked us? Never happened. The right doesn't like to hear that Islam isn't the problem, the left doesn't like to believe that one Islamic ideology is behind this. So nothing happens.  The solution to our problem is becoming much more strict on immigration, banning those with religious alliances to Saudi Arabia and its puppet states. We also need to end our love affair with the Saudi's. We've been played for decades. And the first way to do that, is to assure western energy independence. Cut them out of the game. Salafism is a direct threat to our security, our culture, our way of life. Not Islam. It's time we start controlling it much more seriously.
The Mayor of London, a Muslim, welcomes all religions.
Canada stands up for women except if they are Muslim women and under Sharia Law,  where women are treated as second class citizens. Here in Canada Trudeau refers to that as diversity and is fully supportive of it as according to Trudeau this is Canada's strength. Quite ironic isn't it Tommie.
How many Muslims are killed by Western Christian fundamentalists worldwide compared the Islamic radicals on a worldwide killing spree of innocent people living their perfectly socially acceptable lives? Double standard? aBsolutely.
Who said anything about supporting any terrorists?  But having no vetting system is rolling out a red carpet for people too come here, get acclimated and plan their next act of terror.  Are you seriously denying that it's far more likely that someone from a Muslim country would be a terrorist than an American citizen?
Isn't the Trudeau's government affirming  canadians are a racist lot, therefore the need for the m-103 islamophobia motion. Fast forward a few days later, the Globe tell us  they're asking for their own place,  where only muslims will rest in peace, is it because 'muslims' will not want to be buried besides a non-believer.? There, I sanitized my comment as much and over the Globe's requirement. Let's see if this one passes the moderators leanings.
I disagree. That's like saying the Amish and United Church read the same cook book. There is little in common religiously or ideologically with a progressive Ismalli and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Because that worked so well in stopping the Muslim invasion  of middle eastern Christian lands in the 7th Century. Why are progressives so low-knowledge?!
There should be no mass prayer time at a public school. Take a look at countries with a Muslim majority, only one is listed as a democracy, it is Indonesia. They just worked up radical Islam support and their 1st Chinese Christian governor was defeated in an election after being charged with blasphemy. This is after someone altered a recording of him saying something about the Koran. Now the radicals are planing marches demanding he be sentenced to jail.          In Pakistan you can receive the death penalty, for blasphemy, and it is sometimes used against minorities surprise, surpise. ISIS which has gotten recruits from many Westerm countries was beheading and crucifying people. They committed genocide on the Yazidis including enslaving their women. Also 80% of Christians have been killed or fled these areas.        Most Muslim people are peacful but everywhere they are there is a radical element based upon a literal interpretation of the Koran. Separate religion and state.
Revealed: Conway, Bannon Members of Secretive Group August 31, 2016     Mark Potok Senior Fellow  The two political operatives chosen earlier this month to lead Donald Trump’s presidential campaign after two former managers departed have been members of the secretive Council for National Policy (CNP), Hatewatch has learned Longtime Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Bannon, executive chairman of the far-right Breitbart News operation, were named on Aug. 17 as, respectively, the Trump campaign’s manager and its chief executive officer. The appointment of Bannon was by far the more controversial choice, given his role at a “news” outlet known for bashing immigrants, Muslims, women and others. The CNP is an intensely secretive and shadowy group of what The New York Times once described as “the most powerful conservatives in the country.” It is so tight-lipped that it tells people not to admit their membership or even name the group.
The good Bishop's speech is full of misrepresentations. The Bishop's reference to troops and deportations is a bare-faced lie. There is absolutely no basis for such a claim. It is the worst kind of lie--a complete fabrication.   To be concerned for the nation's safety when real problems and threats exist is not equivalent to promoting views about Muslims or anyone that are hateful. It is sad to see a Bishop, using  another version of the "your a racist" or a "homophobe" or whatever ploy.  The accusations are fallacious and we deserve better from a sitting Bishop. It does not become his office to participate in base political rhetoric that.
I hate to disagree with the editors, but I don't think this will damage Trump at all with his base. They didn't mind when he mocked a disabled reporter, or when he bragged about sexually assaulting women, or walking into the dressing room of teenage girls. They didn't mind when he spouted racism against Mexicans and Muslims,  including a Latino judge. Or when he refused to disavow the KKK.  They don't mind that he lies over 70 percent of the time.  So why would this bother them?
Yes more than once, because I cross regularly, and was turned back once because they thought I was going to work. It's no big deal. They are doing their job. And that was before Trump. My sister was regularly questioned and had to wait for more than an hour with a green card as a born white non Muslim, Canadian, all before Trump. It's not irregular. This is why people don't believe the MSM anymore. It's total almost fictionalized 100% bias.
"...Christianity was under attack by Islam..."  He is correct. The crusades have begun. Just like in the Middle Ages, the Crusaders went to fight against the aggression of Mohammed and Islam who were overtaking the Middle East by war and killing.   Research it yourself. Find out why the crusades happened.
You know, shortly after 9/11 there was a sentiment expressed that we, as a nation, would never forget it.  I commented at the time that Liberals would forget; that their new-found patriotism would be short-lived.  And so they have.  If Donald Trump agrees with my original post on this topic, then good for him.  But if you disagree with what I stated, then why don't you explain why?   The ban IS a temporary 90 day travel ban.  Do you disagree?  It affects those traveling from just 6 countries, that do happen to be majority Muslim nations.  But if it was a ban discriminating against Muslims, why just those 6, and not many others with much larger populations to boot? Shouldn't 9/11 and all of the terrorist attacks around the globe make us scrutinize travelers from hotbeds of terrorism?  Do you think it's wise to allow tens of thousands or more people into the country, knowing that they'd go straight onto welfare that we simply cannot support? Trumpspeak?  Lame.  How about some substance?
Quite the double standard:  Notley is pushing for the promotion of secular values public schools,  but somehow objects to the promotion of christian, muslim or jewish morality in faith-based schools? Does the constitutional protection of the freedom of religion not apply in Alberta?
Justin, the trust fund baby is compromising the ability of young couples to survive and raise children. (YES I know, we don't need them, we can just import 100s of thousands of MUSLIMS)
"It is unclear how Burnham, a Roman Catholic, has come to the conclusion that Salman Abedi is 'not a Muslim.'   https://www.conservativereview.com/articles/manchester-mayor-muslim-terrorist-not-a-muslim?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=052417crcontentemail&utm_campaign=newslettertraffic  No...I think it is very clear.  Very.  "Andy Burnham was elected Manchester’s mayor on May 5. Less than three weeks later, his city has suffered a massive Islamic terror attack that killed scores of innocent teenage girls. All indications appear to say that Burnham will continue to engage in willful blindness and coddle radical Islamists, much to the detriment and safety of his citizens."
Only the evangelicals. They may seem more numerous and as if They are "The Christians", but that is also "post-truth", they only seem that way because they are concentrated in some regions of the US, and so politically powerful, as Muslims may one day become when their numbers get high enough.  In fact, the more mainstream Christians, the Catholics and mainstream Protestants, put more emphasis on the New Testament than the Old.
What is being reported  is that he is a 'suspected' Islamist terrorist.  He is a US citizen and you've no idea if what your sharing is fact regarding his religious affiliations.
"I'm fundamentally happy that it is going to be challenged because in my humble opinion, it goes against everything that Canada stands for," said Mr. Grewal,  So, hatred and loathing. That is why Muslim women won't show their faces. A sense of entitlement, disrespect for other Canadians...if they want that sort of religious freedom go found your own wacky country, Here in Canada we respect each other enough to show our faces in public!!!
.  BurntErnest,  you are wasting your time with Alceste.  His only role in these forums is to deflect and qualify anyone questioning anything Islam  as a non-Canadian, bigot, supremacist: . "... no doubt that a lot of participants in Globe comments despised this writer merely by seeing her hijab, but that isn't representative of Canadians." . Background: ------ . The above quote is a new "talking point" for him, which he adopted since last week. It was result of me questioning the motives of the G&M (and other media)  publishing "opinions" of only (practically) hijabed women. As if the Westerners should be  brainwashed that only a hijabed woman can be a true Muslim woman.   I find it interesting that the bulk of the  media doe not publish Muslims, critical of Islam, and calling for a reform - a hard look as to the state of Islam today. They do not publish Muslims, critical of the hapless left who is used as a Trojan horse to advance political Islam agenda in Western democracies.
You're high...and when the Islamic population outnumbers the liberals after a century of your sides immigration policies like they will in Europe, time won't be on either of our side
There is no "radical" element of Islam.  There is only cultural/non-practicing, and practicing.
One wonders how you arrived at your conclusion.  Did you miss the part where Martin's book was endorsed by cardinals and bishops?  Did you miss his appointment as an advisor to the Vatican's Secretariat of Communications by Pope Francis?  If this isn't the "Institution of the Catholic Church" building bridges over schisms one is hard pressed to think what might qualify in your world view.  The Catholic Church is no different from any voluntary assembly of individuals, it has smaller groups within the larger whole whose views are not always exactly the same.  Why the same people who take great pains to say that all Muslims shouldn't be painted with the broad brush of their extreme adherents go out of their way to do precisely that to Catholics is puzzling to me. Would you care to enlighten me as to why you do this?
Calling it a "Muslim ban" certainly SOUNDS like there is evil going on.  And if the executive action was "Ban all Muslims from entering the United States", you would be correct.  But you're either unknowledgeable or intentionally misleading when the order has an effect on only 7 countries (with at least 40 more Muslim majority countries not affected).  Not as impressive if you say that, is it?  If you want to make a case for letting in Syrians, Iraqis, Iranians, Libyans, etc who aren't US citizens without enhanced vetting to help lower a chance a terrorist might get into the country - please do so. I have an open mind and would love to hear your thoughts as opposed to inaccurate, fiery emotional slogans.
Another Globe & Mail article says "A routine request for ID papers outside a deserted train station in a Milan suburb at 3 a.m. Friday led to a police shootout that killed the Tunisian fugitive wanted in the deadly Christmas market attack in Berlin".  It seems the Italian police in Milan stopped the Tunisian terrorist Amri in a routine check. That sounds similar to the carding in Toronto where police were stopping people to ask questions but Canadians protested against that.  Canada isn't immune from Muslim terrorist attacks. We've had them before.  I wonder if we will need that sort of police checking in Canada the future.  Maybe Mississauga should keep it up just in case.  And Conservatives says  if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear.
fortunately the new UN general secretary, Antonio Gutteres, sees through  the anti Israel obsession of the UN which has 57 Muslim countries (Organization of the Islamic Conference)  out of about 200 members
Jake, it is really easy to criticize, but you, after being critical, offered no strategy. Perhaps that is because the middle east is a big problem with no easy answers, and quite frankly, the American public is tired of the MURDER OF OUR CITIZENS, by Muslim Islamic Extremists, from Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, and Libya, and Somalia, and Iraq, and Syria, and on and on and on. WE CAN'T FIGHT all the wars of all the muslim nations. Either muslims have to learn to get along with others or we may forced into the HIROSHIMA OPTION. Now that may sound extreme, but the facts are that once JAPAN realized that someone on the block was bigger than them, and proved it with force, they became a peaceful nation. The bald-faced reality is that the only true way to deal with extremists is with EXTREME FORCE.
Islam is political.   It is not a religion which separates politics from its religion.   It is inherently totalitarian.   Wake up Canada.
Could you please specify which severely anti-Constitutional executive acts & pro-muslim, anti-American acts & words, Obama did or said?
Clearly, the list of (and violence against) targetted groups in the US (and Western society generally, including Canada) is growing as the disaffected angry, nihilist fringe grow and increasingly feels they have licence to come out from the shadows where they have always existed to attack whoever they blame, by whatever means and for whatever reason that strikes their fancy.    Energized by demagogic rhetoric which creates the illusion that such hate and its methods are mainstream and such outbursts normal, groups from this fringe begin by targeting the Mexicans, Muslims, etc but quickly expand their hit list to include groups targetted in past generations such as the Jews (and can Blacks, Orientals, Feminists, etc. be far behind).  Society must get at this contagion of irrational hate at its root causes before it metastasizes further.
'Questions and criticism about Islam are not Islamophobia. In fact, Muslims themselves engage in robust debates about modernity and Islamic practice. The cruel irony is that such debates are banned in countries that need it most.'  And apparently in the Globe   Censors working overtime today
I don't get why it matters who David Duke supported. Did it matter that the father of the Muslim Orlando mass murderer was at a Hillary event sitting just a few rows from the front? Or that Hillary was cozy with Robert Byrd? (KKK)  Or how about that Pentagon Bomber Bill Ayers held a campaign event at his home for Obama, which Obama attended.
Fox News and New York Daily News reported the 701 figure as have many other media...Governer Cuomo's hotline reported over 400 calls since Nov 15....  SPLC Say: The report is SPLC’s second since Election Day and covered incidents reported between Nov. 9 and 16. While the organization expressed concern over the increasing number of attacks, it noted that the trend points to a “steady drop-off” as roughly 65% of the incidents were reported in the three days following the election.  Anti-immigrant sentiment was at the top of the list with 206 reported attacks, while anti-woman and anti-Trump attacks remained at the bottom with 36 and 27 reported attacks respectively. A total of 151 incidents targeted black people, 80 targeted LGBT-people, 51 targeted Muslims and 60 involved swastikas.
Misleading to think the shooter was "inspired by Islam."  If fact, Islam may have meen the least of his problems, even if it had been a factor!
Istanbul (Constantinople) was the centre of Christianity 400 years before the birth of Mohammed. Look what islam has done to the middle east.  Guess what it will do for Canada.
I have always said that it will start in Europe.  We just don't learn our lessons that history gives us.  Muslims and Christians have never been able to co-exist in peace.  Having said that the Middle East has been embroiled in war and terrorism for as long as I can remember.  Sure there are reasons why such as the re-drawing of borders after WWII but even the Sunnis and Shiites can't get along. Wake up Canada, they want their own neighborhoods and rooms in schools to pray. Now they are Ministers in the Liberal Cabinet pandering to their own. They just can't get along with anyone.
Why has nobody in western media mentioned that Saudi Arabia has room to accommodate a million refugees in an air conditioned tent city outside of Mecca, used for pilgrimage?  It would save  Germany a lot of grief if refugees from Islamic horrors  had gone there. Or is Wahhabi Saudi Arabia better than us and need not dirty it's hands with Muslim refugees it helped create?
Both PA and Hamas are better examples of Apartheid: not only they are Juden-free, but they persecute their Christian minority. Israeli Arabs and Jews have the same rights, live together and work together.   I visited Israel, talked to Arabs and Jews, and don't need to listed to cheap lies from Islamist propagandists.

Lena Ibrahim posted;" There are gay bars an clubs in major " Muslim cities" like Amman, Dubai, Beirut, Istanbul, none of which have seen massacre of this sort. The heart of the problem among inexcusable and often promoted homophobia in the Muslim community, is the AMERICAN numbness to violence. When a country cannot go a single week without a mass shooting , there is a serious f___king problem and a chilling disregard for gun violence and gun control. Why fool ourself into believing this is anything else for the sake of AMERICAN Exceptionalism? OMAR Mateen is first and foremost an American, who though on an FBI watch list, who was taken in for questioning twice by the FBI, could purchase multiple guns and within a week commit a mass murder. I am not posting this for debate. In love and solidarity with the LGBTQ community tonight. Using the power of Ramsdan Observance to send prayers and light your way." Thank you, Lena.
This news report does a good job of reporting on the constitutionality matter of Trump's recent move on refugees, for example from Syria, to ban all Muslim refugees but to have a case-by-case basis review of Christians for possible admittance.  My prediction would be that a US Court judge (or Supreme Court) would likely rule against Trump. The establishment of religion clause of the US Constitution has been widely interpreted as providing a muscular freedom of religion, and a requirement for hands-off from government in he area of religious favouratism.  I predict that Trump does not have a leg to stand on, legally, with that part of his proposal on refugees.  I do note, however, the Globe and Mail was remarkably quiet about Obama's system, which reportedly took in massively greater numbers of Muslims than Christians from Syria (greater numbers taking into account the per capita distribution there, about ten percent Christian but refugees to US well under one percent Christian).
Oh boy,  Just matter of time before the usual suspects, place their comments, denouncing another of Trump's atrocities, against muslim electronics and technology this time around. Apple will claim their life hood is in peril, some States like NY and Hawaii will say the ban is unconstitutional and unnecessarily protects American lives. Go figure.
Most of the groups that "signed on" with the sentiments of this "letter" are in open defiance of Church teaching on other topics.  I guess groups like these support the defiance of other groups.  How interesting that they not admit several of these groups have been condemned by the Vatican, giving a rather false impression that they are all in good standing.  How lovely of this group not to encourage catechesis, dialogue, understanding, discussion in an open forum with Bp. Paprocki - but rebellion and encouragement to "consult widely with one another" - but not with the Church; to "create (their) own pastoral practices" outside Church teaching; to continue to reinforce the misunderstanding that gay people are not welcome in the Church; how disingenuous of these groups to infer ssm & homosexual activity is approved by "Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists."  Okay.  Waiting for the laughing faces and comments.
The Islamophobic depiction of Muhammad's marriage to Aisha as motivated by misplaced desire fits within a broader Orientalist depiction of Muhammad as a philanderer. This idea dates back to the crusades. According to the academic Kecia Ali: "Accusations of lust and sensuality were a regular feature of medieval attacks on the prophet's character and, by extension, on the authenticity of Islam." Since the early Christians heralded Christ as a model of celibate virtue, Muhammad – who had married several times – was deemed to be driven by sinful lust. This portrayal ignored the fact that before his marriage to Aisha, Muhammad had been married to Khadija, a powerful businesswoman 15 years his senior, for 25 years. When she died, he was devastated and friends encouraged him to remarry. A female acquaintance suggested Aisha, a bright and vivacious character.
Motley, I want to say, and I hope you don't feel I'm patronizing, but I like you....in the sense that from sparring with you I believe you are sincere, factual, an intelligent  free thinker, and well intentioned, if I may use such a naive term for such a cynic as you portray yourself to be.  At the same time I obviously feel you are excessively cynical and seem a little afraid to grasp for better possibilities.  To me you are hung up on the past, and on the awful Islamic leadership in places like Iran ans Saudi Arabia.  This gets us nowhere.  Your Muslim dentist in Portland doesn't care any more about Sharia law than you do about Sodom and Gommorah. Muslims, as previous immigrants, sometimes arrive with sharp elbows.  I hope they assimilate.  What do you want?  With this, I see this bold statement from Nihad Awad as the best thing we could have in our war against Isis, just as all our current vocal hostility is the worst--  what do you think?
Of course our country is not a game, but if Trump wants to ban Muslims he needs to try again because the first try appears to have failed.  I'm happy we agree that time will tell.    In the meantime, leading cheers won't make much difference.  What's interesting is what *happens* next.
Hindus are the majority in Kerala - more than half of the population. Then come Muslims and Christians. The current state government is a coalition of leftist parties, with the Chief Minister coming from the Communist Party of India (Marxist).
No, I do not feel sorry for him either.....but what we have to start to recognize is that offensive rhetoric and violence is apparently not restricted to one side of the aisle....  Do you see that buying into the whole "Muslim ban" thing is not exactly true?  And that it is contributing to division and hatred?
The Radical Left and their RINO henchmen will never stop at one. They will try to destroy every person who dares to challenge their established cult.  The alt left won a small victory. Milo isn't going anywhere. He sounded the alarm about Muslim migration in England and in the U.S.  He helped Trump get elected, this is all that matters in the grand scheme of the great culture war.  So that things like this do not happen here - the left is trying hard
A nice but phony attempt at appearing reasonable. Many tell-tales. To start, Ms Khalid was anything but eloquent, and has never directly addressed any of the many legitimate, compelling and non-threatening responses she has received to her motion. On the charge that Islam suppresses womens' rights, the author is happy to concede that “Such a critical view is understandable, given discriminatory gender practices in some Muslim cultures”. But she carefully avoids the actual and undeniable criticism that the basis for gender inequality is the Quran not culture. Similarly, she offers that "Questions and criticism about Islam are not Islamophobia. In fact, Muslims themselves engage in robust debates about modernity and Islamic practice. The cruel irony is that such debates are banned in countries that need it most.” Well.. no!  The truly cruel irony is that Islamists and their apologist enablers tar each and every serious and courageous reformer as ...wait for it ... Islamophobes.
It's a sectarian conflict. The burqa ban is the Muslim equivalent of "no popery".
Taqiyya (taqiya, taqiyah, taqiyyah) is a form of Islamic deception. The Quran (16:106 and 3:28) allows Muslims to lie in order to protect themselves or to protect the Muslim community.
Globe, can we get more stories about Muslims?  I think there were only 4 today.  They make up at tiny portion of the Canadian population but the Globe can't stop writing about them for some reason.  Perhaps there is an agenda other just REPORTING THE NEWS?
Fine, sure, condemn "islamophobia". But there's nothing irrational about "fearing" islam. So you're condemning nothing, except for a politically correct term.  Ban islam, ban sharia.
Islam is not a race.  Neither is the EU.
and all the countries obama bombed and clinton and bush before him were muslim  syria, sudan, somalia, iraq, pakistan, yemen, libya, afghanistan, to name the most signifcant so take a hike radawanski
The Muslim ban clearly rises to this level.
Are you going to make me do all your homework?  Syed Farook was born in Chicago, IL.  He was a natural born US citizen.  The Tsarnaev brothers were permanent legal residents, having come here as minors.  These people wouldn't have been bothered by the EO travel ban, which is the subject of the CB article and this comment thread.  Please stop hating on Muslims.  One of the principles that constitutes our great nation is that we don't discriminate based on creed.
Nicely done! Sounds like a backroom deal doesn't it, Trudeau no doubt a Soro's lackey and puppet for the Saudis like the Clinton's.  How can all these leaders be so Anti White and Anti Christian? I mean Trudope doesn't even bring in persecuted Christians from the ME.  He sure loves the Muslims and sharia.  Trudeau must go!
Agree with your point about  Islam and it's relation to State. Had a class on that subject , Iran as one example.
Your criteria is someone who commits mass murder who proclaimed they were acting in the name of religion. By that criteria I think there it is likely that those who call themselves Muslim are more often engaging in mass murder than those who claim other religions. But why stop at only those who proclaim a religion? Death is death. The stats show that mass murder (and how many killed is that?) is unfortunately pretty common in inner cities (from gangs) but not so well reported.  We're all amped up over Islam (understandably) and so it gets all the press.
Your statistic should include a body count. The Islamic terror body count is on par if not greater and remember Muslim men are just 1% of North America's population. White men are about 35% of North America's population.
Thank you for that edifying allegory. You must be a big hit at parish dinners.  The powers that be in the Trump administration want a war on Islam. Maybe "mean" isn't quite the word for it.  http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/01/trumps-immigration-order-just-opening-salvo-steve-bannons-war-against-islam
It might benefit a couple of tech firms, but in the long run for the whole country it maybe problematic. If those Muslims are not allowed to go to USA or they don't want to go there, guess what country they'll choose. I hope our politicians will make policies wisely.
It's about time a Canadian politician had the guts to call a spade a spade.  And it's so typical of Islamic apologists to refer to one instance to dispute Couillard's statement and shift the dialogue. Islam is broken. It has a disproportionate number of radicalized adherents that cause massive death and destruction throughout the world.  Just look up the death toll during Ramadan alone!  Sadly, the only ones that can fix Islam are Muslims and they don't seem to want to do it. This forces thinking people to draw conclusions that are now becoming illegal as we slip into the Trudeaupean "hate" crime era where one's very thoughts and opinions can result in jail time. Ironically there are no such penalties for Islamic aggressions.  We live in interesting times, I just hope we can survive them.
It's not the Muslims who are responsible for the need for police protection. That's the fault of the bigots who made threats against the school and it's Muslim students.
The whole parliamentary motion is talking about behaviour between people in Canadian society. Islamophobes prefer to deflect by talking about what people are doing in some other part of the world. These are people here now in Canada. What does "Iran's morality police" have to do with the right of a Muslim in Canada to go about his or her day without being subject to anti-Muslim hatred? That my friend is the essence of prejudice and discrimination.
So, the US, waterboarding a Muslim terrorist, has gained concrete and current intel about an imminent attack on the Canadian Parliament while it’s in session.  American intelligence notifies Canada.  Michael Doucet’s reply, “Nope! Don’t care. We Canadians are above the way you got that info!”
According to Pew research, by 2035, globally, there will be more Muslim children born than Christian. The effects of this in Western liberal democracies is especially alarming.   A contraceptive culture, that subjects life to personal and selfish criteria is on its way to self-annihilation. The Christian message is about life, about new life. It is not Islam that is the danger to the Christian message, but the so-called Christians who decide to domesticate, or form God according to their image and likeness, as opposed to allowing to be formed to God's image and likeness.   Selfish political ideals, and political correctness cannot stop life. Life happens.
"in 40 per cent of cases there was no clear ideological motivation" That totally strains the credibility of your "recent academic research"!       I hope we can agree on the following: Right-wing terror exists. Left-wing terror exists. Islamic terror exists. Organised groups carry out attacks with logistical support and widespread applause. Loners carry out attacks with no support and no applause and no allies. Mentally ill people carry out attacks that look like terror.  And I hope we can agree: It is wrong to blame right-wing peaceful democrats for right-wing terror. It is wrong to blame left-wing peaceful democrats for left-wing terror. It is wrong to blame peaceful anti-extremist Muslims for Islamic terror.  http://markhumphrys.com/left.right.violence.html
Right-wingres have always had issues with those pesky things known as "facts". Climate change deniers are cut from the same cloth as fundamentalist Christians or Muslims who deny the reality of evolution or think that the earth is 6000 years old. Facts and data don't matter when one is completely immersed in a worldview based on fantasy.
You're right in one thing, tip2 - my comments have been unlike the original poster's and yours.  I've made it very clear several times that I have no direct evidence.  I do know, however, what the mayor of Saint-Apollinaire, Bernard Ouellet, said: 'It wasn't land use that was being disputed; it was the word 'muslim.' The voters didn't reject a cemetery, they rejected a muslim cemetery.'
"A ban on Muslim cemeteries is an attack on us all"  I take offence at this headline. The town in question didn't have a referendum to "ban" muslim cemeteries - it had a referendum to rezone land for a cemetery. The town would also have had to had a vote to rezone the land if Walmart or a shopping mall, or a housing development wanted to buy the land and develop it.   This article is nothing but yellow journalism.
Can you accept living under Canadian law that outlaws acts of anti-muslim bigotry and speech that tends to expose muslims (among other minorities) to hatred?  Because that's Canadian law.  If not . . . well, you might want to have a deep think about your own advice.
Ya got that right Carang, religious is a red flag?  Sounds like another NRAphobe as well. Watch the chorus bring up Tim McVey again. All of the acts of terror we've been seeing are committed by holy, devout Quran reading Muslims.
post-truth?  Muslims have been practicing taqqiya for centuries.

This article by the G and M was incredibly biased, but isn't all mainstream media? No person should be threatened. However, I worry more about minorities in Muslim territories than I do about Muslims here in Canada being harassed.   The reason the pages were being torn from the Koran is because the Koran has hateful messages in it about killing the unbeliever and taking the women from other cultures as sex slaves. Research the life of Mohammed. He was a black slave owner and kept the wives of men whom he killed as sex slaves.   None of these prayers belong in schools in Ontario. They're hateful. They're also extremely disruptive to the school day for all kids. Schools in Peel are already overcrowded. There is no space for French classrooms. Gyms and lunch rooms are used at break for theatre or sports. Everyone will suffer because of these Islamic prayer meetings. But Islamic hegemony is just what Islamists have in store for the future of Canada!
Actually, it goes back to 630 AD, when Muhammad led an army to capture Mecca. Over the next few years he conquered the Arabian Peninsula, forcing the population to become Muslims at the point of a sword.
Too bad that the Swedish authorities couldn't find this guy before he murdered people. However, they had rejected his application to stay and he would have been gone if they had found him in time. Sad but the system mostly worked, I suspect however that there will be lots of Muslim-hating comments coming up.
When George Dubya Bush declared "war on terra" anyone with any knowledge of history and some common sense said  it was madness because a "war on terror" cannot be won.   The last 15 years of endless war, increasing terror, increasing carnage have served to prove neither a "war on terra" nor a war on terror can be won.   The politicians said, "If we change our lifestyle the terrorists win". But then they went ahead and created more militarization, more police, more security state, more surveillance state, took in more refugees, increased immigration, placed Islam and other religions at the top of daily public discourse. Soon freedom of speech was under attack. Signs are everywhere warning people to watch their language. Folks converse less than ever.    This relentless ruthless push toward the right wing has led to the rise of fascistic Donald Trump and his corporate billionaire oligarchs.    A majority of North Americans want change - but are getting the opposite change they want,
You do realize that a mosque is not a church don't you?  church /CHərCH/ noun a building used for public Christian worship.  mosque /mäsk/ noun a Muslim place of worship.  syn·a·gogue noun the building where a Jewish assembly or congregation meets for religious worship and instruction.   Think twice, post once please.
You seem to suggest the prospect that secret evidence might have been used to contest Khadr's lawsuit instead of settling with him would be a bad thing. As far as I'm concerned - and I don't think I'm at all alone in this - a way to have fought that and actually avoided a payout would have been ****ing fantastic.   I get settling because there didn't seem to be a chance of winning. But if the federal lawyers had something that would have altered the odds, and they were forced not to use it by the risk of Khadr sharing it with the rest of the Islamist network, taking that as a learning experience to design better rules under which it won't happen again seems only responsible.
If he converts to Islam, you'd be ok with him tweeting "Allahu Akbar" too, right?
Invading countries fuses competing ideologies. The Iraq invasion caused Islamists and secular Baathist to become allies. Invading Vietnam caused nationalists and communists to unite.  Muslim terrorists want invasions, and other forms of over reactions. It feeds recruits to them.
It also excludes countries that don't practice radical islamic terrorism.   Correlation is not causation.
I think that some post writers are being a bit too sunny about the Wilders vote.  Wilders is apparently winning about 20 percent of the seats.  Hello?   He ran on a platform in which he declared that he hates Islam, that he thinks the Koran is the same as Hitler's Mein Kampff, a fascist guide encouraging mass killing to establish a totalitarian state, that he wants Muslims to tear out and throw away half of the Koran's contents, and that he wants a lot less of Islam present in the country.  Um, hello?  He ran on that in a well educated Western country and he won about 20 percent of the seats?  Um, I do not share the sunny optimism some have about what this says about the Netherlands. In Canada Wilders would have been arrested and jailed for hate speech crimes, and our media would have been up in arms if he had won ONE PERCENT of all seats in Canada - - the media would be declaring doomsday apocalypse had he won 20 percent of seats...
Not at all  This recent feud is just proving the point that american intelligence is highly politicized . If Trump comes through on his promise to sweep the intelligence sector clean of its  obvious political agenda  the world will be much  better off.  Ever since 9/11  it became obvious that intel was  serving political ends. The failure to separate analysis from response was never so evident when the CIA manufactured evidence about  WMD in Iraq. Instead of letting Israel fight its own wars we are  fighting wars on its behalf and where there once was a terrorist threat targeting Israel we have now all become targets.  In truth what would make us  safer is if the USA stopped targeting Muslim countries either by stealth (Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan where UAVs are targeting enemies of the USA) covert support for rebels (as in  Syria and Libya) or just out right invasion (as in Iraq). We also need to sever our relationship with Netanyahu and his band of  scurrilous troublemakers.
Based on the number of Canadians killed by extremists, no program is required.  There is one program which would save money and make Canada even safer. That is withdraw our troops from the Middle East and environs. As long as we are not killing Muslims there is a less chance they will want to kill us.   All the money spent on supporting our troops in that fighting could be used to buy weapons to defend Canada.
Jesus and his teaching that made this western civilization possible and his message  is fully rejected by all Islamic peoples. That's all we need to know really, or is it just an option and acceptable to reject our cultural fore-bearers to be politically correct?  Why tolerate people that don't follow our teacher? That's too much kindness that bites us in the end. Please delete this message as I am compiling a list of deleted comments to submit later to discredit my opponents that hate Jesus Chirst our Saviour. My human rights are being abrogated by people that don't like my Teacher. To make matters worst, they endorse or excuse Islamic violence as ligitimate when it is not even Islamic and accuse us of being mentally ill for fearing religiously inspired gratuitous violence by making up labels like, Islamophobia.  No, I think that she is the devil posing as a saint. That is normal, evil prentends to be nice when it eats your soul.
Anti-Christian hatred has no place in my Canada. Anti-Women hatred has no place in my Canada. Anti-Jewish hatred has no place in my Canada.  Islamic people, are you doing any accommodating?
Okay - who wants to answer? How come the problem now and not in the past twenty years? Also, there seemed to be a problem with the Muslim student's prayers (sermons) last fall. What was that?
Your comment could have been found in any British newspaper after Jewish extremists exploded a bomb in 1946 at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem killing 90 people and injuring others. The Japanese would have said the same thing after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Muslim extremists didn't corner the market on atrocities.
NO! said that one Muslim...and I answer by= François Jourdan, French islamologue; “...Islam (and Jewish add by me) is very frozen for many centuries and basically lack of freedom - today, it must be said clearly that we cannot build a society of one religion, Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist... or atheist.  This phase of human history is now overtaken by religious freedom and human rights. Secularism requires not the ban but the discretion of all religions in the public space as other citizens have the right to have another way of life.  This isn't the Koranic trend where Islam does not consider itself as other religions and must...DOMINATE !...” So, He said; “...Secularism requires not the BAN but the DISCREATION OF ALL RELIGION in the public space...as others Citizens have the right to have ANOTHER WAY OF LIFE”, oui ? "Islam does not consider itself as OTHER religions and MUST... DOMINATE" !... get it Canadians ???...
The POTUS certainly was incorrect with that statement but he's on the right track now.  His plan to restrict firearms  in the U.S. while bringing as many muslim refugees as possible into the country is definitely sound thinking.  Obama's decision to give Iran $150,000,000,000 dollars to develop their nukes will make the Islamic terrorists more friendly to us.
What makes you think we're not in a war?  Remember the aid workers that ISIS kidnapped and beheaded?  What about the Paris nightclub?  The Boston Marathon?  The recent London street attack?  The other attacks in France and even in other Muslim dominant countries?  The people whose sons and daughters have been killed by ISIS are finally seeing active retaliation.  Those of us who have family members in the military accept the risk that our family members have taken on and that this is a decision that had to be made.  No, it's not a video game.  It never has been.  And it's about time we started playing for real.
Robin get in touch with reality, if you haven't suggest you read the exec order in it's entirety, these 7 nations in fact harbor and support ISIS. Why are these muslims seeking refuge in jewish & christian nations vs islamic countries?, kuwait, qatar, saudi, bahrain etc. are not letting them in stating fear of terrorism, effects tourism, costs & expenses of harboring them. Any immigrant seeking refuge in the U.S. should justifiably go thru extreme background checks to insure our countries safety. Non-vetting results 2 incidents in France, Belgium, Nece and others all due to extreme islamic ideology, Read the order all countries will be involved. with 911 & the 50 following islamic based acts we are close to 4,000 innocent lost lives. Give the plan sometime to get fined tuned and to work. It's necessary, those with approved visas & green cards are & will continue to come in. Immigrants of course want to come to the U.S, we will get you jobs, food stamps, childcare, education, etc.
Liberals are simply pandering to Arab and Islamic voters to buy more votes.   What they don't understand, that each act of terror committed by the migrants will cause them to lose some existing votes.   Look at Sweden www.breitbart.com/london/2017/02/21/sweden-cars-torched-looting-riots/ and see if you want it here.
Unfortunately, Muslims don't follow the Jesus of Christianity, but 'Issa' - a retconned distorted version. They don't even attribute the Golden Rule to Jesus. They even call him Christ, without realizing that IS the Son of God title. They even ignore his Sermon on the Mount where he said 'beware of false prophets who would use my name' (which would be Mohammed). Mohamed is clearly the Anti-Christ, and Jesus would never condone Islam.
Possibly.  Nazism was an ideology wholly incompatible with Western values and systems of governmnet.  So is Islam.  Just what to do about it is a great dilemma, but it is pretty obvious that pretending the facts are not as they are and that a serious problem doesn't exist, or worse yet, denying  there is a problem in the first place are NOT acceptable answers.
Paid agitators on both sides! Saul Alinksy, divide and conquer.  Robert Lee, never even owned a slave but Union General Grant did! White supremacists do not equal White Nationalism. Like La Raza & BLM right?   Did you hear them? Saying "you will not replace us!", mass third world immigration on an industrial scale, but only in White nations! Muslim nations won't even take their own in , why? Too dangerous!  Stop the wars for the Greater project for Israel , where Barry dropped more bombs on the ME than GW  Why hasn't the media reported the biological terrorism by Antifa, throwing feces and urine at passers by?  The Trump is a racism doesn't hold water or he is a NAZI either.  Do you not know he is surrounded by Jews, both in his own family and in business.  Long time, famed NYC Lawyer, Cohen,  Not all Jews are of sabbatean variety or support the complete destruction of the white race.    I think Trump is getting closer to the John Pedo Podesta child trafficking ring, and the DNC
Well said - even in what Trump calls Muslim countries, there are non-adherents to the faith, just like in N. America. Whether rightly or wrongly, the stories being passed down from one generation to the next just are not being believed as much anymore.
It's not "nothing."  Or, I guess it can be "nothing" if you don't care one whit about the ACA, DACA, Medicaid, Medicare, endangering life-sustaining welfare benefits, inhumanely low future immigration levels, travel bans for Muslims, the ridiculous and costly border wall, appointment of unqualified and racist Federal judges that will negatively influence life and culture for 30+ years, the EPA and all related environmental concerns, including promoting coal, offshore and Alaska drilling, constant complaints about freedom of the press and civil liberties, blatant personal racism, ramping up the very real possibility of nuclear warfare, endangering alliances with other global powers, and general, overwhelming stupidity, uncivility, and being unfit for the job.     The media you mentioned provide knowledgeable context and reason in the face of overwhelming incompetence and narcissistic childishness in one supposedly our "leader."  Their viewpoints and concern are NOT "nothing."
Alceste.... Geez, we have police at school meetings and kids who are apparently scared... what more do you need?  I dunno, how about:  1.  Public schools are places of education, not worship - education trumps religion 2.  Religious groups can form their own secular schools if they want, so no need for it at public schools; 3.  Safety issues 4.  Discrimination issues 5.  There are likely other ways/places muslim students can practice their faith  I'm sure an islamic school in saudi would be happy to enroll and bunch of catholic kids and permit them to practice their religion freely.  Ya right.  Alceste - you have lots of posts but no cogent arguments why religion should be in schools other than cite that it's a charter right and needs to be accommodated under human rights.  Please, give me some good arguments (aside from it's their "right") why religion should be in public schools.  Please... I beg you b/c I'm tried of justifying my position while you don't justify yours.
Why would fear of an axe wielding homosexual make me a homophobe or bigot anymore than fear of a sword wielding radical islamist make me a islamophobe or bigot? Can anyone explain that to me?
Really? I'm no expert, but my recollection from history class is that Europeans brought war to the Muslims rather than the other way around.  there was a lot of talk about reclaiming the holy land, which never belonged to the Crusaders in the first place.
I agree. It is a difference that has to be defined, enunciated, and supported by moderate Muslims. By far the greatest amount of hate generated originates within the Islamist constituency and it should not be tolerated in any way by either Muslim or non-Muslim Canadians. Until this definition is firmly established, it is likely that non-Muslims will be wary of accommodating the general Muslim population. We are a tolerant society and have accommodated many religions but Islamist beliefs are contrary to the freedoms we have struggled to create and we must fight to ensure that Islamist objectives of domination and subjugation do not gain a foothold in our country. We are not a hateful people but we will not tolerate the intolerance of militant Islamism. Moderate Muslims are quite welcome to become valued allies in this fight.
According to Ms Flowers womens bodies are slaves to any male sperm that impregnates them, regardless their circumstances or how that sperm got there. The Holocast happened when government assumed/was given the power of life or death, and Ms Flowers wants to give our government the power of life or death over the unborn. Sharia Law, which says and means very different things to different Muslims, is simply religious rules describing acceptable Islamic behavior. Ms Flowers wants to create an a Christian version of Shaia Law regarding women's bodies, based on Conservative Christian religious beliefs. What would they want next, Christian Jihad? Women would be able to make their own choices, not the government!
When did Ezra incite mobs against Muslims? Where? Why wasn't that on the news?
Were they to be private events just for Christians, or official school events?  Because if it's the latter, it didn't involve a proposed accommodation.  It sounds more like school boards wanting to have morning recitations of the Lord's prayer.  As the Ontario Court of Appeal said in 1988:  "The recitation of the Lord's Prayer, which is a Christian prayer, and the reading of Scriptures from the Christian Bible impose Christian observances upon non-Christian pupils and religious observances on non-believers."  Allowing private muslim prayers in a classroom doesn't do that.
On International Women's Day, I would expect a Muslim woman addressing women's issues in Muslim countries, not a M103 agitator...
Because it is NOT a "Muslim" ban It is a travel ban that has hit the PC battles brought on by Trumps inability to get these issues and discuss with his counsel prior to rolling out  the content.
Guest And 100% of countries which have been attacked by the west are Muslim countries.
The Arab Spring captured the imagination of every country. As we speak, Montreal's  main Museum has a show that glorifies "Revolution" . The  Syrian scenario envisaged by the youth AND by the US/EU was Assad surrendering in the face of mass demonstrations as did the leaders in Tunisia and Egypt, or failing that we would intervene to kill the leader (as in Libya).    The problem was that the Syrian mainstream (secular, Christian, commercial, as well as the Shia Alawites) had lived through previous Muslim Brotherhood uprisings and, rightly or wrongly, judged that a firm response was essential to the survival of  a viable Syria.  After three months of futile watercannons and police action at the start of 2011, the Army was deployed under orders to squash illegal demonstrations - which it did.  Seven years later, with a half million killed in a civil war financed and supported by us all, we are realising we should have helped Assad in 2011 to do what Sisi did in Egypt in one day.
It takes more than a few cruise missiles shutting down an airport for one or two days to have an impact on the Assad regime and their ally Russia. In fact, it will take more than airpower and more bombings to fix things in Syria with all its competing groups, many of which are radical islamic groups. Some of the actors are the Kurds (fighting with American special forces) who want to take a portion of Syria, Turkey which wants to keep the  Kurds away, and Iran which has been fighting ISIS. Add to that the Russians supporting Assad. It will take boots on the ground to stabilize the country and keep Assad from being replaced with someone worse and an occupying force and logistical installations to support the force.  And it will take diplomacy and a major effort by the State Department to manage the occupation or coalition that pulls groups together or results in a ruling group.
It's not because it's a Muslim project that it becomes a good project. Cemetery projects in Quebec are now multi-confessional. It is a choice of society. Ignorance is not the reason for the rejection of the project by the opponents. It was proposed by opponents to accept a multi-confessional cemetery. The proponent of the project, Mohamed Kesri, rejected this idea saying that it's discriminatory. The insult here is his refusal to accept the idea of ​​a multi-denominational cemetery. The vast majority of Muslims agree to be buried in multi-confessional or non-denominational cemeteries, or where they have set a section for Muslims only. By the way, there is currently a cemetery in the Quebec City area that has just announced a project like this. This solution was rejected by the group of Mohamed Kesri. This group wants a "accommodation" for them because their dead refuse to cohabit with Quebeckers who did not share their values ​. Now, it's Quebecers that are Xenophobics ? C'mon.
Why should Muslims speak out against their extremists?  None of the nice Christians stopped the European "extremists" from taking North America from the indigenous people.  C'mon, it's obvious, when our tribe is on the march we humans are pretty much all going along with it.
Islam rebels have tried to take over...this is when we started to hear about gassing. They hid among the population, using them as human shields. ----------  that does not justify GASSING even if Assad-supporting leftist progressives in the West think so  between Russia and Assad they were already bombing them to death - not good enough ?
"Thousands packed into the pews — Christians, Jews and Muslims — in a show of solidarity and support and in repudiation of a message of violence, divisiveness and hatred. . . But each of these townspeople, whatever their faith, or absence of faith, with their actions lit a candle against the darkness that had come to their town."  The bottom line, if we are ever to defeat and move past terrorism and hate. Good editorial.
Some key factors they're missing:  1. Many people hate money and the sight of the money itself can have a negative effect. They should show images of people giving universal necessities such as food & water instead.  2. It's not that poor people are more likely to give. It's that people who give -- goodhearted people -- are more likely to be poor because they often lack the ruthlessness & shallowness that is usually associated with the drive to obtain an excess of money and material possessions.  3. The beings that people feel compassion towards, and the degree of compassion felt towards them, can vary from person to person. A mother may feel more compassion for an infant than a single woman. Someone who group up around cats may feel more compassion for cats than someone who grew up around dogs. A Muslim may feel more compassion for another Muslim than a Christian would (etc, etc). As mentioned above it's like a muscle though. A dog person can grow to love cats  under proper conditions
Because this has nothing to do with populism.  It can’t be called “populism” because it does nothing to empower the disenfranchised. Quite the contrary, far-right politicians redirect the public’s anger at the crises caused by corruption, neoliberal “globalization”, unprecedented corporate power and inequality, and of course, the incessant US-led criminal wars of the past 15 years, from those deserving of it and into the usual scapegoats – Muslims, refugees, immigrants, minorities, as well as Liberals/Progressives – in order to protect the very status quo it feigns opposition to in order to win support.  Like “conservative”, this is just another misleading euphemism the press has used to avoid calling the far-right by its real name, which helped to conceal what it truly represented, and the threat it posed.  We must begin to confront it, and eliminate the political legitimacy it should never have been allowed to amass in the first place.
No, Trump was elected because most of his supporters have the attention span of a Goldfish, with half of their working brain cells. These are people who sent money to Jimmy Swaggart, believe Saddam Hussein was involved in 9/11, and believe that Obama was born in Kenya and is a secret Muslim. Throughout the election they lappped up fake news posted by teenage Bulgarian scammers, and they're certain that Hillary was running a child sex ring out of a Washington Pizza shop.
A law that requires religious activity in public schools as an accommodation should be amended—if it is not being misinterpreted.  Religion can't trump (sic) everything.  Accommodation could mean that students are permitted to go to mosque during the school day if they wish but not that they hold religious services in public schools.  Religions that understand freedom of belief should adapt to secular government by granting dispensations from attendance when religious observances intrude on the education of students in public schools. No child is a Muslim child.  He or she is the child of Muslim parents until old enough to choose for him- or herself.
This is pretty typical in all majority Muslim countries. Either you respect the faith and keep your proclivities to yourself, or you will run up against the religious authorities, who do not support gay rights.
The sale of those armored vehicles was specifically for Saudi Arabia to inflict fascism regarding Islam.
Since the so called Arab Spring , there has been a Christian Genocide going on across the Middle East and even deep into Africa.   But I sincerely apologize to everyone for even MENTIONING this being that it isn't Politically Correct to even point this out.  All we every hear anyone cry about is Syrian Muslim Refugees, who in case everyone forgot actually started their own Civil War.   Christian's in the Middle East have no quarter, they are literally being wiped from the Earth and no one in the West will even say a word.    Likely this post won't get through but I truly do feel that Christian Refugees from these countries should take priority.Muslim refugees have thrown Christian's off boats and have constantly harassed Christian Families in Migrant Camps throughout Europe. If you don't believe me, do your own research and you will be SHOCKED.   Before you try to block me, lets at least try to a have a little dialogue on this current epidemic to see who is truly being persecuted.
Its still a victory.  Forcing the Islamic state into being an mere terror organization is a huge win.  They can still kill and cause harm, but they will have no army, no prisons, collect no taxes and run no schools.   I suggest they rename it Imaginary Islamic State.
By not denouncing the Republican's deplorable candidate for the presidency our delegation is in essence providing tacit support for him.  Donald Trump is outrageously unqualified to be president.  He has no relevant experience, shockingly little understanding of how our country works, and has a complete lack of knowledge of the wider world (and no apparent desire to learn).  But more importantly, he is without the temperament and moral center to be president.  He has made outrageous statements and slanders about veterans, Gold Star families, immigrants, Mexicans, and Muslims.  He has an extensive background in bankruptcy and is serially dishonest.  He has given encouragement to despots like Vladimir Putin, and has disheartened our allies around the world.  He has now apparently obliquely threatened his rival in the race with violence.     The AK delegation have a responsibility to denounce Trump.  They need to act with courage and take a stand.
yeah, a bit of a zealot, eh....  seems the Muslims think the same way..
in this case you should  started boycott in 2003 after Iraq invasion. So instead of bombing Muslim countries, as his predecessors did, Trump banned travel. It is time to go to America.
Politicians falling over each other defending Islam, aren't listening to their constituents, look at Wynne, Tory, and many other low ball politicos in outrage for this "anti-Islam" wide support. What they don't care to understand is the silent majority are sick and tired to have opportunistic politicians push down their throats new cultural-religion practices that are draconian in essence and do not match our tradition and canadian values.
Ottawa and international Islamic charities will work together to build  a grand Mosque ( to go with the cemetery)  in St Apollinaire. Ottawa is already funding  mosques in Canada to accommodate the new Muslim immigration.
By definition, a muslin is a pagan, by Christian standards. Yet we allow them to denigrate us. Agnostics are far better at not being murdering psychopaths than pagan Muslims are. That's the entire problem. We let a bunch of Islamic pagans ferment hatred towards us for being kind enough to allow them into our Christian/Agnostic countries and then we end up to regret it very much. So much for kindness. How much kindness did the author forget she got to be there spouting off like some kind of enabler of evil?
It should be OK considering how many people dress up as nuns on Hallowe'en.  Sure go ahead and  show solidarity with Muslims celebrating Canadian values.
So you'd help a Muslim refugee but not a homeless Canadian?
If the government of Saudi Arabia is using Canadian-made armoured vehicles against its own people, can the Shia or other Muslims in Saudi Arabia, who have been injured by Canadian-made armoured vehicles, start suing the Canadian government for allowing Canadian companies to supply the weapons used to violate the rights of Saudi citizens?
Parallel cultures inhabiting one space have always had problems. Islam is as much a culture as it is a religion  one need only to look at the majority Muslim countries to discern that. So, to propose hiding behind the religious aspect of Islam so that you are not criticized for your culture is disingenuous and should not be allowed.
Sharpie The Muslim faith has always collided with Judeo Christian faith  They by creed don't assimilate with Christians  They subjugate Christians  Between 700 AD and 1200AD Islam killed 50% of Catholics in North Africa Middle East and Southern Europe  Tell me one good invention from Islamic countries in100 years  Get a clue  There not here in general to assimilate only future subjugate
The article didn't mention his religion. Why are you assuming he's Christian? The left is quick to label and attack unless it's someone who shoots up a gay nightclub in the name of ISIS and Islam....then even when his own admission states his allegiance to Islam y'all claim he's just "mentally" ill and doesn't represent Muslims...LOL. Threatening to blow people up is crazy but the left I this country takes the cake on hypocrisy and crazy
Maybe inviting those who hate is a way to open the dialogue. Once they realise that Friday prayers are as non threatening as a Saturday Synagogue Service or Sunday Mass then the tensions may decrease. I think alot of this has to do with a misguided feeling of special treatment as friday prayers fall on a workday/school day. Non Muslims are immediately hateful of 'preferential' treatment. They view it as a privilege more so than a right.
Of course, let us remark yet again it is not a ban on Muslims...nor a permanent ban on anyone.....  I understand the need to spin and twist things.  But can you - or anyone - tell me why we have not seen here (or anywhere, for that matter) any outrage concerning the 17 countries that have permanently banned Israeli Jews from entering their countries?  Not one word from anyone here.  By the way - included on that list of 17 countries are the countries now facing travel restictions to the US.....
Two decades ago U.S. leaders decided to pivot to the Middle East. I.e. install all kinds of military bases, send in the CIA to overthrow regimes, convert them into nice peace-loving Christian Americans. But along the way there arose a little problem of blowback - not all of them can be easily converted. Trillions of dollars was spent, thousands of fighting men lost, for what? Today, Trump announced he will enhance the pivot, the goal is to wipe out the resistance. Block Muslim immigration which has caused damages. The first Crusade in 11th century tried that trick - didn't work.   At the same time, Trump announced he will enforce pivot to China - i.e. pick a fight to see who is boss.  Now China don't do the Islamic thing, their religion is harmony and sitting Buddha, they don't do terror, they don't invade, they have no imperial ambition. They are smart, advanced, technical, and love money too. They make the world greatest stuff.   And Trump want to screw them too!
The assumption in the above opinion is that muslim women had a choice how to dress, and the ban would impact that freedom. Nothing could be further from the truth. It's the pashas and the patriarchs who decide how the women have to dress.
wrong...democracy cannot exist in islam
On Memorial Day it is a good time to pause to take a moment to pause and reflect on those who paid the ultimate price for our freedom.... And from a political standpoint, since this is a political article, it is a good time to consider that the military voted solidly for Trump. And I'll bet they will again if given the chance. (No matter how much you focus on the negative in an attempt to negate their (and others) vote. Because you didn't like the outcome. (And before you spew your left wing, group think hate toward me. there is a lot I don't care for about Trump.) But he is 3 steps ahead of you all who are blinded by your ideology. That's how he got elected and you went into shock. That's how he got the 81 year old Saudi King, who walks with a cane to meet him on the tarmac. That's how he made a $110 BILLION deal with him. (Biggest $ deal in human history?)  That's how he got 50+ Muslim Presidents and Prime Minsters to come hear him. While you all keep squealing about a "Muslim Ban".
Islam means "submission".  Muslim parents want to their  daughters to marry within the faith, so forced marriages are happening in Toronto, Montreal , and everywhere Muslims live.  A girl must submit to the rules of her father. A wife must submit to the rules of her husband.  We only pretend they are free in Canada, because honour killing is still a very real fact of life for many women.    The Shafia women died alone and abandoned.  Not  even Margret Atwood will talk about it because that would put her at odds with Islam.  The religion is more important than the lives of women.
Multiculturalism should not mean that we (the West) tolerate another culture's intolerance.  If we do in fact support diversity, woman's rights, and gay rights , then we cannot in good conscience give Islam a free pass on the grounds of multicultural sensitivity.   And we need to say unambiguously to Muslims living in the West: If you want to live in our societies, to share in their material benefits, then you need to accept that our freedoms are not optional. They are the foundation of our way of life; of our civilization – a civilization that learned, slowly and painfully, not to burn heretics, but to honor them.
Study in England: Out of 1 bln Muslims 500 mln support sharia and 50 mln support Islamic terrorism.
He doesn't but he assumes they voted with their best interests in mind, unlike you who seems to think there was a conspiracy to defeat this because the cemetery was intended for Muslims.  What evidence do you have?
Two very complex topics I'm not going to be able to get into in a single reply.  But both require a two step approach of enforcement and a change in policy. Of course we need secure borders, and of course we need counter intelligence and protection from terrorism. But absolutist "build a wall" or "ban all muslims" are about as intelligent as saying "well if you don't want car accidents don't drive" or "ban all guns to get rid of gun violence". They're immature gut-reaction policies, hardly policies at all.   "My way" isn't a cut and dry thing. It's like when people say "Obamacare is a failure!" and then forget about the amount of sabotaging and compromise that has gone into it from people who opposed it (because rich people didn't want the tax).   Most things are a combination and multi-faceted approach. But it's hard to get the general population behind ideas that are researched and complex to understand. We all have TV shows to watch after all, maybe why we have a TV president.
Any election is won or lost on several factors. The fact that Le Pen's anti-muslim, anti-immigrant stance didn't give a boost to her other issues boost speaks volumes, especially in Paris.  10% Le Pen, 90% Macron.
' Trump didn't outline any plan to push for tighter immigration policies,   …he claimed he'd ban Muslims.  And,   …it was a very small minority that voted for Trump.  So, …no.   .  (And you arbitrarily touring the comment sections of newspapers is hardly any kind of evidence to be relied upon for making reasoned and rational decisions, but if that's an indication of your decision-making process, I'll just have to leave you to your musings, but you have to know that the majority is almost never making the most noise and comment sections all over the nation are full of extremist rightwing noise.) .
There was a net gain of 40 (yes 40, from 429 to 469) religiously motivated hate crimes in 2015 over 2014 according to the infographic. Now we don't know what type of crimes were committed and this stat could be entirely misleading. If I break into a church for example and steal the donation plate, is that recorded as a hate crime? For example, if a firearm is present during the commissioning of a crime, the police will record it as a firearms related offence. Even if the weapon wasn't actually used, it could be sitting in the basement closet for example. Total hate against the religious hasn't seen a significant increase in Canada, just a shift onto another religion. Good to see Muslim groups all of a sudden concerned about hate, now that it's not only the Jewish being attacked.
I guess it goes hand in hand that non-muslims students shouldn't have to be afraid because of muslim prayers at school.  They shouldn't have to be concerned about what is going on during these prayers, or be concerned with radical islam, or be concerned about the police or protesters at their school because of these prayers.  Geez, I wonder what the solution is?  I know.... how about getting religion out of public schools?
When a bigot murders Muslims, we cover ourselves in shame for allowing a "climate of hate and fear."  When Muslims murder in the name of [a deity whose name is not allowed in Globe comments because, you know, that would be blasphemy], we are told that they do not represent true Islam and that we are suffering from a "phobia".  Either way, there is a "systemic" problem in non-Muslim society. That, at least, is the liberal narrative.
It's complicated.   Essentially, the situation is similar to former Yugoslavia, only much prolonged: Rohingya separatist movement (which is perfectly fine) had essentially a guerrilla army (which is less fine) for at least 50 years; however, their idea of Rohingya state included a pure Muslim state purged of Buddhists, which is not fine; even worse, there is constant violence from Rohingya separatist movement aimed at Buddhists, which is not fine at all. Problem is, as usual, that while not all rohingya are militants, all militants are Rohingya, and a significant minority of Rohingya support them - which is why the military junta stripped Rohingya of citizenship a few decades ago.   As a result, the military (hardliners) want to push Rohingya out, while Suu Kyi wants to somehow integrate them. Worse, Suu Kyi doesn't fully control the military, and Rohingya who flee the conflict are often very bad militants themselves posing as refugees.
Enough of the divisive talk already, G&M - these folks aren't "anti-muslim", they are pro-assimilation. Despite inflammatory statements resulting from anger, the majority of these people could care less about the religion/cultural practices of their peers or neighbours. They are just sick and tired of accommodating them in the public sphere (especially as we see the decline of our cultural traditions - yes Christian ones - in that same sphere).
"Where the individual has primacy"? So all the subjects of the UK were allowed to vote? False, since 90 percent of British subjects in 1946 could not vote. African Americans in the US South could not vote till 1965, whereas Muslims in Pakistan could. Women in Switzerland got the vote after women in Turkey, by over 40 years.  Colonial inferiority complex? Hardly! You see, my ancestors were writing epics while the British were still swinging on trees (to quote British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli).
they have been doing this since islam sliced and diced itself into the region.
"Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward."  "They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks."  you cherry pick the quran. Then you interpret your prophets words for you own agenda and he's not happy with you.  he meant what he said when he wrote what he wrote. who do you think you are to second guess your prophet.  "O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness." this seems to be the one verse you cling to.   you keep changing hearts and minds with your religious hate fred. you're good at it!
What is wrong with wanting to have secular cemeteries? Yes in the past the dead were buried in churchyards but few are buried there now and people accept that graveyards will be open to one and all.  Muslims do not seem to want to integrate into western societies - whether in their lifetimes..or afterwards. This is a trend that must be resisted. And while we are on the topic why is it that day in and day out the only religion we hear about is Islam? Canada is a multi-faith (or non faith) society so why is that a small percentage of the population takes up so much oxygen?
I don't think so, Kim Roblin.  "In its report on Monday, the F.B.I. cataloged a total of 5,818 hate crimes in 2015 — a rise of about 6 percent over the previous year — including assaults, bombings, threats, and property destruction against minorities, women, gays and others.  "Attacks against Muslim Americans saw the biggest surge. There were 257 reports of assaults, attacks on mosques and other hate crimes against Muslims last year, a jump of about 67 percent over 2014. It was the highest total since 2001, when more than 480 attacks occurred in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.  "Attacks against transgender people also sharply increased."  ~  New York Times, November 14, 2016.
The point is that it doesn’t have to be your accepted view of Islam, or some more mainstream view. All that matters is what these women believe. They believe it matters, and I cannot stress this enough, the accommodations they want do not affect anyone else, so they are due their freedom.
The people of St-Apollinaire have proposed three (3) solutions for the Muslims. How can you say : "The Muslims have been rejected?" It seems to me the Muslims are imposing a request to the people of St-Apollinaire after declining three offers.
A watered down Muslim ban is still a Muslim ban.  Judge Watson is right in maintaining the TRO for the entire executive order.
It appears that many Canadians have forgotten that Canada was in Afghanistan and that many Muslims died. It was after that that Muslims attacked Canadians.
"No grasp of political reality".  That's exactly what people like about him.  He does not worry about political correctness, prepared double speak, or taking the fight to the opposition.  He is not afraid to recognize we have enemies and to call them out by name.  He will talk about San Bernardino,  illegal immigration,  radical Islamic terrorists,  China,  defense,  border control,  guns, trade deals,  true unemployment rates.  He's also right about when asked.  What  if he doesn't win the election.  Trump said  he will consider the last year a giant waste of his time, effort, and money if he loses the election.  No ifs ands or buts.    If Hillary wins,  we're doomed.
This article is fishing.  Well, here ya go.  I am very afraid of Sharia Law becoming a reality in this country with all of the rhetoric focused on one isolated case with typical Canada having an extreme all encompassing response.  Well, Muslim's stole our house from us by organizing against us.  What did Canada do to protect us?  Muslim's want Sharia Law which essentially replaces our judicial system for their own which would result in women losing most of their hard fought rights.  What other religion wants to assimilate/exterminate all others because their's is the all righteous?  Dangerous.  Does not mean I want to commit violence.  I want to create awareness of the dangers BEFORE Canada has an all encompassing response and I also want the rights of all the people who occupy our country protected.  I am a proud christian - and I do not apologize for this.  I do feel threatened as what articles discuss our religion in the paper?  How many times has a Christian stole my home?
When the Globe & Mail is willing to publish cartoons of Mohamed -remember those cartoons that led to rioting in Denmark's case, and the murder of the Charlie Hebdo writers in France's case - the same way it mocks Christian practices, then I'll be willing to listen to what else it may have to say about Islam.  Until at least one - just one! - Islamic country treats its Muslim citizens, let alone its non-Muslims, with the basic rights and freedoms of a constitutional democracy; until criticism of Mohamed is treated with a shrug of the shoulders, rather than with the threat of death; until these things come to pass, if they ever do, to treat Islam as "just another religion" displays a breathtaking naivete by Wente and the other Globe writers.
There's a simple way to do that: google "Muslim burial customs."  At the same time you might want to google "unusual burial customs." There you can learn about endocannibalism- the eating of the dead; and, Famadihana, the ritual disinterment of a relative's corpse and then dancing with it to with live music.  Be thankful Muslims simply wash the deceased's body and then bury it beneath a small and modest marker.
How is the founder of the religion, described as the perfect man not relevant to the discussion?  That most Muslims are peaceful is not because of their founder but in spite of it, however, why are we surprised that at least some Muslims imitate the founder of their religion? Why do we have to close our eyes and pretend Muhammed was a nice guy?
Yes he was as well as other family members. For two full hours. This occurred  after answering that he was Muslim. Why was he asked that in the first place?
What is Islamophobia?  Anti-Muslim bigotry should be condemned. Why is this growing, if indeed it is?  Don't forget that we face a serious Islamist terrorist threat. Hundreds murdered in Europe in the past two years. Islamist suicide bombers blowing-up a children's pop-concert, for example. An Islamist terrorist tried to run-down people on Jasper Avenue in Edmonton a few weeks ago. All this is just a fact and is definitely one of the reasons why there may be more anti-Muslim bigotry around.  Another reason could be the constant accusations online of racism, bigotry and 'Islamophobia' whenever anyone criticizes anything to do with Islam or Islamism. There is, I believe, a growing backlash against this.  Just watching the CBC cover the issue of Quebec's Bill 62 I am appalled that the CBC has already decided the Quebecois are a bunch of racists and bigots. And I'm appalled the CBC has never put anyone on TV to speak in favour of Bill 62. Again there could be a backlash against CBC bias.
The Rohingya (Muslims) in Rakhine ( Burmese province) have been over taken by a Wahhabi group of "rebels".  These are Islamic extremists known for their belief in forced "conversion" .  The other 135 ethnic sects , Buddhists , Hindus , Christians etc , etc are not happy with the idea of forced conversion , do you blame them . For example , in Syria, the Sunni's , Shia and Christians are united in the Syrian Army fighting the Wahhabi's , known as ISIS and Al Qaeda. The  jihadist "rebels" are using  atrocity and following that up with propaganda to try to create a separate state , then claim a piece of Burma's off-shore oil and gas.  This is well funded , brought to you by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, home of Wahhabi Islam . This latest incident was sparked by the rebels killing 71 Rakine police officers .  Consider if that is how the rebels treat police , how do they treat unarmed civilians .
I get Islam, I have just never understood why the far left is so anxious to destroy western democracy.  The only thing I can come up with is their hatred of conservatives, christianity and western culture is such they have decided the enemy (Islam) of their enemy (conservatives, christians) is their friend.
What I find offensive is that the previous administration refused to condemn black panthers, Muslim brotherhood, blm, and the list goes on.
@ALbertD3 >>So, in saying that, am I an online troll? You didn't define it very clearly, just as M103 fails to clearly define Islamophobia. This is a dangerous game. . Bingo. . We have slew of articles conveying 'Muslim victimhood' and 'Canadian -phobias' - most of the time authored by a Muslim woman in a head-scarf. . Here, I said it -  'head scarf'. . Is that so bad? Is that Islamophobia? Hold the outrage, before marking the post, and ask yourselves - why is that a pattern? . Where are the Muslim male authors? . Or non-covered Muslim female authors? . Or "opinion columns" that differ than those having been relentlessly published in G&M?
Terrorist attacks that succeed get most of the news. Those that are thwarted get a bit of the news. But what gets none of the news is the disconcerting fact that a rather substantial minority of Muslims in western countries (and elsewhere) believe suicide bombings targeting civilians can be justified. According to a 2007 Pew Research poll (www.pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf#page=59) when asked the question "Can Suicide Bombing of Civilian Targets to Defend Islam be Justified?" the percentages for "often/sometimes" were as follows:  8% of Muslims in the USA 16% of Muslims in France 16% of Muslims in Spain 15% of Muslims in Great Britain 7% of Muslims in Germany 46% of Muslims in Nigeria 29% of Muslims in Jordan 28% of Muslims in Egypt  Surely in any random group of people the number of sociopaths in agreement should not exceed 2-3%.  Something is deeply troubling about a belief system that produces such high percentages in so many countries.
The library can be a place for entertainment as well, as long as it's not obtrusive or disturbing like streaming porn easily can be termed as. Entertainment version: reading 50 Shades of Gray. Obtrusive: Watching porn, which can be easily viewed by passerby—including youth. That kind of entertainment really is more personal. This isn't a lock down on porn. It's just saying 'watch it on the internet at home if you want it.'   I see what you mean about determination of offense and danger. And you're right, that is what the 1st Amendment is about. However, it's gray. Both gun ownership and religion are directly protected by the Constitution—the first by the 2nd, the latter by the 1st. I know that's an argument  for porn as well, but whether porn counts as speech is gray, while a Muslim peacefully following their religion is starkly black and white: ' . . . make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or <i>prohibiting the free exercise thereof</i> . . .'
OK folks, it's high time we put our emotions on hold and look into facts. Just facts. No name calling, no presumption, no phobias.  The fact is until there is a fatwa placed on taqiyya, honor killing, killing homosexuals, etc., there is a stark polarity between Islam and freedom.   I'm not saying any individual had anything to do with the issues I bring up. I'm not calling out the man and his wife as perpetrators of Jihad. I just don't know them. Neither do most of the commenters in this thread.  Christians and Jews have at least let go of their murderous teachings. When there's a crazy fool, they are called out and ostrocized. I do know Islam is behind the terror that grips the world. Of course i know that muslims are most likely to be the targets of Muslim terrorists, but that's not a point of security. Rather the opposite.   It is up to the imams to lead their 1.6 billion followers to a path of world peace.  I suggest you read the Qur'an, see what it is that concerns us.
Another failure on the Obama and HRC resume.  They supported the ousting of Mubarak in favor of the Muslim Brother in Egypt. They supported the Arab Spring in Libya. The supported the rebel terrorist in Syria. They did nothing about ISIS or the expansion of islam globally.
Even if the town thinks the matter is settled this has just begun:  Muslims have all eternity to get what they want.  This is now a cause-celebre so they will simply never stop agitating.  They will simply wear down all resistance until they get their way (ALLAH AKBAR) and then sue for damages.
Here are quotes of some verses from the Qu'ran, the most holy book of Islam. Qur'an (4:89) - "They wish that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve, and then you would be equal; therefore take not to yourselves friends of them, until they emigrate in the way of God; then, if they turn their backs, take them, and slay them wherever you find them; take not to yourselves any one of them as friend or helper." Qur'an (9:30) - "And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah; and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah; these are the words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may Allah destroy them; how they are turned away!” There are about 100 verses like that in the Qu'ran. All Muslims are supposed to follow Islam and the verses in the Qur'an. Isn't that the truth and not a false perception? Are there verses in the Qur'an Muslims don't have to or don't need to follow?
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-security-mali-idUSKBN17W0PZ  I wonder if Doug & Watson know anyone from Mali or Burkino Faso?  Ansar-al-Islam?  Hmmm.
Chin the dufus judge should be disroped. Just trying to get more govt. money for muslims.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIdHNR38OD4 Clooney moves back to US to be safe from Islamic terrorism.
"You're right about the meddling in Muslim countries."     Good you admit some wrong doing by the West. But don't forget the 100 years of bombing and occupying, overthrowing legitimate governments.   The West are the bad guys. The British bombed Iraq in 1920 to seize their oil. Napoleon conquered Egypt in 1801!    The Bush-Cheney attack on Iraq was only 14 years ago. Isn't natural to want revenge?  "the main problem now is the recruitment of home-grown Muslims to extremism, some of them converts to Islam. "   But, you see, they are only reacting to the bombing and killing of their people back in their countries of origin and wanting justice.  "the best we can do is to reduce the attraction of extremism while urging our governments to keep their nose out of situations where there are likely to be innocent civilian casualties resulting from military action against legitimate extremist targets."   There are no "legitimate extremist targets". They are the freedom fighters.
.  "Cavusoglu also told Kerry that both Turkey and Russia “know” that a movement led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen was behind the attack, the official said,"  -  Gee, I never would have been able to predict that they would conclude that.  I believe that they have also determined that Gulen was responsible for the 1999 earthquake that killed 17,000 Turks, the fall of the Ottoman Empire and for the 541 A.D. Black Plague that killed 10,000 people per day in Turkey.  .
....you mean like the shiny pony and his commies friends have flooded the lower mainland with drugs,money laundering and political payoffs over the last year? The little potato is doing wonders in selling the country out to Communist China and radical Islam! Wake up sheeple!
There aren't any "liberal democrats (sic)" in Egypt. Your comment is ridiculous. This thread concerns hate speech and violence against Muslims in the US, by bigoted US citizens. The US is in a wave of hate speech against Muslims, Mexicans, and blacks as a result of the vicious attacks against them by our current president, who ran on hate and bigotry. This isn't about Egypt or Syria or Iran or Saudi Arabia, this is about OUR country, Go_Ducks.
Columbus was looking for India. I hope you know the difference between India and China?  As for the Muslim conquest of Constantinople, let's not forget that the Orthodox Patriarch resided there for hundreds of years afterwards. Whereas every single Muslim in Spain, Portugal and Italy was converted, killed or forced to flee. Every single one.
The article doesn't use the phrase "ban on Muslim majority countries." Only you do. It uses the wording, a "ban on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries." I did a quick google search and also couldn't find your phrasing (NOT EVEN, gasp, from the CBC!). I'm curious: whose lie are you reacting to with your comment?
Muslims can tell which of them are fundamentalist extremists, and which are secular or moderate, and we can't? Just how do we go about "screening" people, ask them if they are terrorists?  Here's a hint: a man who won't let his wife or daughters interact face to face with an unrelated man is neither secular nor moderate.
Why introduce immigrants ( legal/illegal) or Muslims into this debate?
Was it reported somewhere that he's Muslim?
In other words...our fearless leader.  "Justin skips Parliament to go on taxpayer funded selfie tour to promote lame duck budget."  Veterans and Soldiers, sorry, you're not invited.  Unless you're a female minority.  Preferably an arab muslim.  In fact, all arab muslim females are invited.    For hugs.
The Islamic state?- - Wow............... I did not see that coming
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said two days ago, "Climate change is one of the biggest risks to humanity." Innocent people are beingslaughtered all over the world, including in his own country and he's worried that the climate may change in the next 100 years?  His response to the recent attack, "This was a deliberate and cowardly attack, "I condemn it in the strongest terms," "There is no justification of such barbaric acts." Strange how the words Muslim or Islam or Islamic terrorists or Islamic extremists or anything relating to Islam is mentioned. Strange.
In her article Ms. Aziz begins with the words "Let's talk", but talk is far more than one-sided statements of the obvious. I think that there is a consensus that reaction to the recent attacks by Muslims has created a wave of counterattacks from non-Muslims. Misguided, ill-intentioned or even evil, they are wholly to be expected. It is where we stand when we reflect upon these actions that makes all the difference. Yes, we do - really - need to talk. But we have to look at the problem from more than just the events of the last month or so. We must speak clearly and in context with the realities of both the west and east, Christian and Muslim, Sunni and Shiite: all of the Us'es and all of the Thems.  It is absolutely true that these things do not occur in a vacuum. They expand, breath after breath, one shout following another, until the outward force moves at the speed of an explosion.
Nobody read Sol Alinsky???  This is the strategy utilized by the totalitarians, be it Islam, Communism, National Socialism, Progressive Liberals, in partnership with the media, to convince the majority of the populace that they are in the minority!!!
What is telling though is that you yourself identify the group retaliating not as "Afghans", or "Syrians", or citizens of whatever country was "attacked", but "Muslims". That religious identity trumps every other, so that a Muslim from Tunisia or Saudi Arabia can feel more obligation to solidarity with Muslims from Syria, etc. they never met, than with their neighbours, the people of the country they grew up in, that took them or their parents in, gave them shelter, healthcare, etc..  That makes it purely religious.
M-103 is only intended to lay the foundation for new laws to protect Islam. What ever they study about Islamophobia will be used as a pretext to implement draconian laws against anybody with alternate opinions about Islam. . It may even have a recommendations for Sharia law as the only viable solution to the egregious sufferings of Muslims in Canada. M103 is only a tool to wring concessions and privileges out of the rest of society, to build a separate and unaccountable Islamic power in Canada.  As the Ms Gultch said: "These things must be handled delicately". One step at a time my dear. "All in good time".
As was previously said, the order is NOT  a Muslim ban.  It bans all people from those 7 countries.  Rational discussion about who to let into our country and who we don't must be held and not fall into "sound bites" and "talking points" shallow arguments. Clearly, the executive order was not banning all Muslims into the country as pointed out that millions of Muslims from other countries are not affected by the executive order. Having a PAUSE of immigrants from those 7 countries to REVIEW the vetting process does not rise to the level of  hate of Muslims but a prudent decision.   Perhaps another solution would be the other Arab nations to take in the people who are trying to escape from war?  Why has that not been explored instead of sending them halfway around the world in a totally different culture?  Just saying...
LOL.  I'm a supporter of Sharia Law?  You've completely failed to understand anything I've been trying to say.  My position is that those who espouse hate and intolerance toward Muslims are using Sharia Law as a smokescreen to hide their true intentions, which is to promote their anti Muslim platform.  And how does that in any way indicate a hatred of the U.S. Constitution?  It seems to me that you either have a poor understanding of the U.S. Constitution, or are spinning it in a way to suit your ideology.
This isn't a crime committed because of someone's religion. Pedophiles and sex abusers exist in all walks of life. This dude's actions no more impugn Christians-at-large than the terrorist in NYC's actions speak for all Muslims, Weinstein's for all liberals, or Ailes for conservatives.   Just sayin'
Why do people need to be given a cookie for doing the bare minimum human decency requires in condemning their violent coreligionists?  Are our expectations of Muslims that low?
The violence in Kashmir is the same reason that dozens of Canadian Muslim kids have signed up for ISIS. Pan global Islamic jihad.  There is no conflict between Hindus and Sikhs. That was over two decades ago.  And here is an important comparison. Canada lost 80,000 soldiers in WW2. India lost around 3,000 soldiers in each of its wars. India's population is 40 times higher than Canada's. Which tells you how violent wars have been for Canada (and I am not even going to go in to the casualty figures for the British, Germans, Russians, Poles, etc - they run into the millions; which having a population which is a fraction of the Indian population).
We all knew trump needed a Muslim ban because being productive in creating a valid vetting system would be actual work and against trump's nature.  Why no news about the improved vetting procedure(s) his employees are supposed to produce?  Every single person in the U.S. government that has anything to do with actual vetting works directly for trump. This is where he can do something completely unobstructed and make a difference.  Has he?  no.
"However, the indiscriminate smearing of Islam and by extension all Muslims negates the good at the beginning of your post."  If you can't differentiate between Islamists and "all Muslims" by now, you might want to stop commenting on threads about them.
It is more complicated than that. "Political subversion of the army" - an odd statement considering the army has staged multiple coups, and hanged an elected Prime Minister in the 1960s. "Collusion with terrorists" - that description keeps changing in the Muslim world (the Mujahideen/Taliban were freedom fighters and then were labelled terrorists).   As long as Erdogan obeys democratic processes (which the referendrum was), it is hard to fault him. He was nearly killed in the attempted coup, which can't be good for his mental stability.  The EU made a large mistake rejecting Turkey. Now the Turks can turn on and off the refugee taps at will.
The conservatives are desperate. They are anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim..but they'll quote a foreigner like Piers Morgan to make a half-assed or non-point.
Fast action on pointless and inflammatory distractions: building walls, starting trade wars and banning Muslims. Way to go, Donny boy. This is what passes for leadership in the USA these days?
I'm a little confused. Aren't the ones connecting terrorism to Islam in the name of Islam...Muslims who are committing these acts? What am I to think if the guy mowing down people in a truck says, "This is for Islam!" He's the guy who's Muslim and goes to Mosque, I think he would know best why he's doing it.  Also, the Crusades...were carried out by Christians, and not just Pope Urban II and his supporters among the Nobility (with the rationale that the Seljuk Turks were getting too close to Constantinople). Average, everyday pilgrims, peasants, serfs, beggars... there was even a Children's Crusade! To say the Crusaders aren't Christian or acting in the name of Christ and the Church is just willful ignorance of history. There is no shame in saying that Christians were responsible for the Crusades over 1000 years ago. They were responsible, this is a fact.
"Has "Christian" now become used as a term of ethnic identity, where if one is white and of European roots, one is deemed to be a Christian, whether or not one is an actual believer, or an atheist?"  Of course it has and why not.? People are identified by those who perceive themselves in the majority as such if they are Muslim, Catholic, Hindu, Irish, Italian, Chinese, etc. They've all been used to label individuals as a group to be hated.   Of course, history is filled with "Christian terrorists" (i.e. IRA, The Inquisition), but then the writers of history have also been generally Christian and thus, the lack of a cultural bent to so identify those who are essentially Christian Taliban.   ""The leader of genius must have the ability to make different opponents appear as if they belonged to one category." A. Hitler
most of it is 'click bait traps' you have fallen into .The Philippines spots on news , sells iPhones and Corn flakes , unfortunately . Yes , the problem with the South Island has been centuries old and the Muslim radicals will continue with it . Canada IMHO is not far off from this , IF it continues down the path its going ... Take a look in your own back yard in Boston and NYC  and so many other examples you don know about ! It always much easier to talk about other countries it seems to methane your own .  Very sad indeed ! For the most part the PH is a peace loving wonderful country, full of wonderful people, that is trying to get its act together after a surge off-offshore drug lords from China and other parts (Vancouver east-side?), and the Muslim thing/south.IMHO
These people have obviously no empathy for the soldiers killed and the people without heads . Explain these Muslim only zones they want to introduce into Canada.  Many of these Mosque call westerners infidels which is racist bigotry . Cowardly Liberals will give in to sharia law. They are sacrificing white culture for their power hungry racist ways.
This is the Trump so called end game brought to by chief strategy guy, Steve Bannon. Because Bannon is a Leninist, he's sticking to script and blowing up the government. Part of his plan is to set up the United States for a war, which Bannon desperately wants. Initially, this Muslim country ban includes countries that the United States can defeat as opposed to Saudi Arabia who they need for oil and well, the Saudi's have a pretty good arsenal of weapons that we sold to them.  So all you Trump syncophants, pay attention: the plan all along was to create havoc around the world and the United States will start another war a la Iraq and hopefully come home a victor. Or not.  My question is this: you supported Trump ( really Bannon) would you have the courage to fight their battles?
Art-  Back to square one then?   I repeat, again and again: no one attacked Muslims qua Muslims, but certain countries or factions for political reasons. SOME Muslims (of which the terrorists), interpret that as having "attacked Muslims", rather than "attacking the source of terrorism in Afghanistan", or "backing rebels against a dictator", or "defending Kurds", etc.  What that leaves unanswered is how come Americans are backing SOME Muslims against others. Are those not  "real Muslims"?  And I have seen plenty in the media about retaliation, except that is only part of the story, for the reasons I just explained.  When terrorists seek retaliation on the basis of religion, it isn't so much about retaliation as about the religion.
So man up and volunteer eric.  BTW we are no longer just a Christian nation per Barack Hussein Obama.  Maybe your Islamic friends can take over socialized medicine?
There are very few things he could do to alienate his hardcore supporters. All I can come up with is him advocating for gun control, stating that he supports abortion, or him stating that Muslims and gays have the same rights as the rest of us.
I believe we both got off topic, at least I did anyway. My the point I was wanting to make was over Trumps plan to restrict immigration. I support that. If a Muslim wishes entry into the counrty, it should be restricted untill they can be cleared as completely as possible. Not because they are Muslims by belief but because the elements of radical Islam operate within the Muslim community. They just need to be scrutinized more than is being currently done was what I was getting at. If they are truely wanting entry into the counrty, they shouldn't mind. Immigration into another country isn't a right, it's a privilege, and too quickly given at times. My family understood this and I firmly believe this as well.
Honestly, does anyone think that these folks would have even seen charges had they been Muslim?
You don't get it Sher, we aren't talking about the origins of mathematics - we are talking about modern day cultural beliefs that breed social regression, conflict, and division. This isn't an opinion, it is a simple fact highlighted by Europe's experience over the last 15 years. Now you have a student in Germany who is forced to change schools after he tells his mates he's Jewish. Anyone who sympathizes with Hamas or any other Islamist militancy represents an ideology that is fundamentally incompatible with progress. You have entire generations of children who are taught Jews are a cancer that must be removed from the middle east, political Islam is regressive scourge - pick any country, even Bangladesh is facing a growing militancy that leaves secular poets hacked to death for "blasphemy". Political Islamism should be addressed head on without the misguided politically correctness that deems certain topics untouchable.

I am gay and I know my fate under sharia Muslim law. All across the Muslim world, gays can be thrown from high place, which in the Koran could mean a cliff or mountain, but in practice can simply be a tall building. Toronto has many tall buildings that will suffice. Gays are also executed in mass hangings in public squares, by hoisting a number of them by their necks from a crane. Children can then throw rocks at the corpses. Dundas Sq will nicely for that. If all else fails to exterminate gays there is still the simple gun shot to the head, or sword to the neck. It is all Inshallah, the will of Allah. There is nothing we can do to stop it, because it is Islamophobia to object. M-103 is part of the solution to the persistence of gays in Canada. Orlando was doing the will of God and  I will be denounced as hate filled Islamophobe  if  I try to defend myself.
Saudi Arabia continues to harbor Islamic terrorists. The Washington Post reports that "Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich kingdom touted by President Trump as a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State, has helped block a Trump administration proposal to impose sanctions against a Saudi branch of the terrorist group, documents show. The plan to add the Islamic State’s Saudi affiliate to a U.N. list of terrorist groups was quietly killed two weeks ago in a bureaucratic maneuver at the U.N. Security Council, records show. "
Well, of course we can't have the Pope washing the feet of a Muslim woman. Next thing you know, he'd be spouting some nonsense about loving your neighbor as yourself or welcoming the stranger because we were strangers in Egypt.
When there were a couple of silly cartoons published about the Prophet Mohammed, there were millions of Muslims marching worldwide. Muslim scholars have written open letters, diplomatic protests were sent, threats were made and killings happened in retaliation.  Now, a series of mass murders is taking place IN THE NAME OF ISLAM in London, and Mr. Khan "condemns the attacks in the strongest terms." That's it. No worldwide protests by good-willed Mulsims, no scholarly open letter, no diplomatic protests. Nothing. And this is the problem.  The main reason: violence in in the name of religion in fact IS condoned not only by the Qur'an, but also by the Sunnah and Hadith. No matter how many fervent claims there are about Islam being a religion of peace, as long as the current literal interpretation of the Qur'an is the only official way to read and understand it by Muslims, this is going to be a problem.  People can stick their heads in the sand about this issue, the reality remains as is.
Can you point any post out that justifies the killing of this young women? Or any post that fuels hatred towards Muslims? All posts even remotely critical of Islamic dogma are immediately reported and censored by Alceste, Allan Ross or guantanamo, so I highly doubt that any posts actually fueling hate or celebrating this brutal death could make it past the attacks on free speech.  -----  The above post was up for all of 5 minutes before Alceste popped out of the shadows to report it.
Even his parents dont understand why they would go to Afghanistan with a heavily pregnant wife. They too are looking for answers. Am I wrong that Joshua Boyle follows the Muslim faith? That his family (wife, children) are too?
Header contradicts article. If this is 1st since 2013 , it's a new single INCIDENT, not a new WAVE. Btw, it should be noted the most deadly terrorist attack in Canada involving Muslims was perpetrated by a white supremacist Quebecois of Catholic background AGAINST Muslims. He shot dead six people praying in a Quebec City mosque,& wounded numerous others. It should also be noted all "Islamic terrorism" perpetrated today by supporters of ISIL and related groups is carried out exclusively by SUNNI extremists, not by SHIA Muslims, and not by moderate Muslims such as Sufis, or moderate Sunnis such as followers of the Aga Khan, PM Trudeau's friend.  Shia Muslims,Sufis,&Yazidis are VICTIMS of ISIL Sunni extremists&persecuted, raped, &murdered by them.There's more likelihood of white Christians coverting to ISIL extremism than Shia Muslims or Yazidis doing so.     I'd feel safer having Sufis,Shias,&Yazidis in Canada than hate-filled white supremacist rednecks like the Quebecois terrorist .
"He erased all of the suspected muslim terrorists from our intelligence agencies that they were tracking before 911 so Trump could not have the info." Do you have any factual source for this accusation?
The notion of banning Islamophobia is absurd-- how do you ban an involuntary emotion?  Since a phobia is an 'irrational' fear of psychological origin, the mind cannot directly control it. Following psychotherapy (perhaps utilizing psychotropic medications like SSRI, SNRI, Benzodiazepines etc), this uncontrollable fear of things Islamic may be attenuated to tolerable levels.  Hate, on the other hand is part of one's Worldview, and it is learned-- as is ideology, dogma, and other beliefs.  But hate and other beliefs may be changed with time, the exposure to new ideas, and honest conversation.
He repelled the Islamic invasion...better read some history.
He's wrong on this issue. It's not a Muslim ban, it's a restriction of people coming from those countries because of radical terror issues. It's ridiculous to say it'll impact the tourist industry. He just want headlines.
Islam and Christianity do not share similar values. In fact, Muslims will explain to you how they do not view the Trinity or the 10 Commandments or any other facet of Christianity as being the slightest bit true or factual. Allah is not our God, and God is not Allah, and it is Muslims who like to keep it that way. But, YMMV.
One should realize that Sharia law imposes a death sentence for homosexuality, and most majority Muslim nations do as well.
Nope, it's what a lot of your fellow Christians believe. If they can't tolerate a Muslim mosque, they certainly wouldn't tolerate vouchers going to a Buddhist or Muslim or atheist or Satanist school. Quit acting like your fellow conservative Christians are so pure and noble-minded. You see the world through dualistic lenses: Your side good, everyone else bad.
No.  He was a draft-RESISTER and accepted the consequences of following his conscience, as he made clear in the statement I quoted above.  He "served the state" as H. D. Thoreau described, and the state opposed him.  And while he was a member to the heretical (and separatist) "Nation of Islam", he repented of that and became Sunni Muslim.  And how does once belonging to a "separatist" group make him any worse than the 25,723,167 white Americans TODAY who think "interracial" marriage should be illegal or the 96% of white Americans who opposed it when 'Ali was in the Nation of Islam?   Will you answer, or should I start listening to the wood frogs, as there are no crickets in Alaska?  BTW, I'm neither a 'leftist', nor a 'liberal'--most of the views expressed on NPR are as warped as those expressed on Fox.  Apparently you conflate folks who aren't "white" standing up for their rights with "progressive leftism".  By that logic should I conflate "reactionary rightist" views with bigotry?
And I have no problem with Muslims who don't follow the extreme dictates of islamists. The problem is with the extremists, as with any extremist religions.  The fact remains that Islamists are the ones claiming to be the "real" Islam, and taking control of most Islam-majority countries today, and it is women wearing the symbols of that extremist Islam who are being promoted as the representatives of Islam.  As soon as it becomes clear to most westerners that most Muslims disavow that extremism,, so-called "islamophobia" will disappear.  But it is the Left that is is promoting those extremists as representative of "Islam".
If I had a dime for every time one of you Christian "super-patriots" accused me of treason and threatened to kill me I could comfortably retire.  Prescribing capital punishment for treason is my no means exclusively Muslim practice.  And I've cherry-picked nothing, nor do I substitute my opinion for that of the Most Noble Messenger (SWS).  Again, what is your dah'lil?  How is it YOU are privy to the Holy Prophet's meanings when he himself said "This generation fought over Qur'an's revelation--the next will fight over its interpretation (tafsir)".  By all means provide us the impeccable sources of your so-called 'knowledge', O 'sholar'!  Again, you accuse me of what you yourself are most guilty--both in terms of misrepresentation and in terms of hatred.  And Allah will serve as Witness between us.  Next!
It seems everything in Canada these days is about Islam,. bigotry, phobias, ''asylum seekers'', refugees or some sort of hang up. Whatever happened to Mounties and bears?
But this is what happens when you "treat neutrally" religions that make very different demands of their adherents.  The more demanding the religion is of public commitment and community observance, the more accommodations it requires, the more it will rub others the wrong way in a secular society.  Mohammed was a strategist who recognized that the best way to get people to stick to a religion  was to make it the basis of their social identity, continually reinforced by public demonstrations of faith so any "apostates" can be easily identified and backsliding dealt with through social pressure.  Woe to the student identified as part of "the Muslim community" who does not care to participate in that public demonstration of faith! He or she can't escape that pressure,  even at school. Don't be surprised then if kids get classified first and foremost by their religion, that's the whole point of public demonstrations of faith, to constantly remind everyone of their primary identity.
the phony UN security general wants some 51 countries to sign the first nuclear treaty ban that's a laugh because a lot of nations will not go for that, heard on the news a reporter that is allowed in the UN reported that Muslim leaders brought there own prayer rugs into the assembly room to do there prayers that is not allowed at the UN no religion can be practice in the UN because of the separation of church and state and they let these Muslims do it now I know what the UN is about its to tie us down and help the Muslims get rid of Israel and drive them into the sea the Phony UN at its best.
Paranoia is an unreasoning fear of something. I dont see much of that..... On the contrary most people are behaving very reasonably in light of the increasing terrorist attacks by islamists..  Most of us really deplore this dreadful death sect of islam but we still go about our daily lives. Many of us are very troubled by the misogyny which is inherent in Islam and would love to have further dialogue with muslim women to explore the ramifications of accepting that women have second class status under islam.    Is that bigotry or fact?
Not independent at all. Appeasing the anti-Israel majority in the UN to avoid incurring the wrath of the Muslim-dominated international community and their terrorist enablers. In the words of Winston Churchill: "An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last." Describes Obama perfectly.
The total number of dead during Partition in 1947 was between 250,000 to 1,000,000. That was the total for Hindus and Muslims. This happened due to the divide and rule policies of the British. They encouraged both sides to go after each other - a very effective way of controlling the entire subcontinent.  And the Muslims were victims of Hindus and Sikhs. Not "Indians and Hindus" - did you think there were any non Indian Hindus involved here? I guess that two minute Google search was not sufficient to educate you on the intricacies of the subject.
Let's start with the Rwandan genocide. Many of the murderers were led by Catholic priests and nuns (900,000 died). Bosnian Muslims were massacred by the Christian Serbs in the 1990s. 7000 innocent Muslims were killed on one day in Srebrenica. Russian Christians massacred tens of thousands of Chechen Muslims (in fairness, I have to state that Chechen terrorists killed hundreds of innocent Russians). Americans are responsible for over 500,000 dead Iraqi Muslim civilians, in an illegal war initiated by a very Christian GW Bush.  Want me to go on?
No, like 'conservative' it's just another misleading euphemism the press uses to avoid calling the re-emergent far-right by its true name.  All far-right politicians do is exploit the public’s anger at the crises caused by corruption, neoliberal “globalization”, unprecedented corporate power and inequality, and of course, the incessant US-led criminal wars of the past 15 years, and redirect it from those deserving of it and into the usual scapegoats – Muslims, refugees, immigrants, minorities, as well as Liberals/Progressives – in order to protect the very status quo it feigns opposition to in order to win support.
But ... If they did that they wouldn't Muslim anymore.
Jews, Christians, and Muslims all worship the same God. I'd make the case for Sikhs, also. If there is only one universal God, and since all four religions claim to worship one universal God, they must be worshipping the same God. But, YHVH is the written name for God for Jews only. Observant Jews do not try to pronounce that name, using "Adonai" (Lord), instead. English speaking Christians call God "God, the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit/Ghost". And Muslims call God "Allah". The modern dispute between Muslims and Jews has more to do with the State of Israel than anything to do with Hagar and Sarah. The dispute between Christians and Muslims has more to do with the Crusades and colonialism -- and the fact that both religions see as their ultimate goal the complete conversion of the world's population to one OR the other.
I'd be happy if North American Christian church groups were trying to raise awareness about the real refugees in the ME ...the Christians and other minority religions.  Instead they are all too happy to go along with the Muslim-victim narrative and take in money to help bring in the Muslim refugees.
It is interesting that you use Islamophobia as one of your examples.  I see this as a success for those who have attempted to tell  us that Islam is truly put upon by the rest of the world.    You realize that now Islam has "special" status?  You realize there was an anti-Islamophobia motion passed in Commons?  You realize, if it becomes law, it will elevate Islam to special status, at the expense of other religions?  Be careful what you wish for.  Check out Sharia law and honour killing in Britian. https://www.jihadwatch.org/2017/01/uk-sharia-court-hands-down-sentence-of-honor-killing  Now, I do realize that most Muslims do not share in these horrible, tribal ancient customs, BUT be careful we don't give special status to ANY group that will open the doors for this to happen in Canada.
I wonder if David Grisham and his Repent Armarillo group also went to confront the "Christian leaders" who condoned the killing at Pulse in Orlando and publicly stated they wished more had died?  Isn't this against God's teaching?  Many people (Trump included) criticize Muslims for not doing enough to prevent the terrorist attacks.  But shouldn't these people also criticize "radical" religious leaders for not doing enogh about their fellow Christian leaders violent statements supporting the killing of gays?  The Orlando dead were God's children also.
The Serbs were dealing with this kind of islamofacism head on in the 90's. They were victims of atrocious media deception which paved the way for support resulting in a bombing campaign. The Clinton Family supported the Muslims there, Nobel Peace Prize Winning Barack, and Hillary did the same in Libya, and failed most recently in their attempted coup in Syria.  I have been saying for years now (in these comment sections and others), that the West is going to experience the same thing the Serbs did if things don't change, and this depressing event is just another example. These politicians are just as evil as the terrorists in their involvement in policy and "rebel" funding contributes to occurrence rates of  these events. Listen to the people, who overwhelmingly against this insane refugee immigration policy...
Those who manipulate her story to justify the abuse of young girls, and those who manipulate it in order to depict Islam as a religion that legitimises such abuse have more in common than they think. Both demonstrate a disregard for what we know about the times in which Muhammad lived, and for the affirmation of female autonomy which her story illustrates.
What a waste of time for law makers, only in Canada, I never saw any tolerance passed bills in Saudi Arabia or any other Muslim state when I lived there. Being politically correct has gone to far in this country as we waste things like my time when I travel, useless lawmaker discussion, monitoring Muslims who may act bad. Why do we not try a new approach as these platitudes just seem to feed the nut bars.
GFNC55: Now that you and Tucker put a light on it, what should be the definition of "tolerance"? Should we allow LGBT their own lives and privacy or cite the bible to condemn their lifestyle? Should we tolerate condemning all Muslims for the crimes of a few? Should we tolerate constitutional dimwits occupying the Malhuer National Wildlife Refuge? Should we tolerate white nationalist hatred? How about Dakota Sioux protest over an oil pipeline?  Its messy. Tolerance is too vague and broad a word. Its a shortcut to claiming what's right and wrong. And who can claim authority over that?
Bill Clinton would have bit his lower lip in a cynical display of fake empathy while feeling others pain.  Little Barry Hussein would have been on the golf course before the bodies were cold as he did more than once after Islamic terror attacks.  But I'm guessing the AP lefties never batted an eye back then.   Yep, a little empathy can go a long way with a crafty politician bit it doesn't pay the bills.  #MAGA
As Pr "partial travel ban of nationals from six mostly Muslim countries." There they go again. It was a list of terrorist hotspots started in 1979. Currently Cuba and NK are off the list. It looks like NK will go back on. What coincidental category will they come up with then?
Happy Ramadan.  Islam is Peace remember.
Well, I went to the cathedral in Winnipeg with a catholic friend and was told I 'had" to! Most of my Muslim friends do not wear a scarf- and are not beaten.You know that there are a lot of different Muslim sects- just as there are Christian. Check out the Amish and Hutterites. I am anything but anti- religion.....
OK.  Last things first.  I thnk you mean rapport, not report...but whatever.  And can you provide PROOF that he is not?  So if he runs for office, will you acknowledge?  Don't matter...it's just comments,  right?  By Dough saying that the policy is "anti-muslim" he is providing a negative opinion also.  Just saying.
Yup.   Supporters of Israel ride roughshod over universal values, which are Canadian values. They support "the tribe" over others. E.g., an American from Brooklyn of the right religion may move to Israel and receive instant citizenship. Meanwhile, Christian and Muslim Palestinians who lived there for countless generations are prevented from returning to their own homes.
Great column. The figure on numbers of Muslims is fascinating. 3% real, 17% perceived.  I live here in a rural area. I heard men ranting about the niqab during the election. I asked if any had ever seen one except on TV. None had.
Islam allows polygamy for males, not for females.  It's always been a puzzle to me why our Prime Minister, who regularly reminds us he is a feminist, is so comfortable and amenable with the slowly increasing influence of that religion in Canadian society.  I would have thought feminists would be aghast at any religion that treats females not only differently than but also subserviently to males.
You keep parroting the same refrain "they have been doing it in public schools for the last twenty years" What you ignore is that it was kept secret ..the public was not informed, or you would have had the same reaction two decades ago... non-muslim teachers did not like it, teachers old enough to remember the banning of the lord's prayer, certainly did not expect it to be replaced by muslim prayers. The fact that it was going on for twenty years does not make it more palatable so stop.
No, I'm not still drunk from last night, thanks for asking.  Not "untied", eh? It sure was united before the English got in there messing things up. Incidentally, I am English, born and bred, and emigrated here 43 years ago. I can assure you that there are lots of places in England you can go today where you will find heathens running around drunk and attacking each other with weapons. Back in the good old days, it was get a skinful and head out on the beach in Brighton with your bike chains to take part in the mods and rockers fights; later on it was skinheads piling in to Southall for a nice bit of Paki-bashing. I suspect it's the Muslims who are getting beaten up now.
Interesting comparison between the founder of Christianity and the founder of Islam:  https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/articles/jesus-muhammad.aspx
True, well said.  . The lefties ( actually they are not true Left, just self -anointed "progressives", and pandering politicians) too busy with "new pronouns"  and self -aggrandizing ("Trump/Bush(insert any right persona) is an ogre, ergo I am  of higher moral superiority") don't even realize the global agenda pushed by political Islam.  . Amazes me the total absence of public (or publicized) discussions  in Canada. It is not incidental, one need look no  further than this paper.  But, to correct myself - "it is a waste of time" arguing, debating these.  Not a waste of time countering their falsehoods, for the rest of the readers to see.
Are you a muslim Alceste?
1.  We were not at war with those countries.  2.  Immigrants embraced American.   These immigrants want their Sharia law.  It's just funny to see the Dem's hot on this issue.  Muslim's kill gay people in their countries, how is that for tolerance.  Muslim's are polar opposites of everything in the Social Dem's platform (women's rights, gay rights, lax drug laws, etc).  They just want to hate Trump so bad they can't see that this is inline with what they believe it.
you keep being the awesome ambassador of Islam Fred, you're doing a great job!!!   lol
Brian, thanks for very well written, but also disturbing, piece. You defend yourself very well against protestors and some iconic straw-man "the left" who accuse you, ironically, of believing what your candidate says he believes.   Will your vote determined by some angry protestors and "the left?" I certainly don't call you racist, sexist, or ignorant. But I do ask, will you vote for a man who says what Mr. Trump says about Mexicans, Muslims, blacks, and women? Who ignores decades of foreign policy, and jumps to dangerous conclusions repeatedly? Who promises to deport 11 million people? Who would exclude immigrants on the basis of religious beliefs? You redefine him as "a fighter." Do you just disbelieve everything he says?   And I'd join you, whole heartedly, in objecting to the name calling, polarizing, demeaning, common-enemy tactics of those protesters.  ... if you weren't using them to defend a man whose campaign has ridden those same tactics to unprecedented levels.
Just a hundred years after the death of their pedophile profit in 711 AD, the mooslims started taking over Spain. They even renamed Spain, Andalusia and stayed until they were driven out in 1492. Eight centuries of Muslim rule and it doesn't seem like the Spaniards ever learned anything.
Where will these people be settled? Bangladesh doesn't what them and doesn't have the resources to look after them beyond an emergency sense. Since these people are Muslim perhaps Indonesia could find space for them.
Especially with guys like this around:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/11/27/trump-will-do-to-you-muslims-what-hitler-did-to-the-jews-mosques-get-threatening-letters/
Wilfredo Tungol.  What constitutional rights are being violated by Trump's travel ban?  If there are Christians still alive in the travel ban countries--those who haven't already been raped, shot, beheaded, or burned--presumably they are subject to the same ban as Muslims or anyone else from those countries.  If a country is governed as a Muslim theocracy, it is possible there are no travelers who aren't Muslims since to be anything else means off with their heads.  Sorry, pal, but your argumant is a sieve.
You pretend Trump is accomplishing what Hitler accomplished in the 1930s. That reveals a shocking degree of pampered parochialism your thinking.   Last night on TV, on NBC from America, the first reports were these: - Trump's bans against Muslim majority countries are causing chaos for travelers of many types - The tweet from Justin Trudeau is read out word for word ("... Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith...") - a Muslim mosque in Texas burned down last night, and investigators are probing it as possible hate crime, having arrested a local man for a hate crime a few years ago involving that mosque.   Hello? Germany's 1930's press was no conduit of empathy and facts about minorities, like USA news above. Indeed, Goebbels, the government master of newspapers then, fired all Jewish journalists in 1933. Cartoons of Jews as rodents then appeared, and claims that Jews needed blood of Christians for rituals.  Get a grip. America is not 1930s Germany. Not even close.
Erdogan will clean out Turkey's teaming unemployed masses. Germany, France, Sweden and not even Canada are ready for the next waves of more refugees that will stream westward to flee Erdogan's oppression and Islamic extremism. The Liberals will embrace the teaming new comers, calling us Ismaophobes if we object to even more people from self-destructing third world Muslims states.
In 1492 the kingdoms of Castille and Aragon united, expelled the Muslims from Iberia thus allowing Fredinand and Isabela the opportunity to finance Columbus' "discovery of America " and the reason why our capital is called the District of Columbia. One wonders what the splitting of Spain might lead to.  Will the two nations have amicable relations? Will the Basques also want to become a separate nation?  Will such a divided nation be am easier target for a reconquest by the Muslims?
You need to study what the Quran says, the bases of Islam and just not give uninformed quips.
I will also never forget the Shafia women who were murdered by their family members because they just wanted to live like Canadian women. This is where my "Islamophobia" began.
Okay, I'll reply.   I have learned that it's no use to argue with a liberal because here are the standard answers: I don't like President Obama's policies - makes me a racist. I don't support ISIS - makes me anti Muslim. I think Secretary Clinton is extremely dishonest - makes me a misogynist. I think the ACA is the worst POS I have ever seen come from the Government - makes me hate sick people. I think President Trump is a much better choice than Secretary Clinton - makes me the most hateful person in the U.S. This country is so divided it's unreal, and this division started a long time before 1/20/2017. Please feel free to tell me how wrong I am.
Yes I know that both your comments referred to "years ago", that's why they have little relevance to the issue at hand.  And what accommodation would you have wanted? Did you ask for it? Or was it that your church services were already on Sunday and so didn't conflict with school days. Or are you suggesting that since no one offered you anything that Muslim parents shouldn't ask for something for their children? Maybe the issue is with your parents, not the Muslim ones? Or are you suggesting thats since your needs were ignored that we shouldn't try to address that error for other children 35 years later?
Lots of Muslims working in Vancouver's craft drug industry...might be worth checking out.
Win-win, some more people get to be Canadians (always a good thing!) plus new Muslim Liberal voters for at least a couple generations (yay!).  Good idea, and thank you for bringing this idea to our attention, Globe and Mail!
It's not whether a given activity is a religious practice, it's whether the individual claiming the Charter right genuinely treats it as a religious belief.  And yes, there have been cases where it has qualified.    One example was the follow-through decision to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in R. v. N.S. (in which this author represented the muslim woman).  You can read the full decision at:  https://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2013/2013oncj209/2013oncj209.html?searchUrlHash=AAAAAQAFbmlxYWIAAAAAAQ&resultIndex=2  The question is framed this way: "In order to establish a prima facie case under s. 2(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (“the Charter”), N.S. must satisfy the court that her wish to wear her niqab in court is based on a sincere religious belief. "  She gave evidence and was cross-examined on the issue, and the justice concluded that it was based on a sincere religious belief.  In the end, she was not allowed to wear her niqab to give evidence.
The same can be said of Islam. The World has made the same mistake of treating Islamic nations  as  equal partners, who cherish the same basic principles of democracy, freedom of expression and citizen's rights. They do not. and Trump's calling them out too for their  failure to grow up.
A couple of important points are missing.  No one that accepts Israel as  state, disputes Jerusalem as its capital.  Jews moved into eastern parts of the city after 1967 because before that, that part of the city was illegally occupied by Jordan and Jews were not even allowed to visit the holiest site in Judaism.  Imagine Muslims no being allowed to visit Mecca.   There is no "Palestinian" land.  The land in question was occupied by Jordan and Egypt until 1967.  Only since the 1967 was has some of that land actually come under Palestinian control, including the entire Gaza Strip vacated by Israel. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas (and their predecessors) have refused several offers of land for peace since 1967, and before 1967, when there was not a single "Settlement", the Arabs refused peace and rejcted a two state for two peoples solution.
"As a white Christian, I'm disgusted that so many in my family of faith played a key role in electing a bully who boasts about sexual assault, defines all Muslims by the actions of an extreme few, called Pope Francis "disgraceful" and mocked a disabled reporter."  Let me add to your list, please.  We elected the guy who attacked the American presidency with pervasive lies because he didn't like the man or his policies.  We elected the guy who attacked the American system of voting and continues to weaken that system with his unproven tweets.   Add "non-patriot who attacks the United States" to your list. That might (might) get the attention of those who need to hear this.    One more thing.......stop the Hillary comparisons, please everyone.  Hillary is gone.  There are no "two evils" from which to choose.  There is only Trump.  We will judge him on his own actions.
That guy cannot and will not make a claim. I'm more inclined to think that he is more likely to be picked up on terrorism charges at some point. The federal government had no part in his traipsing around that part of the world, much less any mistreatment that he suffered. His problems were completely self-inflicted, at best he naively thought that being a Muslim would protect him wherever he went there and at worst he spent five years in intensive training.
.  A victory for intolerance.  The Muslims who have been so rejected by these people should be, and probably are, already looking for a place where hatred doesn't determine who rests where.  .
He called upon the Taliban for justice because they made him convert to their religion.   And he's back to being non-muslim because actually converting got him diddly squat.   What exactly do you think happens in a lawless camp full of rebels dedicated to murder and pillage in the first place ? They're handing out fluffy bunny rabbits and cr*pping ranbows out their behinds ?
Based on Watson's logic, any other President could have issued the same order with any legal challenge whatsoever. It's not the EO he has a problem with, it's Trump's campaign statements that he views as anti Muslim.  The 6 countries mentioned in the EO represent less than 5% of the world's muslims. If it truly was a Muslim ban as Chin insists, why did he leave the other 95% off the list?
Have you ever been to a Muslim country where it is the law for ALL women, Muslim OR not, to wear the burqa in public OR in more liberal Muslim countries, where it is law to cover the arms in public in 50 plus degree weather? My sister lives and works in the Middle East so I would know. If Muslim nations, which are mostly dictatorships, not democracies, can enforce these laws, so can the west. Tit for tat. We value freedom but there is nothing FREE about a woman who is FORCED by a misogynistic religion, to dress a certain way in public. How you can defend this shows your lack of life experience. Religion should not be politicized - as it is right now across the West - by some VERY politically radical Musim groups. The West has separated church from state and that's why many modernist Muslims have moved here. They want TRUE freedom from their religion. Religion doesn't give you rights; nationality does. 'Religious Entitlement' is not law in Canada. And, Islam is not a race, btw.
'Islamophobia'?  Why are the Muslim women expected to dress in immigrant baggy clothing while the Muslim men dress in Western clothing? Nothing separates cultures more than clothing.  When will the Muslim men stop viewing women as inferior?   Are people aware that Muslim fathers are selling their young daughters to old Muslim men? Here in Canada. For money. Their own daughters.  This is not 'Islamophobia', this is a huge concern of a culture that has entered Canada and shows no interest in integrating into the culture of Canada. No other culture has entered Canada and refused to integrate like the Muslim culture.  Don't use the word 'Islamophobia' and point fingers at Canadians, look to yourselves.
Canada was overall, based in Christianity.  In comes Islam, demanding accommodation and systematic introduction of their religion. What do the canadian mainstream media, and its reader base say?, well of course, scrap the original Christian background  to accommodate the new cultural one.  Since when, let the newcomers practice their culture in the comfort of their homes, prayer's place, like many other immigrants are doing at the moment. We never had immigrants like orientals, spanish, budhist, hindu, etc, introducing motions, singling them out as 'special'. Something wrong with the way liberals are handling this affairs.
Hey Gary why don't you talk about the real racists....that are trying to ban the niqab, where 6 muslims were murdered?
It's simple, in the past Trump has clearly denounced Islamic terrorists (and most of us support him on that), but now he clearly needed to denounce NAZI terrorists. I don't know what you are referring to in the last 8 years. Most of our mass shootings were caused by demented gun nuts, and not politically motivated, except for those events traced to ISIS fanatics.
Why are all Globe columns about Islamic matters always written from the militant Muslim's point of view? Are the rest of us just outsiders?   No moderate Muslim  is ever given credence. All non Muslims are dismissed as mere hate mongers. Taking the side of Muslims against social secularism (which would otherwise be considered for the common good) can not end well.
The government of Canada signed a 14-year deal  in Feb 2014 with the 'Canadian subsidiary' of U.S. General Dynamics to produce these LAVs, & provide training & support services to "an international customer".   Saudi Arabia insisted on full confidentiality. Wouldn't the USA accept the deal, so Canada became the go-between?   Saudi Arabia is an Islamic theocracy where only the Muslim faith is practised; yet, the Sunnis and Shias interpret Islam differently, and Sunnis are the majority in Saudi Arabia, so they crack down on the Shia. In Shia-dominated Iran, Sunnis are the target. Odd to think people who share ethnicity, language & culture can be so divided by the same religion that they fight each other. Hardened religious beliefs honed over centuries .. then, each child is raised in a particular version of the same religion, passed down from parents.  Religious freedom? Religion as a right and a fight?  This was entirely predictable .. now, Canada will 'review' the sale of LAVs?
Wow.  He was worried about how he would be portrayed as a Muslim man praying.  I wonder how he will be portrayed now.
I'm not sure where the author gets her information. The integration of Muslim refugees in Denmark is not going well. Queen Margarethe of Denmark was quoted recently as saying  that migrants arriving from south east Asia had “prospered”, but those coming from the Middle East “have had a hard time finding their rhythm in Denmark”. The arrival of predominantly Muslim refugees has sparked a heated debate about migration in the country and a leading Danish politician has called for a ban on all Muslim refugees entering the country for up to six years.  Refugees from Middle Eastern countries - like war-torn Syria - are demanding they be allowed to go to Sweden or Finland because the terms of asylum are more favourable for them and the Danes don't provide enough benefits.   Has it also occurred to the author how the US would react to Canada accepting the refugees they are turning away? Our porous border means we simply become another route to the US. Think the US will accept this for long?
And so Trump should rightfully appeal the immigration ban. There seems to be a serious misdiagnosis of the problem. The cause of the problem are terrorists who are being targeted. The symptom of the problem is that they seem to be Muslims as in the World Trade Collapse.  But many democrats and "liberals" seem to intentionally confuse the issue by claiming it is discriminatory against Muslims which is simply not true.
"[S]ome church leaders saying it [Twitler's attack on Muslims] was necessary to protect the country's security."  The reporter should identify just WHO are these gutless "church leaders" who have abandoned the Gospels, who like to linger in the same gutter with Twitler.  Tell us who they are.  If any of these "church leaders" are members of the Catholic hierarchy or priests, their faculties to preach and perform the sacraments should be revoked, and they should be silenced immediately.
I'm fine with discussing how to meet people's needs, rationally, but that is never what happens, it soon degenerates into name-calling.  Apparently this all started because Muslim kids were skipping the mosque when they were supposed to go themselves after school, and "the community" figured if the prayer was held at school they would have to go. Let's start with that simple fact. It's not as if there wasn't an alternative, but some thought that wasn't good enough because kids could get away with not going.
Now, now little fella, we in Canada now live in the 21st century enjoying the fruits of the 1000 year struggle of our ancestors to give us to our liberal western democracy of today.  In order to return the best modern facsimile of  12th century laws  and repressions, you would have to travel to any modern Muslim majority nation ( except perhaps Turkey, but they're working on it).  Or to some Muslim neighborhoods in Britain or France.
It is amazing how our media and left politicians cannot get that many Islamic followers hates the west.    We may have more enlightened Muslims in Canada.....but then again we may not.  To throw our support, or to attempt to bully and strong arm citizens into embracing a religion that for eons has hated our Country, our ways, our culture and our religions is simply bizarre.  Why is this such a mandate for the media and progs.?  What is the reason for this push?  I am not anti-Muslim, but within my country I do not want to be forced to only think happy thoughts and sunshine.....when we have seen women attacked, and sharia law applied within Canada.
I disagreed with your statement that: "France has no (zero) "no go zones where sharia is the law of the land." For you to deny that Muslims aren't trying to enforce Sharia in any zones of France is what I'm questioning. Are you claiming that these French women are lying?
This is just so disgraceful!  Most of the world's refugees are Muslim,and we are refusing to accept them.  Shame on us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Both of you guys have a point. Some Muslims do openly stand against the violence, but the majority are silent.
Saudi Arabia where this 'religion' originates is going to execute a man for being an atheist.  Is that something these muslims are teaching their children?  Keep this out of our schools.
I can agree with the sentiment expressed by the G&M.  However, I don't think that the condemnation be restricted to anti-Muslim acts.  We already have protections within the Canadian Charter of Rights to protect all Canadians from discrimination regardless of race, creed, sexual orientation, etc.  Let's just say that anti-Islamic bigotry is unCanadian.
jcpro says: "All the Administration needs to say is that the Christians are at higher risk of prosecution"  1. That's "all the Administration needs to say"?  Wouldn't it be nice if courts worked that way.  2. All the Christian refugee applicants are at higher risk than all the muslim refugee applicants?  Ever heard of taking each case as it comes?    By the way, Laurence Tribe says the First Amendment, not the 14th.
The Executive Order the judges blocked is about Muslims who are a religious minority in the US but not in the countries banned nor in the entire planet.  Just to clarify, there were 3 "bombshell" news that turned out to be fake (1) Trump sharing highly classified information with the Russians (2)  that former FBI director James Comey had requested additional prosecutorial tools from the Department of Justice (DOJ) one day before he was fired by President Trump. (3)  Deputy AG Rosenstein was weighing whether to resign from his role at the Justice Department.
As much as you want me to be, I'm not an apologist for islam, although I am a proponent of tolerance.  I realize that's a foreign concept for you.  I don't know about stories on your favourite city Rotherham, but the Globe has published many stories on genital mutilation and on sexual assaults in Sweden.  I think your problem is that the Globe doesn't assume that the million peaceful muslims in Canada partake in either.  It's hardly surprising that you can't bring yourself to post anything negative about the 'donor' this article is about - not about his white supremacy, nor about his exhortations to violence.
Ask a Muslim.
Of course they bad mouth him. It is all they and the election losing folks do.   Here is a great thing our President and his WH Administration is doing as well. But I didn't read it here.   7 News -CO (Sister News of the DP)  The U.S. is cracking down on Myanmar for failing to sufficiently address its humanitarian crisis involving Rohingya Muslims...  The U.S. gave Myanmar more than $50 million for humanitarian needs in fiscal year 2015...  Last week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. was "extraordinarily concerned" about the situation and that "the world can't just stand idly by and be witness to the atrocities" in Myanmar-  http://www.thedenverchannel.com/newsy/myanmar-loses-us-military-aid-for-failing-to-fix-rohingya-crisis
Sure, I'll answer your question - yes, campaigning in the referendum is unrestricted in that sense.  However:  1.  It should have been mentioned in the article and wasn't. 2. If even the leader of the door-to-door campaign is a member of a far-right anti-muslim group who makes that an issue in the campaign, there's a good chance that a no vote would be invalid.  Now that I've answered my question, perhaps you can answer one of the many questions you have ignored in the past:  We know who the military figure Charles Martel was in the 8th century - why did you chose it as your online name now?
No, they'd said it was all about guns, and nothing about Islam.
Once again inflamed rhetoric by the MSM. Obama did the same thing in 2011............banning refugees from Iraq for 6 months and also a temporary ban on the same countries as Trump did.  The reason then is the same as now......a periodic hiatus while the US can re calibrate their immigration filters.  As we can see by the terror attack in Quebec city, inflamed and irresponsible rhetoric by the MSM is exactly what ISIS wants to provoke and they get it every time from the MSM.  The MSM completely ignores the hundreds killed every day in terror attacks  in the muslim countries by other muslims, as tho these poor souls are any different than humans every where.  Its the prerogative of every country to have secure borders. The US does not. They are fixing it..
Employees are paid money and can spend it however they want.  At issue in the Hobby Lobby case was a newfound government power to compel employers to buy things for their employees (at their employees' request) that their consciences as informed by their religion tell them they must not buy for others.  In this case it was Protestants being compelled to buy (by proxy) drugs they thought were abortifacients.  But it could be contraceptives per se, alcohol (for Mormons and Muslims), firearms (for aging Jesuits) or tickets to the local whorehouse.    "Buy me crack." No.   "Government sez you hafta buy me crack."   Still no, thanks to the Hobby Lobby decision.  The employee has zero religious liberty interest--none--in compelling the employer to buy these things, no more than an Aztec fundamentalist has in compelling others to walkup the pyramid steps and have their hearts cut out at the top.  Religious liberty interest of the employee isn't even what the government argued in the case.
Justin and company need to address Turkey's refusal to recognize the 1915 Genocide of Armenian Christians. Over 1.8 million murdered. Present government of Turkey makes it a crime to even admit Turkeys guilt. Imagine if Germany did that regarding the Holocaust. Muslim nations and great Muslims in Canada need to lobby the Turkish government on this burning issue.  Canada could cut trade, ban tourism and cut relations until Turkey acts more civilized. But then again it does not fit the present narrative by the government and news media.
Interesting article from a member of an Islamic lobbying group about the merits of muzzling dissent. Islam cometh.
no the islam converts and such others born into it are the problem period
Hey!  Now we are getting somewhere!  Amira is communications director at the National Council of Canadian Muslims.  Who knew there was a National Council?  Who knew they had a Communications Director?  If I had your job, I wouldn't consider myself a success--nor my council--until messages like the one that so upsets Council members had become a very rare phenomenon.  And, Amira, I would make this my New Years Resolution: to fight those false perceptions that you are (or should be) charged with fighting.  But, no, what do you do? You put YOUR people's responsibility back on US.  Right. Blame the public.  But, hey, having been in PR and marketing most of my career, I know that you are often only as good as your client allows you to be.  I have a hunch this might be true of you. If true, you have my sympathies.  And don't clip out this column and photocopy it and call it a victory.  Not with that final paragraph.
I read the first link and if other are interested it's pretty good.  The author is clearly not a Trump supportor, IMO, he resents the way Trump has used veterans as "props".   He also mentions he's opposed to Trump's comments on Muslim's which he feels is in direct contradiction to the intent of the Constitution.    On the flip side he had little kind words for Democrats and Clinton because they have maintained what is headed to be a war of more than 20 years.  Soldiers who vote are predominantly male accustomed to clear lines of authority.*    Trump is all about authority, but regretfully an 'image of authority' is much different than authority born of competence and skill.         *The military is not a democracy and it shouldn't be.  I'd be comfortable with a military officer of stature, with a great educational base in one of the academies.    Like Eisenhower, they know the human damage of war.   They live life with open eyes and see both the best and worst of human nature.
Say what you want about Assad - he's saved Syria from becoming an islamic / saudi terror state. Make no mistake about it, the so called moderates were sunni jihadists supported and run by the Gulf states. Had Assad not done it, Israel would have. And everyone knows what Israel's big stick is.
You would think that Canada would learn from Western Europe's massive overrun of so-called Muslim refugees from the Middle East and North Africa. Eastern Europeans closed their borders - they knew what was coming.  85% of the refugees are illiterate uneducated young men who are hard core unemployable and many are on crime sprees,  And they never assimilate.  The drain on the economies  and medical services  in many of the Western European Countries is massive. And many ISIS terrorists are among them.  In Europe, native Europeans have less than 1 child per family where Muslim families have 4 - 5 children per family.  So the math and the demographics support Bat Ye'or's Eurabia in less than 2 generations.    As with the Palestinians and the rest of the Muslims; why don't the gulf states who are rich take these fellow Muslims in. You won't like it.  They want western culture overwhelmed with Muslim immigration to replace western culture.
This is not a civil war; Sunni players inside and outside Syria---supported by the USA in its callous  campaign of "toppling Arab dictators"---have been trying to overthrow and eliminate Syria's Shia minority, who are fighting for their lives.  It's a "big lie" that Assad's opponents are democracy-loving secular Muslims. In reality, any "moderate opposition" in Syria was pushed aside or absorbed within a year by hard-core Sunni jihadist groups, supplied and financed by Syria's Sunni neighbors Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE.  The truth is that by far the most powerful group, Al Qaeda spinoff Jabhat al Nusra, was on the verge of overthrowing the Assad government a year ago and making all of Syria part of the new "caliphate" (and slaughtering or exiling every last Shia Muslim). Washington complacently sat by, letting it happen, as if Iraq and Libya had taught them nothing. Putin and Russia, Iran and Lebanon stopped that happening, and the world should be grateful--I bet most Syrians are.
My neighbor immigrated from Pakistan 5 or 6 years ago.  He seems to be a good guy.  Works hard.  Pays his taxes.  Friendly.  He's also a devout Muslim.  He should be packing, right?    I have more questions about his adult son.  Often unemployed.  Isn't going to school.  Sticks to himself.  But hey, he's not on any watch list so he should be packing too.  Right?
Donald wants 'extreme' vetting for Muslims but doesn't do it for his own cabinet. What a surprise.
In previous reporting, it was stated that Toronto, Windsor, Surrey and Winnipeg all have appropriate and fair numbers for "baseless/unfounded" cases, in the range of less than ten percent of cases.  And the article pointed out that level was appropriate and fair because "true unfounded cases, which arise from malicious or mistaken reports, (afflict) between 2 % and 8 % of complaints (rendering them) false reports, according to research from North America, the United Kingdom and Australia."  It is peculiar to me that the editors do not remind readers of that fact in today's blanket-bomb of Canadian police forces. Those cities do not merely have "low" numbers, they have FAIR and EXPECTED ones.    I have a sneaking suspicion that, had the offending entities in question been, I dunno, say women, or Muslims, or natives, or feminists...  ... this newspaper would have been quick to emphasize that NOT ALL of them are like that, in an article that otherwise blanket-bombed them with criticism...
Hi Jimbo, 3 motivations:  1. My chief motivation to write on this topic and the other one on Muslim Adventists (and there is a third article as yet unpublished) was I got sick of reading about women's ordination and the usual "culture wars" issue. Don't get me wrong, those issues are immensely important and I had to have my two cents worth. But I am now getting "culture war fatigue", so thought I would write about some "big issues" instead - if only to give us all a breather.   2. And this topic in particular came about by accident, when I was watching an episode of Westworld. From there I ended up reading both Jaynes's book and the one by Rabbi Cohen. It naturally then made me think about Ellen White and the rock=epilepsy claims, as well as the nature of phenomena associated with Paul's blindness etc etc.  3. Recently a man who is schizophrenic and/or demon possessed has been attending our Church regularly. On top of everything else, it made me wonder...
Weary of this sort of news, I only scanned this article.  Is there any mention of the perp being a muslim & what specific type .... or is that no longer acceptable?
@ALbertD3 >>So, in saying that, am I an online troll? You didn't define it very clearly, just as M103 fails to clearly define Islamophobia. This is a dangerous game. .  Bingo. . We have slew of articles conveying 'Muslim victimhood' and 'Canadian -phobias' - most of the time authored by a Muslim woman in a head-scarf. . Here - I said it, "a head scarf".  Is that so bad? Is that Islamophobia?  Hold the outrage, before marking the post, and ask yourselves - why is that a pattern? . Where are the Muslim male authors?  . Or non-covered Muslim female authors? . Or "opinion columns" that differ than those having been relentlessly published in G&M?
A lot of the people being maligned and harassed (and even killed) in the USA right now are legal immigrants, or the children of legal immigrants.  It may be that "God Bless America" and "O77" are very welcoming to their Mexican-American and Muslim neighbors.   But a lot of people are jumping on a nativist bandwagon, and they start out with getting angry at illegal immigrants and then spread that anger at others.
For the record, women being exempted from prayer during menstrual cycles has nothing to do with their gender. Men are exempted as well if they are bleeding just as much, due to injury, or wound, etc. You can try to push the "Islam is anti-women" line as much as you like, but it doesn't hold up when examined in the sunlight of facts.   The reason why men and women are separated during prayer time is to let each person focus on their relationship with God. This is the actual reason. This reason also drives other rules or recommendations, such as the one that states that you shouldn't wear distracting clothing to the mosque, and that you should turn your cellphones to silent, etc. This is out of respect for the place of worship and to let everyone focus on their supplications in peace and sincerity.
The Muslim Ban is bigotry at its finest.  So you will agree that anyone who works to implement the Muslim ban should be denied Communion along with pro-choice politicians.  Yes?
Antifa should be classified as a domestic terrorist group - no two ways about it. The irony of being "anti-fascist" yet crashing a free speech event (organized and attended jointly by left, right and centrists) and using force to try and silence a group, is not lost on me.   Of course, the media framed this as a "mostly peaceful protest" because there was little footage that could bolster their agenda.. Go ahead and watch Tim Pool's 2 hour livestream of what these uniformed (and uninformed) animals were doing. Their whole "punch a nazi" (aka. anyone right of the far left) movement, is disgusting, and it is coming here.   All of this really boils down to the existence of free speech, and the pace at which it is being destroyed. Hate speech is one thing, but even in this article, disagreeing with the notion of public money being spent on prayer rooms is classified an entire group as "anti-muslim".
Alceste, you downvoted my comment for a reason, you disagree with my statement, you wouldn't agree with:  immigrants should respect our people , they shouldn't either show love for  canadians,  it would be fine if they don't want  to be part of our nation. Well, understandable you're a representative of the pro-islamic movement, anti-canadian sentiment.
Pretty clearly a lot of religious nutcases in Canada want to use Islam to force us all to be believers. No, we removed christianity from running our lives, segregating us. We did not do so to have an even more primitive and brutal Religion  foisted upon us. Anyone arguing this anti-social slave clothing is a right needs to read up on both normal muslim behavior but also ex-muslims. Butt is the enemy of democracy​ and women worldwide!
Did Muslims around the world draw straws to see who get shredded into hamburger in a bar and Istanbul won?
Good.  As a hardcore conservative, this is exactly what our asylum program should be used for, people actually under oppression.  Better yet, gays from the area are almost surely not to agree with the backwards Islamic rule of the area let alone the extremist views that run rampant there.  Anyone who thinks the modern conservative is racist or homophobic are usually the same type of simpleminded as those who would claim Trump is a nazi (a truly ridiculous proposition).  Back to the issue - floods of people directly over the border, illegally, not actually facing any persecution; that's what angers the average conservative.
Yes, it was in Portland no wonder the media plays to the anti-Muslim hysteria. If it smells it sells $$$$$. Mean while else where in the world House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced she is fit to tied over President Donald Trump’s failure to visit countries in alphabetical order.
Obviously the logic of the comment you mention is flawed but it is not indicative of the view by many here from the so called left. Most of us are out here to balance out the even more flawed opining of those you suggest that all of Islam should be painted with the same broad brush.
the St. Laurent mayor did not change bylaws to allow for a mosque to be built that is why he was rejected by the Justin and his Islamofascist entourage. Seriously that is why he will not say why.
The NRA claim terrorists,  of every shape and form, only strike in gun-free zones, i.e. zones where concealed or open carry not allowed.  Their prime example is the Fort Hood military base where the cowardly disgruntled muslim camp psychiatrist let loose with a firearm in the 'gun free zone'.
This glaring example of public misdirection reminds me of another.  The principalities and powers continuously shriek and flail about the Islamic Republic of Iran's nonexistent "nuclear weapons" to divert attention away from the Zionist entity's' very REAL ones, which they have repeatedly threatened to deploy since the 1967 war.  Golda Meir order 13 nuclear weapons readied for deployment at the start of that war.  The US went to DEFCON III.  Former Minister of Mass-Murder Ariel Sharon (lannatullahi alayhi) said: We are much more important than you Americans think.  We can take the Middle East with us when we go."  They call this the "Samson Option."  And today, so-called "liberal" propagandists shriek and flail about Trumpty-Dumpty using nukes, when Hillary Bathory the Blood Countess has PROMISED to do so for a decade to please her Zionist puppet-masters.  More misdirection--like screeching about a garter-snake in front of you while a cobra rears up and spreads its hood behind you.
As usual, it is Christians and Jews helping their fellow man.  I pray for the day when atheists, Moslems, etc will also begin to do something positive for others.
'anger' and 'chaos'.  Ha!  Most of the civilized world admires what President Trump has done to protect his country from the Muslim hordes.  The French government will be replaced by May and Brexit won.  Netherlands and Italy are next.  Germany a good possibility.
http://www.factcheck.org/2016/08/video-obama-clinton-not-isis-founders/ Video: Obama, Clinton Not ISIS ‘Founders’ By FactCheck.org   Trump points to the withdrawal of troops from Iraq in 2011, under Obama, as “the founding of ISIS.” But experts say the creation of the Islamic State terrorist group dates to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the expansion of ISIS can’t be pinned on the troop withdrawal alone — if at all. And there’s the fact that President George W. Bush had signed the agreement and set the date for that withdrawal.  http://www.factcheck.org/2016/08/trumps-false-obama-isis-link/ Trump’s False Obama-ISIS Link Furthermore, Trump himself supported withdrawing troops from Iraq as early as 2007, telling CNN in a March 16, 2007, interview that the U.S. should “declare victory and leave, because I’ll tell you, this country is just going to get further bogged down. … [T]his is a total catastrophe and you might as well get out now, because you just are wasting time.”
The Muslims of Mindanao have a reputation in the Philipines as smart and fierce fighters. The Moros fought off the Spanish, Japanese, and the Phillipines over almost a thousand years. The spread of ISIS to the Phillipines and the formation of a branch of the Caliphate there along with ISIS training camps is a danger to Southeast Asia. Rooting out ISIS from Mindanao will be almost impossible for Duarte-- he is not the first Philippine president to be challenged by Muslim uprisings or inter Islamic conflicts-- this will be a test for him. There are already signs of mlitancy in the Muslim populations of nearby Sabah, Malaysia, and Indonesia  (although some militants in these areas prefer their own militant groups over ISIS).
Thanks again Alceste, for proving yourself impervious to radical discussion as a hothead of the reverse persuasion...  No one did that except in your own mind. No "hate", and no "equation". Just the question, "when is it a good idea to make a point of congratulating someone for their "courage"?   Why is it that "Progressives" who are at the forefront of fighting religious obscurantism and sexism when it involved Christianity, defend even worse obscurantis and sexism when it involves Muslims? Why will they congratulate women who wear Muslim scarves and veils for their "courage", but not right-wing writers or fundamentalist Christians for THEIR courage in expressing their views? And what takes more courage, facing nasty looks and social disapproval, or actually putting your life on the line, but do you congratulate those who do that in the name of Islam for their courage, too?
RD, you raise, as usual, a false dichotomy.  The last SJ rally I was at there were all manner of people: female, male, heterosexual, homosexual, African, Caucasian, Asian, Native American, immigrant, native born, Protestants, Catholics, Orthodox, Jews, Muslims, Nones.  Many of them had infants and toddlers.   They change diapers AND righteously protest injustice.
A whole bunch of comments have just disappeared. I posted "Muslims don't like bacon". For the fifth time that innocuous post disappeared within 5 minutes. How could that possibly be uncivil? When I've posted "Jews don't like bacon" it's never disappeared...
Do you have a link (facts not opinion) to that wild number?  Most Muslims are here to get away from Sharia law.  Have you ever spoke with a Muslim-American or been to a Mosque?
>>The pomposity of self-declared winners gets old quickly. . As  do your vapid one-liners. . Care to provide a real response, or you are just on duty (as usual) to "protect" by declaring anyone who would question the Islam-pandering Liberal agenda, exploited by political Islam a bigot, racist ( as if Islam is a race)? +1
On BBC World's HardTalk interview program recently Ms Le Pen made a lot of sense re migrants, secularism, Islamic fundamentalism and Russia.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T84Sl2DREQY
It is disgraceful that Prime Minister Trudeau rushed out his condemning proclamation that the Quebec shooter was guilty of “a terrorist attack".  There are reports swirling that the name of the shooter is "Mohamed Khadir" with roots in Morocco, a nation between 96 percent and 99 percent Sunni Muslim.  But Trudeau should not jump to conclusions, he should not rush to condemn Mohamed Khadir as a terrorist.   For example, for all we know, Mr. Khadir may suffer from psychiatric illness. Canada has cruelly failed in providing the needed levels of mental health care to those who need it. Why is Justin Trudeau so certain that Mr. Khadir is a terrorist rather than the victim of a mental health disease?  It is disgrace that Justin Trudeau rushes to judge Mohamed Khadir as a terrorist, without the facts all being known.   And yet Mr. Trudeau DID WAIT AND PAUSE to get all the facts in previous violent attacks in Canada. Why did he not pause THIS TIME? Is it because these victims were Muslim?
One presumably a Muslim, the other ...a convert?  No matter, Trump is the obvious culprit in the eyes of the media and most of our political class.  The more allowed entry into Canada without a thorough vetting the better?
President Trump is  stating why his policy is necessary as well as who started that ball rolling originally. It will take several years to 'back vet'  who is here right now. (Folks such as this man and the San Bernardino Bride jihadist.)  Uzbekistan Refugee Expresses Anger And Shock Over Travel Ban ... news.wgbh.org/2017/.../uzbekistan-refugee-expresses-anger-and-shock-over-travel-b... Feb 2, 2017 - Stas Gayshan, of Wayland, Massachusetts, is expressing anger and shock over President Trump’s executive order temporarily banning travel from seven majority-Muslim nations and halting a Syrian refugee program, among other measures
Its called the First Friday Prayer and it is uttered at ALL the Mosques from one end of the planet to the other and it ISNT Pretty. Lets hear what its about from a Muslim Scholar schooling the members of a rather Important Canadian Agency. Afterwards you can comment on how Islam is a Peaceful religion and why you shouldn't be at all concerned.             https://youtu.be/xONYrtJ6ZlM
I'm agreeing with you. He, by demonstration, lied.  After Obama you must agree with me.  It apparently comes with the office.  Change can be good.  Changing your mind can be better!  The Order shows he has done just that, or it would have included all Muslim countries, like India.   Isn't President Trump wise? Thanks Mr. President for continuing to try and keep our great country safe.
Trudeau said during the election  " The more Muslim  refugees we allow in Canada the less risk we have of terrorism:" ..
No, the premise of M-103 is too flawed from the outset. It open-endedly casts virtually all criticism of Islam (or any other religion if you extend the premise) as tantamount to prejudice and/or racism. Religion, of course, is a man-made institution and as such must in a democratic country be open to criticism and/or ridicule and/or censure. This is simply consistent with Western values that have progressed from the Reformation to the Enlightenment to the present.
Under President Obama, and his two Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, the United States foreign policy is a disaster, Obama inherited a relatively stable Middle East with Iraq people and Afghans voting with relatively stable governments. ISIS did not exist, most of the Taliban gad fled to Pakistan, and al Qaeda was decimated. The Middle East now is in total chaos. The Taliban have taken back 1/4 of Afghanistan. Libya is rules by ISIS and elements of al Qaeda with over 200,000 Iraqis killed since he took office. Large portions of Iraq and Syria are ruled by ISIS and al Qaeda with over 500,000 killed and almost 1 million refugees, most of which are lawless uneducated Muslim men are invading and destabilizing western Europe.  Russia has annexed the Crimea  and the Eastern Ukraine is next.   Russia is completing Iran's large nuclear reactor and has shipped ten S-400 SAM Missile Platforms to Tehran.   They own all this mass slaughter and mass chaos.
Well Syrian refugees right?, notwithstanding the other things about Trump, Clinton is horribly naïve to believe Syrian refugees want to live the "American dream" and will respect things like transgender bathrooms and homosexual rights -- no surprise a common phrase in Israel concerning Americans dealings with islam is "I told you so"
What kind of example does Trump represent for the young?  Do you want your children to emulate him? How so?  In lying whenever it suits them,  to get out of being responsible for what they say and do? Lying as a way to cast blame on others and avoid responsibiity?  Do you want your children to grow up to think it's OK to condemn all  immigrants from Latin America as violent criminals? And all Muslims (all 1.2 billion of them) as being terrorists?  Do you want your children to be sexually promiscuous, to brag about their promiscuity,  and to have serial marriages? Do you want your sons to look at women primarily as sex objects and to rate them according to their physical attractiveness?   Do you want your children to break commitments - to their spouses, to their "allies" (as Trump has stated he wants to do with America's allies)? Should your children to value money and glitz insstead of virtue?  What precisely is it about Trump that you believe is something your children can admire?
Was it Saddam Hussein who on his retreat from Kuwaiti set on fire oil wells, pillage towns, and prosecuted anyone opposed to his regime? Obama seems, is taking on the steps of  infamous Saddam and his affinity to Islam, showing his true color, trying desperately to leave in ruins, before he jumps ship,  what he wouldn't dare do during his disastrous tenure. Trump will need to pick up the pieces and mend them.
The laptop ban does not apply just to Muslims. It applies to everyone flying from those airports on those airlines and not just those who are Muslims or citizens of those countries. Hence it is not like the Trump travel ban that has constitutional issues because It applies to 6 Muslim countries. The laptop ban is like Obama's constitutional immigration order that applied to everyone coming into the US no matter where they came from, but used vetting criteria that Identified and checked people who had travelled to one of 7 countries that had terrorist training camps or facilities that converted people to ISIS, so you could be banned even if you came from the US, but had travelled to a country like Libya. Same with the laptops-- no matter your religon, if you flew on a plane from those countries that were risks of being a source of laptop bombs, you could not take a laptop.  No issue of constitutionality because of religous discrimination. Even non Muslims cannot bring a laptop.
From Wiki:  Jamaat ul-Fuqra (alternatively Jamaat al-Fuqra) (Arabic: جماعة الفقراء, "Community of the Impoverished") is a terrorist organization of mostly African-American Muslims based in Pakistan and the United States. Some of the approximately 3000 members have planned various acts of violence, often directed at rival factions. Two Al-Fuqra members were convicted of conspiring to murder Rashad Khalifa in 1990 and others are alleged to have assassinated Ahmadiyya leader Mozaffar Ahmad in 1983.  The group itself is not listed as a terror group by the US or the EU, but was listed as a terrorist organization in the 1999 Patterns of Global Terrorism report by the U.S. State Department. It operates two front groups: Muslims of the Americas and Quranic Open University. They also have been known to operate in Canada and the Caribbean.
Yes, Justicels , the 3 religions are all Abrahamic religions  Historically Judaism is the elder brother of Christianity as Pope John Paul II and Benedict have acknowledged  The Old testament of Christians is the same as the Jewish Torah  However the Koran or Qu'ran of Islam is different
Forget about the Catholic component. It's very clear that race is as important an issue in this election as gender. Whites by and large are going for Trump and non-whites are for Clinton. Men by and large and going for Trump and women for Clinton. Clearly, we've reached a moment in our history where we're retreating into our tribal bases. That's a very sad commentary on the state of a nation that was founded on the idea of disparate peoples coming together. That whole sense seems to be totally gone.   Republicans who defend Donald Trump talk a lot about "taking their country back." Implicit in that statement is taking it back from blacks, women (who've gotten too uppity), gays, Muslims, and immigrants - all the way back to a time when straight white men ruled the world and everyone else had to cow-tow to them. Well those days, thankfully, are never coming back.  This is the election in which empowered femininity will vanquish toxic masculinity and the U.S.A. will be much better for it.
(Islamic State extremists have claimed responsibility but British officials have said they don't see proof of a connection yet.)  A connection which is positive is that British troops were and are in Muslim countries, killing Muslims. That certainly is an incentive to bomb Brits.
No, it wasn't Obama's fault there were so many hate crimes against Muslims.  It was the fault of the people who committed them.  By and large, they would have been Trump supporters - and all during his campaigns, his words encouraged them to commit more of them.
Muslim Brotherhood ?  Expert Lorenzo Vidino testified before the Senate in Ottawa: ''To start, there is no group calling itself the “Muslim Brotherhood” in North America. Instead, a few hundred sophisticated, politically savvy and well-funded supporters in Canada have over the past 50 years created vocal and visible organizations that represent a very small part of the Muslim community. They exert a disproportional influence over mosques, schools and spaces where Muslims come together, said Vidino.  While they don’t take orders from any Arab capital, they “are part of an informal network where you have strong links based on personal and financial connections, and at the end of the day what matters the most: ideology. They all embrace a certain world view.”  Groups sometimes go to great lengths to sever or hide such ties, Vidino told the committee. He said they include the Muslim Association of Canada and what used to be called CAIR-CAN, now the National Council of Canadian Muslims.''
"to demonstrate that our Christian heritage is so ingrained into our culture that we don't even notice it anymore. But it's intellectually dishonest to ignore how our society evolved to accommodate Christian worship. "  That is a strange claim. It is Progressives who refuse to accept this is a society based on 2000 years of Christianity, or consider it a shameful thing that it is. Of course it is, what else would it be based on, and what  is wrong with that?  I may not be religious, but I acknowledge that I inherited a culture shaped mostly by those 2000 years of Judeo-Christianity, as well as Greek and Roman  influences. We are not a society shaped by Islam or Buddhist or Shintoism or Confucianism. That is my cultural heritage, and that of my country, and anyone choosing to come here and join this society should be aware of that and ready to accept that reality, too.
My post says specifically  radical islam only because, indeed, I wanted to distinguish radical islam from muslims in general.  As I mentioned elsewhere, many moderate or non practising "small l" liberal muslims feel let down by liberals in the west who defend radical islam, since this is exactly what moderate muslims were looking to escape.
Read your rant. Fighting for Muslim. Read my post YPG is fighting for Muslims. What don't you get? Get your ears drained.
As I noted on another thread, Saudi and the Gulf States are in the business of exporting Islam, not importing it.  Ergo, the multitude of Saudi sponsored mosques all over Europe, even on Gibraltar.
Read them all, the word "threat" doesn't even appear in any of the articles.  All it states was anti-Muslim rhetoric, no mention of specific threats.  BTW, you do of course realize that one can not be racist against a religion, right?
Trudeau supports White Gay supremacy - there is not much Diversity in Pride Parades they are mostly a Caucasian event small minority of Muslims, Blacks, Asians ... just look around at your next Pride Parade
Canada has allowed religion into those  specific schools of which the Catholic school systems is composed. The public school system is supposed to not have a religious component- which is why parents have their children enrolled there. If Muslims wish to have  their own schools, through which their religion can be accommodated through any means they wish, then feel free.
Predictably, GBR uses this tragic event to get out his Breitbarf talking points. Strange how you were sooooo quiet during all your skin head soldiers heinous acts emboldened by the DC dog whistle calls we have endured since November.  Oh...And I suppose you are going to say those were liberal skin heads that attacked Muslim and Jewish places of worship.  Heck, even your president FINALLY had a united tone today. Wouldn't expect the same from you.  Too busy adding to your hate agenda.
The accompanying photo tells a story: Muslim appearing men sitting in the front row, with properly covered women seated a respectable distance behind.  Meanwhile, just a few meters from the Muslim men, a western looking female is uppity enough to occupy the same front row of seats, without even so much as a head scarf.
Yesterday, every random crime against a muslim was a hate crime.  Twenty four hours later random crimes are terrorism?
Are you okay with Catholic cemeteries, of which there are many? Are you okay with Jewish cemeteries...of which there are many? Is it just Muslim cemeteries you're opposed to? Why? Are you even afraid of DEAD Muslims en masse?
I'm reading the Quran, and no where have I read that we have to be buried in a Muslim cemetery, or any of that nonsense.  Once we die, we are supposed to be buried as soon as possible (usually the next day) in an unmarked grave.   Muslims are becoming a constant whining bunch.  They want to build a Mosque every where possible, with no regard for traffic and parking issues.   They refuse to assimilate yet they want to be accepted.  Now they are on it about Muslim Cemetary, tomorrow they will demand Halal food in every restaurant and eventually they will demand from the government Islamic schools funded by the public.   My advise for our Muslim community is leave your hijab, burqa, silly long beard, (none of which are mandatory in the Quran) at home and stop whining.  It's so easy, go back to where you all came from and see how much easier your lives are there.   I came here decades ago,and have never had a problem with prayers, burials, food, being accepted, racism, attire, or anything.
One of those Alt Right "fake news" sites, apparently upset at Trump's sudden pro Saudi/pro Muslim stance, says Melania is a muslim based on a personal interview with her a few years ago. Maybe Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud will make the same offer to Trump for Melania as he did to Kanye West for Kim Kardashian-- $10 Million for one night with her-- this was in mainstream media as well as Alt. Right media. Rumor (or fake news?) is that Trump will offer Prince Mohammed and the Saudi's a huge arms deal being pushed by US arms dealers which will provide the Saudi's with the latest in US weaponry, weapons technology, and aircraft. See what Republicans say about this since they fought a similar deal by Obama.
Uh, Islam has been part of the fabric of Europe since the the eighth century (google "Al-Andalus" or "Caliphate of Cordova"). In the intervening fourteen centuries, Islam has been, to varying degrees, part of European society and culture. In more recent history, Europe's colonial attitudes and policies from the late 1800s created the conditions and the opportunities for a resurgence of Islam in Europe, so no one should be surprised at current developments. That said, there are only 19M Muslims residing in the EU, a mere 3.8% of the total population (and 10M of them are immigrant Turks), hardly the tide that will lead to the "absorption of Europe into the Islamic caliphate"
Yes, it is the America the Republicans want. It's clear from both their words and their actions Be it violent riots to prevent liberal/black/Muslim/immigrant/women  speakers from speaking, mock executions and threats to kill President Obama, hateful rhetoric directed to his family or the right's constant demands for liberals to give up their Constitutional rights, the right is bound and determined to quash anything with which they disagree, in any manner they wish to us, such as blocking all of President Obamas legislation for 8 years, and blocking his Supreme Court nominee and colluding with America's enemies to steal its most important election.
Multiculturalism, large waves of immigration from Asia, new important influences of various religions, has produced a big change in Canada. Together with the global economy and sell off of hundreds of Canadian corporations to foreigners, endless wars and terrorism, new wave of refugees from war-torn countries, lack of affordable housing, hard economic times, stagnant wages... Huge changes these last 35 years, particularly since 9/11. Huge changes always have an inevitable push back from those who aren't benefiting from the changes. Surprising the push back has not happened years ago. In my opinion, Calgarians and Canadians in general have been very generous about accepting 10 million immigrants these last 40 years. We've been very generous about treating Muslims as equals. I was very surprised when Calgarians elected Nenshi seven years ago. They had become more cosmopolitan and generous than I knew. But there's an inevitable limit to tolerance and generosity.
Why do you mention Christian professors specifically if there are also muslims teaching these courses?  I would think that someone who has personally experienced having to live under radical islam would be equally or better placed to understand this.  Or are you just a racist?
Hilary's gloating about getting the rapist of a 12 year old girl "off", her bullying of that child, her staff pleading the 5th so many times, her stating that she couldn't remember -57 times when under oath regarding Benghazi, her "misplacing of $6Billion of State Dept.funds, her continual 30+ years long central position in so many serious controversies  ... what more does it take to see her as a completely self-serving, immoral manipulator of our already corrupt system?    Imperfect as he certainly is, Trump can do our country, our culture,& our people far less harm than continuation of the Obama/Clinton scabrous regime. In fact Trump's intent to reform IRS, reform immigration, eliminate terrorism by truly scrutinizing and restricting islamic advocacy, strengthening our military, building a border wall ... all could rescue us from the one-worldist spiral into which the U.S. is sinking.
It's more interesting that the PDN thought that this rant was worthy of being published, than the rant itself. E.S. must have off the grid during the last 12 months away from t.v., radio and the press. Must have missed the hate filled rants of the candidate, now President elect, nor his hate filled rallies, and the support of the American Nazi Party for him, along with the rest. Or his open mocking of disabled people, or  veterans like John McCain, the parents of a soldier KIA, etc. I'm sure there are people who voted for him because they believed he would stand up against abortion, or magically bring back all the lost jobs in America, that his party gladly helped move overseas. But then there were the openly racist supporters, that he helped fuel at every rally. "Could she possibly mean that Kristallnacht is imminent?" Yes. Already happening.  Muslims have already been attacked. Beaten. You only willing to stand up if its Jews that are being beaten? Not Muslims?
Funny how a Moslem driving a truck killing less than 28 people is a "illegal immigrant Terrorist", but a White, American Multi Millionaire who KILLED almost 50 people and gravely injured 500 more is seen as an emotionally disturbed, lone wolf that by now has almost been forgotten.
Attacks on Planned Parenthood, attacks on public schools. Gee, I wonder who could be behind this. Wake up people. There are religions a lot more dangerous to our freedoms than Islam out there.
The Republicans now control the Executive, Legislation and soon the Judicial branches of the national government.    It will be interesting to witness the results of the repeal of their Obamacare, repudiation of the NATO and NAFTA treaties, deportation of 11 million illegals and the ban on Muslims entering the country.  2017 will resemble 1968 in many ways, it will be a crack in time...
This seems a topic dear to you, but your argument is full of holes.  The Muslim religion has not declared war on the US.  It is unconstitutional to apply a religious test to immigrants, and Trump's ban is perilously close to that.  Yes, the president is allowed to exclude those who 'are a danger'.   His mistake is in banning entire countries (and excluding Christians in those countries), except those where he has businesses.  I'm confident the judges know the Constitution, and law, much better than you.
Do they also cancel classes to facilitate Christian prayers?  The answer is an unambiguous no, in every public school in the country.  But some Friday classes are cancelled to facilitate Islamic prayers.
It's part of Trudeau's love of Islam.  Communism's getting a little old, he knows there's a new wind blowing and he's getting on that ride.
Maybe Couillard's position is viewed as intolerence. But at the same time I would really like the Quebec (and Canadian) Muslims to take a stronger stand against terror attacks. They speak about it very quietly in my view and I think they need to play a much bigger role in avoiding any future attacks - as they often see/know who the extremists are in their circles. The worst part in all of this is that Muslim countries are very intolerent towards non-Muslims (female tourists MUST wear a veil, etc.). Just saying. Double standard maybe?
Let Christian  and Jewish students also have their own  prayer in school rooms, paid for by taxes gleaned from Muslim parents.  Muslims would be outraged they would be forced to pay for infidel religious rites in the publci school system.
No antoine111, Ultimate187 is probably right since, when Obama was president, a majority of states had already said they didn't want more Muslim refugees. Just because you don't like something doesn't make it an "Alternate fact" or "absolute nonsense".
U.S. Supreme Court on Ten Commandments monument.  Actually, I am glad the Supremes are staying out of it for now.  It would just get a huge backlash if they ruled in they only way it is possible to rule - that the monument has to be removed.  I don't want to fan the flames of religious/Christian rightists.  There are enough political issues to think about right now.    It will come back to haunt us, though, unless it is soon removed.  The monument was put up in 2011, long after it was clear the courts would not let that sort of thing stand.  Thought is was paid for by private donations, it was allowed to be placed on government land by government officials.   They tried to put some distance between government and religion by adding a marker:  "Any message hereon is of the donors and not the city of Bloomfield."  They gonna say "No" to the next "religious" group that wants to put up some marker of their faith?  How about Muslims, of Satanists, of Hindus?  Should be okay, shouldn't it?
Explain then why Saudi Arabia is not on Trumpy's list? They are one of THE primary stokers of "radical Islam" on Earth. And they get a pass.   Oh...they do business with POTUS & family in addition to buying billions in American made weaponry
[Except for, you know, the fact that other Muslim countries are imposing their own travel bans against other Muslim countries] Oh Lars.  Why am I not surprised that you would assume a lemming position like that?
You jewish las name and zionist background explains your anti-Muslim attack insulting the only democratically elected Muslim leader who is still in power, Erdogan, of course, following the failed coup which Israel, US, Germany and other Nato countries were behind. You are the same people who supported the coup in Egypt against another democratically elected president "Morsi" who is now behind bars while you installed, recognized, and supported the dictatorship installed in Egypt led by Al Sissi. Who do you think you are fooling with such bigoted and racist articles? When is Israel going to leave Palestine and give the land they stoke with the help of the Brits and the Americans back to the Palestinians is the bigger question and the only question that must be addressed and answered. It is time for you and liers like you to leave the Muslims alone and look at your own savage actions before you criticize anyone else in this world.
Yup, Arabs converted them to Islam in about 900 AD before that they were Buddhist and Hindus.
That doesn't change the sovereignty issue of illegal vs legal immigration.   Where are green card holder currently being turned away and Muslim specifically being banned?   Not a fan of the "extreme" vetting program --but that said, it's clearly within the Constitutional authority of the President to enforce a temporary travel ban of all people from failed nation-states regardless of the composition their religious demographics
In Islamic terms any male that has come to the age that puberty is reached shall be considered a man.
We have values but a "test" would, I believe be against our values.  From my own observation of friends and acquaintances immigrants do do come with some different ideas but most readily accept the values that we have in Canada. In many ways, they wish to become a part of the greater community.  There may be some slight differences, but differences seem to be be more a tendency to a more paternalistic society if they come from that kind of Society or a more Conservative  morals in general.    The differences are not outside the range that already exists between generations of Canadians that are seniors and millennials.  Minis and bikinis have been an issue for decades and what parent isn't concerned about their children and sex?   The problem with people who want a test is they don't want immigrants who are "different", in colour or religion even if the religious differences are more in name than in practice.  Extreme Christians can be more radical than  any Muslims that I know.
The Record and all associated local papers in the Metrolandmedia umbrella (notably the Cambridge Times) are shamelessly politcally correct and don't publish anything but cheer leading for Islam.  Kind of like the G&M now.
I taught ESL, I have had  a lot of contact with Muslims. All of the young women in my classes are married with children, all married to their first cousins. One woman brought in her baby for us to admire...lots of approval from the class. When I looked at the child's face and eyes, I knew something was genetically wrong with this child, The child's parents are first cousins.  What does this do to the gene pool of this culture? What does this to to the future of the country, to have countless children born with same blood parents. It affects the intellect.  We are seeing, almost daily, what is happening in Europe as a result of the huge migration of Muslims.  The Netherlands are trying to deal with this. Is Brexit because of this?. Is Trump because of this? Will we  be in the same position in the near future.
So, you're saying the majority believes Muslims?  That's one of the few factual postings you've made.
Given the costs and benefits to the US of entry by citizens of Muslim majority countries, Trump's ban doesn't seem that unreasonable.   Cue the morally superior outrage Canadians do so well...
Isnt it funny that comments are allowed for anything related to Trump but never a Muslim
Could you do me a favour and post one (1) of my comments that show my " refusal to consider that those voting against rezoning could be motivated by anything but bias"?  Or try to.  Sorry, you don't understand what hearsay is.  If the mayor gives evidence that he has heard voters expressing anti-muslim sentiments, that is admissible and probative on the issue of the existence of anti-muslim sentiment in the vote.  That's pretty basic evidence law.  That level of mistake kinda justifies dismissing whatever other 'legal' opinions you have.
Uh huh...keep defending the Islamic death-cult. One day it'll be your kids stabbed full of holes by a 39 year old "college student" looking for a better life.
The mere mention of the word "Islamophobia", now causes Alceste to report the word itself as being "uncivil".   Strange days the left brings to civil discourse.
I, and I am sure millions of others, knew Trump policies will draw blood. Big blood. But never in my imagination would I see:  Trump's first blood is in Canada  Canada did not experience religious-hate mass murders, not even after 9/11. Not even after many such mass murders in the U.S. But within 10 days of Trump in power we had one. A biggie. Done by a 'kid' whose mind already filled with religious hatred, kicked up a notch and did the most insane thing. Without Trump this would not happen. Religions insanity goes both ways in holy wars.  The current holy war on Muslims was started by America's Pivot to Middle Policy in 1990 after the USSR collapsed, thus allowed the U.S. to roam free in the area and do its plundering. After the Gulf War the U.S. stationed permanently 100,000 troops, 2 naval bases and 6 air bases complete with strategic bombers. Their purpose is clear.   Trump ordered continue of this war policy, starting with a blanket travel ban. He is getting ready to invade Iran.
You have to wonder how non-Muslim females, especially young girls, are being affected by all this. Who will march on their behalf?
Absent fathers have been blamed for lots of stuff, including homosexuality.  Meanwhile, the author concentrates on males rather than ethnic / Muslim males. A study on percentage of young ethnic men from Muslim families and their high school / college graduation rates would be useful, but may be politically incorrect, so we are wandering around without valid data.
Ottawa Poog,  In response to your questions: 1) they will probably, barring some compelling circumstances/evidence, be denied protection in Canada and be removed to their country of origin; 2) they will have to provide a compelling explanation for why they abandoned their claims in the U.S. (eg: a ban on Muslims); 3) they will have to justify their delay in claiming refugee protection which is a closely examined aspect in assessing credibility in refugee claims but often can be justified (eg: a visa that was valid so no fear of deportation); 4) You already asked this; and No, a principal claimant does not get to bring his or her family to Canada pending a refugee claim determination, though if they make it here they can join the principal claimant's refugee claim or make one independently if they have their own basis for a claim.
“But no, I do not want the extremists to be welcome here.” -- skyofblue ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Take off your rose-coloured glasses. There are plenty of home-grown extremists in Canada -- just read the comments in any on-line news website. Imagining that the Islamic hoards are at the gates eager to “scare you witless” is sheer paranoia.
Obomba is not Muslim.
It's not the Muslim people, many of whom are very good people, it's Islam and Christianity wherein lies the divide, springing from two different traditions based on two different creators, Christ of Love and peace and Muhammad of war and conquest. How do you mesh together these very different Religions. How would you choose Trista? Study what happens in most if not all Muslim majority nations and see what happens over time.
Of course wars of conquest and plunder, to obtain other people's riches, including slaves, were par for the course everywhere. The notion they are immoral is a recent western invention. BTW, those slaves used to be white, and the masters Muslims, at some point in history:  http://www.unz.com/pfrost/from-slavs-to-slaves/  The relation with racism is the other way around. When people become enslaved because they cannot defend themselves, the masters start to think of them as naturally made to be slaves.  But it is as a result of the French and American revolutions that the latter countries started to think of themselves as having a duty to spread democracy and human rights elsewhere, that is a fact. Of course that then got exploited and distorted, etc.., but to deny that many people genuinely believed they were doing good is going too far.
Good grief. Do music and art really 'violate the Muslim faith'?  Or, are new groups using Canada's multicultural accommodation policies to impose their will on Canadian society? I thought Kelly Leitch's idea of a 'test for Canadian values' was a stretch, but it is beginning to look like Canada must make it clear to immigrants that they are required to adapt to our society and methods, not vice-versa.  I really wonder how many Muslim parents are ready to withdraw their children from the relative peace and quiet of an art or music class to promote their fundamentalist view of their religion.  If a majority really feel this way, why bother moving to Canada -- unless there is some ulterior agenda afoot here. Stop being played for a complete fool, Canada. This is not a theocracy, and we don't need groups pushing their own agendas just because our politicians don't know how to promote Canadian traditions.  Enough of this nonsense.
Per POTUS Trump: "To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days. I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria. My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president I will find ways to help all those who are suffering."
It's interesting and somewhat puzzling that, in all this debate regarding Motion 103, there is little or no discussion of the genesis of the "phobia" that the Motion seeks to address.  Is there something intrinsic in Islam that might give rise to these reactions of fear, intolerance or hatred?  Or are those feelings entirely irrational fabrications without any basis?
- the global sexual and physical abuse of children by clergy, covered up. - women not to be ordained, proclaimed to be true for all time. - mandatory celibacy not to be spoken about at any clergy meetings. - homosexuals banned from seminaries. - priests must wear clericals at all times in public. - 25 years of the work and of ICEL ditched. - Individuals who were clearly not saints, proclaimed Saints for political reasons. - female altar servers banned, women not to be admitted to sanctuary. - Vatican II Council described as causing "rupture." - Extremely conservative clergymen from Anglican Church welcomed. - Discussions opened to welcome back Marcel Lefevre's crowd who had been previously been excommunicated. - Other Christian Churches labelled as "cults." - The Moslem faith insulted. - The Jewish Faith insulted. - Opus Dei given free reign. - Barrier contraception fought during AIDS pandemic. - Popes to dress like Dorothy from Wizard of Oz - Millions leave the church. JPII, Benny 🏆
I had the pleasure of working in the health field where diversity was just a given. I've got friends who, although full Canadian citizens, are Sikh, Hindu, Muslim (Sunni, Ismaili and Shiite), Jewish, and everything in between. None of them has ever tried to convert me or even get me interested in their beliefs, other than explain to me what the background was to some religious holiday when they seemed to be celebrating some event. Some Christians (and only a minority, but a vocal one), on the other hand, have hounded me about my religion (more accurately, my lack of religious beliefs) and some of them have hounded me so much that I finally had to tell them to stop pestering me. I'm just saying...
No, No, No! Bill and Hill and Barry and the wookie need to keep high profile positions in the Democrat party. Also promote the anti-semitic Nation of Islam leader, Keith Ellison-Mohammed as well. People's memories are short and we need to keep reminding them of how rotten the dems are.  Funny how Hillary's only legacy was the Republican revolution of 1994 making Congress Republican and Barry's legacy is making the rest of the country Republican.
Your statement point #1 will discount you from even acknowledging that I may be right about this regardless of how may "examples" I provide.  Let me guess "rapists" from Mexico, "moochers" from South Chicago, "elitists" from the big cities, and Muslim "terrorists" from everywhere. Got it. Thanks for proving my point.  You probably also saw nothing wrong with that "national pride" fellow barreling thru those "riotous" alt-left protesters last week in Charlotte.  You are part of the problem.
"Has been part of the fabric of Europe" is a pretty vague statement, and so true as far as it goes.  In fact, Europe fought off Muslim conquest for centuries, and parts of it were conquered and under Muslim rules for centuries.  That is why, for example, the southern part around the Mediterranean in particular still shows the influence of Islam in its architecture, music, some vocabulary, etc.  Also in the status of women. The Mediterranean "honor culture", with women being under much more social surveillance, gender segregation, married women and old women wearing all black and covering their hair, etc. show the influence of Islam, compared to their more freewheeling social role in the regions that were not under its influence.  That is what Islamic inlfuence does for women's status.
I see no reason for a separate Muslim cemetery anywhere in Canada. Existing cemeteries should be able to accommodate all reasonable religious needs. Theres no reason why cemeteries can't be as diverse as the population they provide for.  Municipalities are responsible for cemeteries and a have a duty to manage responsibly the lands within their boundary. Creating new cemeteries just to accommodate individual religions is not practical or reasonable.
I disagree. Britain was a lot more hostile to immigrants compared to Canada in the 1980s and 1990s. A lot of immigrants take discrimination in their stride (for the last two hundred years) but a few lash out against their home country.   In france, you had to acknowledge that the only ancestry you had was French. If you were Polish or Arab, you had to give up that part of your lineage. It becomes more complicated when you look different.  Islam held through colonial occupation and Catholic evangelization for a couple of hundred years in Algeria, Tunisia, Mali, Mauritania, Syria, Lebanon, etc. It isn't going to disappear when Muslims move to France.  The French were more successful in converting the Vietnamese, Native Americans, etc.
" every western country which has been attacked by Muslims had previously attacked Muslims."  Nobody attacked "Muslims" because they were Muslims, anymore than anybody is being hostile to Russia because its people are Russian Orthodox, or to North Korea because its people are Buddhists.  In fact in most cases "the west" attacked SOME countries which are majority Muslim, in support of some other Muslims. Are some more Muslim, and others not "real" Muslims? That is what some Muslims argue, which is why they are fighting each other.  The fact they interpret everything in terms of their religion is precisely the issue with "radicalisation".
An even better narrative would be: "Canadian sniper saves Muslim lives".
Muslims do speak up all over the world against terrorism.  The media doesn't report it enough.
Class act ??? Kidding right Pro abortion  Pro partial birth abortion Pro debt Pro sympathy to Muslim        Terrorist  Anti Christian  Anti catholic  Anti little sisters of the           Poor  Anti tradition marriage  Get a clue Go to confession
Great. Tremendous relief. I didn't have to wait until the afternoon for the G&M daily front-page story about muslims. Thanks G&M!!!!
As for rapists and other criminals, that is what controlled, legal immigration procedures are meant to do, screen them out, porous borders do not allow that. Trump was pointing out the obvious, that "it isn't the best of Mexicans" that come through that border, unlike legal immigration. But that is a side issue anyway, to the economic one.  Your "history" of rape laws is greatly oversimplified. Rape historically pretty much everywhere used to be considered an offence against the "owner" of the woman, not the woman herself.  It is still that way in Muslim and other countries.   Trump used the issue others had brought up, to get attention for his political ambitions, and the birth issue provided a good way for opponents to attack Obama, just as the reverse would have happened had the Republican candidate been vulnerable. In fact, it did, with Tim Cruz:  http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/natural-born-issue-ted-cruz-not-settled-not-going-away-n499226
Lets see... a phobia is defined as as an irrational fear of something, from what I have seen and heard and learning more about Islam, my fear is definitely not irrational. What is irrational is why our spineless leaders do  not see what is happening in Europe and try to prevent it here. Islam and true Canadian values are fundamentally incompatible and we are welcoming with open arms the beginning of the end my Country under the misguided ideals of political correctness. Wake up Canada!
I am always amazed that a female Muslim lawyer would talk about freedom while wearing a symbol of female oppression, no better than a Confederate flag in terms of highlighting oppression, on her head.  As far as I am concerned it is one's choice to wear a hijab, or to fly the "Stars and Bars" as a matter of free expression and individual liberty.    Just don't expect me to like it.
For your comment to be correct, several conditions need to be met. Making abortion illegal does not decrease the number of abortions. I am sure that as a percent of the population, abortion was higher in Victorian times than today. It is a huge leap of logic to make a voter supporting planned parenthood responsible for abortions- a decision made according individual consciousness. Only in Muslim fundamentalist states laws are dictated by religion and you can see the mess it is. A Catholic can and must separate his civid duty from his persoanal belief- real life situation and trade-offs are complex and require different skills. But most important is that the priest abused his power, in fact he is guilty of emotional abuse and  of misleading a devoted woman- he has no attribution to judge. Only God can. So let me repeat clearly and loud, his behavior is shamefull, and probably sinful.
Allan, you could go on forever, but just for you I'll give you an example of intolerance   https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/10/opinion/nicholas-kristof-religious-freedom-in-peril.html?ref=opinion&_r=0  If you'd like some more examples of Islamic intolerance  just ask.
voluntear - so you're saying their intolerance is acceptable grounds for your own?  Have you never been discriminated against by any other group? Have you never met a Muslim who treated you fairly? Considering that there are a milllon Muslims in Canada, are the few Muslims who you say have discriminated against you really a representative sample?
a muslim calling out canada for misogyny. thats rich. who are "whites" anyway? do they include the halfbreeds running the mmiw, jews, "white" syrians? a vacation to india, any muslim country, or africa usually shuts these snowflakes up pretty quickly. i think these mulsim women are projecting their own oppression.
The line is drawn between her and us.  A hijab, burka and niqab are all proclamations that the woman wearing them is  FIRST a Muslim.  It is a statement she is only submissive to Allah .  She is a loyal citizen of a country , British, French,  Canadian, or American only by her own discretion and will not obey any law that crosses Islam in any way.  She will be peaceable, polite, and drive safely only as far as Islam will permit her. It also means she will not betray other Muslims who break human secular  laws for Allah.  But she will  lecture us that we are wrong.
Muslims from Saudi Arabia is okay with Trump.  He will have a good back door deal for his company by the time he leaves there.
The Muslim community will not stop at prayer in public schools. And some of these prayers are absolutely toxic as we should all know by now.     There will be continuous pressure for more accommodation of Islamic principles that most Canadians find unacceptible particularly as it relates to girls, or any discussion which contravenes their books. Canada is not Iran or Saudi Arabia and yet you will find many who will support initiatives to move our schools in this direction. This will happen.   Best to draw the line now. Public schools are not Madrassas. Stick to it and stop this appeasement and mind-numbing political correctness for everyone's sake. Especially for these children who deserve a place of freedom from religion in our public schools.
Forgot to add, that its not a Ban, its a temporary hold so our immigration can come up with a process to improve our open door policy. I saw no where the mention of muslims only in your article. Is the AG excited about potentially getting on national news?
At first reading I thought finally something sane. Not hysteria.  On second reading I caught my own errors.  "Telling Iraqis that we want you to fight ISIS for us but we don't want you in our country is insanity."------- It's for 90 days to get better vetting process in place.   "The anti-Muslim attitude of the Trump regime"----- The countries weren't picked because that's where Muslims are. It's where the terrorists and the ones spreading their goals are. Do you think you could find 5 Canadians in your entire country who would sympathize with the complaint that certain minority neighborhoods have too many arrests, therefore they are subject to some sort of racial bias?   "By far the biggest terrorist threat in the U.S. has been and will continue to be self-radicalized Americans. "  That's not a major insight but you just don't wake up one day "self-radicalized ". You can become 'radicalized' in your parents basement on the Internet.   You created your own facts and then argued them.
First off there are more than ISIS (Islamic State Iraq and Syria).  As those "Islamic Democracy Movements" aka "Arab Spring" Fully Supported (including U.S. Aid Money and U.S. Assistance Money)  by President Obama that later became Islamic State Tunisia, Islamic State Egypt, Islamic State Sinai, Islamic State Libya.  Second, President Obama Supported the 30  Million Kurdistanis aka Kurds of Ansar Al Islam, that are the Allies of the Muslim Nation of Iran, as the Non Syrian Citizen "Syrian Rebels", this included actual U.S. Military Involvements, U.S. Aid Money, U.S. Assistance Money, even U.S. Weapons, Military Equipment, U.S. Army Special Forces since December 2011 as the Obama attempt of "Regime Change" as the Overthrow of U.S. Ally President Assad of Syria a U.S. Ally since 1990.  After this Obama Failure, most of the Kurdistanis fled Syria as "Refugees" to the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, England, Italy, Spain, and other Nations.  2001 we fought against Ansar Al Islam aka Kurds.
Are you so naïve that you think the Muslims in this country really care what we think?  They just up their birth rate and bide their time.
Gawd!  Now it appears, at least according to this author, that he's caused a major, global humanitarian crisis.  Of course, if Muslims would just state unequivocally that the Prophet was flat out wrong in his teachings about what to do to infidels, this might not have arisen as a problem in the first place.  Just a thought.
By all means they should allow muslims to pray in school after all....  If they do not pray ( 5 times/day) they are subject to 15 punishment from you know who. 6 punishment in this life time 3 punishment while they are dying 3 punishments in the grave 3 punishments when they rise on judgment day.  If by chance these young students were to leave the ideology the punishment is death ( after a 3 day waiting period of course )  If any of the above happened the school board would be held responsible.
No, before Wade Page murdered 6 and wounded 4 Sikhs, he was peacefully living as a skinhead white supremacist who told a friend there was going to be "impending racial holy war"  Dylan Roof sat through bible study before murdering 9 of the black people in that church because of his own racist hatred - to start a race war. Substitute "jihad" for "race war" and it doesn't change the act.  Those murderers aren't better because they didn't yell a vague religious slogan.  McVeigh killed over 160 people for working in a building because he had a grudge against "the government".  A couple where I was working at the time lost an infant in the rubble there.  He didn't yell anything religious. Does that improve things?  No. Mass murderers have gotten addled somehow, gotten weapons, and then grab for a justification. Don't blame what an addled person blames for their behavior. You trying to blame "Islam" is the same as trying to blame "White".
Trump did not ban "all Muslims" from entering this country. It was limited to seven countries either very unstable or known havens for Isis/Taliban terrorists.  Outside of those countries Muslim were treated the same as non-Muslims. The reporter should have known this. I am not a Trump supporter, I just wish the media would keep to the facts when reporting about him or his adminstration.
he obviously has not chatted with many Middle east people, Muslims, Arabs, ISIS members..they have a piss poor opinion about Canada as a rich country attacking them, as a puppy dog of the US coalition
Using the Islamophobia word is a cop out and only intended to shut down constructive conversation. What about Jewishophobia and Hinduophbia and so on?
Islam is not a race. It is a religion. One can choose one's religion, while one's race is inherited and immutable.
If you read the history of the spread of Islam across a good part of the world you would feel unsettled about Islam. Is that a bad thing??
They already have, and they already do.  March 6th, 1996: CBS Evening News showed a bunch of old geezers like me in Tehran reciting the following litany: "Allahumma saali alaa Muhammadan wa alaa Ah'lii Muhammad."  That's called Salawa'at, and is part of every Muslim's daily prayers, whether Shi'a or Sunni--the Muslim equivalent of 'In Jesus' name I pray'.  It means, "Oh my God, bless Muhammad and the Pure Family of Muhammad."  What the lying CBS announcer CLAIMED they were reciting was praise of Hamas and death-curses against the US and 'Israel!'  Even blanked out the first syllable of Muhammad's name in the audio feed to make it sound like 'Hamas'.  I confronted Jeff Fager, CBS Executive News Executive Producer.  Although he admitted the mistranslation (claimed it was an 'accident'--of course it wasn't), he refused to retract it.  The pro-Zionist ideologues who control most American propaganda organs like CBS have been attacking us a LOT longer than they've been attacking Christians.
Islamic terrorism has already had a massive impact on air travel. We keep forgetting that because of Islamic terrorism, you must remove  your shoes, belts,  watches and  wallets and put them in trays for Xray examination at the departure entrance, then you have to go through an  Xray scan, get a pat down, and  go through multiple layers of security checks. It is why you are not allowed to carry shampoos, conditioners, bottled water, and other bottled liquids in your carry on bags.   Why do people keep thinking Islamic terrorism doesn’t exist or at least hasn’t already effected them?  The lap top ban is just another thing to deal with. It is won't be the last.
People are, rightly, fearful of Islam. The faith is locked in a violent, global internal war that has led to the deaths of millions. Many have been brutally killed and maimed in Western nations as a result of Islamic terrorism. To single out Islam for special protections makes no sense when the law already clearly bans religious discrimination.
I must have missed something, was that a joke?   You honestly didn't see or hear any of the comments, all the way back to the Iowa primary, questioning his birthplace, his patriotism, his allegiance to a black church, then his supposed allegiance to Muslim church's.  I not saying the President is faultless, I could question his leadership skills.    But that man has tolerated death threats, media condemnation, talk shows on radio, internet from parents basement called 'news'  - all with almost social restraint.     It's no worse the Johnson or Nixon, but neither of those 'strong' guys managed to complete a second term either.    Honestly if he had liked 'the fight' more, he would have come out swinging early, not waiting for his last 2 years.   Again, I hope you were making a joke - all Obama's fault, that's a knee slapper.
You're deflecting. The fact is, Trump wanted a Muslim ban that could pass muster. That is why he called it a "Muslim ban."  That Giuliani pivoted from a religious test (unconstitutional) to a "safety" criteria is neither here nor there.  Trump made his intention clear.  By the way, the Trump ban is NOT "just like" Obama's. This conservative talking point is sheer cr@p.  http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/30/sorry-mr-president-the-obama-administration-did-nothing-similar-to-your-immigration-ban/
This comment appears to suggest that the Premier is referring to some Muslims with a theocractic view of the Religion, and the the terrorists hold an empire building, violent version of a theocracy.  Snipets of the book by Harris and Nawaz are available at Google Books: https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&id=9mZSrgEACAAJ&q=theocracy#v=onepage&q=percent&f=false  The term Islamist is too close to Islamic. Essentially the book explains that a minority of Muslims have a theocratic view of Islam. And a much smaller segment support a violent empire building theocracy.
Our Republican Sec. of Housing and urban Development believes someone can't be a Muslim and serve in the U.S. Government.  He's supported by at least one (GOP) member of the House, who's publicly stated that "a sincerely devout Muslim...cannot seriously give an oath to support the Constitution."  A current (GOP) member of Congress argued that Muslim representatives should be required to swear oaths of office on a Bible and banned from using a Qur'an.  We also have a Republican President that believes religion is a viable basis for discriminating between refugees being admitted into the country.   Compare that with asking someone who has advocated that judges should refrain from issuing rulings that conflict with their personal values how that philosophy would affect their role as a judge and tell me again which party as a First Amendment problem.
This is an amazing story.  It is somewhat understandable because of Islamists and Islamic terror organizations. But these are not doing very well in terms of their own goals (more or less conquer the entire world).  But they have managed to recruit surprisingly well using social media.  Note, however, two things.  First, the call by Islamic State that EVERY Moslem in the world drop everything and move to its territory to fight has been ignored by vastly more than 99% of the world's Moslems.  Second, that more than a few of those who have so volunteered were not born and raised Moslems in any country.  If you become informed, you will learn that what most Moslems term 'terrorists' or 'extremists' are very much feared inside their community.  Because they have more knowledge of what being ruled, intimidated, or harassed by them means than most others do.  It is unwise, indeed very counter productive, to equate being Moslem with being an Islamist. Most who fight them are in fact Moslems.
The  erroneous focus on Islam as a breeding ground for terrorists misses the point:  The point is, what will an ever increasing population of Canadian Muslims mean to the freedoms, liberties and democratic institutions in Canada?  It is interesting that this convert was not pressed about something as simple as freedom of expression, or more pointedly, the freedom to criticize or even ridicule his religion. What would something as simple as the publishing of a cartoon critical of Islam mean to this man?  What about depictions of Mohammed in media, film or books?  An what if one of his kids decides to leave Islam, what does this man say about the penalties for apostasy? Would he accept that child's choice as his father did?  People who focus on the terrorism-Islam connection are not only wrong, they miss the far more important point: Islam is not a religion of tolerance, it is a religion of submission.  It is not compatible with liberal western democracy and liberties. And never will be.
"I can't think of a single country where Muslims wiped out the entire local religion."  And I can't think of a single country where Christians "wiped out the entire local religion", except for Spain in a specific period of history.  In both cases there were periods and places where both imposed their religion on MOST of the people, either by force or persuasion, and people who could moved away rather than convert, but there were always holdouts.   When people base their identity on a religion, that is what political struggles will be based on.
One Muslim will never criticism another. They will blame the Crusades, George Bush, Trump,  Jews, but they will never say  there is something wrong with their religion.  You will  be blamed for Islamophobia before they admit 9/11 was done by Muslims for Islam.
Stand by for Muslim Ban Cluster #2
Confused.  Are you saying this story is untrue.  You know media, they cover car accidents, but not how many make it home safe.  You bash mainstream media Motley but on this issue they are telling the whole truth?   I don't deny the threat of deadly threat of extremist Islamic terrorist.
Its not often, very rare in my view does Ms. Wente not appear to-be spot on., but with this missive she is going against the majority view. Muslim prayer`s in Public Schools with special rooms is only the thin edge of the wedge, next Sharia Law.
You are accusing us of bigotry and religious hatred because we think women shouldn't be subjected to rules that exclude them from society? Muslim men are allowed to wear western clothing but the women aren't.
"Yup, in your obsession with Muslims you’ve proved some of their ancient texts are as hostile to gays". As Orlando has shown us there's nothing "ancient" about it.
Ironically, the comments bashing the writer of this article are split between those who defended the vote on the basis it had nothing to do with muslims, and those who defended it because of course it was about muslims.  A.  "Our media and politicians are falling all over themselves to make this issue an "anti Muslim" one. What utter nonsense." and... B. " Since the public has no control over immigration policies which are rapidly changing many of their countries, the public sometimes turns out to vote down things like Muslim cemeteries."
Radicalization is taught at home, around the dinner table, as the family enjoys mom's good home cooking, while the grown ups discuss destroying Israel, eradicating homosexuals and the evils of dirty infidels It is drilled into young minds with every tale of glorious martyrdom for Allah in every mosque in every city around the world. Extremism for Islam is taught the same way Christians are taught about Jesus and his message of mercy and forgiveness. It is not at odds with the teachings, but is central to the religion
God help our country.  He has demonized Blacks.  He has demonized Hispanics.  He has demonized Muslims.  He has reduced women to "this year's model" and toys of the wealthy white male.  His expressed beliefs have shifted with the sand.  God help us.
"A balance must be found between protection of free speech and protection from bigotry and hatred"  M103 is an assault on free speech and thought. We already have laws for the other bits.   IMO the Isamophobia "problem" if you want to call it that is a strictly due to the fact that most Muslims immigrate from countries where Islam is not just a religion. It is also the basis to varying degrees for legal and political systems.  The fundamentalist features of Islam;  Sharia Law, lack of rights for gays, women and hatred of infidels (often other Muslims) are obviously incompatible with modern secular societies like ours.   The valid question that many are asking is:  Are Muslim immigrants escaping that situation or importing it?  Every attack just adds to that number.    Western governments paralyzed by identity politics have chosen to blame the "welcomers"  while failing to understand that it is actually up to Muslims to prove they are "joiners".  Islam must adapt to us.
I still believe and feel that there really is no difference between Catholicism and Protestantism since Vatican II and that's why many people left the Church over the past 5 decades. I remember the RCC before 1962: It had a STRONG identity and most Catholics believed it was "THE TRUE CHURCH." Not anymore. That's why people left. Why should I remain Catholic and follow all those rules when I can get to Heaven just as easily as my Protestant, Jewish, Muslim, or atheist neighbors who don't have to follow these rules. To leave is very logical, and that's why most did.
Sylvia, your comment reveals your own confirmation bias. Trump IS a liar, that has been validated again and again. His administration IS dysfunctional that has been validated (and Gen. Kelly is there to fix it) and there IS much evidence that he is a crook unless you choose to disbelieve all news reports, all leaks, all the statements from people who know him or did work for him that provide that evidence. You'll note that I haven't drawn a conclusion that he is a crook, only that there is evidence. Sure, I have confirmation bias, but you don't? So you accept nothing Trump says as true until it is validated, am I right? You didn't believe him when he said Muslims were celebrating 9/11, that the reports that his calls to Mexico and Australia went badly were "fake news", that Mexico would pay for the wall, that the Boy Scouts called him about his great speech, or that he didn't collude with Russia, etc., etc., right? You're waiting for validation before you take a position? Good for you.
Mr. Chin can try...again,but he will fail! It is within the executive powers of the president,if he feels a threat to the American people, & he will protect them.! What are we talking about here .What ? Seven countries? Braah! You know how many Muslim countries are EXCLUDED from this executive order? And for 120 days? C'mon Doug!  Time to Wise up! Mr.Chin 's effort is moot & nothing more than MORE grand standing and more of this nonsense Political Correctness. Because they LOST the election!  Constitutional Rights? Better read up on it, on what the president can and cannot do . Wonder who  Mr Chin Voted for? Was it Trump or was it........Hillary Clinton? IMUA!
Although I recognize the concern, I don't believe that segregated shelters are the best way to address it. In addition to potentially violating federal housing law, this sends a "men cannot be trusted" message that is troubling at best, and downright bigoted by any but the most gentle interpretation. Camps should teach residents to identify and deal with offenses, regardless of the genders or individuals involved, not pigeonhole people based on assumptions.   What's next, are they going to start turning away Muslims or people of color?
We can all embrace Islam and have no Halloween and then secretly mock and hate all other religions--sound good- I am going as a infidel this Halloween.
At least the women of Germany have bee spared to joy of Islam this year.
Tom Pain; If you think that the bigoted beliefs of Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam are any better than those of the crazy Bundy family, then you really have a twisted vision of our world.  Have you even ever heard Farrakhan speak?   You should sometime.  You will hear him say things like this:  “You see everybody always talk about Hitler exterminating six million Jews. That’s right. But don’t nobody ever ask what did they do to Hitler.”  "White people are potential humans – they haven’t evolved yet."  “The Jews don’t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that’s a good name. Hitler was a very great man.”  The Nation of Islam is a small fringe organization in the USA, with less than 40,000 members.  Yet, Ali was a member and fully endorsed their extremist beliefs.  The renown Southern Poverty Law Center has a detailed article about their well documented extremism and racism.  Take a look:  https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam
Gerson forgets that evangelical can also be caught up in the pursuit of recruits, to grow their ranks regardless of their theological roots.   I would offer the theology of prosperity as an example.     And if my friend Motley will jump in, I'm sure he too will mention that evangelical Muslims also fall into the basket of those seeking very worldly power, with little regard to, or a distortion of, the teaching of love, compassion and grace that some of us find in spiritual reflection.  This is not to damn all Christian evangelicals, but it doesn't let them off the hook either.   I like Rick Warren quite a lot and have read some of his books.   I dislike, with extreme prejudice the teaching of Kansas evangelical Fred Phelps and his hateful screed.  I will defend those of the Muslim faith who act in peace and compassion and I will fight any acceptance of a Muslim theology that allows murder and torture in the name of their saint.  Stereotyping is lazy, thoughtless and self serving.
"Canadian officials, who have spoken on the condition of anonymity, have said Ottawa has been reluctant to overtly blame Suu Kyi for the violence against Muslims in her country because it believes Myanmar's military is using it to undermine her celebrated global reputation."  What?? Is this genocide to be allowed to go on because Canada endorsed Kyi and respects the Myanmar military more than it cares about a million Muslims? Is the military of Myanmar the ruler of Myanmar? It's the entire government and its power players, especially the military that needs to be condemned by every nation in the world.
Islamists are doing this all over the world.
"Wow. I guess judges have now turned into mind readers."  Huh? You can't be serious. Trump has said he wants to ban Muslims dozens if not hundreds of times throughout his campaign and since being elected. Hardly takes a "mind reader" to understand what Trump's intent is here. It is discrimination based on religion. Period.
Muslims playing baseball? You're in the wrong section of the paper Snowbank
Black Lives Matter is an off-shoot of the American (radical-Islamic) Black Power movements of the 1960s-1970s.  But BLM-Toronto have been double-crossing even their own roots by driving forward the military-industrial complex owned by Christian Crusaders (who fund any political party, including the Clintons and Bernie Sanders).    The military-industrial complex is more powerful than the American government (analogically, just like the Toronto Waterfront Organization realty-industrial complex is more powerful than Canada's governments at every level).   They operate over-under any laws, whether internal or international, and cannot be indicted for atrocities the private soldiers and contractors have committed against the Muslim people.
ISIS militants base their views on Islam, it's not a secret and pretending otherwise only demonstrates an unapologetic ignorance. Islamist extremism is based on interpretations of Islam - most of the victims of Islamist extremism are other Muslims - every country in the world governed by Islamic law is highlighted by regression, violence, and misogyny - there is no free expression, no freedom of association, and no gender equality. Western societies represent advanced civilized liberal order. Countries governed Islamic law represent uncivilized 7th century chaos - just look at every country in the world governed by Islamic law in terms of gender equality and individual freedoms (death penalty for blasphemy and apostasy), it's not a secret.
What's the goal of ISIS in Europe or North America?  Is it to take us over and turn us into Muslim 'caliphates'?  No. That's just silly.  What is it, then?  Polarization.  ISIS attacks now, because they see a chance of polarizing countries like Germany and France into muslim-hating countries. ISIS wants far-right politicians to win.  The main goal of this is to turn the population of Muslim countries against the west, and into the arms of ISIS.  The best answer for us is twofold: 1. take a firm response to terror; 2. build strong ties to the overwhelmingly peaceful muslims already within our boundaries.  Fanatic anti-muslim right-wingers in Europe and North America play ISIS' game.
NPR was reporting "Active Shooter" early this morning.  Chompin' at the bit to work in an anti gun story.  All I could think was, bet OSU is a "gun-free zone".  Just more of the fake news from NPR we expect.     Of course ADN has the "sanitized" version. Here's some of what ADN selectively omitted:  ...was identified as 19 year old naturalized Somali Refugee Abdul Razak Ali Artan.  "The Lantern", Ohio State's campus newspaper, ran an interview with Artan on August 25 of this year, in which Artan criticized the school for not having Muslim prayer rooms on campus, and said "I'm a Muslim. It's not what the media portrays me to be."
Islam  means "submission". It is expected that  eventually  all people  and all things will submit to Allah.  The Peel school board is in the first stages of submitting to Allah because useful idiots  at the school board are willing to pervert 40 yeas of secular school policy to appease Muslim demands.    In due course, there will be demands girls and female staff  wear hi jabs and food in the cafeteria must be halal.  How does the school board  say no ?
You defended Burke's blatant homophobia, and you defended the bigots who harassed those people in the Church. And you defended Trump and his anti-Muslim bigotry.
Lorenzo Vidino also said about the NCCM and  the Muslim Brotherhood: ''The problem is more indirect, Vidino said. “Generally speaking, the movement has not abandoned violence as a tool to advance its agenda.” Tactically, it doesn’t pursue violence, “but it’s not heartfelt,” he said.  “They have this narrative where they lump together foreign policy issues with issues like cartoons and so on as part of a big narrative that proves this point that the West hates Muslims and Islam. It’s that mainstreaming of this narrative which is very much the staircase to violent radicalization and the brotherhood does mainstream that. It provides somewhat of a fertile environment.'' http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/beware-of-the-muslim-brotherhood-expert-warns
I and many others would argue that Afghanistan was a war caused by the Islamists (al qeada) harboured by the Taliban government of that country attacking the US and killing over 30000 US citizens.  As such, it was an attack on a NATO member and an article of the NATO charter (5?) says that an attack on one is an attack on all.   As well, the UN was involved in delegating to the NATO allies the responsbility for conducting this was against al qaeda and the Taliban.  Trump has gotten commitments from several NATO members to up their contributions to defence spending and much of this will go to their NATO contribution including to the Afghanistan war effort.
Terri, what is the ratio of Christian to Muslim in the mideast.  I think using simple figures without looking at all the facts has a certain quality of hogwash or false news in of itself.
None of these  groups listed here ("foreign terrorists, undocumented workers, and Islamic terrorists") are Americans.   Not one single one of them.  President Trump does represent Americans.
If the school board wants to create a safe environment, it should immediately close the door to hell it opened.   Recording any public speech  is neither an invasion of privacy, nor has ever been defined as a hate crime. To the contrary, it should be regarded as documenting a crime-in-progress.  Besides, the sponsor clearly talks about a very legal process, saying "if you get us the evidence...". The next sponsor might simply broadcast the evidence on YouTube along with very good labels; such as, names, location and time. Just an idea.   But the news for me was this: "Muslim students have observed Friday prayers in schools for about 20 years now." No detail provided. Is it some public session with many participants and speeches or are you talking about one or two guys privately praying in some tiny room?  If this sentence is intended to mislead the readers, shame on you G&M.
The father actively supports the Taliban and has made many statements about gays that supports what his son did and what many muslim nations do to gays. So you have no problem with an open supporter of terrorism and death and discrimination of gays as an obvious Hillary supporter? Interesting.
A Honda civic isn't going to push through even 6 inches of snow. It's just a tax for trudooooo to give more to isis movement. Aga kahn, an imam and part of the muslim terrorists. Thank God for Trump.
Considering that Muslims comprise 0.9% of the population in America, one third of them feeling for their safety (0.3%) is about the same number of any size population having the normal slate of fears and paranoia about any given situation, say for example, vaccination or Birth Control. Putting it another way, 2/3 of the respondents in the poll have a rational basis for ignoring the rhetoric coming from the White House and are confident in the Judicial processes in place to serve them as needed.
So, as I said, the important point is, as a fiction writer, you choose if your anti-environmental/profiteering/totalitarian villain will be an outer space mining company, or a dinosaur genetic engineer industrialist, or a radical Christian, or a radical Muslim.   And look, you are the second person on this board who has raised the ridiculous notion that oh, well, way back then, no one was concerned about Islamist threats. Hello? As I already said, Clancy's book came out around the same time as Atwood's, so clearly some were concerned. But even if they weren't, who cares? You even used the word "absurd" - are you KIDDING me? The Manchurian Candidate and Mars Attacks and Being There, they all managed to be hits at times when takeovers of Washington by simple-minded English gardeners, by green song-averse Martians and by Chinese puppet-masters was hardly high on peoples' lists of everyday worries!!!  There IS a double standard in the arts community - my thesis is nicely intact, thanks!
The positive mindset is admirable in the face of bigotry. Most Canadians do not have an issue with Muslims, however, political Islam (Islamism) is incompatible with Canadian values of secularism, gender equality, and freedom of expression (including satire and comedy). Every country in the world that is governed on the basis of religious law is fundamentally hostile to the Canadian values above (without exception - see OIC at United Nations for reference). Gender equality and freedom of sexual orientation are not a function of cultural relativism.
"Interesting" that you do Not list any of the Extremist Muslim shooters here in the US.  http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/attacks/american-attacks.aspx
Anti 'infidel' hate by Muslims has no place in MY Canada.
Curious that the travel ban doesn't include Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, the two most dangerous Muslim countries. Let's remember that Osama bin Laden was a Saudi, as were the 911 hijackers. Pakistan sheltered bin Laden and created, armed and financed the Taliban which has killed countless US soldiers. What kind of odd thinking is behind this ban?
IS might die but islam will keep marching
the members' website is interesting :   https://openparliament.ca/politicians/iqra-khalid/  Does tend to spend a lot of time promoting Islam, and its achievements.  If the focus of this bill is as you say, then all secularists should be VERY alarmed.  No religion should be above questioning.
Proportional representation is great for any fringe elements to get a platform and legitimacy to use as a springboard.  Muslim Brotherhood, for example, is going to love it.
Islamophobia is an allegedly irrational fear of losing life or liberty to Islamic rule merely because the laws, sacred texts, and traditional practices of Islam demand the submission of culture, politics, religion and all social expression.  It tends to afflict those most familiar with the religion while sparing the more gullible.
I don't have a problem with Friday prayer in school for Muslim students, but I think the school board should exercise some vigilance. Freedom of religion cannot come at the expense of another's right, like the right to be treated equally based on sex/gender/sexual orientation. Muslim students should have the freedom to pray in schools, but not at the expense of other (female) Muslim students freedom to do the same.   Where I see a real problem is Muslim parents pulling their kids from art and music education. These are absolute cornerstones of western civilization. This is extreme bronze-age thinking that will breed ignorance and extremism that isolates Muslim students from their non-Muslim peers. It's a dangerous precedent, and has the potential to create IS-infested ghettos, like Belgium.
Expect more of this in coming times.  Sunni Kaliphate and Jewish finance alliance terrorized Christian West for 13 centuries until the English found the silver bullet - create competing land claims by founding Israel.  Since then no war in Europe. Christians at peace.  Now the payback time. Sunnis and Jews will be targeted everywhere. What goes come around.
z55man: are you a knowledgeable commenter?  Trump's "stand" goes far beyond Illegal immigration.  He's stated that he is cutting back immigration--legal immigration--from 7 Muslim countries.   Next.
If those migrants entering Canada illegally from the U.S.A. were legally in the U.S.A., they really don't have much of a problem.   Trump's executive order was to stop people from some Muslim countries outside the U.S.A. from getting into the U.S.A. It wasn't about people already in the U.S.A. and it was a temporary block (ban) for only a few months (90 -120 days) and it was overturned in the U.S. courts.  If they're already safe in the U.S.A., why do they have to cross the Canada/US border illegally into Canada?
Oh well. Muslims doing what Muslims do.  Why do they hate each other so?
Does the Globe & Mail have some kind of hidden agenda here? Are you getting paid from some Muslim country?  I myself wouldn't feel comfortable walking the streets with half of the people wearing masks covering their faces let alone letting them use public services...  when does this stop...  If you let one group do it then everyone else has the right as well.   This is canada .. We don't hide our faces here...
Where were you when the women died in Canada? Where were you when millions of women were subjugated by Muslim men....  Phoney
and finally: "Most Muslims will not have the “opportunity” to become a martyr in this war between Islam and the rest of the world and make no mistake every true Muslim must be involved in making America (or the nation where he lives) a Muslim nation." (muslim fact) i would ask you if this were true, but then, we already know what to expect.
Traditionally, Jews and Muslims are buried in a plain shroud, but the law required a coffin, so there was a plain pine coffin. The male relatives carried it to the grave. The rabbi recited the (four-line) El Male Rachamim, the mourners recited the (fifteen line) Mourner's Kaddish, the coffin was lowered into the grave and everybody took turns forking some dirt onto it. Then the miniature bulldozer finished the job. There was some ceremonial rending of garments, but obviously not real garments, just ribbons provided for the purpose.  No promises, no fantasies, no feudal pageantry, no exploiting the occasion to frighten anybody into being obedient. Nothing left to be said. If there is a God, the rest is up to Him. If there is not a God, the Jews will continue to worship Him, because that's what being a Jew is about.  I was impressed. Much more dignified, I thought. Kind of sorry I have to have the other thing, but of course, at that point I won't really care anymore.
Muslims in Canada, USA, Germany, France even Israel have more rights than Muslims in the Middle East  so why these claims of "Islamophobia" of Muslims living in the West?
Sigh.  The definition of islamophobia includes "hostility or prejudice towards Muslims."  Yes, we know that the root "phobia" comes from the Greek for 'fear', but the English language is funny that way.
Why the raucous?   Israel does this to Palestinians day in and out, using our money and equipment.   So what if Muslim Saudis do it too? Why can a Muslim not do what a Jew can? Blaming the Saudis is patent Islamophobia.  Come on Fellow Canadians. $15 Billion is a lot of money, lot of jobs. The targets Shia and Palestinians be damned. They are poor anyway, and contribute zilch to our profit.. Moreover, they are expendable, a children of lesser god than our mighty Dollar. Profit, Profit, Profit.  As the wise guy said, "Stuff happens", "collateral damage".
I was Independent until Jay Hammond convinced me to join a party in 1969. The liberal Demos were not in tune with my concepts of American Constitutionalism. I became a Republican - I've always been Conservative.     But adherence to "the party" has crippled both sides.     In Alaska we've seen more criminals & what should be seen as criminal behavior in Reps than in Dems.  I've become a 'Republican in shame only.'    Supporting Donald Trump is difficult, but supporting his concepts & promises to return our country to the greatness for which we all wish - that's where it's at.    Let all us voters be moved by Policy, rather than personalities. We must see the threat of islam, the porous border, the adverse trade agreements, the nuclear treaty with Iran, military protection of other countries without contributions by them, disrespect for police & law, corruption in government at all levels, &a host of other ills & vote for Trump.   Let Judeo-Christian ethics & statesmanship guide us all.
Sher-  "feminism" is a continuum, not a yes-or-no issue, and your average conservative western male is more of a feminist than any Muslim. He takes it for granted that women will participate in public life, will go out on their own without needing the permission of a male relative, will get equal education, will have male friends and colleagues, etc. He does not deem them "immodest" for showing anything more than face and hands, let alone their face. That's so basic it isn't controversial. Conservatives say, "Do what you want, just be ready to deal with the consequences." Muslims say, "Society should be organized so women do not have the possibility of needing abortions in the first place, by making sure they can't even be tempted to have sex outside marriage.."  And for the millionth time, a face covering isn't a "head covering", it is meant to make women socially invisible and prevent social interaction. Amish women, etc.  interact socially with men outside their family.
Treating all Canadian Muslims as a monolith is a bad mistake. Perceiving members of a group as homogeneous in thought and culture is something that has been done before in Canadian history and with disastrous consequences.
There is a simpler, fundamental explanation for the Arabs' intransigence over a Jewish state in Palestine. It is a religious prohibition. A passage in the Qu'ran states that Muslims are forbidden to give up territory that has been made Muslim. Palestine was conquered early on by Arab Muslims and reclaimed from the Crusaders in the Middle Ages, so falls under this prohibition. For Abbas or anyone else to formally recognize a Jewish state in Palestine it would be a serious violation of their religion - apostasy. This they cannot do.   What they could do is quietly abandon hostilities against Israel without official admission of doing that or official recogniing of Israel as a Jewish state, as they have done with Spain, once largely a Moorish (Muslim) land, and more recently in Nagorno-Karabakh and neigboring territory reclaimed by the Armenians from Azerbaijan. If there is to be peace in Palestine, that is what it must look like.
And yet Obama deported more Mexicans then all the other Presidents in the 20th century combined. He has killed more Muslims then the Spanish Inquisition 2,500 by the Inquisition as opposed to 3,000 Muslims. And yet Trump (Wavemaker please note spelling) has done nothing yet.
From what I know Jumah is a prayer than modern day muslims can practice to replace the 35 weekly prayers  (5/day).  The condition is that is has to be done before the afternoon prayer (even if you don't do this last one).   I don't agree with school boards getting involved with this I am just explaining the narrative.
Ok you let wing democrat loons. Wipe the foam off your mouth and think for a minute, even if it hurts. We sold them 12 billion for a few F-15 fighters. Does anyone thing they will be used as terror attacks? So we win in a couple ways, more good paying jobs in the h US. Massive amount of taxes paid to local, state and federal governments. And one more thing, even if Qatar is sending money to  Muslim terrorism that is 12 billion that won't. ALso when we provide military equipment we have pull over the use in the future . Iran had a very hard time keeping their US Built  build F-4 and F-14 flying after the Islam revolution
Don't like much Obama has done but he's got this file right.  Muslims handling their own affairs, fighting with each other, with no American boys dying, just support.  I'm afraid Trump will change that and the Americans will become the common enemy of all sides once again.
This level of violence against Egypt's Copts is relatively new.  The Coptic Church and Islam go way back. If it wasn't for the Coptic patriarch Muqawqis, also known as Cyrus of Alexandria a contemporary and admirer of the Prophet, the Muslim conquest of North Africa and Andalusia might have been stymied at the Nile.  http://boreal.ca/Koran/Topkapi.htm
Just a few facts...  A total of 80 Americans were killed in terrorist attacks from 2004 to 2013, including perpetrators and excluding deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq, the majority of which are combat-related. Of those 80 Americans killed, 36 were killed in attacks that occurred in the United States.  Terrorism by Muslims makes up one-third of 1 percent of all murders in the US.  Meanwhile, deaths from other causes per year...  . Heart disease: 614,348 • Cancer: 591,699 • Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 147,101 • Accidents (unintentional injuries): 136,053 • Stroke (cerebrovascular diseases): 133,103 • Alzheimer's disease: 93,541 • Diabetes: 76,488 • Influenza and pneumonia: 55,227 • Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis: 48,146 • Intentional self-harm (suicide): 42,773  Maybe Trump would be better off tackling real problems.
No -  the west is saying no to islam
We don't care about the Peaceful followers of Islam, it is the unpeaceful ones we are trying to stop. And as far as the protesters, don't forget blocking traffic,which includes people going to work, one thing most of the protesters know little about. I don't think anybody here is interested in meeting with you Eric, other than your like-minded stooges - you tend to throw tantrums like Icon, you seem a bit unstable.
The expression, ‘Muslim backlash’, is neither uncivil nor a bad comment. Do not rate it as such. This is a free country still? Thank you and have a nice day.
Yea we need those muslim tourists
But the violent ones are now, once again the ones linked to liberal prgressive positions just like all the other times that the violent were there in your sup port with Nasty mouths and actions.  It's like all those peaceful followers of Islam you keep telling us about.  Where are they when the bombs go off?  Those who just watch your friends on TV don't separate them from you and your message.  Few of you deny that you agree with them; you are then tarred with their brush.  Saying that you "understand" their anger position etc. further links them to you
Where is the outrage, for torching a Muslim immigrants car?  The limo torched in DC Trump protests, belongs to a Muslim immigrant, & may cost $70,000 in damages.  The immigrant, who has a Nationwide Chauffeur Service, who was not a Trump supporter, said the anti-Trump march was counter productive.  Somehow the news media missed that bit of irony.
More 10 year old girls are raped in Thailand by German men, than German women being raped by a Muslim man.  But the MSM reports only one crime, and not the other.
Another apologetic article making excuses for another islamic terrorist attack!  The apologies and obfuscation have to end!  islam is the problem and islam must change!
Headlines on webpages:  "CHAOS, ANGER WORLDWIDE as Trump ban takes effect", reports the Globe and Mail.  "PANIC", exlaims the headline at Australia's main TV news website.  "Chaos at US borders" says the New Zealand counterpart.  "TRUMP'S TURMOIL" reports England's "Mirror".  "TRAVEL CHAOS" screams the CBC.  Meanwhile, over at RT News, the Russian News Website, we have this news item:  Headline: "Forty percent of refugees in Austria put religion above law... A new study from the Austrian Academy of Sciences shows that 40 percent of refugees in Austria believe religious commands take precedence over the nation’s laws, prompting the country’s foreign minister to push for a rigorous new integration package."  Wait, what?   Austria's going to push down hard against Muslim religious beliefs in the country in order to address a widespread Muslim religious resistance to accepting and abiding by the Western rule of law?   Wow!  Where do I read about that on the website of the CBC? The G&M?
Then you haven't been reading the comments. That type of comment is a constant leitmotif among a certain segment of commenters, and dismissing them as insignificant while claiming a few hotheads making hateful comments about Muslims are a major social problem is rather one-sided. Every year at Xmas and Easter you get the same kind of comment, and as a result of that kind of attitude most politicians and public officials have bent over backwards to play down any remaining religious associations.  Why is it "ironic or somewhat hypocritical "to talk about our society being secular when so much of it has a religious origin"? There is no contradiction. Of course our society and culture has religious origins, respecting those origins doesn't mean we aren't secular now. Just as our society has features based on paganism, others based on Roman or Greek origins, it doesn't mean we are either pagan, Greek or Roman now.   You don't need to tear down Notre Dame or the Blue Mosque to be secular.
Mr. Stacy, The baker refused ANY custom design for a cake. The discussion never got as far as that. The moment the baker heard the couple was gay, he offered them an off-the-shelf sheet cake or cupcakes. That is discrimination under Colorado law. I'm wondering if you would feel differently if he had refused to even consider designing a custom cake for a black couple or a Jewish couple, but offered them a sheet cake instead? And, "artistic freedom"? Would a topiary company be exercising artistic freedom if they refused to trim shrubs for a lesbian woman or couple? Would a home-products warehouse be exercising artistic freedom if they refused to give a gay couple their custom design shelving service? And, is this "artistic freedom" available to people who have objections to serving Muslim couples? Inter-racial couples? Or is this a gay exception only?
I suggest you read up on 'Muslim burials'...it's not about not having a 'Muslim Cemetary'...it has everything to do with their burial rituals. Honestly, you need to familiarize yourself with it, then you will understand WHY this accommodation should not be made!
I see from the comments here- that many people are blaming the Muslim religion (rather than Islamist) for this tragedy- even without definitive proof that the perpetrator was a radicalized Islamist. I had relatives killed by fellow Christians in Ireland during 'the Troubles". I vowed then that I would never condemn an entire religion for acts of thuggery. I despair of what will happen to our society if we blame 'the other" without proof of wrongdoing- or condemn millions for the actions of a few. Now I am off to our Toronto Christmas market. I am done with the G&M comment sections which seem to be a meeting place for bigotry and hatred.
sky  I hardly see Harper as a defender of feminism. What do you think his stand is on abortion? It was a coded anti-Muslim strategy. After all, he could have gone against all head covering for women, which would have included the Amish, Hutterites and so on.  And why stop only Mexican rapists? What about all rapists? After all, British, French, German and other rapists also enter the US. The idea of protecting one's womenfolk from rape is one of the oldest ways to get a native population riled up. It is one of the reasons that rape was a capital offence in the US. It was meant to be employed against black men who raped white women. It was never meant to be enforced in reversed circumstances.  Trump was the leader of the birther movement against Obama. Do you think that was a genuine question about Obama's birth (with an American mother, Obama was automatically a US citizen). Or do you think Obama's skin colour had something to do with it? After all, Trump's mother was not American
I grew up in Australia and spent many days swimming in the ocean. Whenever a great white shark was spotted a horn would sound and everyone would get out of the water as fast as they could, I can't recall anyone saying something idiotic like sharkophobia even though sharks kill far fewer people than Islamic terrorists(less than 1%). Fear of death is not a phobia but unfortunately Darwinian laws of natural selection do not extend into large urban areas where words like Islamophobia come from.
Well, there isn't anything now or on the horizon that would tell us things will be better than what it looks like today.  In fact, as this is all being sorted out, it does look worse than a first glimpse had us believe.  As pro-Trump supporters and voters will come to see, as their parents and their own social security is threatened and payments lessened, as access to health care is restricted and costs increase further, as the 1% get richer and morph into the top .5%, as racial discrimination and open backlash against persons who are LGBTQ or Muslim citizens or aged or black or Asian increases and is splashed across our evening news reports and social media, and as Washington become the retirement community for every conservative elected official in a second career of senator or congresspersons, then, maybe, they will begin - just begin - to wonder if somehow they may have made a mistake.....but never admit it.
Truth is the primary value that we all share in peace. All conflict is derived from lies.  All religion has two parts, belief and rules for social conduct.  Conflict with religion comes when belief is claimed as truth. If that were a principle, the existence of contradictory beliefs would render truth meaningless, leaving only conflict.  In the past, when Christianity was as extreme as Islam, there was far less immigration. I suspect that the fact that God in Christianity is the "spirit of truth" has had a significant influence on our disdain for conflict. People of all religions benefit from it but the west is far from conflict free.  I suspect the fact that the west has  invaded, colonized and undermined self rule in mostly Islamic nations for over 100 years has impeded conflict free evolution in those nations. Our armies are there among proud people who act as we might if the situation was reversed.
Quite sad this went through.  Turkey used to be a model of how a predominately Muslim country could be a secular liberal democracy and I had high hopes they would someday join the EU and act as a bridge between Europe and the Middle East.  Unfortunately it seems they are moving more towards a dictatorship.  At this point it is time to cancel their EU application and they can re-apply once they improve their human rights.  Ataturk who was the founder of modern Turkey must be rolling in his grave as this is exactly what he didn't want.
I love your qualifier "refugees".   Substitute "Muslim" and what are the results???
"I'm disgusted that so many in my family of faith played a key role in electing a bully who boasts about sexual assault,(I site hypocrisy considering the opponent)  defines all Muslims by the actions of an extreme few,"(Can you cite this? and the "few" cannot be ignored) called Pope Francis "disgraceful" (you're lying now, or by this criteria you just called us disgusting)and mocked a disabled reporter(remember Obama's Special Olympics joke?) A white nationalist is now the chief strategist to the president of the United States(another lie).  We've been called bigots, racists, homophobes, etc, anything to keep yourselves from considering other views, we know that we're not, so why should we believe you when you call ANYONE with a (R) by their name these things? Rather than learn, it seems you will simply tell yourself that you were right about us all along, and go on with the dehumanizing rhetoric that has incited the left-wing violence we're seeing in BLM, and election protests.
All that I can see in the bishop's words (below) is horrific distortion that can only provoke more fear and hate.    “We must disrupt those who would seek to send troops into our streets to deport the undocumented, to rip mothers and fathers from their families. We must disrupt those who portray refugees as enemies, rather than our brothers and sisters in terrible need. We must disrupt those who train us to see Muslim men and women and children as sources of fear rather than as children of God. We must disrupt those who seek to rob our medical care, especially from the poor. We must disrupt those who would take even food stamps and nutrition assistance from the mouths of children,” the bishop said.
The school bullying is particularly troubling, but we have it here in Canada too.  A Toronto school district only reluctantly provided separate prayer rooms for Muslim students. Terrible. Luckily the bullying is blunted somewhat because the same school district forbids the use of the term "Christmas Pageant" as that would be far too traumatizing.  And in Calgary, a private school is being sued by a Muslim parent over the school's unwillingness to provide separate prayer space and prayer time - very disturbing since of course the parents are paying for the privilege of sending their kids there and should obviously be able to force the private school to conform to whatever wishes they want.
No thanks. Malaysia and Indonesia are muslim countries, and are right on their doorstep. The sooner Trump pulls the plug on UN funding the better.
And what else would you expect in a western society whose culture developed based on 2000 years of Christianity?  Would you be shocked to learn that Middle East societies are steeped in a Muslim ethos and Islam is the assumed normal, or that East Asia is steeped in a Buddhist ethos, or India in a Hindu ethos, etc.? Of course their cultures reflect their history.  And just what is wrong with that?  But culture, while heavily influenced by religion, is not religion.
Which country is Hindustan? I don't find it in the UN's list. It is an ancient name - like the Roman EMpire. I doubt you will see the Roman Empire listed as a country in the UN.  As for the 1947 Partition riots, guess who was running the government? That's right - the British! They had instigated Hindus and Muslims to fight one another, so that the Indian independence movement was slowed down. The Muslim League was actively encouraged by the British to start riots (e.g., Direct Action Day in 1946).  And then separating two countries, which led to 15 million people to run away from their homes overnight, was handled in the most incompetent way. Leading to these horrific riots.  Now you see why Indians and Pakistanis are not too grateful to the Brits?
Islamic terrorists may be a small percentage of total Muslims,  however the Muslim religious/ideological doctrine (Koran and Hadiths) supports jihad by individual Muslims.  When Adolph Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, he provided a blueprint for future Nazi Party actions.  When the Muslim Brotherhood wrote their Strategic Goals in North America (1991) (entered as evidence in the Holy Land terror funding trial),  they were laying out their plan to achieve victory for Islam here.  Ignore it at your peril.
Can you please show where sharia law is enshrined in the Koran?
The left reflexively came to the defense of a religious freedom concept that really separates Church and State in the secular realm and does not give preference for one religious view point over another.  I am not personally interested in giving fundamental Christianity any rights over our constitutional system anymore than I would fundamentalist moslems or jews.
Here are some facts for you. The Muslim population of Canada is doubling approximately every 7-10 years. Their numbers were at 3.2% in the last census but by the next one, in 5 years, those numbers will likely be over 7%. Ten years later it will be 14%. By way of comparison Jews are well under 1% and natives are 4.2%. And the children of Muslim immigrants are not becoming more secular and 'Canadian' but more religious (see Pew Survey). The number of Muslim women in Canada choosing to identify with fundamentalist Islam and the culture of the Middle East by wearing Hijabs continues to rise, going from 42% to 53% over ten years. The number wearing Burquas is small but tripled. The Muslim religion is also a political ideology, governing every aspect of government, criminal and family law. It is extremely and violently hostile to Jews and gays, and regards women as, at best, second class citizens in the care of their father or husband.
Let's compare. Scandals during President Obama's term of eight years. Hmmm. None. Unless you go with conservative talk radio and he was a Muslim, a terrorist, a dictator ad nauseam. If he had been any of those things, the republicans in Congress would of sought immediate impeachment proceedings. Oh, that's right. The alt right said he had the Republican Congress in his pocket. Right.Now lets compare that to Trump's first 3 weeks. We have the birth of a new word, alternative truth. That should speak for itself. Flynn talking to a foreign government and making deals before Trump was sworn in. Kind of illegal. Trump still having ownership in a hotel on federal land where it says in the lease that you can't hold a public office and still retain ownership.Violates Ethics. Conway going on national tv and actually saying she is giving a free commercial to buy Ivanka"s line. A little illegal. But the sad part is nothing will happen. Ain't America great?
I find it interesting that the very people that are " explaining " the muslim crisis have NEVER put on a uniform and stood a line in a middle eastern country. I have, and have seen how they treat the very people that are subject to them. This is not a "reality show " of when bad things happen to good people, but rather it is when people with more will than the "talkers" in this country try to impose themselves on others. But no worries though, we can take away OUR defence and open OUR borders, and this will bring about the utopia some Americans are after....... for about a split second! We need to be politically correct after all.
Ms Khan attempts to legitimize the term Islamophobia by suggesting that what she calls the "closed view" of Islam is irrational, because some Muslims (such as those who have taken refuge in Western democracies) engage in debate about modernity and Islamic practice. Such discussions, though, surely have to take place within a framework that accepts Islamic scripture as the unquestionable teachings of a supreme, supernatural being.  To put it another way, Muslims all over the world are reading from the same playbook. Unfortunately, that book happens to contain some things that are very worrying to anyone holding hard-won liberal values. That hardly makes us phobic.
The list of mass murderers is unfortunately long and includes believers in a wide range of faiths.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_murder  Your attempt to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt about Muslims is un-American.  Please stop hating on Muslims.
So would you be in favor of Christaphoboa? You seem to cherry pick the Quaran. Are you in support of Imam Said Rageah? Or would that be having islamaphobia too?
Your claim that you don't care one way or the other is obviously false. You've made dozens of comments criticizing the Peel school board's approach, and that despite the fact that the school board is simply following the law. Moreover, on any topic having to do with Muslims in Canada you are right there, front and center. Except when six Muslims were executed in their Quebec mosque. On that matter you went silent.   I've looked at hundreds of the comments here. I haven't seen anyone accused of being an Islamophobic bigot. But clearly there are such individuals around, therefore it's a valid topic to speak of.
Well, wait a minute.  you've not provided any evidence of this "major increase in rapes", nor have you provided any causal link to it (if it is true) to immigration. It is often said that Sweden became the "rape capital of Europe" since immigrants from the middle East showed up.  You know -- brown Muslim guys.  However, Sweden changed the definitions of rape & sexual assault around the same time, shifting some acts that previously weren't called rapes into that category.  Therefore, Sweden's rape statistics shot up not because of immigrants, but because of changes in the law.  The woman who wrote the original "rape capital of Europe" article that sparked the outrage has well-known Neo-Nazi ties.   No one is trying to be "politically correct"; they are trying to set the record straight and prevent unjust accusations.  All of this can easily be verified; off to do your homework!
The article does not state the suspect was Muslim. Just a rejected asylum seeker. He could indeed be an Islamic extremist or someone who went violent to avoid deportation back to Uzbekistan. The motivation is still being investigated.
No, I'm stating that Anders Breivik, a Christian, was guilty of a terrorist attack in Norway that left 77 people dead. He did it in the name of his religion. And there was not an outpouring of apologizing from Christian Bishops, Pastors, etc.   It was a reply to the above letter from Mr. Walker. Was that not clear?  Now, as far as your statement "you weren't trying to hear" that goes for Mr. Walker as well. Go look at the Amman Message, or the website muslimscondemn and you'll be able to find many, many people apologizing for the actions of extremist terrorists. Something Mr. Walker has failed to do.
“ But Canadians of all races and faiths are largely united in a desire to live in a country of peace, order, good government and equality before the law, and in wanting to ensure that Canada remains a place where people of many origins and beliefs can be neighbours without fearing one another.”  Well … nice thought, but maybe more rhetoric than reality. There is at least one religious tradition which does not seem to line up with Mr. Keller’s pollyannaish image of our polity. Check out the November 2011 report by the Macdonald- Laurier Institute “What Do Canadian Muslims Want”. The results of the research are not very comforting or consistent with Keller’s wishful claim.  The whole world knows that Canada has a heart. In question is  our brain, and our willingness to uphold our values and traditions, when it is necessary to do so.
John Kawamoto, the topic and premise of this forum is not about "campaign promises" but the New Travel Ban that is challenged. The New Travel Ban is not about "All Muslims".
Multiculturalism, large waves of immigration from Asia,  new important influences of various religions, has produced a big change in Canada. Together with the global economy and sell off of hundreds of Canadian corporations to foreigners, endless wars and jihadi terrorism, new wave of refugees from war-torn countries, lack of affordable housing, hard economic times, stagnant wages...    Huge changes these last 35 years, particularly since 9/11. Huge changes always have an inevitable push back from those who aren't  benefiting from the changes. Surprising the push back has not happened years ago.   In my opinion, Calgarians and Canadians in general have been very generous about accepting 10 million immigrants these last 40 years. We've been very generous about treating Muslims as equals. I was very surprised when Calgarians elected Nenshi seven years ago. They had become more cosmopolitan and generous than I knew.   But there's an inevitable limit to tolerance and generosity.
It was a rhetorical question underlining the point that Canada is arguably the most open, tolerant and non-racial society in the world and we should celebrate this but not allow political opportunists at either end of the spectrum to play racial politics.  This includes lefties like Nenshi who have an unfortunate penchant for crying racism every time someone disagrees with them about anything.  What is happening in Indonesia is tragic.  The 4th largest country after the US, Indonesia is the largest Muslim majority country.  The rise of Islamist fundamentalism including terrorists has been frightening and destructive.  While the Muslim president of the country Joko Widodo is considered a moderate, Islamist intolerance threatens Christians in ever larger parts of the country.  Now, just 1 of 16 states is controlled by a Christian governor.  And you have accurately described the mob reaction to a Xian running for Jakarta mayor.  Nenshi could do with more humility and more perspective.
Muhammad Ali's son, also named Muhammad Ali, was returning to the US after going to Jamaica. He was travelling on a US passport, which gave his birthplace as Philadelphia. He was detained at the airport at Fort Lauderdale for a couple of hours because he was a Muslim. That is profiling.
Thanks to the Liberals and their M103, Canada is now vulnerable to further infiltration by Islamists.
This is a biased, sloppy, lazy piece that brings discredit to whatever is left of journalistic credit in the Globe. "It is feared many more are going unreported because Muslims are too scared to report the crimes or do not trust the authorities" There is nothing remotely connected to facts. By whom, precisely, is this "feared"? Where is the evidence.  “What I can say on this case is this individual, so far as we know at the moment, was not known to us, but we are aware of a rise in the far-right.” The evidence is that he was not known because he is not a far right terrorist. He is a "nutter" pushed over the edge by whatever demons reside in his skull.  In Britain, far-right terrorist suspects drove the increase, according to an unnamed security expert interviewed by The Telegraph newspaper. "An unnamed" source has the credibility of a parsnip.  "A quick Google search"-- This is what masquerades as journalism now.   For heaven's sake, stop insulting your readership Globe and Mail.
Middle East, North America and Islam did not exist when that Jesus thing happened (or not).
The vast majority of Muslims are not terrorists but support for terrorism and terrorist organizations in the Muslim community ranges from lows of 5% to highs of 75% in some countries.  Also just a reminder that Muslim men form about 1% of the American population and maybe 3% of the population in the European Union. They are committing like 90% of the mass casualty terror events.  White European Christian or secular men form almost 45% of the population in the EU.
"Osama Bin Laden Is Dead, General Motors Is Alive" - President Obama's Reelection Speech.  Worldwide the Imams announced that "Obama Declared War Against Muslims (Islam)".   Rallies Worldwide of the Over 1.8 Billion Muslims chanted "Obama, Obama, We Are All Osama".  President Obama's Supported "Islamic Democracy Movement" aka Muslim Brotherhood attacked the U.S. Consulate Alexandria and U.S. Embassy Cairo Egypt, Obama's Supported Shia of Iraq Government bombs blew up at the U.S. Embassy Baghdad, the U.S. Consulate Basra, Iraq, Afghan Taliban attacked the "Green Zone" Kabul, Pakistanis murdered two U.S. at the U.S. Consulate Pakistan, Obama's Non Libyan "Libyan Rebels" of Al Quada's Ansar Al Shariah attacked the U.S. Consulate and CIA Annex Benghazi Libya, Obama's Supported "Arab Spring""Islamic Democracy Movement Tunisia" overran the evacuated U.S. Embassy Tunisia.  CIA Director Panetta at a CIA SCIF not Obama did CIA Operation Neptune Spear using Bush's Executive Orders.
Khan was more concerned about fellow Muslims in London than for the people killed by his fellow Muslims.  He wept as was his duty, but later comments told us he was more concerned about Muslim safety than for Briton's. Bombing innocent English children was wrong, but arresting Muslims for it is worse.
no matter why this murder occurred it is a tragedy. It is hard to believe that these women were not attacked because they are 'different'. Attacks like this are done by ignorant people usually young and uneducated who actually fear their victim (the victims background). Racism is alive and well in the  USA and  Canada. Anyone that is 'different': Black, Asian Sikh, Muslim, brown skin, Latino, Natives, Jews etc etc are often subjected to it. Fortunately it is usually verbal or written and not physical. The death of this innocent young Muslim American is an atrocity.
The liberals Democrats, even in Hawaii have never answered the question:  When their hero liberal lefty Barack Hussien Obama did the same banned on muslim countries, why didn't Hawaii make a challenge?  President Donald Trump presented a water down executive order to his last "extreme vetting" on Muslim immigrants flowing through this country from location where Terrorist home countries and yet this Federal judge shot it down.  What is wrong in using "extreme vetting" to catch any ISIS or any other terrorist infiltrating in the good immigrants path?  Political correctness is winning over common sense will put Americans in danger in our own country.      Undoubtedly if we ever had (hopefully not!) a terrorist attack in the Hawaiian  islands, they will blame it on President Donald Trump.        Obama clones, Chin (AG) and Ige smiling in a photo after the Federal judge ruling.
I bet there's more loved ones killed by Americans Terrorist than Muslim Terrorist...I bet there's more loved ones killed by smoking and drugs than Muslim Terrorist...Is their pain less than the pain Terrorist will cause???...#MAGA
Prayer meetings should never be allowed in a public school in the first place. End of problem.  Has anyone taken a good look at the prayers or the books these come from? These are toxic and have no place in a school. Death to homosexuals, death or enslavement to infidels....come on. Not acceptable.   Allowing religion to encroach in our public spaces may be the norm in Muslim countries...but not here.  Its time for the Muslim community to adapt to how things are done in Canada and not the other way around.
These arguments about whether Islam is an extremist religion or not are moot: Canada has already chosen the path which will see a majority Muslim population within this century.  Enjoy your liberties while you can, and make your plans accordingly.  It is coming and it cannot be stopped.
A Merry Christmas message from the friendly Muslim Brotherhood to their Christian brothers. How nice... Looking forward to seeing our brave and righteous  PM visiting a Coptic church in show of solidarity..........
I am an agnostic.  Have been since college (50 years ago).  But religion has been my main interest since that time too, along with all the sciences.  ////  I'm pretty sure a God exists, but I would hesitate to define God.  What Christian, Jews, Muslims, etc., have done is create a God in their own image and likeness.  Because I think, with the Taoists, that "The God that can be spoken of is not God."  The best we can know about God is from a good (basic) book re physics.  As a Franciscan I knew in HS used to always say (and he was very old and quite wise):  "All I know about God is that he loves babies."  It took me a few years (of growing up) to realize that he was speaking about everything wants to replicate itself and live.  Even The Universe is expanding, stars are 'born' every day -- EVERYTHING wants to stay alive, grow, replicate,'continue'.
If we're going to be fair, "infidelaphobia" is an inherent component of Islam. How do you square that circle?
This really is a useless article there is no 'ban' on cemeteries people were given a vote and they don't want another one in their area and the local Muslims don't want to share one - why this comes down to race and hate is really irksome as in Muslim communities they don't want a Jewish one in their neighbourhood but that's OK apparently and the 36 people had a vote which politicians want to overrule in some way ? Imam says "what are they afraid of" - it's not fear of anything they just don't want ANOTHER cemetery with all the traffic etc it brings...
April Showers, a zoning decision based on anti-muslim reasons would violate the Constitution.
Quoting anti-Muslim websites to hold discourse on my faith makes no more sense than quoting from "Der Sturmer" or other anti-Semitic sources to discuss the Hebrew faith.  All it spotlights is your own dishonesty and the fact you're no more knowledgeable of these faiths than you are of your own.  Here's where what passes for your 'logic' breaks down:  If you want to learn about fish, you consult an ichthyologist--or a fisherman If you want to learn about flying, you consult a pilot or a flight instructor If you want to learn about plants you consult a horticulturist, botanist or farmer If you want to learn about Islam you consult...an evangelical anti-Muslim hate-site???  One of these things is not like the other.  One of these things just isn't the same...  PS: Either admit you lied about Bro. Gregory not accepting me as Muslim or provide a direct QUOTE from him saying so.  Your lie does NOT 'redound unto the Glory of God'--I don't CARE what the Impostor Paul says.  Khalas.
Elise, while I don't agree with everything Trump says, there are valid reasons to be concerned with enforcement of federal laws on immigration, including letting muslim terrorists into the country to kill Americans.  (The same muslims responsible for the 73 mass graves full of hundreds, if not thousands of men, women, and children found this week and torturing and raping Americans like Kayla Mueller)  Since you have claimed in the past to be concerned about assault and violence issues, could your next column be about Ms. Mueller, how brave she was to endure her captors, and support her Christian faith to the very end.  You could even suggest donations to the foundation her parents set up.  (Donations could possibly cover Obama's broken promise to her parents to make a contribution)  And how could Americans not be concerned with the war zones and thousands of dead African-Americans under democratic control for decades?  ADN won't report in detail or depth on either of these topics.
Several good points Shannyn, my perception of Kelly and Dunleavy's actions is that I perceive them to be a violation of the first amendment, keep the spiritual " beliefs " ( or delusional fantasies as the case may be ), out of government, maintain the separation. How many realize that King Solomon and his magic flying carpet are mentioned in the Quran. Does that legitimize the Muslim religion or does it seem ironic that Kelly and Dunleavy, are in fact, the tea party Taliban?, the King James version of a zealot. ALEC is behind the nationwide push to arm students on campus. That level of deception is still beyond the acumen of Kelly or Dunleavy, they just do what the Koch brothers tell them to do, not unlike that pretend " I'm Alaskan " Senator we have.  As I tell the missionaries in my own family, Jesus was a union carpenter who made a lot of good wine, hung out with the working girls and gave great advice. I cant stand it when people preach to me, I just try to live it.
The German authorities more concerned about Islamic sensitivities than murdered Germans. Thank goodness that kind of  thinking ends in the US on January 20th. Hopefully the rest of the West follows.
Look, I don't care much either way, but it is not a "ban on muslim cemeteries".    It is a group of people, in one area, not wanting it in their backyard.
Speaking as an Atheist, this article supports what I've believed for a long time ... that you can write negatively about Christians with impunity, but don't ever, EVER criticize Muslims, for to do so is bigoted and wrong.
Actually Islamic terror in Russia and other eastern countries is as pernicious as here, if not worse.. Russian police don't waste any  time worrying about being accused of Islamophobia. Russian police go into Muslim homes and mosques of suspected terrorists and discover war chests of weapons . They simply burn down any mosque or home in which weapons were hidden.  They do not care if they kill suspects in the process. But our media won't report it.
Ms. Khan is once more engaging in deflecting criticism of Islam by comparing white supremicist extremists to Islamic extremists.   Islamic terrorists use the Koran as the basis of their actions. White supremicists in contrast do not have an ancient holy book to justify their actions.  Kindness by all is a good thing. However, it will not stop violence that is rooted in religious traditions that are 1,300 years old.  It is time that all Muslims faced up to the fact that their religion is not one of peace insofar as the Koran promotes violence against its own people and those it calls infidels.  It is time for all muslims to acknowledge that their religion is no better than any other. Only then will kindness work its magic.
Thank you ADN for having the sand to tell the truth. Hillary Clinton is dangerous. The Saudi Crown prince is funding 20% of her campaign. The Saudis have one of the worst human rights records in the world. They practice Wahabi Islam, the most violent radical forms of Islam.
Wow!  Imagine that, a savage terrorist act in the Middle East targeting Western society.  I guess one take away is stay away from this part of the world otherwise be prepared to take on the consequences.  Too bad our country is importing so much of this into Canada.  We should all be getting very tired of reading about Islamic terrorism.
UN global population estimates are for 8-9 billion by 2050, 11-12 billion by 2100.  With most of that growth to occur in Africa, the Muslim world, and the Indian subcontinent.  Things are really looking up.
Okay, the shooting is bad, but so is this article.  It is filled with gossip.  Yup, that's what most of it is, just gossip.  The comments described are not directly pertinent to the man's potential role as the shooter.  Just hearsay gossip.  Note, despite the gossip how PC the reporting is.  No mention of whether the dude is Muslim.  Just another example of the extremely low quality of our media.
Religious profiling...maybe but not the purpose nor point. We aren't vetting Norwegians, nor Lutheran's, nor Canadian's or Presbyterian's. But what are Countries to do to keep their citizen's safe when there is an active Worldwide Jihad to kill the "infidel's", which includes us. The great majority of  Jihadists are known to be Radical Muslim's  and primarily Middle-Easterners. Most all countries have been tip toeing around the vetting  so as not to overly profile or look too closely at religion.  Values provide a cover for them and allow them easier access to targets, i.e, 9-11. They are an enemy to be feared because they use a countries values and turn them against them. If to survive you must stay free of them it's  impossible to not profile. To protect our values we must keep a look out and report if needed, so we "profile" silently. Only Muslims can eliminate them. If only Muslim Leaders were speaking LOUDLY to the WORLD how to help remove them but they are not!
I agree with Frank_96740.  You libs need to indoctrinate kids at a young age in order to support your leftist ideas.  As a teacher with such power over your students should remain neutral and unbiased. But that would be against your agenda.  You should be teaching facts not opinions.   Your, " I never made a statement...."  Makes no since whatsoever. That statement is suppose to justify everything else?  Your other statement about "Trump's muslim ban...."  Is biased and an untruth.  But of course the truth that 85% of muslims can still travel is just an inconvenience to you agenda. Or that over 40 countries with muslim majorities are not subject to this ban.  Now we are beginning to see why the United States is ranked 28th world wide in education.  You could tell your students that the election was an example of democracy in action and some may not like the results, but he is the President and we need to think what we can do to make this a great country. Letter  writing or protests OK.
Stop this pandering to demands for religious activities of any kind in the school system The reason the police is at the school is because we who believe in diversity for all and for religion to be a private, at home business are appalled that there is this kind of  leniency towards muslim demands.  Stop it today!
Chuck, the lack of individual freedoms in some Islamic countries is not an excuse for us to abandon our own or to set our bar lower. Secondly, if we do live in a liberal democracy and value personal freedoms then we must support a woman's right to make her own choices while giving her to opportunity to chose for herself. Anyone forcing her to dress a certain way is obviously wrong but forcing her to not dress as she sees fit is simply a different kind of oppression and just as ignorant of her personal right to choose. Your example of Iran is as irrelevant as your comment about other Islamic countries. We're talking about liberal democracies here, not Islamic theocracies. No one is claiming Islam is beyond reproach but making gross generalizations about Muslims is intellectually dishonest.  Oh and nice rant BTW. Doesn't do much to support your point though.
While Muslims excoriate us about supposed Islamophobia, we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, antisemitism,   Christophbia, Europhobia, Americanophobia, democraceaophobia,  iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other. Ancient hatreds and wars of extermination between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects are worse than anything expressed in the west, even by Trump
What bafflegab.  People should not be trusted to base their opinions on their perceptions, because those perceptions are wrong (so therefore their opinions are wrong) and "we" have the hard numbers to prove that they are wrong.  Maybe we should take away everyone's right to vote because they are too stupid to see things "our" way while we're at it.  The reason some people perceive that we are being "overrun" by Muslims is because many Muslims do very little to integrate into our Canadian society.  Many (although definitely not all) stick out like sore thumbs.  They don't dress like us.  Women wear veils and niqabs and in rare cases, burquas.  Many get satellite dishes so they can watch TV in Arabic.   If I gave you a thousand dollars for every Muslim at a Remembrance Day ceremony I'd probably not give away a dime.  Perhaps the Muslim community should focus more on integration into our society, and less on bafflegab saying our perceptions are wrong.
Was the problem just No to Muslim cemeteries  or was it a zoning issue?  Perhaps find another zone and there might be acceptance of a Muslim cemetery
Uh-oh, you weren't expecting an answer like that, were you.  Whoops.  That pesky fact still won't go away: Muslims don't drink. But don't worry- next round of 9 at Isa is on me.
Morocco is a modern Muslim country that practices a moderate version of Islam and yet even they are at risk from radical Islam and taken measures to put a halt to it.  "Moroccan authorities have recently banned the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of the burqa – an outer garment worn by some Muslim women to cover themselves in public. It completely conceals the face, with a mesh cloth shielding the eyes from view. The decision is noteworthy in a country whose population is 99% Muslim. So what does the ban mean?  The Moroccan Ministry of Interior cited security concerns as the reason for the ban. It argued that wearing the burqa could help criminals and terrorists hide their identities. Indeed, several criminals have reportedly used the burqa or niqab – a veil that covers the face but not the eyes – to perpetrate crimes, including theft."  So a 99% Muslim Country that still imprisons gays but says NO to the burqa, but liberals say something else.  What an ehco chamber.
Er, Carter banned Iranians and Obama banned Iraqis. Where were all the protests then ?  Any protests because having an Israeli stamp in your passport gets you banned in most Muslim countries ?
Once again trudeau screws Canada for his Islamic masters!
Comments closed means that the perp was muslim.  Comments open means that the perp was not muslim.  Comments open but pre moderated means it might be a muslim.  The G&M is afraid of meeting the same fate as Charlie Hebdo .
The fundamental flaw with accepting everybody from diverse backgrounds without making it conditional that they leave their cultural baggage behind is that it eventually leads to recreating conflicts that were global to being local scale here at home.  Basically, countries are fighting each other and positioning for power, resources etc motivated by cultural prejudices. We are just recreating that conflict here at home when all these ethnic groups refuse to integrate and jettison their negativeness.  Germany is a good example of the massive Turkish Muslim worker block that were imported decades earlier that have refused to integrate themselves into German society.  Look at the Asians in Canada over the decades. At one time, Chinatowns were dominant centers. A lot of Asians now live, dress, have the same social habits as Canadians. Compare that to the Muslims. Muslims as a general community do not integrate well. The majority reject Canadian liberal values privately.
Deutsche Welle's Shamil Shams:-   "One year after the Cologne attacks, I stand by my argument that political Islam and Western liberal values are not compatible. I still believe that the migrant influx ultimately disturbs the harmony and balance of German society. In fact, 2016 has proven that German society and the European way of life have suffered immensely due to the government's "open door" refugee policy.  "More than 1,500 police officers will be deployed on New Year's Eve in Cologne to make sure that last year's assaults - when more than 1,000 women were sexually harassed by hundreds of young men allegedly of North African and Arab descent - won't be repeated. It is saddening and outrageous. It is proof that the German way of life - people's longing for fun and festivity - has already been compromised. The fear of harassment has taken over the free spirit of Germans, and I find it very unfortunate."
Conspicuous, What is not part of the conversation by reporters or comenters in all of the Santiago shootings articles is the Radical Sharia Muslim ISIS connection. I went back and read all the articles and found the one brief mention of the ISIS connection in the first ADN article. Santiago informed authorities that the CIA was controlling his mind and forcing him to view ISIS terrorist teachings on the internet. Mental illness is a factor in all terrorist activity but the effect of Radical Muslim Religious teachings is the big factor. So he informs authorities of his ISIS connection then buys a one way ticket and only checks a bag with a gun and ammo. I know it is politically incorrect to profile but this is textbook. I personally think informing authorities of ISIS connection and mental instability should have placed him on a watch list. And the profile of one way ticket with only gun and ammo for baggage causes no concern? I call the political incorrectness of profiling BS.
When Islam calls for the death and mutilation of non-believers, I think it's only rational that non Muslims might have a healthy fear of it - especially since we see it being practiced in many countries with majority Muslim rule to this day.  Quran (8:12) - "I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them" The targets of violence are "those who disbelieve" - which is further defined in the next verse (13) as those who "defy and disobey Allah."  (non-Muslims).  Hate against any person or identifiable group is contemptible but it's already dealt with in our charter.  This motion is nothing more than a weapon to be used to suppress legitimate discussion of the wackier points of Islam (which the Quran makes punishable by death).    Sahih Bukhari (52:260) - "...The Prophet said, 'If somebody (a Muslim) discards his religion, kill him.' "
I think what you're seeing is a reaction to political correctness, which many (like me) see as a form of deceit, sometimes involving deceitful use of language.  So I doubt that Trump doesn't give a damm about the KKK; I'm sure he does.  But in truth, the threat posed by radical Islam --- ISIS --- is far greater than that posed by the KKK.  There's no equivalence, and it's only political correctness --- a falsehood --- that leads people to call the group CVR rather than CIE.  Not that there shouldn't be a group that focuses on the KKK.  There should be, and there is.  Within the FBI, there are units that focus on the Klan and other such groups.  But it's untrue to say that Trump is just out to get Muslims per se.  A highly aggressive approach to ISIS --- radical Islamists --- WILL keep us safe.  Or at least least safer than political correctness will.
Your opinion of me is this: "you are delusional." Okay (grin!)    I really am not interested in personal opinions with no merit.  Our American  President Trump speaks for American citizen's, including me. He most definitely does NOT speak for those you stated are "all Americans" and then listed those Americans as "foreign terrorists, undocumented workers, and Islamic terrorists."   Have a good night.  Cheers!
Lazy "Frat boys" renamed Al Quada Niger, Yemen, other Nations AQIM because they don't know there is a difference at Each Nation, including how they Operate, what they do. Democrat Obama's Support of the Non Libyan "Obama Libyan Rebels" of Al Quada's Ansar Al Shariah to Overthrow U.S. Ally President Gaddaffi a U.S. Ally since 2006, Ended U.S. Alliance Agreement that required Gaddaffi's Libyan Military to Aggressively Fight Muslim Terrorists, what this did was kept the Muslim Terrorists stuck fighting at U.S. Ally Libya to Stabilize the Entire Continent of Africa.  Obama's Supported Al Quada Ansar Al Shariah seized the Libyan Military Depots at Hight Razma Benghazi and Resupplied the Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam Worldwide, they then outgunned the Nigerian Military, Niger Military, Tunisian Military, Mali Military, Algerian Military (until the French Military returned), U.S. Ambassador, CIA Libya tasked to locate the 400 U.S. FIM-92 AA Missiles, 2000 Russian SA-7s, and AA Missiles.
He's selling hundreds of billions of dollars worth of weapons to the Saudi's who finance most Sunni Muslim terrorists.  It seems he wants more war and terror for his financial backers in the military industry.
Maybe you should read all of the islamic racists tweets!  Then you might have a different and more realistic opinion of her.
I wonder what the true reason for this need to ban people from those countries is?  In the past 5 years, only 11 of the 89 terrorist attacks in the U.S. were by Muslims:  http://reason.com/archives/2017/03/24/do-muslims-commit-most-us-terrorist-atta  Another poster on here yesterday stated that GW Bush didn't start his Iraq war until 3 years into his Presidency. But, Bush and his cronies had been planning that since the late 1990's.  I'm wondering if 9/11 was a set up to give us an excuse to move into the middle east militarily with a heavy hand.  The Saudi's have shown signs of trying to manipulate the balance of power in the middle east, and they're our buddies.  Coincidence that those attackers came here from Saudi Arabia?  Hmm....
Should I bother creating a similar list based on the Bible or would you even get the point of it?  Christians, in all their variety can discern what parts of the Bible are worth following and which aren't. Do you really think Muslims aren't capable of that?
How does one go to war on the home front when the enemy at home is so nebulous?  It isn't a conventional war any more when fighting terrorists.  These are stateless actors using propaganda on the digital front to spread their extremists dogma.  The best way to counter this is to be persistent and diligent in shutting them down on the digital front.  The second step is to monitor Imams in local mosques to ensure that they are not spreading extremists ideologies.  Even the middle east muslim countries monitor the messages spread by Imams in their country.  It is folly for the west to allow extremists ideologies to be spread under the guise of freedom of religion.  There are limits to freedom of religion under our Charter.
In this case of mass murder, we don't know why he did the killing. There will be future cases of mass murder and we  can't predict who will do it.  But in the case of Islamic terrorism we do know the motive and we do know they will continue. You just don't want to acknowledge it.
You are missing the point. Yes, the past was bloody, Christians today reject that kind of action, they don't claim it with pride, but shame. They have learned from history, and evolved.  So what does that have to do with the present?  In the present, some groups commit acts of terrorism *in the name of* their religion. That is what makes it "Muslim terrorism", rather than "Communist terrorism", or "Anarchist terrorism", etc.  The Weathermen, the Baader-Meinhoff Gang, etc.,  were organised terrorist groups who acted out of a common ideology, so are ISIS or al-Quaeda-inspired terrorists.  There is no equivalent so far for Bissonnette, he did not claim to be acting in the name of Christianity, so why describe him as a Christian terrorist? Because of his ethnic origins?  So are atheists also going to be considered "Christian" because of their ethnic origins?
Islam is a religion that preaches submission and hatred towards non-Muslims.  The whole concept of Jihad further supports this.  A religious war.  Moreover, if you look at the statistics on population density of Muslims in a western community you will see increasing violence and rape of Western populations, especially when the Muslim population reaches about 10%.  All you need to do is look at France, England and Sweden and you have concrete proof.    I do not mind immigration, but would request that immigrants integrate in to the Western societies that invites them in.  Not segregate themselves into mosques and keeping pretty much to themselves and only seem to contribute with violent acts.
I concede that there are violent practitioners of Islam, just as there are violent practitioners of Christianity, Judaism, and, no doubt, many other faiths. (before the deadly attack against innocents in Manchester, remember, was the attack against Muslims at worship in Quebec). When you rest your argument there, though, one wonders what it is you would have the "sensible" Mr. Trump do about it. I ask you this, franco prairie, because just a day or two ago President Trump was on television carefully making the point that Muslim terrorists are "losers." "Losers," "losers," "losers;" he hammered it home. Evidently it's present U.S. doctrine.  I actually felt thankful that he is President of the U.S., soundly discredited and not seriously listened to almost anywhere. Imagine that he was a high school teacher or principal, getting away with such abuse, such emotional violence in a world of vulnerable young men/older boys.  We do have to resist, to hold onto one another until this ends.
Study your history. America chose sides in the Muslim Religious Wars decades ago. Also, read T. E. Lawrence ...
Hi, Amira...been ages since your last column, (In a Post Truth Environment, False Perceptions can Hurt Us All, Jan 6) in which you suggested that to improve relations with Muslims, it's the rest of us who should make some changes. Meanwhile, presumably, Muslims need make no changes at all, just...go about their Muslim business as usual. No joke! Yup, couldn't forget that.    But seriously now: "One rare and alarming study here at home suggests a 600 per cent increase in how frequently Canadians used language that was racist, Islamophobic, sexist or otherwise intolerant over the period between November 2015 and November 2016. "  Before I get "alarmed" I gotta ask: who studied it?  How?  And most important: "a 600 per cent increase" from what level, exactly?  Over what period? Hate to nit-pick, but I shrug off a lot of things that others find intolerant.  And occasionally (being usually tolerant) even I find intolerant some attitudes and behaviours others accept.   Funny column, alright.
Yikes. As if the Arab rivalries were not complex enough.  The U.S. just made best friends of Saudi Arabia, who probably spearheaded the action. "The chief worry among them is the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Islamist political group outlawed by both Saudi Arabia and the UAE as it challenges the nations’ hereditary rule."   Meanwhile, the U.S. has major bases in both Qatar and Bahrain, now on opposite sides of this dispute. And Trump can't just sign an Executive Order to settle the issues.
After reading this column and these comments I have to come to the conclusion Canada is lost. There is no hope for human rights or liberties in Canada as Islam continues to  expand and take control of our social fabric.  Gay rights , women's rights, and the rights of other minorities will be throw away to appease delicate Muslim sensibilities, and Wente here will cheer it as a great victory for justice and understanding, when if fact it is the closing down of all free speech and equality.
I will try again.Reports have it that in Dearborn, MI over 100,000 Muslims (45% of the city!)have settled into a “no-go” zone. The area is governed by Sharia law. The Muslim authorities of the compound build as they like, create schools, and write their own curriculum. How do you call it?
The Trump effect.  Saudi's want to keep their primary market. Qatar is not so valuable, even among Muslims.
I would rather see all of these cash, tax free handouts go to court before a cent is given. ........and not a left wing, pro-Muslim Judge"s court.   Our Government has now hand 4 guys 41.5 million again....tax free dollars. And why are we spending millions for supposed torture that happened in a foreign country?
John  Your outlet on life is wonderful but is about a 51  deck of cards. have you read any of the world news papers particularly Germany, Spain and or course France. My "rants" comes from 6 years on the ground in Muslim countries plus 2  more in Dubai.  Take a trip to Europe especially Germany and then come back and talk to me. America is already GREAT, refugee's especially those from Syria and the surrounding area have no potential. When they come over I want to make sure you adopt a large group to help us attain higher potentials
You say "so what?".  Good for you. That is your prerogative.  I would appreciate your views on Muslim nations that exist today. Which could you live in comfortably? Probably the majority choice would be Turkey, but as it slides towards dictatorship (again), perhaps soon that one almost tolerable Muslim nation will join its fellow Muslim states as a  cesspool of intolerance and medieval practices. Of course, you would say that this is the west's fault.  Yes, so what? So what if nations that have achieved the greatest living standards and the highest levels of liberty in human history sink back into the dark ages.  So what indeed.
I think you have a good point regarding Trump and policy – "truly important matters."  Although he does, as Paul Scott suggests in his comment, rattle off a lot about what he will do in arenas that the constitution reserves for congress or courts. All the winning he promises require cooperation with the other branches. Yes, all candidates do that. Trump, however, does it more, and with far less ambiguity than normal.   Sadly, beyond that, Mr. Trump is also distinguishable from all previous candidates in my lifetime for his brazen use of common-enemy tactics that include open disrespect for millions of Mexicans, Muslims, women, African Americans, and ... who else? (It's hard to keep track.) And his shocking disregard for norms of presidential speech and behavior (Waterboarding? Sure, and more!) His policies may be as you suggest, but his persona and tactics, are different.   I'm very disappointed to see that persona and those tactics get so many votes. And worried.
Sizable Minority.....this is exactly the tone of news that is trying to grab a headline. I for one am weary of this type of reporting. It encourages dissident behavior and inflammatory reactions to something we have done since becoming a country. Immigrate. This "idea" that Muslims are all bad is quite like saying that all Catholics are bad or all Christians are bad. Its sad that this type of thought pattern is being encouraged by journalism. Man Made fear over another belief,color etc. Wake up people and stop being controlled by what you read to the extent that you are willing to harm others. Immigration is how we here in Canada make enough to run our country. They are generall the hardest working.  We as a population have the biggest issue with getting our own to work. Stop comparing to other countries, get educated about how our country works before you single out others. We are Canada and we represent many great things including a society that is inclusive
Trudeau did say the more Muslim refugees we allow into Canada   the less risk of terrorism we will have.
This person's Muslim organization changed its name from CAIR, an unindicted co-conspirator of Arab terrorist group Hamas.  The Globe is now a Hamas terrorist mouthpiece?
Sometime the message will get through to Western leaders  that if you attack Muslims, or any other group, you can expect retaliation. For example the West set up Israel with the best of intents except it meant taking land from Arabs/Muslims. The Arabs retaliated against embassies in Africa, a US Naval ship, the US responded attacking a factory in Khartoum and caves in Afghanistan. Then the  Arabs responded with 9/11. It is very clear that if the west attacks Arabs,  the Arabs will respond. Immigration control will do little until the west stops attacking Muslims.
"But whoever wins will have to appeal to voters in Mississauga-Erin Mills, to choose just one Greater Toronto example. That riding is 60 per cent non-white." No kidding. You can see the lib-totalitarian party representatives, working their butts off , to try and accommodate the Islamic community, which has spread from Brampton, to Toronto,  Mississauga,  Milton, moving south to Oakville and Burlington. Whatever party gives in  the most,  to this culture, will get the advantage at election time. Don't be surprise, in just a few years,  we'll see either the first Islamic  Toronto Mayor or Ontario's Premier.
For years ISIS has been trying unsuccessfully to goad the West into a religious war in Arab lands in the hope Muslims would rally to their cause. But the US and Europe didn't take the bait, so ISIS killed hundreds of thousands of Muslims who opposed them instead. Fortunately for ISIS, in a few short weeks they will have a man in the White House who has promised to give them exactly what they so desire.
Why some people don't want Muslim?  http://debatepost.com/2017/04/04/death-toll-rises-to-14-in-st-petersburg-officials-suspect-muslim-suicide-attack/
The CBC'S Macdonald's article linked to in this article, makes the weird claim that Bissonnette was a "Christian" terrorist.  Has "Christian" now become used as a term of ethnic identity, where if one is white and of European roots, one is deemed to be a Christian, whether or not one is an actual believer, or an atheist?  I guess that follows when you need to make hostility to Islam about race, skin color, ethnicity, rather than to a set of beliefs...  The problem is, Muslim terrorists are Muslim terrorists because they CLAIM to be acting in the name of their religion. There is no indication Bissonnette was religious, or that he acted in the name of Christianity.
Dr Khan clearly bending to Islamophobia.  There are negative feelings expressed towards muslims, but legimatization of the reasons of why we feel this way were not acknowledged or even referered to.  We have only to look at the continual terrorism attacks all over the world to understand that if there is prejudism and bias against muslims, they have earned it. They are, in fact, a conflicted culture.  They did it to themselves, we are only trying to stop it.  We are in no way blameworthy for the violence we have had to endure, not just in other countries but right on the doorstep of Canada, a place of refuge to many of them. Canada is our home, our land, and they need to respect us and the laws of this great nation that protect all who reside and abide here.
Drop the word 'Islamophobia' from the motion. Otherwise the motion is perfectly fine.  For example: is German Chancellor Angela Merkel Islamophobic for stating recently that the Islamic full-face veil and burqa make it impossible for women to integrate into German society and should therefore be banned? Or, was the Dutch film-maker Theo Van Gogh Islamophobic for making a film about the mistreatment of women in Islam?  I think no one can say Ms Merkel is Islamophobic considering Germany has been the most generous country on earth assisting Syrian refugees and migrants from many other (mostly Muslim-majority) countries. But if you say you want to ban the burqa I guarantee you will be attacked as Islamophobic (at least on Facebook posts such as this one, based on past experience). If the accusation of Islamophobia against those who want to ban the burqa is justified then Ms Merkel is also Islamophobic, which is absurd.
The Globe believes Canada should accommodate cultural practices that are only common in countries where women are second class citizens.  Europe is playing catch-up after failing to address the issue of political Islam from the beginning; laissez faire political impotence and hoping for the best have failed conclusively with growing radicalism, cultural segregation, and widespread no-go zones. It's not "Islamaphobic" to point out that Turkey implemented strict limitations on public displays of religion for 70 years to protect the separation of Church and State - it has taken Erdogan's Islamist AKP under 10 years to regress Turkey into an authoritarian regime, Islamists never stop until they have absolute control. The cowardly attack in Quebec must be condemned in the strongest terms but we should still be able to have an objective discussion about political Islam. Political Islam (Islamism) supports cultural segregation and isolation, it should be addressed head on.
" I know dozens of Canadian Muslims, and all of them seem to have adapted well and integrated into Canadian society." More like integrated well into the Canadian Welfare system.
Obama no more took out Bin Laden than the man on the moon. Bin Laden had been dead for at least 10 years when obama pretended to have him killed. Curious that there were all newspaper reports announcing his death in 2001. Equally curious and tragic was the killing of the navy seals who were part of the alleged raid. Then there is the complicating factor of no body (buried at sea according to some muslim tradition that no one has ever heard of) Never never never underestimate the gullibility of the American Democrat in believing fake news
You can't base an entire immigration policy on a handful of exemptions. As heinous as this individuals actions are they do not represent mainstream Muslim faith Not do they represent the sentiment of the Somali population across the USA.
About 5 seconds of research found the explanation for 907AK's fake news. Alinsky taught you well 907AK:  "The media are targeting Dr. Sebastian Gorka for political assassination. Gorka is a deputy assistant to President Donald Trump and renowned irregular warfare and counterinsurgency expert. A proud anti-establishment figure, members of the media, academics, and his rivals are on the warpath against Gorka.  Leftist outlets have labeled Gorka an unqualified “Islamophobe” and “anti-Semite.” Serious charges to be sure. Though the multitude of hit pieces do not reveal a single statement or word suggesting a hint of anti-Muslim or anti-Jewish bias during his decades-long career, they insist that the White House staffer harbors these malicious thoughts."
So much for secular modern democratic Islam. Modernity and Islam: Oil and water. Tunisia is just another failed Islamic theocracy. Note to Justin: this is not the kind of "diversity" we need in Canada.
Wrong.  The Roman Catholic Church was the overall leader in Europe at the time, using its Religious authority to sanction the Political (it forced Henry II, King of England to do penance for the death of Thomas Beckett in 1174).  The Church inherited what was left of the Western Roman Empire and reconstituted it as the Holy Roman Empire in 800 AD.  The Church used its influence to recover Christian sites in the Middle East from the Muslims who wrested it from the Eastern Roman Empire in 639 AD. That area had been in Roman / Christianized Roman hands since 37 BC.
Good for you.  I agree, how could you waltz through the border while a Muslim person right beside you would be barred and not think "no, I'm not doing this.  I'm not better than you. "  I suggest you wait four years before setting foot there again.
It brings to mind a report in the media, not long ago, where our dear PM will earmark over $ 35 million dollars to fight islamic extremism radicalization in Canada. As we all know, one of the first tools was the introduction of  'just a motion' anti-islamophobia, studies and ways to implement actions against this 'destructive' practice by the canadian people, to be put into a final legal resolution to protect islam against critique of the religion of peace. Not a joke, it's coming. Like muslim London mayor stated, you need to get used to attacks, run, hide, deny. The left's way to confront terrorism.
Anyone who votes for Trump and supports the Muslim Ban is going to be accused of racism.  That is just the way things roll.  That is why people voted for Trump because of this. They don't particularly like Middle Easterners among other brown skin foreigners and want them kicked out of the country.  I personally grew up in a conservative area and know multiple people who voted for Trump for that reason.    And yes Bannon is an open bigot.  Dude is a white nationalist who has aides who have worked with people who espouse the separation of the races like Stephen Miller does and who have associated with neo-Nazi European parties like Sebastian Gorka.
Perhaps you should mind your own business as Catholic Schools are Private schools and perhaps you shouldn't be teaching Islam in public schools and perhaps you shouldn't be teaching five year olds, primary students sex education, what their vaginas and penises are and in Grade 3, homosexuality and gender identity.  These are children not adults.  Oh yes and their teachings of masturbation in Grade 6.  Of course, they don't teach them what you call "SELF CONTROL" and what kind of diseases they can get until Grade 7.  Should be minding your own business as it is the parents' responsibility, not yours.
Khan says what many, including Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, et al have said when she writes "Questions and criticism about Islam are not Islamophobia. In fact, Muslims themselves engage in robust debates about modernity and Islamic practice. The cruel irony is that such debates are banned in countries that need it most." Let's not have these debates banned here out of political correctness.
The Crimean Tarters kidnapped Ukrainian and Russians and sold them on the slave markets in the Middle East. The Turks kidnapped Christian boys who were brought up from age 7 to serve in the Janissaries (infantry units). The slave trade is the reason why there are so many blond and blue eyed people in the Middle East.   Savery continues in the Middle East to today’s date – although it no longer involves white children. Type into Google the words “slavery Saudi Arabia” or another country and read what appears.   The Muslim countries have never apologized for the white slave trade. No compensation has ever been offered to the descendants of the victims.   4. On 3 occasions, Muslims nearly conquered Europe. Twice the Turks reached Vienna. Muammar Gaddafi, when he was Libyan leader, predicted Muslims would conquer Europe through numbers and their birth rate.
Why Allan, the one word I changed in my post was "Christian".   And it kept getting censored, yet when I changed it to Muslim or Islam, the post wasn't censored.  Isn't that amazing?  Isn't it sad really?
Russian operatives set up an array of misleading Web sites and social media pages to identify American voters susceptible to propaganda, then used a powerful Facebook tool to repeatedly send them messages designed to influence their political behavior. The sites and Facebook pages displayed ads or other messages focused on such hot-button issues as illegal immigration, African American political activism and the rising prominence of Muslims in the United States. The Russian operatives then used a Facebook “retargeting” tool, called Custom Audiences, to send specific ads and messages to voters who had visited those sites. We could just as easily be describing an effort by the NRA or the RNC. Except that it was a foreign government intent on undermining American interests. Even if your put aside questions of collusion, (…and there was), ..the fact remains that Moscow (correctly) judged that supporting Trump’s candidacy would weaken the United States at home and abroad.
CANADIAN CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS  •	(b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication; •	15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.  We have the right to express our opinion about a culture  that does not view women as equal...it is written in their book. We have the right to express our opinion about a culture that refuses to assimilate into Canadian culture...where the women are expected to dress in clothing from the middle ages while the men dress in regular clothing.  This is not targeting minorities, Canada is filled with minorities. It is about the Muslim/Islamic culture that refuses to assimilate.  We have the right  to express our thoughts.
This article concerns Toronto's Police Muslim Chaplain. In 2016.  "Toronto Police’s Muslim Chaplain says marrying 9-year-old girl is permissible in Islam" http://en.cijnews.com/?p=53446  According to Musleh Khan, the husband is the only leader of the family; “the wife should be obedient to her husband at all times” including when he calls her to bed; she should “ask her husband’s permission before leaving the home” and “is obliged to serve her husband.”
Countries governed by Islamism are just shining beacons of individual liberal freedoms (just look at Turkey's "progression" under the AKP or the 57 members of the OIC at the UN. The fact that smug "progressives" in Canada champion symbols of female subjugation is shameless irony, considering the niqab is only common in countries where women are treated like second class citizens, without exception.  Interesting how smug progressives are silent when liberal female Muslims are bullied into submission or ostracized as provocateurs for choosing not to wear head coverings. In Iran, women are beaten by morality police for showing too much hair but in Canada, it's always a women's choice - blind ignorance by Canada's leftwing blowhards demands we can't defend women who are ostracized for failing to submit to their pious obligations, because it's not PC. The double standard is truly shocking - Christianity and Judaism are fair game for satire, but Islam is beyond reproach?
Yes it's amazing. Liberals  have Canadians eating out of their hands with multiculturalism because they're afraid to be called racists or even worse, "unsophisticated provincials".   Then they had Canadians eating out of their hands with same sex marriage because they were afraid to be called homophobic.   Then they had Canadians eating out of their hands with Islam because they were afraid to be called Islamophobic.   Now they have Canadians eating out of their hands with feminism because they're afraid to be called sexists.        All this feeding at the Liberal Lunch Cafeteria while democracy disappears,, the middle class vanishes, sovereignty gets lost,  the electoral system  spuks, and the economy tanks.
Read the article again.  "The current U.S. ban applies to nonstop U.S.-bound flights from 10 international airports in Amman, Jordan; Kuwait City, Kuwait; Cairo; Istanbul; Jeddah and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Casablanca, Morocco; Doha, Qatar; and Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. About 50 flights a day, all on foreign airlines, are affected.".  Those are mostly, if not all, Muslim dominated countries.  I consider terrorism a serious matter and I am NOT joking.
Mosques, separate schools (some funded by Saudi Arabia (that bastion of tolerance), the congregation of minorities in neighbourhoods, and the very rigidness of Islam should be of concern to a largely secular society. After a while there is no necessity to "fit-in"
So far, this new administration is "through the looking glass", with the Red Queen screaming "Off with their heads", the mad hatter talking backwards, and the royal knights riding in circles, directionless. Alice has her hands full, having fallen down the rabbit-hole into a truly crazy place.  Shinzo Abe rolls his eyes as Trump addresses him by his first name rather than last, and has his state dinner in front of golfing members at Mar-a-Lago, peering at his table while Trump and his minions discuss the North Korean missile launch. Insiders panic at the release of an order banning all travel from Muslim nations, without any warning from the Big Cheeto. Morale is soaring, of course, as panic stands a foot away. Another day at the office.  Is this REALLY what we wanted, folks? I won't accept YES as an answer. As Alice says to the crazy cast of The Court,  "Stuff and nonsense! Who cares for you? You're nothing but a pack of cards!"
Islam is a system of beliefs.  A Muslim is a person who adheres to all, some, a  moderate version, or  none of this system of beliefs.   The person has protection under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a system of beliefs does not and should not.
Isn't the Aga Khan an Islamic Imam? Did Justin convert while he was there for "Christmas", thus explaining Bill M103?
Questioning the central beliefs and practices of a religion is an absolute right, and shouldn't be silenced because it's followers call it "Islamophobia". This is not to be mistaken for anti-Muslim hatred; you can question a group's beliefs without hating individuals of that group.
I would not like to see  women treated the way Muslims treat women become the norm.
That's incorrect. Some Jews are atheists.  "The Jewish people are an ethnoreligious group and nation originating from the Israelites, or Hebrews, of the Ancient Near East. Jewish ethnicity, nationhood and religion are strongly interrelated, as Judaism is the traditional faith of the Jewish nation, while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance." - Wikipedia  "Jewish" describes a diverse group of people that transcends their traditional religion. You can't use the term Jewish in the way that we use the terms Muslim or Christian. Muslims and Christians are identified by their adherence to their respective religions, regardless of their ethnicity. Jews may or may not identify with Judaism, but they're still Jews.
The wake up call is on Club Islam,  now  a world wide pariah .   Club Islam is something that the world can do without.  A cancer trying to metastasize .   I cannot imagine anyone wanting to stay in such a club.
Uh gee, he only criticized Obama 100 times for not saying 'Muslim extremists"
So you agree with Stuart Chambers then, that anti-Muslim extremists need to be opposed.
It's not really about either Christians or Muslims.  It's about normal every day people who care about the future for their children.  Both religious practitioners ultimately care about their children.  We either learn to respect that or our children murder each other...an our grand children's children will not see the light of day.
This was obviously one of the friendly Muslims that Justin keeps speaking of. Harper was branded a racist by the liberals for wanting to screen refugees, can you blame him? As far as I'm concerned Justin is a big reason for what's happened in Edmonton and future attacks to come. Next election, I will vote for the leader who will not let hatred into this country. We need a safe place to raise our children! Justin has no idea, killing small business and letting in terrorists. Is it just a coincidence that our immigration minister is also a Somali refugee, no conflict of interest there?
"Impervious to rational discussion" - interesting for 2 reasons- 1) it is a direct quote of popular regressive, Reza Aslan and 2) dismissing those who disagree with your position as "extremists" ironically inhibits the ability to have rational discussion. Let's discuss the "silent majority" as highlighted by a Gatestone survey in England: 23% of British Muslims said Islamic Sharia law should replace British law in areas with large Muslim populations, 52% of the Muslims surveyed said they believe homosexuality should be illegal, 35% think it is acceptable to have more than one wife, and only 34% would report suspected jihadis to the police. Eye opening.  I am for legal immigration and don't care what one believes/practices in private, provided they assimilate to Canada's cultural norms in the public sphere, and that their private actions do not violate the rights of other individuals as defined in our Charter. Now you know my position - I am fully prepared for a rational discussion.
The pope has finally caught up to what Donald Trump was saying many months ago about terrorism.  Previously the pope wanted to pretend that the high profile Muslim terrorist actions were caused by "the west" wanting to "close themselves off" to "surprises"...or to "gun money" or to imperialist western countries.   The pope though can't quite bring himself into the fullness of the truth, but mounting events are moving him nonethessless a bit closer to reality.   We definitely need a more agile and quick thinking pope in this day and age.
“The SAMs imposed on Mr. Abdulmutallab prohibit him from having any communication whatsoever with more than 7.5 billion people.." True. That's what solitary means. Now - there are, or should be limits on how long a prisoner spends in solitary. It is inhumane and no matter what horrid thing this guy planned, we still don't torture here. Well - except for John Yoo who's good with it.  Religion - well, we have Christian clergy on staff, so a Muslim would be appropriate. Group worship - not so much. As for protection - we also have that duty to keep this worthless person safe. Not our first choice perhaps, but that comes with imprisoning someone. Besides - I want him to have a very, very, very long time in prison. No easy out by way of extra judicial killing either.
Those who say it's a good thing to strap on a bomb to kill innocents are not following Islamic doctrine.  They're violating it.
Really? When did Hawaii place one religion above another by filing this on behalf of the Muslim community? Nothing personal, but if they are harmed can’t they file on their own? Haven’t we been down this road before and lost?  Come on Mr. Chin, take care of Hawaii first.
"nativist hate-based "  You must mean the indigenous of that region promoting their minority cultures and languages. Like the Québécois culture and language threatened by the monolithic language and culture of 350 million in North America, the situation in Europe is similar. The majority of European countries have a unique language and culture developed over centuries. The majority of European countries have prudent and rational laws and citizenship requirements dependent on ancestry, culture and language. European countries, like the United States, Australia, NZ, Arabic and Muslim majority countries do not have the bizarre Canadian policy of multiculturalism and multinationalism accommodating  non-indigenous cultures and languages. For example the population of Denmark with its unique culture and language is a couple of million whereas the Arabic Muslim population is about 400 million.
Qatar is definitely at fault here. The Saudi foreign minister reported that Qatar must end its support for the Palestinian group Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood before ties with other Arab Gulf states could be restored. Saudi doesn’t think this is good. Qatar has to stop these policies so that it can contribute to stability in the Middle East
That was exactly my question to sirencall, Chris.  Why didn't sirencall - or you - post something about the widely held beliefs of, say, Muslims?  Just wondering...
Who faces more persecution,Christians in the Middle East or Muslims in the West?
This is because when is refugee crisis you are unlikely to be sympathetic and vote NO to helping a Muslim refugees. This because when you see a Muslim person who is in need( say he is struggling to pay rent with precarious jobs he can find in GTA)  you are more likely to ignore them and label them as opportunistic economic migrant but you are more likely to extend helping hand if the person in need is a Japanese woman.   But I don't think people engage in helping behavior or harming behavior because the recipient of the help(or harm) deserves it truly but because helping others to makes yourself better like you are some kind of hero, extension of God when in fact you are only trying to maintain your self-image. Nothing admirable about helping other people nothing despicable about harming other people. Remember just don't judge other people for their behaviours be it pro-social or anti-social.
"liberals"  fought the Born Again Christians, the only group large enough to have tried to impose their values, without success, even though those are a lot less extreme than conservative Muslims'.  The Hindus are actually very adaptable and do not try to impose theirs anyway, and have not asked for "accommodations" under the Charter.   Hasidic Jews accept the fact they are marginal, they don't try to impose their values, none of which are as extreme as conservative Muslims' anyway. But there have been conflicts in areas where they do demand accommodations, because they do  impact others.  Atheists have impacted society because they are now numerous, just as Muslims may when they get numerous too. That is precisely the danger. Liberals who fought hard against BACs are fine with conservative Muslims imposing their values? I'm not.
If you ignore the politics of islam you are not thinking.
I work with a lot of Muslims. They are all nice people. They work hard, are smart, and are easy to get along with. None of them has ever given me any cause for concern, none of them (nor their spouses that I am aware of) wear a burka or a niqab, and none of them are any kinds of activists.  None of them have been anything but good colleagues, friends, neighbours, and in most cases, Canadian citizens. The Globe and Mail should try speaking to them.
recognize the Virgin birth --- So they recognize Jesus as son of God?  Other than western media and maverick muslims do you have Islam scholars quotes to back that up?  You mentioned Jews seing Jesus as source of their troubles. But not the Muslims? Ever heard of crusades?
Gee whiz, even liberal Bill Maher and Sam Harris realize that criticizing Islam isn't "racism."    And how can "racism" be inherent in long standing U.S. immigrant law, which mandates (gasp!) that our nation has a border.  A bord-er   bord....er     http://www.dictionary.com/  And simple math teaches us that if  Trump is correct that illegal immigrants do sometimes commit crime (they do)....then how is it in our nation's interest to have more crime?  http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/18/in-2013-59-of-deported-immigrants-convicted-of-a-crime/  NCR, if you're bothered by "hate," then stop needlessly fanning flames of hate with false information and accusations.
This dreadful bombast from our president is meant entirely for US consumption. Trump doesn't get much of anything substantial done, but he works nearly 24/7 on shoring up his support among his base, in case he survives in office until the 2020 election. His base are a bunch of tough-talking yahoos, we saw them in action at his rallies, sucker-punching black people, yelling the "F" word nonstop. screaming "Lock her up!" in stupid unison, cursing Muslim people. Trump is absolutely shameless.  What about the rest of the world? This was a speech at the United Nations, after all. Trump alarmed every thoughtful person, meaning people who want to avoid nuclear war; and that includes the Japanese, threatened by North Korea's dictator. Japan doesn't want a nuclear war, having already been the victim of one.  What happened to diplomacy? Trump's base don't like diplomacy, they want to bomb North Korea back to the stone age, and they don't care about the assured collateral damage to our allies.
Can we please be honest in this debate and make a distinction between Islam and radical Islam?  I believe the vast majority of Canadians are able to distinguish between the two, and rightfully would be fearful of Radical Islam. That does not make them 'Islamphobes' any more than a radical homosexual would make us homophobes.
Muslims who think "Allah will provide" should pay attention.
The grandma had seen the alert, she ignored it. And why does the kid have a muslim name?
And every society has to make its own judgement about what is should do. There is no point judging an another society with one's own values. In Iran it was women who wore the chador as a protest against the Shah's secular rule, where women wore western clothing.  And being judgemental about Islam only makes a lot of Muslims more defensive, which defeats the purpose of integration. In two generations most Muslim kids will be indistinguishable from other Canadian kids. However, if they feel they are under siege, then these identity issues will last a lot longer.
Canada rooted for Stalin? Churchill diverted ships ....  You grasp on facts is getting a bit slippery.. in fact gone.  Fact - Hindus slaughtered , raped and maimed how many Muslims juts not so long ago?  Fact - woman riding a bus in India is groped how many times?  Fact - Trudeau (both) admired Castro.   So - what's your point?
Right Sher, keep deflecting even though there are no parallels to the regressive nature of political Islam. I am against anti-Muslim hate but I do not condone "accommodating" a boys soccer team who threatens to forfeit instead of playing against a team with two female players. Women can't pray on their periods because they are unclean and they must pray at the back so they don't arouse their male peers - this has no place in public schools. Gender equality is not a function of cultural relativism.  Canada and the west didn't evolve into the most advanced societies in the world by accident - so why should we accommodate cultural practices that are only common in countries where there is no free expression and no gender equality? Because it's 2017?
Baloney, there is no prejudice against Japanese. They have earned the respect and sympathy of the community through their behavior. The same cannot always be said of Muslims and Blacks - they have more black sheep among them.
Apparently, you have forgotten about the seven Islamic attacks in seven years on U.S. soil while Obama was in office. Google: How many terror attacks on U.S. soil happened under Obama. The CB censorship won't allow me to give the link. Can't stand the truth.
