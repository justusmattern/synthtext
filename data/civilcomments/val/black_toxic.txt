I feel confident that your "paraphrase" of Arthur Ashe's words is a very poor one and the message you were trying to convey by it is clear from your post. You wrote, "Let me quote Arthur Ashe from his last book “Days of Grace”, he stated “If Blacks would act Human there would not be a problem” (paraphrase)." Your paraphrase clearly implies that if African-Americans would just behave correctly (act Human) they wouldn't be treated like non-humans. The problem is that several hundred years of history fail to provide any evidence for your claim. What is more, you very wrongly made a claim about persons who are my flesh and blood and I consider your words justification for violence against people whose skin is black and whose ancestry is African-American. You keep your racist filth off my family.
Fire those ungrateful inmates.  Professional?  Far from it.  Let them become unemployed and become adept as drug pushers or pimps.  Then they can join their black brothers as inmates again.
Good thing this guy is not black, they would have stormed the building ant shot him by now.
OK...let's have that conversation.  1) As I stated earlier.....blacks that kill other blacks tend to go to prison for that crime.  2) Very rarely does a cop get convicted for killing someone who happens to be unarmed.  3) While the DOJ cleared the officer in the Ferguson case (as did the primary investigation....and rightly so in my opinion), their investigation unveiled some other stinky things taking place with regards to how the Ferguson PD and City interacts with the black community there.  That also needs to be part of the conversation.  4) As another poster commented....when a child is beaten to death or nearly to death by a parent or guardian, no one comes on here and complain that no one is talking about child-on-child assaults, which happen in a greater number.  Yet, when the discussion is police treatment of blacks, some have to bring up black on black crime.  Why is that?
Black athletes should also be taking a knee to bring the "blacks killing blacks" to the front pages.
"'All lives matter but certainly black, African Americans have generally been that part of the population that to some degree — in some areas — gets the short end the stick. We do matter just as much as everybody else matters.""  The impetus of these marches:  Many Americans are dumber than a sack of hammers and easily manipulated by propaganda. Where should they be marching?  How about suburban ghettos, with the toughest gun laws, run by Democrat mayors and city councils. Chicago is a perfect example of the real problem. Fifty years of welfare programs and treating black people like victims has created a dysfunctional system leading to hopelessness, crime, and perpetual poverty. Chicago is 32% white, but they commit only 3.5% of the murders. Over 96% of the murders are committed by non-whites. Essentially, it is young black men murdering other black men.  We were done when it became unacceptable to tell the public the truth without being called racist.
Just give all the blacks $10k each and a one way ticket to Africa. We would all come out ahead, and you all know it.  70% of them are on welfare and drain much more than that every single year in welfare alone.  Add in the societal and economic costs of just having them here and hell, give $20k to the holdouts.
you can be fined for discriminating against Micros.  in the news a chinese landlord was fined approximately $15000 for telling a Micro he didn't like Micros.  If you don't like Micros you can't tell them that.  Same like telling African-Amerians you no like blacks since they are all criminals.
garycrum - Oh, the guilt you must feel.  Ad hominems always reassure me that I’m on the winning team. You don’t know my intentions any more than I know yours. Your definition of “rude” obviously means anything that disagrees with your PC narrative.  Chew on this…… “The point I was making was not that my grandmother harbors any racial animosity, but that she is a typical white person. If she sees somebody on the street that she doesn’t know (pause) there’s a reaction in her that doesn’t go away and it comes out in the wrong way.” - Barack Obama throwing his white grandma under the bus.  Can you imagine the political firestorm if Donald Trump used the term: “typical black person”? You’d be on him like Old Yeller on meatballs.  Have a great day!
I'm aware of that, and that the shooter was black. I'm aware of black gun violence and black unemployment, black incarceration, single black mothers. While going about my white business and enjoying my white life, I read the news, shake my head and wonder, When will they ever learn? Some group of black people decided to remind me that Black Lives Matter. Oh, I forgot about that. Black Lives Matter doesn't diminish my self worth in the least.
Blacks can solve some of their own problems.   We do have to prosecute people like the story is about.
How exactly is pointing out the glaring media double-standards in their consistencies of reporting considered to be defending white nationalists?  Btw, it wasnt Trump but Obama, but thanks for including the info that Obama actually did his defending and excusing of the racist hate group BLM, whose role model is a wanted black nationalist cop killer named Assata Shakur, at the actual FUNERALS of the murdered officers.  Would you agree that was "disgusting and offensive to the families of the officers killed".  The hypocritical liberal media sure didn't, they loved his speech.  Imagine if Trump attends the funeral of the lady killed by the KKK idiot, and starts defending and justifying the KKK in his speech.  Do you really think the media would applaud that like they did with Obama?
This has got to be the dumbest article I have read in my entire life. Last time I checked Hillary Clinton is white. Last time I checked the majority of US citizens are white. When the majority votes for a candidate, that candidate wins. It is simple math, has nothing to do with racism. When HRC pushed for Libya to be invaded, thus killing thousands of brown Africans, destroying Africa's most prosperous state, I guess people voting for her are racist AF, since they obviously don't care about brown Africans.
You mean A tiny minority of self serving hardcore black racists like BLM I repeat "self serving"
Your numbers show 5948 murders committed by whites and 5620 by blacks.   WHich is bigger?
Black Lives Matter!, wait then what about Red, White, Yellow, and Brown Lives? If blacks can say nigger in the white house then what the hell you doing taking my comments down? Get a pair nigga!
"Black Catholics must work harder to bridge the racial divide in communities, the nation and within the church"...Wow.  The victims must right the ship?!  Talk about "Right church, wrong pew"!
They are mob whores & their children will be subjects {besides a black democrat president would have to be a traitor you don't know this?}...you are uninformed
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay  Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI! - Hypocrisy is a greater crime than racism.
".....since apparently, black lives don't matter to you".  I personally am far more concerned about the lives of the innocent black lives that are being lost with gang shootings, in cities like Chicago, than I am regarding the police shootings of individual such Micheal Brown. However the BLM is far less concerned about those innocent lives. Let's see an innocent school girl shoot in her front yard while playing or a thug who just strong armed some innocent store owner, which one concerns be more? Based the action of the BLM group my concern would differ from them.
Yup, lucky he is not african american!
bunch of cowards do this, whether it is against Jews , Muslims, Sikhs ,blacks, Asians, Indians, Pakistani's etc etc. Let them come out  and show their faces. Bunch of creeps.
You're confusing "cajones" with racism.  White Neo-Nazis chanting "Jews will not replace us" are "very fine people."  Black athletes quietly kneeling are "sons of bitches."  Rote patriotism is not an ideal of this country.
In it's zeal to do away with any and all traces of a black President who was and is infinitely more popular and certainly more revered than Trump, not to mention immeasurably more intelligent, real damage is being attempted to be done to policies the majority of the public fully supports.  The Trump regime is intent on instituting policies which are blatantly against the best interests of America and Americans, in the most undemocratic manner possible.  With the revelations of Trump's collusion with a foreign enemy of the US, the conflicts of interest, and the criminal money-laundering, any and all actions of the Trump regime should be suspended immediately until after the investigations, the court proceedings, and the impeachment process have been conducted and concluded.  Until that time, all aspects of the Trump administration should be viewed as illegitimate.  A criminal doesn't inquire about how to obtain pardons if they are innocent.
Here's something that will cheer up your day ... "St. Louis ex-officer acquitted in killing of black man" http://www.denverpost.com/2017/09/15/st-louis-police-shooting-acquitted/
There is no place for a bunch of Ku-Ku-Klowns in Canada. In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century an English  three Canadians was a member of the white supremacist organization Anglo-Saxon, WASP equivalent to the United States ("White Anglo-Saxon Protestants").  Four members have been Prime Ministers of Canada; Sir John A. Macdonald (father of « Canadian Federation » of 1867 but not « Father of Canada » which is Sir Samuel de Champlain in 1608 ),  Sir John Abbott,  Sir Mackenzie Bowell (a past « Grand Master » (?)),  and John Diefenbaker.   In 1927 the “Orange” movement gave birth to a more intolerant and racist group, the Canadian Ku Klux Klan, which had its deepest roots in small towns in Saskatchewan because of the "yellow peril", but also because of the blacks...Jews...Catholics... The “Ku Ku Nest” in the province campaigned against= teaching French + wearing the religious habit + the presence of crucifixes in schools (more to come)
Hey I like a lot of black people including Denzel Washington, James Earl Jones, Herman Cain and Ben Carson. So if we hate Obama does that make us racist? I have come to the conclusion that it  is not about race, but smarts. We have stupid white and black people that can't figure out how to make a living and smart black and white people that can. What are you? If lazy people got off their butts and worked hard we wouldn't need ACA,welfare for people to lazy to get a job and food stamps. I think if people want free food they should be limited to certain foods seeing I am tired of buying them better food than most working people can afford.
In all fairness, there wasn't a lot in his speech that condemned the shooter's racism in what I saw was one sentence about halfway through.  And, a lot of the speech was about racism on blacks.  So, it was pretty much biased, but not to the subject of the funeral itself.  Obama did largely avoid pointing the finger directly at blacks who were either performing or calling for acts against whites.  And, the Dems/liberals kinda went along with it and protected him.  Kinda like how the Repubs/right are doing for Trump.  Trump is coming under much more criticism, and largely deserved since the idiot can't keep his stupid trap shut or, god forbid, actually say the right thing to begin with.  The problem are the various "sides" in our society.  If they mess up, they protect themselves and deflect.  None stand up and say, "we're in the wrong and we need to clean up our act."  Spineless.
Why is it that racial protestors don't remember that the majority of slaves were sold into bondage by other blacks (from opposing tribes) and that American Indians hated each other so much that continuously fought wars with each other. Oh. Let's make history work for our own causes.
Marikana was an "Apartheid heritage?" What are you smoking, Einstein? The ANC currently has reverted to what it does best - killing predominantly black people at the bottom of the social stratum. Their record so far (and which overtakes their harping on Sharpeville by a country mile) 115 murdered (Esidimeni), 34 murdered (Marikana) and 7 000 mainly poor and mainly Black kids murdered every year by contaminated water (faeces in the water thanks to stupid and unqualified cadres being shoved into position they're unfit for). But, hey, in the ANC's grand population design, there's a very nice saving of R25-million (child grants) or so annually with these kids out of the way.
If he was a BLACK old geezer, that's PRECISELY what would have happened.  And all these white posters who are pleading for mercy for this guy would be applauding and/or making excuses for the cops.  Double-standards are the root of all evil.
Blacks who weren't slaves fighting whites who weren't Nazi's over Confederate statues erected by Democrats.
By those words it seems we could replace patriots with black lives matters, peta, Muslim brotherhood, on and on and on and come to the same conclusion.
Please forward me the link on the guy killed in front of his girlfriend. I really don't trust your word. You are projecting your own racism on me. I think black people should reduce the crime in there neighborhoods. They have a crime problem. when  6% of the population commits 50%of the violent crime, they have a problem. I think everyone that interacts with LE should be respectful.
So you actually do believe the police rounded up and arrested 100% of the rioters.  400 arrests means only 400 were involved.  If they weren't arrested, they didn't take part in the riot.  Am I alone in understanding how incredibly unrealistic that is?  I don't believe Trump commented on the incident last month in Fresno when a Muslim black man shot and killed three random white guys on the street because he dislikes white people.  I guess that means Trump condones racist black on white violence.  Did you express outrage over that too?
"Half black, which also means he is half white as well." How original.
Democrats have given millions of US jobs to illegal aliens and are now importing thousands of young Syrian Muslim males who, under Sharia law, treat women like dogs, believe homosexuality is punishable by death, and that all "infidels" must convert to Islam or die.  If illegal immigrants can find work so easily in America, why can't young black males?  Maybe Paul Scott knows.  Why would any woman, black or LGBT vote for a Democrat?  Along with the Kennedy brothers, Bill Clinton is among the biggest womanizers in American history.
A few loud-mouthed protesters trying to disrupt and intimidate local politicians will be seen exactly as that and nothing more if Trump turns the U.S. economy around. People got tired of stupid, self-serving protests like the 'Black Bloc', 'occupy or idle no more' or 'only black lives matter'.  My bet is that locals get so peeved at loud driveling liberals at these townhalls that they eventually bring in their local police to force them to be civil or keep them out.
Do you consider every "Black Lives Matter" supporter responsible for the death of each cop assassinated by OTHER BLM supporters?  Probably not.  Was this a "White Supremacist Rally"?  ABSOLUTELY not.   This "Rally" was organized to protest the removal of certain southern heritage monuments in the city.   Did some "White Supremacist" groups show up? Certainly. Did ANTIFA and all the other left-wing "anti-protestors" show up specifically to provoke violence and antagonize citizens who were lawfully trying to assemble and exercise THEIR First Amendment Right?   You're darn right they did.  This man wasn't responsible for the violence that occurred any more than the founder of BLM is responsible.   ONE individual made a choice and committed a crime for which he will certainly pay for the rest of his life.  Blaming the ENTIRE right-wing for causing this is hypocrisy at its finest. It takes "two to tango" and if the left-wing antagonizers had left well enough alone, this would be a non-story
Blame the fat failure in the WH. Supposedly we are in Afghanistan to hep and encourage young women escape the heavy hand of the Taliban that holds women down and insists they NOT go to school. Supposedly we are there to help and encourage. Then the fat orange terd does this? WTH are we doing as a nation? No wonder the whole world is laughing at us and shaking their heads in amazement at how stupid and ignorant we are as a country. Trump is taking this nation into the twitter/sh!tter and we are, thanks to the obese orange sexist racist clown, the USA is circlin' the drain. And all his trumpanzee supporters are simply too ignorant and hell-bent on some sort of revenge against the black president to see clearly...color-blinded by our national pastime -- racism!
Congrats on being yet another person to change the narrative and blaming black people for cops mistreating them. Every race of people has criminals yet tons of evidence has shown that whites get treated way better by police when doing the same types of crimes. You're just another person blinded to the truth.
Gigi, I think you and I arguing from the same side of the fence but with different perception at hand. Sad point is, FDR and his racist policies did a lot to imposed Jim Crow into the military. One person who stood against that, was General George C. Marshall. It was his influence that allowed minorities to gained into the military. His influence ended the stupid FDR cronies' belief that blacks can't handled the cold weather and stupid crap like that.  In our nation's history, blacks had to proved their worth each and every time. From the Revolutionary War to the Civil War, Indian Wars to World War I, blacks have proven their worth but forgotten once the conflict was over.
So what you're saying is, white peoples also have EBT and MediCaid??? I think you're right, Trumpers thought it was a black and latino thing...#MAGA
What a load of Crap ! One does not have to belong to the ruling Party, to speak to other Governments, or be sympathetic towards certain people on the African Continent, HE IS AFRICAN ! As for Whites looking down on Black Governments ? the present Circus in South Africa today is a case in point. OUR Politics are separated by many hundreds of years from those of Blacks, Blacks do not understand Politics, to them it's like Tribalism, a feeding frenzy on it's "Colonial" wealth, different type than their white counter parts. All these African Countries completely fell apart upon the departure of the whites who brought much Knowledge and development to the Whole Continent. Most Africans hate "Colonialism" but ALL want and LIVE with ALL it's benefits, all things modern was brought by the "Colonialists" and Africa is living it ,whether they  want to admit  it or not. African arrogance knows no bounds, they ALL so want to be all things white, but cannot, therefore the hate !
What the report does not  include  is the day to day, on the streets  real time and real ife experiences all police officers face as they do their jobs. They are taught by the people they deal with. who to trust and who not to.  These black Democrat politicians  want officers to be a naifs, learning nothing from life, seeing  only the good  in the people who would gladly kill them for breathing.
Well, there's a mindset, a behavioral set, to even want to be like you.  Some of those behaviors are:  Bully, Attention Craver, Liar.  Serve your own interests.  Funny how hypocrites like you tell everyone "not all Muslims are bad" and "not all blacks are bad" because of the behavior of a few that dont meet your standards yet here you are generalizing about all law enforcement.  You deserve to be slapped. Stop gobbling up the garbage that the media keeps piling on your plate.
He's only doing what everyone else is doing (painting with a broad brush). Get out your Venn diagrams and see how much overlapping you can find. First, identify the super relevant groups: Blacks, felons, sex offenders, those convicted of domestic violence (scary lingo alert), homeless, druggies, potheads, methheads, liberals, air breathers. . .
Of course Trump blames the black guy.  Hurricane Maria was the fault of Puerto Ricans.  The Jews caused Nazis.   Blacks force themselves to be abused by the cops.
Why do blacks riot when a black cop shoots a black suspect/perp, but whites don't riot, even if a white suspect/perp is shot by a black cop?
The baker discriminated against the gay couple. That is a fact, the baker's lawyers agree that he discriminated against the gay people. You are arguing that the baker should be allowed to discriminate. If the baker is successful he could then fprefuse to serve black people and claim it would be against his religion to do so. A pharmacist could refuse to serve the elderly because of his religious beliefs.   Are you,still saying that the baker did not discriminate? lol
We are certainly not more racist than in the 1950s and 1960s. Race violence in the U.S. has mostly to do with police racial prejudice. Contrary to Margaret, the police are more racist than average.  Covert racism is not really to do with private attitudes but collective perception. For example, most toxic waste dumps in the U.S. are close to black and Hispanic neighbourhoods because it's assumed blacks and Hispanics either won't know it's there or won't care.
What about an open letter to the double the number of blacks and Hispanic Christians who voted for Trump?  This article is trying to double down on the false idea that it was the mad white men who put Trump into office.  In that sense this article is racist, because it fails to factor in the actual voting patterns among ALL Christians.
gs - is totally wrong.  action speaks louder than words.  trump has always been a racist.  his father and himself are known to deny rentals to blacks in the apartment rentals they owned.  trump has been reluctant to reject the KKK, white supremacists and neo-Nazi who supported him during the campaign.  in the charlotsville fiasco, he refused to condemn the neo-nazis and kkk until he was forced to.  he also stated that they were good people - these folks are never good people.  hence, trump is a known white supremacist, his actions clearly shows this.  in the campaign he promised to help the blacks in inner cities with jobs, housing and better schools.  to date nothing has been done.  it was only rhetoric (lies).  it is quizzical that a minority like you would defend him as he really does not like you too.  if he had to choose between you and a white guy, he would choose the white guy 100% of the time.
Lovely stuff! Please don't think though that Bell Pottinger will not live on. They will. As will Victoria Geogehen with her dark hole where her soul should be.  Andile, the Gupta dog, is threatening to take Rupert farm/s. The campaign about white people being trash and just stealing everything from black people (only black people as they deny that the Coloured and Indian people have any rights) is being stepped up on social media. So anyone who thinks they can rest safely now is sorely mistaken.  The Gupta's, the thief called Zuma and the robot that is Geogehen, are still at work, they won't stop until they die or are put away somewhere dark and mouldy forever.  Why? Because the money. Always follow the money trail. Methinks South Africa is small fry compared to what this bunch of terrorists did to other sovereign countries. We cannot stop now. We have to get that woman to reveal all, and from there, to The Hague.
Who said she's privilege because she's black, the KKK?
If their Facebook profile pictures are to be believed, none of the perps in this case are black or African-American. You may be thinking of the BJ's Super Bowl shooter.
And how are they free market if they have an umbilical cord back to government? And how are they white capitalists if they are run by ANC cadres, most of whom are black and incompetent?
Asian countries for Asians.  Black countries for Blacks.  but White countries for everybody?  That's genocide.  Anti-racist is a codeword for Anti-White
Affirmative Action hurts Asians the most, followed by Whites. If college admissions were completely race blind, it has been estimated that Asian enrollment would increase 5x, White enrollment would increase slightly, and there would be almost no blacks, hispanics or indigenous people.
For black kids I heard the number one cause of death is from firearms. Different realities on this issue for different folks.
Danepol  "black politicians"  Please, it is really really important that south africans don't dress this (gupta, zuma, zwane, buthelezi, sabce, saa, etc) in race terms.    We do that we are stuffed back in the 70's and 80's  The Guptas are Indians are crooks so all Indians are bad?   No.   Think of Pravin Most of the Zuma clan is corrupt so all blacks are bad?  No.   Think of Madonsella  What would your reaction be if you overheard four coloured folk in Mitchell Plain discussing this mess and one chirps that all white afrikaners are slimey sleaze pond scum traitors - based on Gert van der Merwe (gupta lawyer) and Pieter van der Merwe (ceo of their metal conduit and money laundering biz)  Most politicians are crooks regardless of race, it is the nature of the beast, let's not make this about blacks being crooks
The idiot owners have really shot themselves in the foot. Goodell will make a real mess of this pandering to the anti American left. Btw, few want to see millionaires playing the victim and ignorantly  disparaging the country that gave them their wonderful opportunities. Since Obama endorsed  BLM,  black on black murders are up 20%. Why? Police  would rather stay out of communities that need them the most for fear of lawsuits or media vilification. This is an inconvenient truth the nightly news seems to have overlooked.
Good luck raising money, when I last checked the fundraising money's of both the Democrats and the Republicans; Republican party doubled the amount of the other party since Trump has taken office.  Maybe Republicans are busy working and paying taxes, while the other party has nothing better to do but protest violently.  Arizona had the AntiFa guys at the end throwing smoke bombs and things at the cops and even a few were arrested.  Of course there's no reports of that in the SA or associated press.  The media likes to laugh at the ESPN amd Robert Lee, but IMO its in response to the media to not hurt them and the snowflakes.  Media liles to say Trump is racist, but his ex GF of 2 years was black.  Even heard her say if she felt Trump was one bit racist, she would never have thought about dating him.  But of course media says he's racist, so he must be huh?
It's perfectly in order to fret about KPMG. But not at the expense of removing attention from the black politicians who grunted, slurped and gleefully swallowed the swill offered by their new masters from India.
This time the (reverse) racists have gone too far....a black politician attacking a white president because he made a condolence phone call to a black family. Shameful politicizing. And stupid hats (Ms Wilson's trademark)
You are welcome to join the 21st century. I'm quite sure, we black folks know our history better than you. We know who the murderers were. That is why we know most of the racists in the in the 21st century endorse Trump. That makes the Republicans in the 21st century a white identity party. Don't take my word for it. Check out the Storm Front website. Klansman, David Duke, is on record endorsing Trump. The only thing the GOP has for black folks are police bullets. At least the Democrats will let us vote. The GOP is doing everything they can to prevent black folks from voting. The Democrats are just the lesser of 2 evils.
Trump couldn't believe a Black man became president. So he ran and is failing every test so far. I'm the only Alaska Native with a Pulitzer Prize medallion on my desk. Of course you will refuse to believe me because I'm Native. Doesn't change a thing.
For me it is about slavery.  If Deady, Jefferson, Washington, Madison, had been revealed to be part of a child sex ring, their names would be off all public buildings in a heartbeat. We all see child sex abuse as an evil. But slavery seems to be placed in a different category...not so bad a deviation. So we seem to be saying that because a person's skin is black, the evil done to them is not the worst thing that can happen.  Culture is about community belief and norms. The community of then Oregon was about racism so that was what a child knew and became. When a child learns of the racism of those held to such high esteem that they have buildings named on them, that child, at least to some extent, thinks slavery just wasn't that bad.  Well, I don't get a vote, but if I did, I would vote to take the names of all slave holders off public buildings, and those who belonged to the Klan or other racist organization, would have the same punishment. Call it reparations. Hugh Massengill, Eugene
If this person was native or black and this was a mostly White community people would be losing their minds right about now.
Lefties are hilarious. You yap about democracy, yet when you lose - you go thug. Let's summarize a few things..  1. Trump is the enemy of Jews. Obama and Kerry throw Israel under a bus yesterday  2. Trump is a racist. White people can't apply for jobs in Obama's administration. White Middle class America under Obama's is destroyed and working class families lose for the sake of gang drug dealers and Black LIves Matter terrorists.  3. Obama is the defender of the West. Turkey announces it has proof Obama is funding ISIS.  4. Trump's man Steve Bannon hates Jews. Israels applauds his selection in Trump administration.  Now we have Obama trying to hurt Russia for hacks that came from inside the US infrastructure from honest Americans patriots who wanted the world to see the scumbag Clinton machine for what it was. The most corrupt Oligarch machine.  Thanks God Trump won.  The left after losing are outed for what they are Totalitarian thugs
Statistics are very clear, the more blacks the more problems....Don't believe me check statistics yourself...
What a load of revisionist nonsense.  "Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. " - Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, March 21, 1861  Care to tell me again about how the war wasn't about slavery? Not mentioned for two years? History proves otherwise. The confederacy was always, has always and will always be about white supremacy. Grant should have executed every confederate soldier as the traitors they were, then we wouldn't have to put up with this garbage about "honoring our heritage" from their still racist descendants a century and a half later.
<Some are good people who were duped.> If they were duped it's because they willfully choose to confine their "news" to Fox, Limbaugh, Drudge, et al. No sympathy there from me.  <some are afraid of a world changing faster than they can make sense of and some just don't know what to do with their discontent.> Cry me a river! If that's their pitiful excuse for voting for the P*ssy Grabber-in-Chief, that's not nearly good enough. Try again.  Finally, I think we already understand Red State voters who voted against their own economic interests well enough. Many, if not most, were guided by Fox News' methodical twenty-year demonization of Hillary Clinton, many of them truly do hate blacks, gays, Mexicans, and Muslims, and will never ever vote for a Democrat because of that and because they think Republicans affirm their various phobias and hatreds.   When you can figure out a way to circumvent that mindset by all means let the rest of us know. Then we'll be on to something.
Who am I gonna believe?  You or my lying eyes?   Do people who think this comment is racist not see that at a miniumum, Ozell is terribly guilty of leading the four black girls down a very very nasty path, too.  Unless they were chosen to hold the victim down because they were already familiar with that path.
She sounds like an idiot. The majority of crimes committed in the country are from Blacks and Hispanics. Black on Black crime is the worst, yet the Left and the media won't admit to that. Did your savior Obama do anything about the killings in Chicago? Did he do anything for eight years about the poverty in the inner cities? No he didn't - because he didn't care. When the Left won't take responsibility for their actions, or lack of - they call everyone else racist.
What a load of crap ! get over it already. You still don't have a clue - - - -  heard a story, shame. create your own wealth through Black Monopoly Capital, and less corruption from your fat cat Politicians who are stealing your future, but you so blinded by your own prejudices, that you cant see the wood for the trees !!! There ARE NO MORE  whites left for your pathetic story. There are now MORE black millionaires than white one's in South Africa. Go do your homework and stop playing the victim, you are one of the PRIVILEGED BLACKS AND HAVE NO idea what you talking about. !!!
The first white person ever executed for killing a black person in Florida?  Seriously?
I think it's just this kind of arrogance and disrespect for your anthem and country that will actually escalate the beating up of black people by patriotic, arrogant cops!!
If Obama, a black man, a Latino American or a Muslim group declared Donald Trump winning the presidency ONLY because he was a WHITE MAN and he had little else going for him except THAT (insinuating he was a WHITE MAN) you would be condemning all as racist.  . Above you clearly state  "On the premise that he was a black man. He had very little going for him than that" (insinuating his color or being a black man). . Earlier Gene Miller writes "His genetic color is only "relevant" to a racist."  . Your statement clearly is based on his genetic color and his color being relevant to his winning the election.  . Gene Millers words, Nor do I "insinuate" that Obama is a black man.  Gene states, He had very little going for him than "THAT", what does "THAT" mean?   You continue to prove my point.   Are you a racist? In your words, YES.
My word, so "sleeping with a white woman" (by marrying one) would automatically discredit a black politician? Gee whiz, how about Tokyo Sequale and many others?
How about back when black/hispanics used to live on MLK Blvd. instead of California transplants and yuppie hipsters alongside their organic food grocery chains and microbreweries?  I don't see this gentrification stuff going away.  Pretty soon, all the young white people of the next generation will be making similar claims about the good old days when Portland was "weird" instead of the semi-Oakland/semi-SF situation we'll have in 10-20 years.  People in Portland are so clueless sometimes to the things that don't happen to them.
I learned long ago that insisting upon, asking for an apology is a complete and total waste of time. It changes nothing and, the one to whom the request is made laughs at the petitioner. This carpetbagger is just like the white cops who beat on black human beings, they ENJOY it and, when asked for an apology, they laugh. Do not attempt to assign human feelings to them as, they are a life form or two below us.
Do you believe black people are more violent than white people?
And in your exploration, did you find any monument or sign that spoke only of "whites"? That only whites were involved in building this highway. Or was it that they didn't even mention the skin color at all. Or are you asking that blacks deserves a special monument every ten miles or so? Your perception promote racism by separation races. No where is there just whites or blacks, they all contributed to the building of the highway. Why should any color get special honors??  I am well read on the Navajo Code Talkers. They provided valuable service in disguising commands over the open air waves. That stupid movie with Nicholas Cage really demeaned their contribution.
Vidio shows rioters chanting " black power.. Black power"... Let the free shopping begin... These lowlife second class slum rats Belong in a cage.... - Prison.
My grandparents were killed by the Nazis. I say that they represent pure evil. The KKK would like to bring back lynching of blacks, such as my beautiful daughter-in-law and her equally beautiful children. This is also pure evil.  There is no common ground with such monsters.
I haven't seen any beheadings, burnings or drowinings lately by Christian groups. Please link me to them. BTW, did you know that President Andrew Jackson was the first Progressive president (Democrat) that was the beginning of the KKK? Even Democratic Senator Strom Thurmond belonged to the KKK!!!! The Democrat Party used the KKK as its militant arm to "put down" blacks in the South.
Then people will be able to not serve blacks and chalk it up to religion.
oh yea? guess what black, we need more somalis to come here and shake things up. i am all for it.
The classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug was alw”ays bogus with no scientific justification.  Marijuana criminalization was a racist act. Harry Anslinger, Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics stated:  “There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.” “Reefer makes darkies think they’re as good as white men.
The Jones Act was immediately lifted to help Texas and Florida. It took the nation two weeks of shaming Trump before he acted to help Puerto Rico. He spent that time making lame and nonsensical excuses for why he couldn't lift the ban. In other news: Trump continues to shore up his racist base by dropping more racial dog whistles. Now he says NFL owners are 'afraid' of their black players. Yep, the plantation is under threat by the uppitys all over again. Trump is a racist. And a traitor.
Bill should move to Africa. Nobody there gives a hoot about "sexual misconduct". Look at  president Zuma of South Africa: Dozens of affairs and the blacks there applaud him.
Someone who calls an entire group of people "blacks." Smh.
So little vision shown here.  It's not even ultimately about the flag or the national anthem.  It's about a cultural rift, largely along racial lines, about whether America's white population is fundamentally decent. The kneelers say no, America's fundamentally racist.  Listen to Kaepernick: “America refuses to address the pervasive evil of white cops killing black men, and I will not stand during a national anthem that honors the flag of such a country!”  This is how the left sees America.  "The flag of such a country," indeed.  Those words should be ringing in the ears of every American.
It's all part of that damn "global conspiracy".......watch out for those black helicopters...they're coming for you!!!
And the vast majority of those shooting the black kids are other black kids. How are facts a different reality for different people?
I live and work in Atlanta, we have "Black Flight".  I have co-workers and neighbors who have moved to my neighborhood to get away from urban decay, and fewer young black men on the streets.  I have also met folks who have moved to Atlanta to get away from Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago, because of dysfunctional neighborhoods.  But they really do not want to talk about it in terms of policing, what many Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics will do is just say "Hey I am not like those lowlifes, getting out of here".
What B.S.  The laws putting more blacks in jail, signed by Clinton was because of crack cocaine.
Remember "An outspoken member of Black Lives Matter Toronto is being sued after leaving her job with U of T’s student union with a $277,508 severance deal that included 1,975 hours of overtime.  The union wants former executive director Sandra “Sandy” Hudson and her co-defendants — who allegedly approved the package — to jointly pay it back, along with another $200,000 in damages for breach of fiduciary duty."  Whether they win or lose the law suit it would appear that they engage in questionable methods such as Blackmail in stopping last year's parade and rigging executive committee votes at the U of T student's union executive committee meeting. Pride are the big losers if they think they will be treated with fairness by this group of bullies.
The bad n word is wrong but so is 'black' and "African American' . In the old days any mixed **'s would be called the good n word and that is wrong too, because the good n word is the proper racial description only for unmixed **'s . Nowadays the good n word which ends on 'o' would be the proper word , but fools forbade its use.
White people suck.. Black people suck.. Yellow people suck.. Brown people suck.. Humans in general suck... Rant over thank you...
Compassion for your fellow man and being a real sucker for some sob story are two different things.   The welfare state has done to black Americans what slavery couldn't do, what Jim Crow couldn't do, what the harshest racism couldn't do. And that is to destroy the black family. (African-American professor, Walter Williams, in an interview in The Wall Street Journal, 1/22/11)  You are seriously mistaken if you think creating an entire generation that it is okay to live off the work of others. There is huge difference between compassion and enabling bad behavior.
It's funny how black people are "activists" but white people are 'supremacists,' 'neo-Nazis,' or racist.
So LGBT people are "dogs?" What about  fornicators ,  adulterers, or clergy that buy an anniversary cake or want a photographer at their church event - how does the business know that they're  doing business with an apologist for child sex abuse and trafficking?  Also, as far as even Catholicism is concerned, even in Latin America as in the United States, the Church was segregated ; in the former, special chapels were built for Black slaves. All this so called "religious objections " to serving LGBT people is a smokescreen and a slippery slope down the road to making it legal in the name of "religion " to refuse to do business with non White people hence, a return to Apartheid.  If you don't wish to serve the public, then cease being a business  owner that does just that.   Although I don't doubt that a return to Apartheid in America is what Trump supporters want.
These black players have the flag to thank for the life they have. What a f'in disgrace you are. I will not watch another sport event of any kind again. Any event!  People died in wars for your privilege yo sacks of crap F you!
You don't seem to be looking beyond your life experience. I served the public in Oregon for more than 30 years. I know more about white people than you. The lies told about white people by white people don't effect my judgement. I deal with facts. You want to ignore the role of whiteness in this country because it gives you rights the rest of us don't get, like being considered innocent until proven guilty. Black folks can be shot dead in the street by white cops for merely being suspected of having a gun. White men can get away with arguing with a cop while having an AR-15 slung over his shoulder. The Bundy family comes to mind. That family would be dead today if they were black and threatening government employees with guns.
Black Supremacist.
Whites never learn....you're making enemies with the world - Blacks (lives matter/cops killing innocent blacks), Browns (destroying entire region and creating chaos), Slav Russians (yeah, anglos dont really consider them part of their own, so...), Yellow (sending the navy as potential "PREEMPTIVE" strike; not allow China to take uninhabited atols, when white STOLE and KILLED other of their land). Whites should enslave all blacks in America or send them back to Africa (on the way throw them oveboard), Nuke the crap out of Middel East and keep their Oil. Nuke the Crap out of Yellow peril so you can not only have the Pacific Ocean as your backyard, you can have the Yellowman's backyard as well!
Perhaps you need to back off the caffeine. I think you are making a huge jump there with your "fact". As I recall yes, Trump was prosecuted for not renting to blacks many years ago. How do you explain the multitude of minorities he has hired in his businesses? By your logic he should have only hired blond white people. To say someone is a Nazi Racist for supporting the President is also a big stretch. Support that one
You just don't understand the situation.  When the shooter is white, the shooter is a "lone wolf" and we must all wring our hands at the impossibility of stopping such incidents.  It is *only* when the shooter is black or brown that they are properly called "terrorists" and we must then gratefully accede to low-rent authoritarianism.
Actually, he was half black. Obviously it was the white half that got him elected (/sarc)
If this guy was black he would have been shot.
His friend was on tv claiming this guy was only arrested because he's black. Really? We don't want criminals coming to our state, no matter what color they are. And we don't want to hear any "because he's black" crap.
I find it telling, Richard, that you describe black Americans as "thugs","refusing to listen to reason or facts",  "stealing and burning", and I find it strange that you imply they're "not average Americans". That's the sort of language I'd expect sixty years ago, not something I read in 2016.  I am also confused as to how you assign blame to Obama--as the leaders of our country, were either Eisenhower or JFK responsible for how white people lynched blacks during Jim Crow in Alabama? Or is it only black people who are uniformly influenced by the president's behavior?   I finally find it unsettling that you're more angry about property damage and peaceability than you are about the extrajudicial killings of Americans of color.
Another white dude stealing the black man's thunder.....
Yeah, those "poor millionaire football players," in street clothes and out of their team uniforms, can be shot dead by power-mad fear, simply walking down the street or reaching for their wallets. Both of those things have occurred within the last year. The players are sick of this...I don't blame them. They're being killed by white cops, not black ones? I wonder how one of those trigger-happy cops would feel to find out they'd shot one of those "poor millionaire football players?"
Yes but blacks are only 17% of the population... And commit more violent crimes then whites who are about 65% of the population.
This sounds like a capitulation to the anti-police bigots. Accomplishes nothing other than to satisfy black bigotry.  Police need to quit appeasing the overt hatred of their ranks, and start showing some backbone. Next time blacks engage in a shoot-up in one of their communities or gays complain that they are being punched out at some event,  go for coffee. Better yet, phone in sick.
A caucus is a gathering of persons with similar interests. The Congressional Black Caucus was formed to decide what those mutual interests are and how they can be achieved. It is for the advancement of neglected black American interests, and not for opposition to the interests of any race, so it is not racist. Also, the CBC is open to Republicans, and in the 115th House one black Republican (out of three), Mia Love of Utah, has joined the CBC. The two current black Senators, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, both Democrats, joined the CBC. The CBC has 45 members currently with only two Republicans declining to join.  You often say that the Democratic Party is racist, the party of slavery. That was true 157 years ago but not since passage of the Civil Rights Act, after which all the Dixiecrats joined the Reagan Party. Now only fools call the Democrats "racists". This should be obvious because of the 47 black members of Congress, only three are Republican. People know who their friends are.
Please tell me, please, I beg of you, please tell me what constitutional tool could American citizens use to rid us of this creepy fool.  Sheila Jackson Lee is in the same mindless, absolutely stupid mindset of Maxine Waters and the other clowns in the Black Caucus. These are people that have done nothing through decades of their years in Congress. However, they all do live a lavish lifestyle off the donations intended to elect new young blacks to Congress. Oh, I forgot, all the members of the Black Caucus are under investigation for fraud and mail fraud in reference to those donations. Please give us that tool needed to remove these malcontent pieces of trash from our Government.
Yep, and blacks can seek out another form of public transportation or use Uber.
Strong black women are needed, Stupid loud mouthed ones not so much.
For several years now on the Lars Larson daily Radio show Lars has a gentleman on his show usually once a week  that quotes daily, monthly,  and annual CRIME  statistics, (Rape,Murders, Domestic Violence etc.),  and other statistics  like   food stamp numbers, welfare numbers etc.  He discloses on whites, blacks, latino, mexican whatever races.  Its quite STAGGERING to see the numbers of   Latinos, Mexicans that are incarcerated, or on Food Stamps.   These people are committing the most  VIOLENT CRIMES, and of course,  most are ILLEGAL ALIENS.    They need to be sent back and BUILD THE WALL.   Motley's post below is a good example.    The DRAIN on the states Financial Resources for these folks is HORRIFIC.
Thanks for this. Anyone who thinks for 2 seconds that racism, white supremacy and the oppression of blacks is worse today, or even worsening, needs to grab a mid-19th century history book and read up on Jim Crow and the humiliating & un-American things it did every day to  ten million blacks in the South circa 1948.  Read U.S. Senator Bilbo's "best" quotes, delivered in the Senate or on the stump in Mississippi. Trump's idiot tweeting and clumsy or inadvertent race baiting can't compare to the least bigoted Southern congressmen of that era. It was the Southern Dems in Congress like Bilbo and his ilk who protected Jim Crow from federal spanking for 7 decades while Northern Dems like FDR coddled or ignored Jim Crow's blatant sins to keep the "Solid South's" electoral vote in presidential elections. My 1948 history "30 Days a Black Man" details black lives under America's apartheid in the South.  Rothstein's great "The Color of Law" details how racist govt. policies segregated the North.
I don't believe that Charles Dalton has ever posted that no black person can be successful or ever has been because of white privilege.  If fact I am 98% certain he has not. It seems you have to lie in order to make your dubious point. In fact, I find you more of a racist than Charles, since you yourself have implied that Charles's success was the result of affirmative action, rather than his own talent.
I'm wondering if the interracial chick is letting her man know that her parents are racist? I tell you what, if it was me, I'd like to know. Especially as a black person in America. It's important.  But then again, if she up with mommy and daddy then mommy and daddies bigotry will prevail and there isn't anything she can do but suck it the funk up. Next.
And yet when Trumpty-Dumpty or Rush ("he just LOVES little black Dominican boys!") Limbaugh say unpleasant things about black folks, that's OK because it's "freedom of expression."  Double-standard much?  Oh yeah, and this is what Muhammad 'Ali (rah'matullahi alayhi) said about Frazier after their third fight: "I always bring out the best in the men I fight, but Joe Frazier, I'll tell the world right now, brings out the best in me. I'm gonna tell ya, that's one helluva man, and God bless him."  Funny neither you nor Flowers thought to mention that.
No, the most idiotic suggestion was that which came from BLM to exclude police from the parade, along with the Pride Committee's complicity in agreeing to exclude police in what should be an "inclusive" parade.    I would argue that Pride makes enough money that it should be paying for police security, especially given the organizing committee's insistence that the police should be excluded from the parade.    If Pride Committee organizers desperately need money to pay for police security, maybe they can get funding from some of the homophobic black rappers whom they've chosen to align themselves with.
Just the White Supremacists emboldened by their leader to resurrect the 1930s pogroms of the New Hitler/Der Fuehrer  Trump and his National Security Advisor Herr Bannon.  Start with a small non-christian minority to appease the Fundamentalist Racist Christians following Judaeo-Christian ethics, expand to Islamics and all immigrants while imposing martial law in all Black urban areas.  The 4th Reich in full flower.
"Sessions talked Tuesday of improving morale in local police departments, which he maintained had been unfairly maligned, and he notably refused to commit to leaving unchanged consent decrees mandating changes at certain departments."   Still the same old "let the police run wild" ( as long as white people arent killed) racist jerk who was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 because he referred to a black colleague as "boy," used the N word freely and "joked" about liking the KKK until he heard they liked marihuana. Same Sessions who blocked black judges from nomination and sitting on the bench when he headed the judiciary committee.  It just gets worse and worse.
I notice some Muslims, Hispanics, and Blacks are claiming the the media, Trump, and Police are slow to call this terrorism, because the shooter is white, and likes guns and country music. On the other hand some white nationalists are calling this Antifa because it targeted at country music lovers. The divide in the country again.
Please allow a black man, a guy who knows what profiling is from the wrong end of a pistol, explain it to you.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwfvRbAK2IM
Bad day for the black race who already have a bad reputation for all kinds of criminality and bad unethical behavior. Scram popo.
They killed my brother. and I believe I see a white person there. So stop with the race bait bullshit. A BLACK person KILLED MY BROTHER.
He's one black conservative liberals love to hate.
Going to prison in the black community is a badge of honor.
Ninjas ????? Another word for black people!? Wtf!???? Hope they catch everyone and I'm thinking let's get the death penalty up here in this great state of Alaska! Or let's get some rope and find a tall branch, enough is enough!
Lee was in charge, he either knew, or was incompetent. Leaders always try to play ignorant when they are accused of war crimes, happens every time. Lee was defending the preservation and expansion of slavery, and multiple generals under his command captured free black americans and enslaved them. Thousands of free black americans were transported south during the campaign, and I will not buy for a second that Lee was innocent.   I also care little that a handful of confederate soldiers might have released a few. They were a tiny minority in an army fighting for the sole purpose of preserving and expanding slavery. Once slavery because less fashionable the south started an enormous revisionist history campaign to paint themselves as victims or noble men defending their homeland. Total garbage.
Racist comment?  Of course not!  Blacks are incapable of being racists!  Maxine, time for you to swim back to Africa!  Now that's not racist... it is simply honest.
Police brutality exists but it is not even close to being the biggest issue facing the black community. Violent Crime, Drugs, Unemployment, Family breakdown, Housing, Education are all much bigger issues, but the media and the political left focuses on police brutality because they have no solutions for the more important issues and they need a boogeyman.
You do, of course, realize that calling a white person a Nazi is as repugnant a statement as calling a black person a N%^er, dont you?  Lemme ask it this way.  Were you offended by the Kathy Griffin\Trump Head photo?  As i suspect you werent, ask yourself what would have been the social reaction to Griffin holding a black mans head in the photo?  There has been a desensitization of hating white people.  Trump is regularly called a Nazi by the media and democratic leaders, hollywoods elite, and nobody is outraged by it.  Now, Trump tells rich black athletes to respect the flag, and all you can focus on is the use of foul language?  The language was disrespectful?  do you see the hypocrisy?  So please, understand, when you call conservatives Nazis, realize that you are using a slur that we find unbelievably objectionable, and racially based.  I dont file you under Antifa.  So dont file us under White Supremacist.
PS: Never know, James...  maybe "separate" commencement was a safety precaution to keep the black students from being run down by a bunch of drunken white frat-boys.  Could happen, and if it did the frat boys would get away with it.
"The GOP can get away with being a whites only party"???  “It is time to end the slavish devotion to the Democrat party. They have insulted us, used us and manipulated us. They have saturated the black community with ridiculous lies: ‘Unless we support the Democrat party, we will be returned to slavery. We will be robbed of voting rights. The Martin Luther King holiday will be repealed.’ They think we’re stupid and these lies will hold us captive while they violate everything we believe as Christians.”  Bishop E.W. Jackson
Im I suffered from East Indian racism in Durban. That made me hate South Africa so much i will never step foot there. Mandela fought for east indians and Afrikaans to run the country because racism is alive and well in S.A yet black south africans will blame other poor Africans for that sh!t. South Africans must love other races calling shots in their country. Shaka is turning in his grave.
Nineteen year old attends ghetto trash party setup using stolen ID and credit card. A party with drugs and alcohol. She staggers down into the lobby hours later and somehow locks herself into a freezer unit in the hotel kitchen. Video clearly shows no one else entered the kitchen until she was found. It is too bad her family didn't show more concern for where she was going and with who before she went missing. Now they and there dirt bag attorneys are hoping to cash in on this tragedy.  Of course had the hotel attempted to prevent a large group of underaged black kids from throwing a party which was in obvious violation of hotel policy the same attorneys would be suing, screaming "racism."
"Where the population is majority latino, black and democrat Mr. Trump has been slow acting,..." Was he slow acting? Houston area and Harris County is heavily Democrat and went for Hillary. When you guys come up with a lie, at least make it a more believable one, not some pathetic race baiting rant.
President Trump has certainly put the 1/3 black president in his place.
Uh, the records tell us that when the police shoot Blacks, the officer doing the shooting is himself Black.  As for what the records tell us about the rate of violent crime in Black America, it's very hard for progressives to deal with, so I won't offend their tender sensibilities by citing the numbers.   Let's just celebrate this movie, and perhaps organize a vigil with scented candles and colorful ribbons.
I'm guessing President of the United States didn't come up because the last one was black and the current one appears to be orange.
And for his base which hates anyone governing while black.
Clinton IS nothing but a bigot.    She doesn't give a carp about anyone or any race but herself............You want to talk white privilege and white bigotry...........SHE's IT.   Raised in a rich family in ARKANSAS , never wanting financially, never rubbing shoulders with the rabble like us working people, never rubbing shoulders with Mexicans or blacks only hiring them as servants...........Trump is right,  Clinton is a bigot.
Blacks had a legitimate beef, and were way too nice about it. What's the beef inherent with white nationalists? Is it that they are required to sit in the back of the bus? Are they slaves? What exactly is their beef? Is it that they are not allowed to own blacks as slaves? Okay.
There's been ugly women through out history - but Clinton is not only ugly through and through down to the bone - she has a vile hideous personality that's like acid to those who have to watch, listen and deal with her.  What is so disgusting - is that she feels so entitled, owed, and expects the world to kowtow, genuflect and kiss her ass because she's Hillary Clinton... while she demonstrates a penchant for a complete lack of respect for human life, the  willingness to break federal laws of the USA and the world, she's a thief and a shyster, an Electon fraudster and will rig and buy votes if not outright black-mail or kill individuals that stand in her way. What she is really owed is a federal prison orange jump suit with a date scheduled to face a Firing Squad.
a little off topic but....  Black lives matter should spend some time in areas of chicago (where police officers will not go), count the bodies, then protest after dark.  Do you really think israel needs another muslim country on its border?
you can be ejected for wearing the wrong clothes dumbass! they kickout people just for wearing bandanas! that is how black culture has affected the fair. can't no one enjoy it without worrying some black thugs gona showup and start some stupid crap that winds up sending innocent victims to the ER. thanks RAP!
In 1968, the evening news was showing, in the southern states, naked black men lynched from trees for being seen with a white woman, some being set on fire, alive. In 1968, the evening news was showing US soldiers in Vietnam, mostly white, with necklaces of 'slope' human ears and fingers, and tobacco bags made of 'Charlie' human scrotums.  In 1968, you would see Huntley and Brinkley on the evening news, curls of cigarette smoke to the side or in the background. In this 2nd decade of the 21st European religious century, there is a tendency to white-wash the past, for emo-cringe reasons. In Hawaii, with the overthrow of the Kingdom in 1893 and the following annexation in 1898, the Hawaiian language was entirely banned from schools and government, and discouraged elsewhere. The Native Hawaiian culture was squashed because it was a "terrorist threat" to the Religious Republic of Hawaii. The ban of the Native Hawaiian language and culture in schools and government wasn't lifted until 1978.
That's just ridiculous!!! Just because of this political correctness BS I'm dressing up as KKK. One of my kids is going to be a white cop chasing my other kid which will be a black criminal. He will be pretending to shoot at the criminal. My other kid will be a Muslim terrorist. Why you ask. Cause I'm sick of walking on eggshells trying not to offend crybaby libtards.
Our good American president, loves America, and stands for America's flag and anthem.  These millionaire black athletes are too ignorant to understand that.  They must be told, the Bronco's, Elway and Co., were very wrong, supporting their nonsense.  They are On The Job, in uniform, representing our city, our team, not some imagined nonsense about the good police in our country.    I'm out, won't watch, purchase or even talk about the nfl until they ALL give heart felt, honest APOLOGY TO ALL OF US WHO LOVE AMERICA.
I see a lot of white people here complaining they can't wear racist costumes. Oh you poor precious people. I'm so sorry for you it's not acceptable to dress up and mock other cultures and races. Oh but that's your right! Or at least it used to be! What a dreadful world we live in now! How is little Chad and Becky going to have any fun if they can't do black face or dress up as an Indian, a group of people who have had to endure and survive a great genocide? Who have had everything taken away from them, culture, Life. And now you want to dress up as some white wash racist version of them for fun? Oh you poor whites! /s Seriously people get used to it. Race and culture are not costumes for your consumption and enjoyment. And yes this line of thinking is going do die with all the old racist white people, and I for one with my beautiful multiracial family cannot wait.
Huh.    http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/falcon-heights-shooting_us_577dd795e4b0c590f7e8058f  Here you go Username.   The latest death of an African American.   LA.

Idiots don't look around very far for their information, unsurprisingly. It was various assorted left-wing nutcases on Twitter and Facebook who accused Trump of manufacturing the hurricane to kill black people. WND is a crappy source generally, but they have assembled a very nice collection of the insane idiocy here: http://mobile.wnd.com/2017/09/racist-trump-accused-of-creating-hurricanes-to-kill-blacks-hispanics/.  And of course let's not forget noted climatologist and theologian Jennifer Lawrence's insightful comments.
White inbreeds?  Are you a member of Rev. Wrights church in Chicago. Or a brown or black, Cool, Cluck, Clan movement?  BLM?
What the heck is "White Swiss monopoly capital" Is that your new phenomena to steal the mind of black people from real issues.
You are always so very quick to bash Americans. Yet "racist" Americans elected a black president twice. Also, a woman came within a hair strand of winning and the only reason she lost is because she was her own worst enemy. Canada? Want to tell me all about the minority leaders and women Prime Ministers our "morally superior" country has elected? Im waiting.........
How did Obama get elected twice, with the same voting pool as today's?  Still don't understand?  Obama was elected twice.   Voters in the rust belt states voted for him, and this is how be was elected twice.  Obama is a Black American.   He was elected twice.  THOSE voters likely voted for Trump.  How do I know this?  Because Trump won the election.  But weren't those voters racists, bigots, basket of deplorable types?  Well, they voted for Obama, twice.    Obama is Black.  Do you understand now?
"Why on earth do you think that BLM doesn't mind black on black crime?"  Because they have not mentioned it. Ever.  Of course, they probably were so busy chanting about wanting to kill cops that they just lost track of time.
all the black players on the team should not stand, so the team would have to forfeit their games.  jones is trying to support trump but he is making a big mistake.
Notice how the article only compares blacks to whites and leaves out other major racial/ethnic groups like Hispanics and Asians?   https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/racial-gender-wage-gap-persists-asian-american-men-top-average-n602076 "White men earn a median $21 an hour, making more money than women across all races, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. They also earn more than black and Hispanic men, who make a respective $15 and $14 median hourly wage. The only group that out-earns white men is Asian men, who earn $24, according to the report."  If there are factors such as "discrimination" as the article states, then why do Asian men earn more than white men? Could it be that Asian men work harder, value education and family more than white and black men and that discrimination doesn't have a GD thing to do with it? This article is a great example of how the leftist media tries to misinform the public in order to push its agenda.
Any thoughts about the number of black on black killings??  Or black on white attacks??  Or the huge number of Hispanic gangs, most illegal alien felons, that run huge areas of LA, Oakland??  How about the number of honor killings in this country?? Any thoughts on the liberal run cities like Chicago, Detroit, DC, etc. No!!  Why??  Because they are all liberal run cities, many for the past 50+ years, and liberals are no going to say a word to challenge minorities to get their act together-FACT!!  What about these parents??  Or do you what to blame that on the CBF, Repubs, G. Bush, or G. Washington!!  Dishonest, lazy and clueless liberals.
Because there is no history of black people enslaving white people in this country, subsequently dehumanizing them, denying them basic rights, and using whiteface as apart of that to caricature and stereotype them. History, learn it.
Ms. Hill's agenda is obviously racially motivated, referring to the president as a "white supremacist", and calling on all the "black and brown" folks to boycott the Cowboys. Are there no white, red, or you name it colors who deserve to join the boycott? ESPN has dug its own grave by hiring and letting loose the results of the so called "higher education" journalism graduates. These talking heads were taught that in order to be successful, and stand apart, they must make a name for themselves. These days, that means being political, and what better way to perpetuate their notoriety, correct or not, than to propagate their personal version of unfair race relations.
You should be ashamed for being a racist loser. Do you hate black people too or just the brown ones you want to tell how to live the lives cause you're Nazi scum?
my god I have just become a TRUMP supporter. I have become more tolerant the older I become . I am 62 and am very proud of the way we have become more inclusive in our societies values.  Then I read this S__t and I become disgusted and more Trumpish.  Scr_w you Black lives don't matter no more to me.  The LBGTQ community should distance itself from such disgusting,self serving people. I will no longer support any group or agency that is connected to this organization and will not support taxes that are given to those thatsupport this lifestyle.  The LBGTQ community needs to stand up to such destructive attention seeking twits.
Good questions. I only stated that the registration of Muslims, not necessarily an injustice in itself, seems reasonable if high rates of crime, of a particular nature,  can be identified with a particular group of people.  Hypothetical references to whites and blacks do not defeat the above statement.   Now that I think about it, the fact of the matter is that Black violence in America does exceed the violence committed by Muslims in this country. But if we knew that their was a particular widespread segment of the Black population  advancing a particular ideology through violence, the society would not hesitate to cast some sort of  blanket over Blacks in general as a means to combat the violence. Would this be wrong?  It all comes down to the actual or potential violence that the society is responding to. Violence can rip a country apart and destroy the very foundations of a society leading to even greater death and destruction. You have to be realistic about these things
"Charles - Obama is half white so is he a recipient of "white privilege"?"  The one drop rule still applies in the 21st century. Obama does not get any white privilege. The Founding Fathers did not want to free their children born by black slaves. That is the beauty of race based slavery, if you are a white man. That is why they created "the one drop rule" in the first place. Don't take my word for it. Just ask a white cop. Most of them support racial profiling. That alone makes equal protection under the law impossible. Of course, you could ask the white racists that support Trump. That includes the KKK and Nazis. They will tell you the same thing. White men are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Black men are always suspect for just being present.
Obama  still has a bit of wave to ride, but had he run in the last election he would have seen that his devious nature, his resentment of historic American society, and his hypocrisy overall were wearing down his numbers . His support base in the USA is largely race based, and everywhere they sent him that last ten days to campaign for Hillary, In Miami, North Carolina, Detroit, Philidelphia and Ohio...SHE LOST. Mexicans and blacks support Obama. It is a shame that politics in the USA came down to race. In France Obama is no here. Many in the world view him as pro muslim, in the extreme. In France he would have no impact whatsoever, even if he said vote for MARIE LE PEN.  She is the leader they need at this time. She will take France out of the EU, for sure.
Would you like the black privilege to be profiled as an angry black man with a gun? You might survive a month. As a white man you can argue with a cop while having an AR-15 slung over your shoulder and live to tell the story. That is a white privilege. BTW, the angry black man idea would only have to be in the mind of a terrified white cop with a license to kill. The police union will say your killing was justified. The cop that kills you will get time off with pay to recover from killing you. Living in an open carry state will not matter at all. Being ignorant is no way to prosper in the 21st century. Start by taking responsibility for your choices and behavior. It looks like you know more about rap music than I do. I'm more of an old school jazz man. Do you have some hidden desires? Do you have "jungle fever"?
the left: asian cop shoots unarmed black man- "i hate white people! kill all cops! pigs in a blanket, fry em like bacon!! no justice!!! Let's destroy the local convenient store!!!" obvious terror attack by an islamic extremist- "ok guys, lets wait for all of the facts to come out before we start pointing fingers. we dont want to spread hate, ok! besides, this attack is nothing compared to the Christian bombing on planned parenthood in the 90's."
Institutional racism? How is that possibly defensible when We have A Black President,  a Black AG, Black Senators, Black Mayors, Black Governors, Black soldiers, Black Generals, Black Doctors, Black Attorneys, Black actors, Black TV Networks, Black... Etc Etc etc. ?!   "What it demonstrates to me is that many white people in the US are still that variety of drooling thugs who would hang any unsuspecting African-American by the neck from a tree if given half a chance."  Now. THAT is Racism! Wow....
In any event, the meaning of kneeling has already been expressed; there's no ambiguity about it.  Said Colin Kaepernick:  “America refuses to address the pervasive evil of white cops killing black men, and I will not stand during a national anthem that honors the flag of such a country!”  "Such a country."  "Such a country."  That privileged little snot, like the ones who knelt at St. Ignatius High,  should thank God they are so privileged to even be in this country.  Their irresponsible comment that they're too good for "such a country" is revolting.
Given the author's logic, the safest places for Whites to live would be Black neighborhoods.  One solution for keeping cops from shooting Blacks would be to withdraw police protection from Black neighborhoods and let Blacks work it out.  "Hodad" echoes some of my other thoughts.
As written before, the anc(another new corruption) is out to prove that they are not fit to govern to everyone especially anc members. There is no logic in this at all, just plain stupidity driven by someone who is dragging the party to destruction and the anc blindly supports him. The anc is not for the people, especially black people,..... look no furtherthan grace Mugabe and the assaulted model. They are not protecting her.... their voter ... but rather the disgraceful Mugabe. The model may lose her ability to model due to scaring. So plainly the anc is their for themselves at the expense of the public!!! Not gonna last!! And then they would have successfully proved to themselves, their members, ordinary SA citizens and the world they are not fit to govern. Good job gweezy!!
We're not talking about your "late wife's uncle".  And, Watts is predominately black not immigrants.  Stick with the topic and you won't sound so stu*pid.  But then again, maybe yiou sound stu*pid because you are stu*pid.
your all negative, we stole their lands, their way of life. The indigenous people of the Arctic and use nature to feed themselves and their families, you ball and protest over one whale, perhaps you should protest more about the Japanese whaling fleet under the guise of science. Want the Japs to stop whaling stop buying their cars, motorbikes, and anything else the Japanese produce. But no your all so fu*king righteous, "Oh I only eat vegetables and so should you", good I am glad for you, but I bet not ONE of you pussies would survive 1 winter with these people, you would shit yourself and die in six months on your veggie diet in the north. How many gallons of Arctic black gold have you put in your polluting car? how many of you use Coal fired electricity. Tell me how many of you sad bastards even know where you come from. YOU ARE THE INTERLOPERS, YOU ARE THE IMIGRANTS AND YOU HAVE STOLEN THEIR LANDS FROM THE INDIGINIOUS PEOPLE OF NORTH AMERICA. SO SHUT THE FU*K UP.
Some People confuse protest on a singular issue as protest against the Nation which is a simplistic response. The protest by Caps and others were against the racism by the white majority against blacks and other minorities. It wasn't a protest against America as a whole. And, more importantly, it was a non-violent protest against what the white cop told the white motorist he pulled over, "Don't worry, we only kill Black people"
The view from the other side, as a white male:  My mother's father was Ukrainian, her last name is constantly mispronounced, everyone gets it wrong. For me, people think I am Chinese because of my first name, and often use my family name as my given name, Chinese people in particular seem to think I am Chinese. My name is actually an old English name that happens to also be a common family name in Chinese. It's annoying, often I just don't correct people, but I don't worry that everyone is a racist out to get me. Jerks come in all shapes, sizes and colours, and from all kinds of different backgrounds, religions and cultures. It's not because you're black, its because they're a jerk.
What percentage of violent crime does that 6% of the population that black males make up commit? Did you factor that in?
I'd like to know where this era of unity was that you're talking about.  Seems to me America's always had a lot of in-fighting.  If it wasn't the blacks it was the Puerto Ricans or the Mexicans or the Chinese or the Italians or the Irish or the ... get the picture?  The only time we "unite" is when we can hate someone else like the Muslims or the Nazis.  We never unite for each other...just to fight someone who we think threatens us.
What an incredible pile of stinking manure. Trump's platform had NOTHING to do with white nationalism. He got basically the same percentage of the white vote that Romney got.  Trump no more promoted white nationalism than Obama promoted black nationalism in 2008 and 2012. Trump based his campaign on economic nationalism, secure borders, reduced regulations, limited government, and lower corporate taxes. Why do people insist on pushing these false narratives? The Democratic Party has not won the white vote in a Presidential election since since 1964. Were Romney, McCain, George W, George H.W. all white ethnic nationalists? They all won the white vote by huge margins as well. Trump is a marketer. His words were market positioning. Banning all Muslims from entering the country was said to differentiate him from Obama who wouldn't even utter the words Islamic terrorist. He later refined it to Muslims from terrorist hotspots. He was campaigning, not setting policy.
What T rump really hates is athletic, handsome, wealthy Black men who dare to speak against injustice. Can't have these uppity black men getting away with that! And then the Pussy Grabber in Chief goes on to criticize changes in the game to try and prevent brain damage. This from a rich boy who got a military deferment for a bone spur on his heel! When you risk your life and health for the team feel free to criticize, Trumpy Dumpy! Otherwise, shut your pie hole!
(a) misleading technicality; (b) put aside Afrikaner for a moment and consider the broader point; (c) (i) such heavily concentrated wealth at the top indicates economic disease, (ii) their race indicates a persistent racial problem; (1) you're defending the bantu education system?; (2) i'm not black; i'm white monopoly capital.   You'd think Afrikaners would do better out of Apartheid than 3 in the top 16 - perhaps they were too busy blaming the English for their lack of will power ... or the Jews... or the Arabs... or is that ignorant and racist?
"Because, for me, it's always been about you," Obama concluded. Is he talking about the criminals he allowed to cross our border? Then he took the American citizens money and gave it to the criminals in cities he allowed to harbor them. He also took Americans money to feed and house the criminals. It has been about supporting the criminals with money he took from working Americans.  Or is he talking about the radical muslim extremists who he refuses to acknowledged? He erased all of the suspected muslim terrorists from our intelligence agencies that they were tracking before 911 so Trump could not have the info. Why would he have done this? Did this help "you" the American Citizen? Or is it the black lives matter criminals who he supports over our brave Law Enforcement officers? For once I have to agree with his comment but the "you" is not the American Citizen. He has proven this over and over again.
Especially in Trump states, but generally in the US as a whole, those receiving Medicaid are 41% white in all states combined, 25% Hispanic, 22% black. 98% of Medicaid recipients are white in Idaho; 93% in West Virginia, 76% white in Kentucky, the state of Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul; and 60% in Minnesota and Nebraska. Whites receive 60% or more of Medicaid in 18 states.  So "them" isn't getting the "welfare", "us", meaning whites, is getting it.  What makes whites into terrorists is the sheer endless number of hate crimes against minorities whether by race, religion or sexual orientation. Except for 9/11, Muslims from our citizens or from abroad commit relatively few terrorist attacks compared to our white citizens. It doesn't help to deny the truth. Hate crimes are terrorism.
I don't care what gender, race, or class you are.  I don't care if the person you murder is of the same gender, race or class as you are.  If you shove an arrow through a living man's ear into his brain (Eugene case) you deserve to die.  In that case, the black defendant got to live by testifying against the white bad guy, even though the black guy was the one who actually shoved the arrow into the victim's brain.    And all just to steal the victim's car so all three of them could commit more bank robberies.    And the black guy had gotten off on a previous murder charge in another State by testifying against the bad guy in that case, too.
Blind allegiance you have, Black.
How did that breakdown happen? Oh yes, 200 years of slavery, disenfranchisement and oppression. In other words, racism. So you’re wrong. And your insinuation that “black” peoples problems are the result of “black” people is simply ignorant.
Sort of like saying not all blacks are bad?   How can you argue? It's true on the face of it.
That's BS, an affectation devised to inflame their racist movement.  When white police kill blacks without good reason, they're almost always  prosecuted. (I said "almost" because I can imagine at least one case where prosecution did not occur.)
He's going to be all on his own as he doesn't fit in with the black, mexican or white general population in the industrial prison complex on the mainland. I'm placing a $1,000 bet the ex-chief is going to be wearing a lot of lipstick when the Mexican Cholos/MS13 gangs call dibs on him and demand he pick up the soap! LOL
Black guy braggin about gettin free stuff ? no way !
cont'd  Now, it may be objected that certain drug statutes -- e.g. crack vs. powder cocaine -- are racist because blacks commit certain kinds of crimes more often that whites.  This is a ridiculous indictement of the system.  The ball is in the individual's hands.  It's ridiculous to cry racism when a black is sent to prison for using crack, when a white man would also be sent to prison for the same offense.  Each of the offenders had the choice whether to commit the crime or not. If blacks who are sent off in droves for PWITD crack don't want to be, they could arrange it so that by this time next year, PWITD crack would be known a "white man's crime."  How?  By simply leaving it to white men to commit that offense.
Correct esp when one looks at Chicago. The blacks have a goal of wiping  each other off the face of the map.  Record killings going on, and its primarily black on black.  No wonder the cops are pulling over the fancy cars.  For every pro black athlete who makes it in the big leagues, there are tens of thousands ending up on the streets with a miserable ending in sight.  A very fine line between unbelievable and undeservable richs, and the grey bar motel and an early death.
I believe people like GBA hate Obama not because he is half-black, but simply because he is a Democrat.
I'm not surprised. Is he even gay? I mean, we have to take his word for it. And does he have a Jewish grandmother, or is that fiction?  He is so full of hate for women, gays, Jews, Muslims, liberals, blacks, and others, that it didn't make sense that he claimed to be gay and part-Jewish. Now, pedophile makes sense.   The alt-Right often confuse pedophilia with homosexuality when they are, in fact, unrelated. Was Milo abused at 13? That would make sense. But then he should be in therapy and not lashing out.  Then again, that's the cycle of abuse. The abused becomes the abuser. Milo thinks he's being strong by spewing hatred of women, gays, Jews, Muslims, blacks and others. He's just compensating for his own lack of self-worth.
Great! Now show me where anyone said it's OK that black cops kill black people.   It's only about race to you, isn't it?
You don't watch much TV.  The man from Mars would think that most people here are black, in the power positions, and dominant over those around them.  What few white women exist are red heads and children are worshiped.
"Southern Democrats insisted on protecting slavery in all the territories while many Northern Democrats resisted. The party split over the slavery issue in 1860 at its Presidential convention in Charleston, South Carolina. Northern Democrats nominated Stephen Douglas as their candidate, and Southern Democrats adopted a pro-slavery platform and nominated John C. Breckinridge in an election campaign that would be won by Abraham Lincoln and the newly formed Republican Party. After the Civil War, most white Southerners opposed Radical Reconstruction and the Republican Party's support of black civil and political rights. The Democratic Party identified itself as the "white man's party" and demonized the Republican Party as being "Negro dominated," even though whites were in control." (PBS) Placing the 2017 Democratic party into 1850 America is a fool's quest.  Why can't Republicans stick with today? Because there's no arguing it's become hate-filled, racist, and fascist.
what is your point, mcclelland?  what are you trying to convey with this article? i was born and raised on the southside of chicago. and i'm white. you did not walk through a rough neighborhood at night, no matter what color you were. hell, you didn't even stop at a red light.  although i no longer live in that area, i can assure you that that still stands true today. i know plenty of white people, including myself, who had their clocks cleaned, after that making that mistake. are you saying that white people should feel guilty about not getting shot, or potentially becoming victims of crime,while walking through a black neighborhood? white people have some kind of immunity from senseless violence? i couldn't be happier that these gangbangin' shitbags are killing themselves. granted, they could use some time at the range; may help to cut down on hitting' innocent people. nevertheless, that's street justice; shitbirds killin' shitbirds; saves the cops some work.
Isn't it a bit incivil, Monte, to say that those who don't agree with your highly assertion are simply being blind?  How is "white privilege" not  racist terminology? The inference is that my accomplishments and success are due to the color of my skin. And that strikes me as nothing but racial bigotry. Would you use the phrase "Black privilege" in talking about the disproportionate success of Blacks in basketball, football, track and field? Would you use that term to refer to affirmative action? I doubt it.   This is the problem with the vocabulary of "social justice." Like religion, it invents a sin lexicon to guilt and shame society into submitting to the tyranny of an artificial equality achieved by rule of law and social pressure. That's partially why 60 million Americans - fed up with the liberal shame game - just voted in a boorish, vulgar president who seems incapable of shame.   The culture of social justice reminds us that more laws simply occasion more "sin."
If the black players are benched for not standing, no one will watch, since most of great running backs, receivers and DBs are black.
Yes, but he was one of the better presidents.  I mean the pack a day dude black nationalist!
After viability, you support no abortion.  I think the reason why is clear.  There's no more polite or politically correct way to say it . . . it's tantamount to murder.  If Trump had enslaved 3,000 blacks every year, we'd be aghast.  Clinton, however, would allow the murder in the womb of 8,000 a year.  That's just the very late term, partial birth abortions.  The rest amount to about 1.6 million.  She has no sense of humanity.
Can you name any woman who wrote a manifesto against men and then targeted them in a killing spree?  No you can't.    But if that were to happen -- or the times when men have written a manifesto against women and then killed a bunch of them -- I'd call it a hate crime.  Just like that white supremacist who shot a bunch of black people in a church was charged with hate crimes.  Yet strangely, there's a lot of resistance to calling it a hate crime when women are the hated group and the target.  Why is that?
Yes, maybe I am a prat. Just to clarify....given SA's history, it can be argued that the white population (collectively) lacks the moral authority to pass judgement or criticise the current government. This is not to say that the critiques and judgements are not valid, but when coming from white quarters it can be perceived to lack credibility. The views of "black" commentators should be given as much exposure as possible - whether or not they are in favour or critical of the current situation in SA. Their voices should be given preference.
How could you have thought for even a split second that I was under a "professional duty" to go around to public schools warning kids about the consequences of federal crack charges?  You say you never called me a racist.  But you assume that I and the great majority of whites need to be reminded that black lives matter.  As I said, that in itself is a hateful, racist charge.  I tell you the truth:  That kind of race-huckstering is causing an increase in racial tension the likes of which I've rarely seen, and it's been going on for a couple of years now, fueled by false, ignorant race huckstering by Black Lives Matter.  When bad cops shoot without justification, they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  I know of no whites who disagree.  To hear you tell it, however, whites in general don;t care whether an innocent black man lives or dies.  What an outrageous thing to say.  If you really care about the future of race relations, get more honest in assessing them.
"Black men and women in Denver are twice as likely to die from gunshots — and five times as likely to be murdered by gunfire — as white men and women"  And why do you think that is?  Perhaps it's that they commit more of the murders and crime than whites proportionally?  Perhaps it is that their communities foster this type of behavior?  Perhaps they need to look inwards and fix the problems with their own communities and people, rather than blaming everything on the white man for once in their lives?
Tar and Feather that Dumb FUGLY Nigga!!!!!!!
I would rather work with a Hillary supporter than a Trump supporter any day. Trump is a proven racist and misogynist.  Examples for the weak minded who forget too easily (or just don't care):  Racist = pointing to one of the only black people at his rally and stating something along the lines of "Here is my black guy"; asking the a black reporter if she knows the Black Caucus in DC and if she can set up a meeting between he and them.  Misogynist = bragging about sexually assaulting women and then stating that this was only "locker room banter".  Please defend any of these statements if you can. However, first place yourself in a black person's or woman's shoes and ask yourself how you would feel if either of these examples happened to you. The irrational out there, will likely state that this is not a problem and would be OK or even proud that Trump would show some attention to them. The rest of us understand that the Idiot in Chief is just that and his supporters are much the same.
the solution is to investigate police involved in illegal activities like offering themselves as lynchmen,henchmen and assassins and punish them then dismantle the police and start on a new slate!the minister knows about the police terrorism against communities pertaining to school-bullying and drop-outs and gangsterisation as he grew-up amidst this threat and the fact he did not make it his priority to safeguard township residents instead constantly lamenting on white security and threatening blacks!this issue has now been hijacked by the third force to destroy coloured and black youths!the hordes who drop-out yearly where are they as they are not quing for jobs or roaming the streets!he,was battling financially after `94 so he came to the flatlands of joburg and the third force show generosity to him and his comrades in return they must shut-up about the attrocitioes and murders of black youths committed by security guards.we need nuremberg trials or martial law to deal with the po
The Jones Act was immediately lifted to help Texas and Florida.  It took the nation two weeks of shaming Trump before he acted to help Puerto Rico.  He spent that time making lame and nonsensical excuses for why he couldn't lift the ban.  In other news:  Trump continues to shore up his racist base by dropping more racial dog whistles. Now he says NFL owners are 'afraid' of their black players.  Yep, the plantation is under threat by the uppitys all over again.  Trump is a racist.  And a traitor.
Maybe you didn’t understand...agricultural and domestic workers, mostly black, were EXCLUDED for Social Security...so of course they didn’t pay the taxes because they COULDN’T. I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt by suggesting you didn’t understand, and so made one of the most stupid comments I’ve ever read here.
Some of the "poorly educated white folks" have noticed that as well!    It still doesn't explain where all those black and Hispanic voters who supported Obama went when Trump was elected, though.    I personally thought Hillary was that bad, but that still doesn't explain not voting at all by 80 plus percentages of those two minorities.
[Insert racist joke about coal black skin here.]  Oh, sorry, it's OK to make jokes about white people's skin color but not black people's or brown people's.  Because social justice.
Liberals daily and for years have shown their superiority over others.  You believe blacks are too stupid to achieve a college degree unless you help them with affirmative action.  And do try to follow the news.  I doubt it got by you that some parents won't let the gender be put on the birth certificate because they haven't decided on the gender.  Being a former Jewish agnostic, it doesn't bother you that Christianity is under assault.  And even though neither you nor I feel under assault, you can't deny that we are accused for all the world's ills.  Gays should be treated like everyone else because it's right.  Gays can purchase any pre made cake they want at Masterpiece Bakery because it's right.
The KKK members have long been "equal opportunity" bigots......Catholics....Jews...Blacks.... "let's hate them all!"
Michelle Obama will run against Trump in 2020.  Why do you think they bought a $5M House in D.C.? Barack uses Slick Willy as his template; he seeks to build a dynasty. The mass media has already started her campaign : pics of her looking skyward ("Visionary") and the Headline "Michelle's Legacy".  For "The Liberals" it is too sweet of an idea  Not to have her run! "Ahhh Yes! A Black Woman (with the same views as "Barry") running against that evil p***y grabbing racist!" I can hear it now!
Bunch of cry babies.."Because I'm black"  is losing its steam.  Do your protesting at the door step of those you angry with (police and courts) or to make a great statement go to Chicago and support black mothers who lost their sons and daughters through black cannibalisim i.e. black killing blacks. And for the white girls who cried about doing splits, find another sport.
How are they racist? Are they suggesting that whites become slaves of blacks? Need a citation. You're racist, right? Show me how I know.
Not if you're black, apparently.
I agree, Xavier.  If the 'pro-white' group had been allowed to simply have their demonstration against the removal of the Lee Statue, they would have said their speeches and then gone home. It "takes two to tango" or have a violent confrontation.  The pictures taken of the liberal Hate Group reveal ALL -the Red Fists: Communist Party/Workers Party (if that was not the intent, then KNOW What signs and symbols MEAN before you use them.)...The Expletives F#@* this, or that....the Hate just spilling over.  The death of Ms Heyer was terrible. She apparently was a good person who felt the need to support the downtrodden. I wonder if she protested about the Black Lives Matter Group?
The sickness is in YOU, self-loather. You concluded "murder" in the early days of the shooting based on conjecture. Oddly, you think it has something to do with white people when the officer is Latino. Can you tell us why? Yes, you're programmed with racial self-hatred. That much is glaringly obvious by your racist bilge here.  There is ZERO proof that cops "target" black people. That blacks get pulled over more is a correlation/causation fallacy. The New Jersey study showed it was because blacks were committing a higher rate of traffic infractions. Instead of rattling off narratives about "rich white men" and other pale bogeymen, learn to be critically-minded and stop blindly swallowing Critical Race Theory narratives. You're parroting absolute crap, and you should be ashamed of yourself.
Blacks did poorly under the last administration, the dirty little secret the MSM NEVER mentions.
True, I also -miss those ancient days when as a kid I could roam safely, even hitchhike;  families seemed to be stable; folks believed in their excellent public schools;  and we all felt like a part of a warm safe community.  Best of all, in a strange way, was WWII, where we ALL pulled together for the sake of America.  At the same time, our town was probably a "sundown" town, as no blacks or other minorities seemed to live there; girls weren't encouraged to finish college or take most jobs; gays and lesbians, if we thought of them at all, were just "queers";  the environment was too often  a place to dump trash;  forests were overcut and not adequately replanted, etc.  So is life better or worse today?  That is a long and complex question.
Yeah but the Marxist globalist scum have been showing up with black face coverings attacking public events for years. Why do they need masks? because of the violence and criminality that they engage in.
Mr. Longmore is not responsible! This is more "Axe Violence"!  What brand was that axe? Black ?
When we see gay people arguing for reverse conversion therapy to turn straight people gay, and black people working to systematically disenfranchise and deport white people, then we can talk.
"Blacks?" Unbelievable. Listen, troll, African Americans are "people." Not a color. Need to throw that out there before flagging your racist lies.
White people do not believe they are superior ,it is dark people who believe that white people are superior . They may have a point because there is not one dark country in the world that  helps people as much as white people.
My how fast this disappeared from the media.  Racist Black man shoots up white people in church is ho-hum.  But when the racist white man shot up black people in church it was all the media talked about for weeks.  How the hypocrisy continues.  No agendas here, nope.
You are clueless if you really believe in this protest. When I turn on football I want to watch football. These players are not oppressed and the BLM movement is predicated on a lie. There is more black on black crime in this country then any other type. Hands up don't shoot never happened. That's a fact! So if you want to join the pity party go ahead. As for me I'm done with the disrespect and the NFL.
Blacks kill far more blacks than cops.  WAY more.  Why don't the players protest that???
21 games above five hundred......Black should be fired. Trevor Story should be driving Lyft. Carlos should retire. Dj can't pull the ball. Our starting pitching is young and bad. Charley is going to be the next Todd Helton wasting his life in Denver. Nolan showed why he shouldn't have played today, he can't hit when it counts. Montforts should either move the team or sell it to people that know baseball. 94 degrees .......the very last time I spend a nickel on this crappy team.
24 yo, black kid, high speed chase, evading police. Yep, yo arsies gonna get shot off. Stupid boy. Didn't yo daddy tell you to stop, don't run, look at the police into their eyes, no make any fast moves, and keep yo hands in plain view? You ever watch COPS? The popos always run. Makes the cops angry and gives them an opportunity to beat you up, shoot you, and plant guns. It shouldn't be surprising that juries acquit the cops. If you black, you guilty and deserve to wasted. Of course they will side with the corrupt cops. You popos are way out of control all over the nation. As long as you break the rules of law and order the cops will kill you. We are tired of your lawlessness.
I think the point here is that if they racially profiled white people they'd find just as much shady stuff happening as if they racially profiled blacks.
I am not as ignorant as you make yourself to sound. I been up and down that highway and read several books on the subject. How about you? For most of our nation's history, black people have received unequal treatment. You are not saying anything that is new or astounding.
Obama without any question will go down in history as the president who turned back the clock once again to a divided nation not seen since the 1960's over racial tensions of black vs. white in America. Obama is a RACIST and anyone who says otherwise is either a damn liar or a bigoted racist ilk of Obama. People in my neighborhood are already planning on a block party to celebrate his last day in office!
Kaepernick told us why he's kneeling:  “America refuses to address the pervasive evil of white cops killing black men, and I will not stand during a national anthem that honors the flag of such a country!”  The kneeling is based on a lie, as is the Black Lives Matter movement.  "Pervasive evil," my hinee.  Do racist police shootings occur?  Yes, indeed.  And they're prosecuted.  Even some cases that don;t have merit are prosecuted.
At least the press now admits that Senator Tim Scott (R, South Carolina) exists.  When Senator Scott was elected in South Carolina, the Cradle of the Confederacy, by an electorate that was over 60% white, it didn't make the news in 2014 or 2016.  Senator Scott was the first Black senator elected from the former Confederacy since Reconstruction, but it didn't make the news.  Now they disparage Senator Scott by saying he's the only Republican Black senator.  The Democrats only have two Black Senators, Cory Booker (D, New Jersey), elected in 2013, and Kamala Harris (D, California), elected in 2016.  Senator Scott is a Tea Party Republican.  He won election twice on issues.  His race obviously didn't hold him back in what the press likes to call the racist Republican Party.  Democrats can't win without identity voting.  Democrats have poor governing results, but identity politics make that irrelevant.  That's why Democrats play the race card every chance they get.
What are you using as a stereotype? If that was a photo of a white male you would not have said what you said it, admit it.  You looked at the photo and saw that he was black and decided he was associated with a gang. I don't know who you are trying to fool but it's not me. Intolerant Dem? Seriously? Overwhelmingly Democrats are more inclusive in their platform and policies. What, are we not inclusive because we don't tolerate hate speech from conservatives, the alt-right nazis and white privileged men who are completely clueless? Yeah I'll own that then I guess.
it was not until the protests that Mizzou's culture of tolerance of racism became national news -- the fact that two people resigned didn't change the culture, and black applicants understand that.
lol!!     The demorat- donkeys were the biggest slavers of all of them. The demorats invented and used the KKK as their paramilitary arm to hand people. The demorats were behind all of the banning of blacks in restaurants, voting, etc.   It took a republican, Abraham Lincoln, to end slavery.
It is all of you that have ruined this city. You all ignore the needs of the poor and bitch when they get shoved to another part of the city. You all bring gentrification and bitch when ya have a black person on Alberta.  Leave now and hope this city will return to the greatness it was. Punk clubs, artists, rent a person can afford, and a people that loved this city not use it as the next whore to cover in glass and glam.
Ummm... I think we got our wires crossed somewhere. When I referenced his private affairs I meant his home and marriage etc. If Dean doesn't want to marry a black woman, disowns a gay son, or wont let a Jew in his home that's his business. If Dean wants to block certain people from public accommodations like pools or restrooms or refuse service to someone because they belong to a minority group he dislikes then no, he no longer gets to claim a right to free association and the courts should absolutely step in.
Joey, it's not the gay agenda, it's the black agenda. Membership has been declining since 1974, when the Boy Scouts were forced to integrate blacks into their troops. Equal rights are ruining the morally straight....
White mass murders can't be ignored or glossed over. As far as your FBI stats goes let's just be real the prison industry in America is huge so if you want to keep your jobs and keep creating jobs for your kids then you must keep a certain population in the dark and keep crime going. Those numbers make people like you feel like incarcerating and killing blacks is okay. But like I said you are the product of people who hung,  hunted, and hated blacks so why would you care. You just show up to hate.
Where the Hell were you, Hillary Clinton, and Obama when Black Lives Matter was tearing up, burning city's, and shooting cops??  Not a word heard.  You self righteous, double standard, vomit spewing hypocrite.
I'm wondering if anyone calling this "racism" (or good grief "reverse racism") even read her post. Have none of you heard of Jonathan Swift? This was a blog post, not a policy proposal to her department, for crying out loud. Sure, the idea is extreme on its face, but she discusses some very real issues faced by underrepresented groups, and she challenges those in academia to think deeply about how they approach hiring and diversity. She challenges all of us who identify as progressive or liberal to think about whether we are genuinely making effort to create more equitable institutions in real, tangible ways: are you walking the walk or just talking the talk? Yet rather than taking an opportunity for a thoughtful discussion, we have a bunch of pearl-clutching over the fate of a bunch of cis white guys...who are going to be affected by this post how, exactly? C'mon, progressives - we need to better than knee-jerk reactions of the O'Reilly crowd when a black woman calls out inequality!
There was no reason to basically reprint the previous write up from Tuesday.  You know this news should have been maybe two paragraphs in the City Region section and really a picture of Mrs Lange. Once again EVERYONE KNOWS SHES BLACK!  Self serving write up once again!  Shame on all involved with this!  Vindictive people hiding behind their mess!
Just another violent murder of Black against White. Bello a victim of a hatecrime against Blacks? No, we all love them. It was  just another incompetent human  who was promoted to a job he had no brains to do properly - that's why he was fired!
You are correct, but if these rino fools want to stay in their government paid positions, they better realize they were not elected by Democrats. The Republicans have nothing on the "indiscriminate lying and cynical promises they can't fulfill" that the Democrats haven't been putting on the Black electorate over the last 50 years.  Lucky for the Democrat leadership that the Blacks don't realize that nothing has changed for Blacks in the last 50 years!  They only believe what they hear from the press, they don't research actual facts on their own. If they did actually some research, likely we would be at outright revolt...against Democrats again, like the Civil War.
in all fairness, it should also be noted that the following perceptions:   "The black-man-as-criminal stereotype runs deep. The archetype is so prevalent that the majority of whites and African Americans agreed with the statement “blacks are aggressive or violent”    are perpetuated by what has become a very dominant part of black culture; glamorizing the thug life, gettin' paid- quick and easy, slangin' rocks, all the hoes you can handle, so on and so forth.  with having said that, perhaps the black community should also be focusing on the people who promote and peddle that horseshit.  because it's not helping their cause.
And black people should have gone to black lunch counters, right?
Black people are so selfish and greedy.  Slavery has already been eliminated...but somehow that's not enough!  They want to also erase our memories of that greater time when we still had slavery.  Today it's statues...tomorrow they're inventing those memory wipers like in Men in Black.  Wake up people!
Their minds are elsewhere. Kneeling is more important. Caused by black millionaires childish racism. Glad I'm done watching...
There are lot more blacks killing blacks than cops killing clacks
Please enlighten us as to what ponderous facts you're referring to. You'll need to cite pertinent Canadian data, ideally with a focus on Peel Region. Or are you just saying that black people commit more crime therefore ALL blacks are criminals or potential criminals?
To dismiss the concerns of a white pupil on the basis of his race is overtly racist and the teacher should be penalized. An incident of this kind would not be tolerated if, say, a black student was discarded for being black.
What is the GOP AHCA?  Why are you so against Obamacare, Keoni?  How does OC actually hurt you?  How does OC actually weaken this country?  Could you please detail.  Please, instead of doing the mindless GOP thing - spouting a slogan???  So a Black Democrat came up with a life saving National policy.  Get over it.   Make a clear argument on how to change things for the BETTER, so that we're closer to EVERYONE having healthcare, and you're relevant.  Otherwise, you're just selfish, foolish and inhumane all wrapped up in a tight little bundle of ugly (= GOP base).
Steven, you worked yourself into a bit of an uncomfortable corner.  Since Trump got more college educated blacks than Romney and Hillary got more non-college educated blacks, are you really suggesting that college educated blacks are racists for voting for Trump? Or are you instead suggesting that these college educated blacks are effectively stupid, despite their college credentials, for voting for Trump.  Please work with the data a bit more and untangle your awkward conclusions.
I prefer he term "general welfare" to the common good. By that, I mean what he Founders meant, not some Wilsonian ideal.  I do believe taxes are needed to run gov't, but 60% plus is for entitlements, that can't be touch for some god awful reason. Welfare destroys the industry of the individual, enslaving him to keep his goals low in order to continue to receive "free" stuff. three and four generations after the Great Society are stuck in a vicious cycle who don't know anything more than a welfare check or EBT deposit. This has destroyed our inner city, mostly Black, but Hispanic and White as well. I don't see that as helping the common good.
The blacks folks at Harvard are having their own "separate but equal" commencement this year so I'm sure things are about to improve for you oppressed people.
I suspect that in addition to owning slaves, many of our founding fathers also sired many Black children.  In that respect, Trump is correct.  I think what some of the country wants is to remove the statues from the side of the Confederacy only.
Lol, what's the point? Trump denouncing hate is like Rush Limbaugh denouncing PCP.  He's just going to do it again when you turn your back. DJ Butt Trumpet has worked tirelessly for decades to ban black people from his buildings, he has consistently and enthusiastically expressed a belief that black people are intrinsically lazy and his beloved father, who he has modeled his entire persona on, was a member of the KKK.  He loves to hate.  He lives to hate! That's why he was elected!  Take the hate away and all that's left is a yellowhaired Oompa Loompa with a remedial vocabulary.
Good point black rifls ...white is actually the combination o all colors together
Police thought and think their authority matters more than black lives. You would have a point except for the numerous times black suspects were shot in the back while running away and it was on tape. Valor.
Not even close. Political thought is not a protected class. You do not have to make a cake for ademocrat. You do have to make a cake for a black person.
Contrary to liberal lies, kids are learning that being white is one of the worst things you can be, being a white male is a double whammy.  Liberals love to pit one group against another and spread their hate that way Unarmed minorities?   Is that why some of the most violent areas in the country are where minorities congregate?  I know from past posts that you are black and proud. From this post and others that you are pro-hate.   Why should it be any more racist for me to be white and proud? Anti-hate, white, proud, and unapologetic.
He said nothing about relative percentages. He said blacks commit more murders. A blanant lie.
Actually blacks in South Africa were not looking to eliminate South Africa, just pursuing equality, whereas Arabs in the Middle East are looking to eliminate Israel, just pursuing dominance.  Big difference.
Nicely written, Neal, cogent, well-informed, & logical. But when did "information" or "logic" have much to do with supporting Trump? DJT is the vehicle for the resentments of folks who not only believe they've gotten a rotten deal (& a lot of them actually have) but also blame their distress on "the other" (i.e., blacks, immigrants, Jews, Muslims, intellectuals, etc.) rather than the actual source of their plight (i.e., the Neo-Liberal capitalist "winner take all" economy & the GOP politicians who support & perpetuate that economy). When the Tea-Party activists & other "low-information" people vote for the likes of Trump, they are actually voting against their own long-term best interests. But their resentments & lack of basic reality checks overcome their instincts for self-preservation & their ability to figure out they're being take for a ride. Trump, who makes his products overseas & trucks in foreign workers proclaims bald-faced lies – the fools believe those lies. Sad.
Ernie, whites commit 60% of the violent crimes in the US (DOJ stats 2015). However, a young black male is 20 times more likely to be killed by the police. Why?
The cry of racism doesn't wash anymore except among the left, who cry racism at every turn.  It doesn't matter to Trump what color the kneeler is.  He didn't say only the black kneelers should be fired.    The resentment and disdain, hatred and anger is in the minds of those who kneel.  They hate America because they see us as a fundamentally white supremacist country.   What a disdain-worthy crock.
Shaun King's a white boy trying to outblack blacks. That's what this is about. Has naught to do with Kolin Caepernick.
Thanks for your warm cares and wishes everyone!! I really like how you turned my being shot into a fucking nit pick contest have you no compassion anymore ? That's the real problem nowadays!!! Sincerely the guy that was shot on Fairbanks street by a black guy and a white guy i. A black BMW
The current president is a birther who tried to overthrow the last president with his birtherism lie. Arpaio is a birther also. Imagine that!  The current president broke the law in order to commit illegal anti-black housing discrimination. Arpaio broke the law to continue illegally racially profiling Latinos. Imagine that!  The current president pretends to be a "law and order" guy. Unless the law doesn't favor him. Same with Arpaio. Imagine that!  The current president cut off his own cerebral palsy-suffering nephew's health care to spite his sister in law. Arpaio was known to spitefully harass and jail his critics. Imagine that!  Trump and Arpaio: two spiteful racist lying birther criminals.
You have failed at your attempt to blame the "white nan" .. when a black officer shoots a white man... No one complains. A white officer shoots a thug... People go nuts.
The same people who, when a black man is killed, keep saying "just comply.  If he'd have complied he'd be alive."  Well, them same goes here, when you're told be armed agents to keep your hands up and stop moving: just comply.
Barry said nothing much during the Ferguson riots or when a mob of blacks dragged a white man out of his car to beat him.   Said nothing about the black gang that killed a white couple just because, made the girl drink bleach and gang rapped her as well as lit her on fire.  The press glossed over that one, why? Because they are anti white
Race issues is out of your league, Rhyner.  I agree 100% with Elise's op-ed.  The social issues may have changed to a certain degree, but race ideologue hasn't changed one bit.  Within the past year, the US Dept. of Justice released a scathing report about racial profiling in certain states where black men were being shot to death by police.  And if we as a nation has advanced, race wise, as you claim then why is there still a need for affirmative action laws?  And you have the nerve to blame President Obama because he's black.  You can't separate your irrationality, Rhyner.  If the president is black he must  be to blame for while cops shooting unarmed black men.  Riggggght.
Are you really that completely ignorant & stridently uninformed or did you post the ludicrous and transparently erroneous assertion that "Trump has a 30 year history of rejecting racism and rejects racism today" as a cheap, baseless tactic to propagate a complete misconception about who Donald Trump really is and what he actually believes? In fact, the tyrant pig Trump has a long and insidious record of both overtly racist actions, policies, public statements & controversies:  In 1973, the US Department of Justice sued the Trump Management Corporation for violating the Fair Housing Act. Federal officials found evidence that Trump had refused to rent to black tenants and lied to black applicants about whether apartments were available, among other accusations.  Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump Tower, stated that during the 1980s, "When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor...they put us all in the back"  (cont'd below)....
The Harlem Clinic    "W.E.B DuBois, in his article "Black Folk and Birth Control, " noted the "inevitable clash of ideals between those Negroes who were striving to improve their economic position and those whose religious faith made the limitation of children a sin." He criticized the "mass of ignorant Negroes" who bred "carelessly and disastrously so that the increase among [them] … is from that part of the population least intelligent and fit, and least able to rear their children properly." DuBois called for a "more liberal attitude" among black churches. He said they were open to "intelligent propaganda of any sort, and the American Birth Control League and other agencies ought to get their speakers before church congregations and their arguments in the Negro newspapers [emphasis added]."   http://www.blackgenocide.org/negro.html
I would like to know since when did any of us ever give a crap about racism in voting? DID YOU ALL FORGET ABOUT OBAMA! BLACK PANTHERS VOTED FOR O AND WERE AWARDED WITH PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS!
The 2017 Congressional Black Caucus is racist with a capital R, barring whites and Republicans from joining the club.  Democrats have been dripping with racism for over 150 years.  "All past and present members of the caucus have been African-American. In 2006, while running for Congress in a Tennessee district which is 60% black, white candidate Steve Cohen pledged to apply for membership in order to represent his constituents. However, after his election, his application was refused.[13] Although the bylaws of the caucus do not make race a prerequisite for membership, former and current members of the caucus agreed that the group should remain "exclusively black"."  [ouch]- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus  So,  where is the all Republican "Congressional White Caucus"?
I'm dressing up as a black, LGBT Muslim in a burqa.
We have to have different Oscars .One for women,one for black ,one for Latinos ,one for gays. Everybody are happy
Most of the killings in America you mention  are black on black  drug  and  mental rage crimes.  Trump did address that  during his campaign and was roundly criticized  for daring to say it. He spoke the truth about race and crime in America.  That's why  13 black congressmen boycotted his inauguration.
It incredible that the liberal press cannot see how they are burying themselves. From the very first day, the have maligned Trump at every opportunity. The problem is everything their black Jesus did was wrong for America and everything Trump has done is correcting the crap Obama did. The press keeps attacking Trump, while the band plays on
Surprised blacks are even part of SBC as there YUGE numbers of black Baptist church not affiliated. Probably most white SBC would prefer blacks leave altogether. White persons need to press for change.  Should not be incumbent upon black persons who often lack any power and historically are the victims of institutional racism. But whites continue to balk at providing leadership for change. Change will come from outside the churches. As MLK said, paraphrase, churches should be headlight, not tail lights.
David Duke himself voted for trump, along with all the KKK, American NAZI Party, and most white Southerners. Trump is the only presidential candidate endorsed by the KKK who did NOT turn down the endorsement.  The Congressional Republican Caucus is open ONLY to Republicans, therefore open to only three three black Congressmen. The other 45 black Congress men and women aren't alowed entry. Those are FACTS, not your racist Rush Limbaugh/Sean Hannity crazy babbling and lies. Your entire political perspective rests on bigotry and lies. Now your head is about to explode, and you'll start talking nonsense in sub-civil language. It's back on mute for you, little snowflake. Or is that, just, flake?  Uh-Oh, too late! Incoming! But I voted it "not civil", and it's so nasty, in a schoolyard taunt sort of way, that it likely will never be published.
https://ballotpedia.org/Brennan_Center_for_Justice  "Election scholars with the Heritage Foundation evaluated the report and concluded that '[b]y eschewing many of the traditional scientific methods of data collection and analysis, the authors of the Brennan Center study appear to have pursued results that advance a particular political agenda rather than the truth about voter identification.'[2]". This was because the Brennan centers "research group" concluded 25% of black people could not get the paperwork required to vote.   This is a patently false statement.     But then it's funny how only left wing organizations are promoting this.  It's funny how Democrats and the Brennan center are ok with 'non partisan' gerrymandering in their favor (aka CA and CO) but horrified when it turns out against them.      Of course much of this is being driven by the fact that Democrats are and have always been sore losers
White supremacists hated the black guy, and it was the black guy's fault.  I guess if the uppity negro had minded his place you and your ilk would have been quite a bit happier, right?
Honestly.  Yes, I know the Republicans who made comments about Blacks and Latinos.  I took exception to their comments not because I personally know of whom they spoke but because of the way it was stated.  "Well, you know how N****** are" or 'Honestly, Mexicans are so lazy.  She always leaves my house not quite clean." That is offensive speech to me.  And I think this discussion is just a smoke screen to detract from the real issue.  It is wrong for any race to make assumptions about another race based on too little information.  That is not the same as White Nationalism, and don't try to pretend it is.
Whoops...meant to reply to Bennice's post.  I don't get it.  I'm sure other races do it, but it baffles me that whites want to blame other races for some intangible issue.  Blame the blacks, blame the Chinese, blame the Mexicans. Uh, what are they really taking from us whites personally?  Nothing substantial I can put a finger on.  Certainly nothing from me personally that makes a hoot of difference in my life.  I've got it good.  I could have it better, but the only one to blame for that is me.
Yep! Criticize a black, gay, Jew , male, female, immigrant, certain illegal immigrant and you are racist, sexist, homaphobic, anti Semitic, xenophobic. I apologize if I missed someone.
Are you trying to say that black people are more likely to be mentally ill murderers?
The sad part of is the Left is thrilled to have face to face confrontations with White Supremecists and Neo-nazi's and happy to incite the violence.  Not question whether the White Supremecists and Neo-Nazi's are scum and thugs - they are - period.    Just saying the left now is using them to paint all conservatives and all opponents as racists. This demonization of regular conservatives both de-legitimizes them as having policy alternatives which may be practical in solving issues and also scapegoats them so they should not have freedom of speech and open to hate attacks.  We now need to be clear. Neo nazis are scum. But doesnt mean Black Lives Matter or similar folks are right and not dangerous.
My, my, my, Paulie,  How quickly we forget what you wrote about Trump during the GOP primary season. Talk about galling hypocrisy:  "Donald John Trump, a billionaire bigmouth, a carny barker with delusions of grandeur, a narcissist whose campaign success is fueled by the fury seething in this country. In a nation of 330 million souls, that Trump could be considered seriously for president, much less nominated by a major party, could be a sign of the End Times. No, really."  "His supporters, like Sarah Palin's, are disinterested in facts. Their minds are made up."  "Trump, with his runaway yap and startlingly tempestuous idiocy…"  "During a campaign speech in a very white Michigan suburb, Trump fished for African-American votes by asking, "What the hell do you have to lose?" We as a nation are about to find out."
From the stats, one out five people shot by police, were black people. That is well within the population ratio. That mean other four were not black but probably whites, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Natives. How many times do we have to read about black person being shot by police? You read it a lot because that is part of the media's agenda. You don't read much about white guy or Asian guy or Hispanic guy being shot by police because it simply not in their interest to report it. Media, like so many elements of our society, got their own political agenda.  Was Castile's killing a racist one?? Would it help if he was white instead of black? Well, considering that the officer who shot him is a Latino, maybe that governor should have said that if Castile was Latino.....then he would have been better off. But in this case, I think that Latino officer just panic and for that, he deserves whatever punishment heading his way.
Jackie:  actually you should read the coverage of the case and the police report on the incident. Your "reading" is really quite mistaken.  You're spinning this to be a racist motivated incident.  You state "white chick gets drunk, has consensual sex with black kids"  Two issues here: a) the young woman involved was not a "white chick".  She was AfricanAmerican. b) ", has consensual sex with black kids".  This, of course, is the central issue of the incident.  The young woman claims the sex was NOT consensual...the young men claim it WAS consensual.  .......a classic "she said, he said" incident.  ADGardner determined the woman would not be a credible witness and, therefore, decided to not prosecute the case.  The coach, the AD department, and then the University administration each instituted disciplinary actions based on, first, athletic code of behavior, and, then, the University disciplinary code.  All the info is readily available.  Read it and educate yourself.  Gary Crum
Can't recall seeing any homeless blacks.  Wonder why that is?  Black privilege?
republicans own these people. They brought them in in force when Reagan campaigned on getting rid of the so called welfare queen. Most every white person knew what that meant. Blacks where all are problems begins. Hating gays and Mexicans didn't come till late.   Every person that pushed and repeated the birther movement is no different than the white racist we saw last weekend. Only they aren't afraid to show it. Others hide it and say not me, but...
True enough.  Alas, for many conservatives the world can only be black or white, and Mr. Trump is Dubya on steroids.  Not only are you "against me" if you're not "for me," you're a loser and stupid and (choose your Trump invective here).  Hyperbole should no longer be tempered:  Mr. Trump is a "leader" in the same vein as Hitler and Mussolini.  Consistently deprecating (and increasingly openly violent toward) to those who not only disagree with him, but are doing their jobs (or not) as journalists.  Not simply a cartoonish narcissistic blowhard, but a rallying point for the ignorant, angry and uninformed.  There will be violence, and worse, coming from the Trump camp, I fear.  The Republican party created this monster in 50 years since Nixon (both their racist, misogynist, homophobic "core" and the individual now leading them), and when you sleep with dogs, you get fleas.  They have no idea where to scratch, which is both gratifyingly hilarious and frightening.
What the Democrat Party does best:  Panders to the poor to get their votes, gives them handouts, and keeps them poor so they can get their votes.  Creates bills for taxpayers--government salaries. Tells Black people they are too stupid to succeed by their own initiative and need special privileges to get ahead because their great-grandparents were slaves, or not.  Although Black people and others are smart enough to get a photo ID to claim their freebies or fly, they are presumed too stupid to get a photo ID to vote.   Tells people we must do things "for the keiki" and future generations while paying for abortions that kill the keiki/next generation.  Tells women they can do what they want with their own bodies but they are too stupid to keep their legs together and thereby deny admission to a penis. Democrats think those who vote for them are stupid, and the party likes it that way.  Heaven forbid Democrat voters should start thinking for themselves.
Perhaps you should move then?  Move to the mainland where you can go shooting black kids with no problem or drink lead flavored water.  Maybe you can be neighbors with Zimmerman.
One anecdotal story does not make a fact. FACT - Planned Parenthood was started by Margaret Sanger to keep "Negros" from increasing in population.
I'm a Democrat and this may be the most rambling, incoherent, idiotic comment I have ever read on this message board. We protect airports to prevent terrorists from taking planes with hundreds of innocent people down. Remember 9/11? It isn't because of some irrational fear "old white guys" harbor.  So you are blaming  "old white guys" for the fact that a gay nightclub was not protected by TSA employees? Deborah, it must be nice to live in your little black and white bubble world where if it just wasn't for "old white men" the world would be a peaceful, and equitable place.   Get over George Bush. Find a new boogey man to blame your paranoid fantasies on. And sorry you married (or had a relationship) with a controlling man. That was your mistake, so don't paint all men with brush of the jerk you married.
When is the DP going to run a story about all the blacks shooting other blacks on a daily basis in places like Chicago and Baltimore?
88% of the time a black person is murdered, it is by another black person
Apparently Udell(?) is a black guy, and there's this senile old white fart Carol Portugal who thinks her grasp of the black experience is more authentic than his. You can't make this stuff up.
What an idiotic contention.  It wasn't the party of Lincoln that acted as you claim. The KKK was assisted in it's creation with the support of Democratic victories in Southern state governments after the Civil War, in opposition to the Republicans Party's platform during and after the war.  The Dems pretty much controlled all Southern state governments from the 1870s for the better part of a century, during which in the early part of the 20th century the ranks of the KKK were in the millions.  All big cities in the U.S. have been under Democratic control for decades; how well has that gone for the non-Whites who live there, especially in the gang-controlled massive (ware)housing projects?  Just seeing how Dems attack and slander any Black Republicans tells us all we need to know about how they really feel.  Phony compassion.
I assume you believe black Americans were intolerant for not tolerating slavery.
And people wonder why so many young black males are incarcerated?
Perhaps young black men should avoid gangs, guns and drugs and the police would not need to confront them--unless BLM thinks that culture is appropriate.
I was hoping you would respond to my comments about Trump, but I see it's much easier to complain about Obama. It's true Obama did not take us to war against Russia. I'm glad about that. I don't like our soldiers being killed. Police in America have clearly been more violent against Blacks than needed, and I am glad (and so are most police chiefs) that he called them out. Justice is something we all deserve. And pushing his way past others, calling female heads of state cute, and talking so that everyone knows he knows nothing... I think that qualifies as a buffoon.
following up on her thoughts, shouldn't black athletes in the NFL and NBA....."get out of the way?" Athletes, business people, AND academia should be chosen and or rejected by their merits and qualifications.....not the color of their skin.  She's an ignorant academic racist.
Peter, they were shocked about what I thought of my experience there. They never thought they were acting like bigots. One of them even told me he was married to a Latina, like that inoculated him from being a bigot. Slave owners made a profit center out raping their black slaves. We know most white men are willing to have sex with just about anybody and anything. I earned every penny of my Tier 1 PERS retirement, working with these people.
Dang, that's good commentary coming from a black man.
Racial tolerance?  The children are going to be taught how to "tolerate" going to school with black children?  That statement is racist and disgusting.   Why aren't the children who simulated a rape against a black child expelled from school?  Make their parents home school or pay for private school.  Why should they be allowed to stay?  How terrible for the victims to have to continue to see these terrible monsters every day.
question arises - why aren't other minority groups marching also - black, Hispanics, muslims, gays, American Indians, native Hawaiian, Asians, etc.  dumpy is going to make it miserable for all of these groups.  he only favors white Europeans and rich people.
Black lives matter!!  ??
It's so Donald Trump - just some black people from some funny little countries he couldn't hope to find on a map. Sad.
"If they want to make change, the do something positive. Go into the cities and find out why most of the families are single parent, find out how to stop the gangs, improve schools and school attendance. Do something about the black on black killings."  How do you know black leaders aren't doing these things? As Jon Stewart put it (I'm paraphrasing), Just because you're unaware of something doesn't mean it's not happening, just the way that when it snows in your town that doesn't mean the earth isn't getting warmer.  But in a larger sense, why do you feel it is incumbent on black people to correct behavior of other black people? When a white person does stupid things, we don't blame all whites. And before anyone gets outraged at me bringing up race, I would point out that your comment says "Go into the cities..." (we all know what THAT means). Please examine your own biases before telling others what they should and shouldn't do.
And once again "our" delegation votes to erase a black man from history in lock step with the republican party .
Maximus,  I don't think you understand native history very well. The founding fathers used the five tribes as a model example for creating a democracy here. Along with lots of other enlightened philosophies coming to light,  I don't think the natives fought more wars with themselves then Europeans fought wars by themselves.  That is a stupid comparison.   Also, I'm sure if you we're black and imperialists came wanting laborers, you would sell out the weaker tribe in your area...... racist prick..
So how is the murder rate in NYC, are they still pushing over tombstones there, can a black person live in trump towers, are the banks there going to need bailing out again, what have you done to stop global warming and keep the sea from taking over your subway system, is Three Mile island safe, are you involved in the fight for healthcare or do you just obsess about stupid theories on dog care? A major part of creating a TEAM is figuring out how the dogs get along, having fighters or dogs that continually bang the tug line is a no brainer, how often do dogs that come into heat get dropped? How about taking out your energy on purebred dogs with smashed faces that cause sinus problems, STOP breeding in genetic defects that cause a dog pain and suffering all their lives, what happens to racing Greyhounds at your local dog tracks. Maybe you could buy a castilator kit and ambush male dogs in NYC to keep the population down. Are the feral cats there spreading disease to other wild animals,
Yet this disgusting liberal's vile and totally uncivil post still stands.  So much for the big new "Civil" meter.  How long would a post claiming it would be funny to see racist blacks being beaten down stay up?  About three seconds.  Double standards much?  BTW, how telling is it that five libs gleefully up-voted that comment?  Dericho64, George Spelvin, john1235, Lee Anderson, and Johnny Gee should all be ashamed of themselves.   I read posters who up-vote uncivil comments are at risk of being banned too.  Why do those posters still have their accounts?
Careful that could be racist since he is black!  BLDNM!
When have you ever heard President Trump advocate sexual violence? You are fake news. How about black lives matter chanting "what do we want dead cops when do we want it NOW" hows that for the left wing hate speech. Another question what was the March about? do you know the the president can not stop abortion? that's up to the supreme court! If you are really interested in helping womens causes why don't you march at the Saudi embassy. They seem to have a very low view on women!
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI! - White male conciousness is rising.
Black guns cause most of the murders. To be safe buy white guns instead and put little rainbow, butterfly, and Jesus saves stickers on it. If you're a guy you might be labeled as gay because of your gun but at least you could protect yourself from a hate crime.
Let's cut to what u just said Whitty u better learn how to step n fetch If u think u r going to fit in u r crazy They will take ur money give u crap n u r to take it Hawaiian people are slaves to the politions n unions Thay will never change So what they do is look for someone to put  below them Whitty that is u. If u want a quick lesson in how it feels to be black live in Hiwaii Whatbdo u think Haoles means N----- n don't forgot
so, as a minority do you blame the White Man your not a millionaire by now? or as a millionaire in this Free World do you believe you'd be better off in another Country? Let's see the Black fb player play fb in Europe and rake in the millions! C if I care, they can take their wares out of the US for all I care. College fb, Baby! The USA ain't the Heavenly Heaven, we all humans with shortcomings. Deal with it if you got the millions! Run for an elected office and Change the Laws but i'll say you'll never change all the peoples minds. We're all humans, racism will always be here as long as humans roam Earth. Even if we had Aliens from Mars attack Earth we humans would still have racism on Earth and YOU can take that to the bank!
You have to love the idiotic comments by liberals about bigots and race,  the majority of crime in Alaska is perpetrated by blacks, indigenous or other than white,   so please,  by stating the obvious about a crime makes it bigotry.
Lee wrote that slavery was evil but the best thing for the blacks, and that whites had to bear the moral burden of it for their sake.  That's some pretty tortured logic; forgive the pun.
No, they have articulated just fine. They are opposed to blacks being murdered by cops just for being black.  Otoh, you and other far righties continue to try and distort this issue.  Now, I do not agree with taking a knee during tge anthem, but, even the owners are not firing them. In fact, many are backing this. And yes, you are free to gripe all you want. But to lie about it, you are not. Sadly, u and others, get by with it because nobody will go after all the liars.
There are many, many, studies which prove blacks commit a much greater portion of crimes than whites relative to their population!   All large cities with large black populations have high crime rates. We should stop pretending and tell the truth about black crime and black on white crime. Political Corrrectness invented by Democrats is a way of ignoring the truth.
And if a black candidate mentioned somehow that he/she is black, would it be as offensive and required condemnation and apology? Just wondering.
Inclusivity anyone?I wonder what the gay cops think of this one.Western society is getting more stupid by the day.I wish I could go ahead in time about a hundred years and read about these times in which we now find ourselves.Black Lives Matter,pathetic!
I feel like if I’m proud of my white heritage I will be seen as racist. There is a double standard. You can have Miss Hmong, but if you have Miss Europe that is a problem. You can have a scholarship program for blacks, but you wouldn’t be able to have one for just whites. I’m not prejudiced I’m just tired of being politically correct. I’m proud of my heritage and I won’t apologize for being white.

You probably don't consider yourself a bigot and I hope you aren't one, yet your post perfectly exemplifies how bigots think. They see some characteristic they think is true of some members of a group, and then make blanket statements about those groups, e.g. "white folks" or "black folks" or "transgender people." Nobody thinks they are a bigot, they just don't much care for ____ people because of ____.  Aside from the hateful nature of such characterizations, the biggest problem with this approach is that it perpetuates the racial and cultural divide and the profiling you claim to abhor. Please be part of the solution, and not part of the problem.
That applies to black drug dealers who shoot each other  too.
Trump's appointment of Sessions to be attorney general has made it okay for police to kill unarmed black people. The Obama administration had been cracking down on police murders of unarmed people. Black lives don't matter to the Trump administration or his voters.
They never should have "promised" that in the first place.  It was a cynical, racism based way to whip up frenzied electoral votes.  Not good policy.  All the bad things in the GOP coalesced in that single plank of their platform.  Racism toward a black President (and the "PERCEIVED" beneficiaries of the Act), class division, pandering to business at the expense of a thing called "health" for everyone else, a proclivity for embracing dogma and tribalism to the exclusion of  the greater good, and a heartlessness (millions losing health insurance) that is just unbelievable.  THAT is the GOP.  In a nutshell.  And, the reason their current bill (and past bills) to "repeal" have been no good is because they reflect all those things above.  Worst of all, which is the most curious thing about all of this, is that the GOP's repeal efforts clearly will do great harm (at least in the long run) to at least half their base, probably more.  Stupid and cynical.  That's the GOP.
trubo69, You are a disgrace: "invaded by liberal, freedom hating socialists."  Just adjust your tinfoil hat before the 'gub'mint' comes to take your guns.  People like you give Alaska a TERRIBLE name.  Seriously, your delusional right wing rantings are so off-kilter, it's laughable, if not downright disturbing.  Now, go crawl back in your underground bunker and wait for the Apocalypse to come (You know, when Blacks and Mexicans "invade" Alaska.)  You're a big fat chicken. And everyone knows it.  ----- PEOPLE LIKE YOU, trubo69, DIVIDE OUR GREAT NATION. ----  BTW, MVS is a great local store.  Been shopping there for decades.
And?  Why was this 'report' necessary?  Don't we all know blacks do more crime?  Are we still trying to keep that a secret?  Is it 'racist' to tell the truth, yes, I suppose it is.
"Cone of stupidity"? Seriously skewed journalism....or is Cathy now strictly an editorialist?  Obama divided the USA racially by making many ridiculous statements pointing racist fingers at police (yes, even black officers). Trump must be Satan....90% of pollsters and editorial writer think so.
What was that racist chant that I heard at the so-called hate free march.  Yes,  I believe it was BLACK lives matter.   Not ALL lives matter, not Arab lives matter, not muslim lives matter,   not transgender or homosexual lives matter.  Just BLACK lives matter.  There is also offense taken if you insist on ALL lives matter.   Tell me again about racism.   Blacks can exclude whites or any other group from their gatherings, but let whites try to exclude blacks from a gathering and cries of racism  ring out from coast to coast.  Tell me again about racism.  Blacks can riot and yell racist chants, but nary a word is said.  Let all blacks be nominated for an award and it is cheered as diversity, let the same group nominate all whites and it is racist.   Now I have no problem with all black gatherings or all black nominations as long as it goes both ways.
Why, because he was a white guy running for the office vacated by a Black guy?  Get over it.
I have not tried to attend many.   Why does it have to be me personally?  Even one person being denied attendance at a meeting because of the color of their skin is one too many.   Why should we be forced to celebrate "black history" month without a corresponding "white history" month?
It tells us that a majority of us is sick and tired of a government and its media that consistently lie to us, try to manipulate us, and think it is smarter than its constituents. Electing Trump was a total repudiation of the left and everything it stands for including its lying, racist, elitist, unqualified half-black president.
Yes we are proud of hanging blacks and burning their homes.   We are proud of our terrorist history.  Don't you know Bin Laden used our play book for 9/11?  lol
4 out 5 white people fear Muslims....... Source: Barneys neighborhood poll of 4 out of 5 white people who self identified as non black or brown. Poll is accurate normally 19 times out 20 but occasionally not.  Kinda like what happened in London today........
All these protests stem from Kaepernick's stand against police brutality, white police officers against black. Google a list of fallen police officers, google how many have died at the hands of others, to include black assailants. Tell me there isn't a great disparity between the two lists, one more honorable than the other. Our own Celena Hollis of the DPD, a black female police officer of Denver was gunned down by a black assailant. Is she, a fellow community member on any of these football players lists of protest. She was in a park giving security to everyone, race exclusive and was shot at for no other reason that she was a cop. Keep this in mind when you see a player kneel, our police deserve it.
In other news, Al Sharpton Promises a post Labor Day endorsement of Hillary.  Me, I'm wondering if he ever paid that million or so he owes in back taxes?   Or why Hillary wants to associate with someone who,  "has derided moderate black politicians close to the Democratic Party as "cocktail sip Negroes" or "yellow niggers."   I guess it's a 'Democrat thing' and since I'm not I'll never get it.....
A typical demented leftist. Good grief. Donald Trump, a businessman from New York City, who has employed thousands - whites, blacks, Hispanics - will win the election because millions of Americans are fed up with people like Ann, an arrogant leftist kook - most likely on PERS - trying to link Trump with Adolph Hitler. What is wrong with you?
Last patriot - yes it DOES matter.  The black shooter said he wanted to shoot some white cops. Obama's outrage is missing here
The robot censor seems disinclined to accept some harsh truths, but let's try again:  Why is it that despite 70% of serial killers and 80-90% of child molesters and mass-shooters being white, most white Americans are fixated on BLACK crime?  Perhaps its related to a long-perpetuated double-standard that when black or brown (or Muslim) criminals commit crimes, it's held up as a reflection on their entire communities, whereas when white criminals do so, it's only a reflection on said criminals themselves.  And that in turn seems predicated on a widely held and nearly as frequently denied assumption that was first voiced by satan, when his Creator demanded he explain why he refused to make humble himself before 'Adam as he was commanded: "Anna khairum min'hum--I'm BETTER than him." (Qur'an, Suratul-A'raf, Ayaa 11-12)
Black lives matter but didn’t  they read articles about black youth running amuck doing drive by’ s , robberies, rape , drug dealing , pimping etc etc .....
Sounds like somebody is doing enough whining. Pot calling the kettle black. Get over it already.
"We can turn out all the black votes you want," Reed, chairman of the ADC, said in a telephone interview. "But somebody's got to talk to the white voters; it's not our challenge to do that. We can talk to everybody, but white voters got to hear from white folks."  And we conservatives are the racists?? Unbelievable...
Seminole, I'm very familiar with your Republican go-to document and website. But it is hardly the only one. Shall I break out my far-from-obscure sources that gainsay yours? Why should you hire black people, other than the law? I mean, we know how stupid and what horrible workers they are. Same with pot. You know it's the devil's drug. Your government has made that very clear.  Blumstein, Alfred, and Kimonori Nakamura. “Redemption in the Presence of Widespread Criminal Background Checks.” NIJ Journal, Issue No. 263 (2009): 10-17. Google 	Scholar. Web. 2 Feb. 2013.
As a life-long Democrat who voted Republican for the first time in 2010 (Yes, I voted for Obama's first term!), let me tell you my perspective of what I've learned since Trump's election:  - Democrats are the biggest  dividers of this country, using race, sex, sexuality, religion, immigration, and political correctness as tools to lure voters.  Donald Trump's most racist, misogynist act was that he was a White male who won the Presidency following a Black President, and he beat a woman.  Democrats are sore because they believed that they could win elections based on identity (race, sex) without substance. - Establishment Republicans (now on the way out) like Flake, are no better than Democrats, legislators becoming fat and rich by taking taxpayer money, selling out the country, and throwing crumbs to their voters.  That's just a start of what I've recognized.
Now this is hilarious. When you have no argument and the facts aren't on your side ad hominem attacks are what you use. BTW, facts aren't racist or bigoted. Try to ease up on your obvious biases and maybe you'll open your eyes to the truth.  The following is what makes your comment beyond hilarious. I am from a multi-racial family. We are black, white, Mexican, Jewish, et al. To top all of that off I had a family member murdered by the KKK decades ago, so unlike you, I actually have valid reasons to hate racists and Nazis.   People like you just throw out personal attacks, while having no clue about anything. Pathetic.
After the most recent shootings in Baton Rouge, I can't ignore this frightening article any longer.  BLM is a terrorist organization. Period.  If Anchorage citizens are touting the BLM banner, then the Outside madness has affected us up here.  To go marching around spouting, "I hope my (insert relative here) isn't next!" is almost guaranteeing they will be.  These marchers are instilling the wrongful belief that all cops are racist and they're "out to get you black citizen!"  So when an officer does stop you, you, who are all hyped on this "they're gonna shoot me for no reason" mentality are gonna get belligerent and combative, which greatly increases the chances of someone getting hurt!  Don't bring this madness up here!  Don't go into any situation with the police as if you're the martyr and victim-to-be.  This is called a self-fulfilling prophecy and it's feeding on itself, right now, in our nation.
And, I believe Trumps condemnation also includes the blacks, the liberal students, and many conservatives who don't appreciate the angry white people outfitted in riot gear and weapons, promoting their hate for groups of people based on their color or religion.  Many American's of all race's have lost their lives fighting against this type of hate. And MAGA refers to what and when? When was America greater than today? Before blacks had the vote, or had rights? When Jews were rounded up and gassed? I would like to think America is greater now than it ever has been, but as of last November, I'm not so sure.
The liberal "politically correct" ethos is drowning out even Muslims that want to help and condemn this type of child marriages by their most radical flanks --I think they call this irony. No law abiding, responsible Muslim citizen wants their children involved with these insidious terrorist groups, let alone child marriages; no more than white parents want their kids in neo-Nazi gangs, or black parents want their kids hanging around with the Bloods and Crips. Let Muslims help by speaking out and identifying these radical elements within their community, so let's please not sacrifice more innocent blood in the name of politeness and pretend that we don't see any differences in our multicultural societies. Help be part of the solution, read "Heretic Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now by Ayaan Hirsi Ali"  1 Reaction Delete
If you have tolerance for fake Black victimhood, violence (BLM), the fake media and the political Left's double standards- you are the enemy!  Nothing turns people off more than violence and hypocrisy.  You've already defeated yourselves!  TY
Oh! I heard part of it, the Mkhizes were talking of the need of African psychological therapy/cleansing for the black people. The assumption(a preposterous one) been that it is solely the black people psyches that shows the deformities of apartheid oppression. However Biko on his racial equality formulation argued that racial superiority(whites) is as much a problem as racial inferiority(blacks) and that, both those deformities should be exorcized in order to build a genuine multiracial society in South Africa.
Ann Wright, If you were BLACK & A CRIMINAL then Obama would likely stop and give you hugs and praise! He has failed his duty from the beginning and no wonder, who in their right mind would believe 'a community organizer' that never had a real job could con his way into our highest office. His major accomplishment was to DIVIDE our country and set race relations back DECADES! iF Obama's presidency has proven anything, it's that ELECTING A PRESIDENT BASED ON GENDER OR COLOR is NOT the right way to get the job done..
Indeed!  Then neither do my opinions have anything to do with hate.  And I'm a Democrat too.  And a black nun.  Your problem is that you can never admit to your hate because that's what you derogatorily accuse others of when they disagree with your hateful alt-left narrative.  Indeed!  I've accurately diagnosed gary crum as a self-righteous hypocrite based on his holier-than-thou, condescending comments in this forum.  My sympathies to those in your little circle, gary.  Your smugness precedes you.  Hate is defined as "intense or passionate dislike" which means that everyone hates, including you, Sir Gary Crum.  You can claim to not hate 24/7, but your high horse comments betray you.  Here's you Gary - "Self-righteousness (also called sanctimoniousness, sententiousness, and holier-than-thou attitudes) is a feeling or display of (usually smug) moral superiority derived from a sense that one's beliefs, actions, or affiliations are of greater virtue than those of the average person."
except for the black racist like himself. blacks made "tremendous progress" in the past 8 years?! maybe that explains all the riots, BLM, civil unrest! geeze, if this is how you blacks celebrate when you went to top, omg, what would you do if you come back down to earth? or, maybe, just maybe he was only talking about blacks like himself who benefited tremendously under obama who basically hired only blacks  into his cabinet and key positions.
Trump somehow managed to not get over the very low bar of decrying white supremists and Nazis, but has managed to personally attack one of the only African Americans on his commerce committee, the head of Merck, for resigning BECAUSE Trump wouldn't specifically decry white supremists and Nazis. Nice job Trump, who stupid house ape.
Trump made it clear Curry was not welcome.  He called black football players "sons of bitches", then he tweeted the Pens are a great team after their poorly timed missive.  Like it or not, all three leagues are part of a very divisive political debate with Donald Trump at its centre.  That the original issue is police brutality with respect to blacks only makes it worse as Trump is very pro police and even pardoned a police chief in Arizona who was on his way to jail for his abuses of minorities.  America is the land of contradictions and politically is about as polarized as ever, dismissing one another is not the way out of this mess.  As North Americans we need to find ways to come together.  Sports has always been such a vessel.  In Canada think hockey.  In the US it is football, baseball and basketball.  Therefore it stands to reason that they should be part of the reconciliation.  But that won't occur without some honesty and broken eggs.
I don't see why the US election gives visible minorities in the US concerns.  Trump has never said anything to indicate he was against minorities.  He said statements related to illegal immigration and terrorists.  But the mainstream media and the lefties made this out to be that he hates foreigners, blacks, gays, etc.  This is the biggest snow job by the media ever.
Maybe you should ask the women who are heads of state if the like being called cute. I think it's sexist bullshit to diminish a strong leader to simple cuteness. And Blacks see far less justice than police, which you must be able to see. So many stories in the past few years of trigger happy cops, afraid of someone just because they are black. Anyway, I'm done with you. Have a nice day.
I'm sorry you feel that way but are you also offended by the u.s. flag as white supremacist groups ALWAYS have it present in abundance?    Please note that many blacks fought for their states under the Confederate battle flag.  There are many photos of black confederate soldiers at reunions with the Confederate battle flag.  That flag belongs to blacks as much as anyone else.  Blacks are southerners and have helped make the South what it is.
I gotta respectfully disagree with the characterization of the "scuffle". No one in the march was there to start a fight. They were there to make a statement about legitimate grievances against gentrification, how Uncle Ike's plays into it, and how it was put right next to a black church when that would never be allowed next to a white church.  The scuffle started when him and his goons laid hands on people. I was on the fence about Uncle Ike's, but now I'm not. Fuck Uncle Ike's. Don't shop there.
Do you people condemn reverse discrimination ?  The. White's just did what every other race  has done. So it's wrong because there white ? How many people have been hurt or killed in other racial riots threw out time ? I think we should have a white only college fund  ! Don't you all ? That way the negro college fund wouldn't be racist ! It's about time the white race quit bowing down to all others why in hell should they ! All is fair you people cry for equality well let's be fair with the white race also!
The problem is that it's a lie. More white people are killed by police than black people, even though blacks commit half the violent crime in this country.
You think all blacks only earn minimum wage?  Your racism is showing, along with your ignorance.
We are on the cusp of a Fourth Nazi Reich. Heil Trump! Seig Heil!!  With folks like 3rd gen Ak saying white men are Earth's alpha males at will on these pages, hell yes, we're headed to Hitlerism. Won't be long before Fuhrer Trump will start talking concentration camps and gassing brown and black people. And starving them to death at his personal labor camps. Seig Heil!
Wow!  How come you not sharing your wealth with the poor black man?  You wanted us to?  Don't fall in the ocean, a shark might get, but, then again, he'd probably spit you out.
C'mon South Africans, Red, Black, Purple, White, Coloured and Green, let the teeth of the sheep now clearly be seen!
It was a class action suit, of which Trump was a small part.  And the case was settled out of court.  I think you are reaching.....come on, you can do better than that.  Trump is a horrible racist right?  Surely he would have SAID something racist in between getting awards for helping inner city (read black) youth, and getting his picture taken with a smiling Rosa Parks, and hiring promoting black entertainers, and promoting black people to positions of authority in his companies.  SURELY you can do better than that.
In Amerikkka, “black” people (because identifying someone using a colour is just so enlightened) are only allowed to be “grateful”  Anything else is “uppity” and makes people nervous because it does not fit the traditional narrative of “white” hegemony.
If the shooter is black, I thought Republicans wanted black support. He was just using his 2nd Amendment rights as the GOP has threatened. I guess the 2nd Amendment is just a white privilege.
No one actually likes fascism. Running around screaming how much you hate fascism and racism, shows you have some personal deep-rooted issues you should probably work out on your own time. Being a loud-mouth about that shit is just stupid. 90% of the western world fought fascism and Nazism just 70 years ago for a heavy price. Black-Bloc/ANTIFA morons are just frustrated youth looking for an enemy to justify their anger towards a system they can't actually affect for change.
I hope that lynching won't become popular entertainment again. That was family entertainment for white folks in the good old days. Trump's Supreme Court could bring back race based slavery. We know the GOP base hates black people being considered equals. It is not like we don't have precedents for such policy decisions.
Are you 17 years old? Go write fairy tales rather... Your knowledge of history is poor at best.  It's black people that control the NPA and police now, that kill black people, just like in the 70's and 80's.
...(cont'd from above)...   John O’Donnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump’s criticism of a black accountant in his 1989 book: "Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day…I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.”   Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama — the country’s first black president — was not born in the US. He even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama's birth certificate.  Trump has repeatedly referred to Mexican immigrants as “criminals” and “rapists”, plans to build a border wall & force Mexico to pay for it, repeatedly referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas” due to her Cherokee ancestry, called for a complete ban on all Muslims entering the US  (cont'd below)....
White people were never the slaves of black people nor do white people suffer broad institutionalized racism from black people.  To equate "white shaming" with "racism" is ignorant and another form of racism. You should be shamed for thinking they are equal sides of the same coin.
Why did he get the establishment peace prize for, being half black?  Obuma's legacy is a failure, he was neutered in the last  primaries and supported an unelectable candidate - oooops.  One must thank Trump for his handling of North Korea and unifying Russia/China. Yes my friends actions do speak much louder than words and cash bribes.  I say great work Trump, the hell with establishment and its endless hysteria
Every parent has seen how a baby cries to get what it wants . The baby doesn't know any other way to communicate .  Now we see first hand who the adult babies are---the democrats.   Can you even imagine what would have happened had the republicans staged a sit-in over Obamacare ?    The most stupid part of the democrats baby like show boating is that no new laws would have stopped the latest mass shooting . Nor would they stop the next.   It's a sad joke for them to show photo's of those poor victims in Orlando when ten times that many are slaughtered in black on black crime in Chicago every year . Where are their protests over that ? Even Black Lives Matters doesn't care about the massive numbers of black lives lost there. Many are innocent lives . Chicago has strict gun laws and look how much good that does.   Democrats in congress aren't even following their own rules of conduct by staging this sit-in , yet they expect the public to follow the rules they make for us ? Pathetic !
he's an ISIS terrorists! He fought for ISIS a caliphate. Now, who's the group the Nevada guy fought for but of himself? Do you know his affiliation with any terrorist group than theDonald could go after? The Nevada guy terrorist group died with him, lol. Oh wait! It's the WHITE man! But the Black mass of murders in Chicago is 10 times the amount the White man killed! Where's your distaste of the Black Man killings going on in Chicago?
Scalia never allows blacks in his fictional militia either.
C'mon lets be honest - "Tough on Crime" is right-wing code for "tough on black, brown, and poor people."
He's black dude. Minimum of 6 years.
"The facts are most of the consumption of deep fried food occurs in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods." Where's your evidence Harvey? Are Jews stingier? Blonds dumber? Mexicans violent rapists? I have a PhD Harvey but that's no guarantee of anything. Most of the time common sense is sufficient. When's the last time you went to a minority neighborhood to "observe the shape" of the inhabitants? Common sense says never. You don't need a PhD to look up "stereotype" Harvey.
Translation: A predominantly black school makes inflammatory and false accusations about the conduct of a predominantly white school and community and the blame belongs with the victim because of their mascot.  Not only that but the school who had false accusations leveled at them is told to make up wrongdoings, punish people for those made up actions, apologize, and institute a program to be tolerable of other races.  Are you freaking serious?
If black lives matter, why do more blacks shoot blacks? What is the purpose of this kind of thinking? Hey N.....r, yeah you N.....r Im gonna bust a cap in your A.., I'm gonna shoot you Motherf..... They have the freedom they have wanted for years, look at the race now, a few are  giving a bad name to the ones that are good, responsible and honorable people. You just don't hear about them in the news, only the bad ones.  A peaceful riot, it always starts out as, even though it's a black cop that shoots a black suspect, why destroy things? YOU few are giving your race a bad name. So a few of you destroy a cop car that sometime in the future could come to save you. So you destroy a store that you and your neighbors count on to be there when you need to shop. What is your purpose to destroy? Ask Kappernick for some money to help you oppressed people, he has plenty.
School children should certainly not have to put up with being called names.  Any thoughts on the black people calling for white people to be burned in the Knysna fires, Siseko?
It is clearer each day that he's off the rails...my favorite rant was when he was saying that the cameras were turning off becuase they couldn't handle the truth...as we were watching the live feed stay on on CNN. I'm sure the Faux folks were agreeing with him but the truth was CNN and others broadcast it all live...and we now have more evidence that he's a nut job, a braggart, throwing himself a pity-party for all to see. This is not 'very presidential' as he is fond of noting about himself in a strange self-reference. He was a very poor choice by those bamboozled by 'pizza-gates' and other dreak from the alt-wrong side of the space cadet class...or Russian hackers, take your pick. So a small crowd, a few thousand, saw him implode and loved him for it...cool! And the 'Blacks for Trump' guy turns out to be seriously deranged...do they know? Or more important, do they care? I see that the majority of voters say they would have been better off with Hillary as President -- Ya think!
Did you tell CNN and NBC thanks for using their worthless talking points?  The amount of out of working Americans has never been bigger, the amount of people on food stamps has never been bigger, the violence among black has never been worse.The world laughs at us and thinks we're wimps because under Obama we are, The we have suffered multiple terrorist attack on American soil under his watch. He created ISSI, he's brought in terrorist into the country and set them up on the backs of working people. He lied about Obamacare and makes the working pay for the freeloaders. You can't keep your doctor or your insurance. He has divided this country by race like never before. He paid ransom to Iran and has aloud them to have nukes in 10 years. He's a joke and an embarrassment. Duh!
It was more cost effective to rape black, female, slaves and enslaving their children, than buying adult slaves. Rape was just a business decision and fun. The memoirs of Mary Chestnut mentions how white wives of slave owners didn't like the fact that so many of their slaves looked like their husbands.
What do Obama,John Lewis and Loretta Lynch have in common? Failed black politicians spouting their mouths off!
Now they can all migrate from football (they really won't, but...) to NASCAR, a sport specifically designed for the low information voter and hey!, no pesky black people.
That's not true at all, Philobiblon. The press is mainly interested in overthrowing our President.  Where is the howling of the press for Trump to condemn Black cop killers, as they did for the white supremacists?
There is no comparison of death of 500 blacks in Chicago black on Black Death and 2 unarmed blacks killed by police in one year The problem is no fathers perpetrated by Chicago democrats
This is absolutely ridiculous, if someone flys a flag who cares??? But If blacks wear their malcolm x that's ok right???? Some blacks are more racist than whites!!!
Obama had no answers for anything!  But, psychopaths voted for him because he is half black!  And now you want to tear down a real president?
No, not when its senseless. I have no f**king clue what you're trying to say with that one liner about the President and his supporters. His supporters have IQs far in excess of those of the ungrateful imbeciles who refuse to stand for the national anthem, and his supporters understand that you don't put political party agenda before respect for your country, another aspect that the football and basketball players (and those who support them) do not have the intellectual capacity to understand. On top of all that, Trump's supporters understand that the stated excuse for the protests is a lie in itself. In nearly every case where a Black person has been shot by a policeman, if the suspect simply complied with what the officer asked him to do, said "yes sir", and then asked for an attorney once they got to a police station, they would have survived the entire episode. The police are not racist, the suspects are imbeciles. This is who the athletes support.
that excuse of " because I'm black " is over used already . That line could've worked during the 60's and 70's but not during these times. Get a life!!!
Gary, it's human nature to want to feel good about ourselves. If someone doesn't have self-esteem, the only way to feel better is to put someone else down. Indians, Blacks, Chinese, Jews, Mexicans. Poor people, women, diff-abled. There will always be groups of people whose only sense of self-worth will come from targeting someone they feel is lesser-than.
Imagine if America wasn't filled with millions and millions of Negros.  They are an indisputable black mark on the history of this country.
Then why did the Declarations of Secession of Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas all declare that the white race was superior to the black race and the black race being enslaved was the only way they could exist in America?  "Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. " - Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, March 21, 1861   I realize you're a Trump supporter so you probably don't appreciate things like "facts," but you could stand to crack a book sometime before you go online and make an ass out of yourself with your ignorance.
The question is not whether in the distant past, some have regarded black lives as not mattering to whites.  The question is:  Do black lives matter in the USA?  Do YOU  need reminding that black lives matter?  If so, then count yourself a racist, repent, and make amends.  Don;t include me in your allegation of white racism.  Just speak for yourself, please.
Obama's actions this week, as he slinks out the door, exposes the hidden  angry black man that he kept from view. His hatred for Netanyahu and Putin is only exceeded by his hatred for Trump.
Yeah, you're Exhibit A alright. Parroting the GOP talking point of (last) week: Never mind the president's sympathy for the "fine people" marching with Nazis and white supremacists. Look over there! It's Black Lives Matter! And how "horrible" they are to virtuous, non-racist, Confederate-monument-opposing white guys like you! It's so unfair! Really, Counselor?  Considering a majority of white voters (and Catholics!!) opted for the racist Trump, I rest my case.
That' right, But Lee was a traitor to the nation of his birth, which gave him his military education and rank. States' rights at that time meant legal enslavement of human beings for profit. If Lee had truly possessed character, he would have sided with the Union.  But a other have pointed out, Lee had adopted a commonly held belief that "negroes" were sub-human and incapable of living without the guidance of the white people. Today, at least some of us can see what a preposterous idea that is. but as recent events have shown us, we still have millions of people who still believe that white people are better than black people. How they can believe such a thing is beyond me, given the stupidity of white people we see every day.
You can't know how much I appreciate your comment, thanks.  After my mother accepted that I as a gay man--indeed human--and her loving son, she cringed and even shook every time DP spewed more of his radical Christian hate rhetoric. He is a radical, no doubt. Sooner or later her will go after divorced folks, blacks and on and on. His is ayatollah behavior. Be safe you and your brother.
Rupert is happy with the sales of the resident keepers. because now he can now again start campaigns for ramaphosa with a collection of looted money by blacks and buying book against Whites.
Walter, you are wrong. Lynching is part of American history and lynching was entertainment for white folks. Can you handle the truth? If not, please don't kill your loved ones in a murder suicide when you realize white folks, as a group, are not innocent. You all benefit from white privilege. If you don't know how to benefit from that privilege it is not the fault of black folks. Do you know that you benefit from such violence? They did lynching for white folks like you. Today, cops can get away with murdering black children. I guess that is a demotion for white folks. In the good old days, any white man could get away with murdering black folks with out needing a badge. That includes murdering black folks praying in church. It is clear that some white folks miss those privileges.
And people wonder why so many black people are in jail. It's because some of them commit vicious crimes and deserve to be incarcerated.  For life in this case.
Shooting to police,dui's  and not paying his taxes he must have some black in him because only black people would do something like that.
Against her religion for dog saliva to come in contact with her skin? One more black mark against Islam in my book.
Why are black women dispropotionally represented? Excellent question. I would suggest that it's because they have less access to contraceptives given the fact that they earn about 17% less than white women. They probably are less likely to have insurance as well.  Ironically pro-life attacks on Planned Parenthood will increase the number of abortions.   http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/
Sam Wallis.  If Trump were a Democrat (which he once was), the Democrats would be singing his praises--his success, his business acumen, his tough negotiating, his renegade methods to shake up a calcified system of government.  If GOP President Trump walked on water, they would criticize him for not swimming.  If he found the cure for cancer, they wold criticize him for ignoring Alzheimer's.  Democrats can't accept defeat, especially when they trusted the polls, ran a poor/corrupt candidate, and expected to be able to take credit for the first woman president along with the first Black president while continuing to play the race, gender, and all the other cards against the GOP.  That's what they can't get over, their own stupidly poor judgment.   Trump is struggling to find his way, but Americans who desire his failure aren't patriots.  They are the enemy within.  It's long past time for the Democrats to grow up and help Trump govern instead of inventing faux news and obstructing.
I wonder how many of these protesters are white hipsters who moved into the former black neighborhoods?
A gun recovered at the scene of the fatal shooting of a black man by police in Charlotte, North Carolina, was loaded and fingerprints, DNA and blood from the weapon matched those of the victim, CNN reported on Friday
Are thay going to let ......people that where in Miami when thay where 16 and had no money......??????? I was .....and ......why you running from east ..what you don't like black people? And why do I have to do a background check?????
black is beating a dead horse.  the decision has been made and the chief has decided to resign, what more is there?  most people agree that this was the right decision.  why do we need the details of the discussion?  not important.  this is silly.
The only lying fraud out there has been the lunatic left for the past 30-40 years. Martin Luther King said his dream was that his children will, "one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character." The left doesn't judge by the content of character. It's all about reverse racism. If it's black it's supported. The lunatic left has a pro-black bias. Even the cop hating criminal thugs who claim to be victims. The left judges by color. If it's black they get all loopy. And what's with commenting about Trump's color all the time? They always say he's orange as if it's a point against him. Sorry? He looks just fine to me. Trying judging by the content of his character but I'm sure that's too much to ask.
Seriously pathetic...will you be exhibiting guns..killings in Chicago...drug dealers...democratic slums..democratic suppression of blacks...he's NOTHING...what the hell is wrong with u ppl....
Rubbish, DACA was an executive order which was made because the republican congress refused to do anything with a black president.  So ok, you succeeded in getting the town butcher elected as president.  Now just fix it.  Pass a law republicans, lets see you do it.  I just love republicans, they have been so good at fixing problems.  (Not)
NEVER EVER HIRE A NEGROE FOR EMEGENCY CALLS,,,THEY THE NEGROES ARE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO MAN PHONES EVEN THO A MONKIE CAN DO IT,,,NEGROES ARE NOTHING MORE THAN FARM IMPLEMENTS IE COTTON PICKERS
As a white male who's Great Grandfather fought in the 2nd World War, against the Germans, how do i reconcile this statement?  "We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is racial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by whites, we can mold them to the program of the Communist Party. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the Negro minority against the whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the Negro will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause."  -1912 Israel Cohen  And there are plenty more from prominent rabbi's.  How many young white men have died for lie after lie? 9/11? Muslim terrorists in a cave ?
BLM has no legitimacy (members of the group probably have to look that term up as they have no idea what it means) as they only seem to show up when it suits them, not when they are needed like when gang violence takes a young black life in the streets.  Where are you then BLM???  I feel terrible for police officers who risk their lives every day to SERVE citizens no matter their race or religion.  BLM are promoters of systemic racism and it's sickening.  They will go away when the press stops giving the loudest angriest mob time that is undeserved.
..."if someone comes to my town and tries to preach hate, the white race, guns and a race-war, we are at that time when this is a threat to the community. They are terrorists in the making. Their kin in the KKK is ISIS." And of Course you also include the group Antifa, and you denounce their Marxism, Socialism, and stated desire to foment Violence to achieve their goals? They qualify as "terrorists in the making"...if (by definition; their own)...as well, "their kin is ISIS". Antifa is a clear threat to our community and Nation. I am also sure that you would include "Black Lives Matter"when they preach Hate, the Black race and a race-war-"kill the white cops! Fry em up like bacon"
LOL!  You're response shows you are even more clueless than I thought.  If you actually were a prosecutor and can see no racism in the system then you were part of the problem.  Apparently, you actually believe black and white criminals are picked up at equal proportions.
"Gay marriage" ... what a contradiction in terms ... but people think if they vote for it, it will be a reality... :))  It is a sad, very sad state of affairs, when people think that the truth about reality is a matter of majority vote. :)) You know ... like Supreme court decides, tat 2+2=5 :)), or Supreme Court decides that blacks are inferior ...     I find this sooo sad ... when people have to resort to the coercive force of the law (decided by majority vote) to twist reality into their image and likeness. What an extreme form of narcissism this is....       In every other area of life people would lough their heads of at such silliness, but when it comes to sexuality ... people eyes get glassed over ... and they start to see and think things ... very strange things .
i acknowledge the fact that this stereotype has been around for centuries, and persists today. no argument there. i was merely suggesting that there are many very influential (unfortunately) people in the black community who are themselves fueling the fire- taking the stereotype that white devils created, and not only living up to the stereotype, but are promoting it.  "man, this is how it is on the streets; this is all i know, so this is what i talk about in my 'music'." well, ya selfish asshole, how about taking some of the money you make- the profits made, by the way, through your choice to destroy your own people's culture via the message you're sending- and put it to good use. gee, i don't know, maybe try a positive message..?unfortunately "stay in school" and "do something positive with your life" go against the gangsta grain.  you can point the finger all you want to. maybe you'll gain some ground with that tactic. but when a large part of the problem is within, that's on you.
Black crimes matter
Fine, let's say for every one of the white supremacists at the rally there is 100 more in the closet and 1000 more who are active sympathizers to the idea that all blacks and jews should be murdered.  That's about 110,000 people.  Sound better?  Again, there are 325 million people in the USA.
Even Africans? You clearly have never met someone from Africa and are lieing out of your ass, most of them have a ‘we did it why can’t you’ ignorance towards African Americans. Same as most international Hispanic people. Just like every white person who has never gotten to know a single African American and judges them off of what the media puts in front of them. You guys really enjoy making things up.
The article fails to mention that there is a massive dose of present-day political indoctrination contained in the recommended replacements for the classical literary works in question.  The novel titled "Indian Horse" centres on a Canadian First Nations boy who survives the Indian residential school system without getting murdered there by the white man who ruined everything for native folks.  The book titled "Stone Thrower" centres on a black man spending time in 1970s Canada and the USA trying to succeed in a career but who is kept down by the white man, and his black daughter growing up in 1990s Ontario and the racism she faces in the high school cafeteria and reflections thereof, comparing racism in modern America to racism in modern Canada, the white man ruining things for visible minorities.    Visible minorities good. White man bad. The social justice warriors must be ecstatic with these choices. Next up in literature class: Pin the tail on the racist white man.
"Why would any woman sympathize with Islam, Bill Clinton or Bill Cosby….. all womanizers?" Islam, Democrat, black. Are there any other womanizers of note?
1857, how far back do you need to go.  Recent shootings of police is what prompted my concern, the latest was a black killing a black cop.  Also I feel strongly there is a lot more to this than we are being told.
But black people gun down black people every day and sports teams are silent on it as is BLM--cops have a dangerous job and the bad guys have guns and yes some black crooks will get shot trying to kill the cops.
Knock off your cherry picking, oldvalleyguy.  Many of the black men and teenagers that were gunned down by white police officers were unarmed and not resisting arrest.  Almost all of the cases had bystanders or witnesses video taping the murders.  Videos don't lie, over adrenaline police officers lie and manage to beat their murder wrap.  I can easily understand why protesters take to the streets rallying for justice.  And by the way, the liberals aren't the ones passing open carry or concealed gun laws.  You can't have it both ways hypocrite.  You must've left your morals in the military locker room.
So you agree that these black districts are dangerous?  http://web.csulb.edu/~astevens/posc100/files/notes/nc12.jpg
LOL!!  and you believe all of that crap?  get real!   Trump is liquid.  He owes a few hundred $million, and his loan to values are about 10%.  His net worth is in the multi-$Billions. That means that 90% of what he has is free and clear.  He generates income.  He builds luxury apartments.  He lists them for sale before they are finished and whomever shows up with the $Millions gets them, no matter where they come from, or what  color they are.  Americans?  OK! Russians? OK!  Chinese?  OK!  Asians?  OK!  Blacks?  OK!  Whites?  OK! ...etc.   That is the ethical American way, in case you didn't know that.  He also owns multiple Golf Courses around the world.  ANYONE can play there, black, white, brown yellow, red.  It doesn't matter.  Your fake news without sources is just that- fake news.
Another arch Liberal blames someone else for his hate speech. It's not unlike Hillary blaming the women her husband abused. Or Barack Obama  when he blamed White people for Black crime, or when he blamed Americans for Muslim terror.
Yes, great party town, but I wouldn't want to live there. Rude workers, rude customers, rude waiters demanding 25% tips, way too many shopping centers in every casino. less and less water, broken escalators, sneering or uncaring front desk and security people, and so on. Wouldn't want your kids to grow up there. Full of unwanted kids, anyway. Worst part is I miss the $1 breakfasts and $5 buffets from back in 1970. Now all gone and the prime rib Popo gives you only thin one piece slice. Too many immigrants who don't even speak Engrish. Notice there's fewer and fewer blacks and whites. Plenty of Chinese immigrants and automated blackjack machines with robot dealers on the movie screens. Ugh! Mo beddah play the casinos games on my computer or on those battery operated toys from Long's. No can use money on the.
I do not like any of the dark groups, BLM is a good example . They are a racist group who are demanding black people take power by beating on white people . Africans as a group are murdering their own people . That is what dark people do with power. No need to explain what goes on where large groups of Muslims gather.
She should be fired for continuing carding. Carding is a racist practise that targets Blacks. Blacks are harassed, intimidated, and sometimes shot. Shame. #BlackLivesMatter
"Young black men are treated like enemy combatants by police and vigilantes rather than as someone in their custodial care"  On this very site three years ago, I counseled a young man that if he were ever arrested, to be respectful and non-confrontational.  My advice was met with extreme hostility, the young man insisting that he would push back if he thought the arrest was invalid.  That's the mentality among many street-thugs, and it explains a lot of police shootings.  This is not to deny that some police actually do commit murder, so don;t misconstrue what I'm saying.  Damn; I wish I could stop using the ; key instead of the '.  Pardon me.
If I wanted to see BLM play a game, I'd watch reruns of protests where they murder innocent people and burn/loot businesses - or head down to the local hood and watch the thugs for free. Question: what made black players think that the average American values the NFL and it's Rastafarian-looking tattooed freaks OVER their own country? Black people might, but that's 15% of the population. The NFL will be left with liberals and blacks for fans... pay cut coming, or my personal favorite, unemployment.
This is ridiculous, hiding Hilary behind her sex. I will attack anyone who has done what Trump did (which I didn't need to because he got chewed out earlier), and I will attack Hillary for what she has done. I don't care if they are a girl, Muslim, black, Christian, Mexican, gay, or anything in-between; I will never withhold criticism of actions. I was pointing out the hypocrisy of the statement Trump is bad role model so we should elect Hilary. I believe Hillary is worse, you can disagree and that's ok. But both are terrible role models, and her being a woman doesn't change that.
Yes, I know Republicans. Most of them are racists. They believe things like welfare mothers, gang members and drug users are all black or brown. That blacks are lazy, Asians are smart, white people were meant to rule. That has been my experience.
The Blacks think they are in Chicago.
What's ridiculous to most people about it is the impression created -- that entitled white men have nothing better to worry about than being excluded from a few screenings of a Wonder Woman movie.  Seriously, do you really think this is a hill to die on?  I mean put this in perspective:  Black men in the US are protesting being routinely killed by police, indigenous men all over NA are protesting treaty rights and land claims, and entitled white men are protesting not being allowed in a few screenings of a movie.  And then they wonder why people are mocking them.
Since all black people are the same, then Michelle agrees with all rap lyrics.  Of course!
Here we go again, another black face caught up in criminal behavior.  And no this isn't a racist statement.  Nearly every high criminal act that's been occurring is either perpetrated by a black or Samoan.  FACT.
When you have NO evidence that in these days, whites in general do NOT believe that black lives don;t matter, and there is ample evidence that in general whites believe that black lives DO matter, it is a vicious racist lie.  More than 150 years ago, scores of thousands of white boys died to end slavery.  Jim Crow followed in some places, yes, but it was whites who ruled those laws unconstitutional.  Then there was busing, and "race norming" (giving an applicant for a federal job more points on a test merely for being black), and affirmative action in college entrance and private sector jobs.  And you still say that whites in general believe black lives don't matter.  Where is the everyday killing of blacks by whites?  Where is the everyday wanton maiming of blacks by whites?  Your statements reveal the utter moral bankruptcy.  I will continue to treat blacks as equals, as human beings, with respect and courtesy, despite your best efforts to make me hate.  You failed miserably.
Planned Parenthood was created by Margaret Sanger who said she created it to kill black people off. An organization that was created to kill members of a certain race calling someone a racist for supporting a black woman kinda speaks for itself.
How do you explain the racist insults hurled by men in Edmonton against a black journalist?  Or do you simply excuse such behaviour.
Of course.  Blacks!
You're correct that when white people are dying, a law enforcement problem (when black folks were dying) morphed into a public health emergency.
Maybe it's because black girls can spread their legs easier.

Fredrica...Go back to the Ghetto where you belong....You are not even worthy of being called a black American...
what's the big deal. blacks are 70% of NFL and 80% of NBL and majority  and majority  of murders. just a statistic.
Fag,dyke,queer,homo. Kids learn the behavior at home. They also learn kyke,nigger,slut,retard and so many slurs and derogatory names that they can't all be listed. Kids - or whomever uses them - or whomever bullies the "lesser than" or "different from" probably suffer from low self esteem and fear. Sometimes it carries in to adulthood. Insecure people need a target. As for Trump and his tiny...... hands -  fodder for ridicule, as Trump like to project all things Trump as being the biggest and the greatest. Size matters to some - to Trump more than most let on. I didn't interpret Colbert's remark as homophobic. The holster issue occurs across the board in sexual behaviors. It would have been just as plausible that someone would say the same about Hillary. Crass, inappropriate in any case, but not necessarily homophobic..
I don't care if we see this as racist or whatever the hell you said. What I can't stand is that we have this black history month and gay pride month, what the hell. Where is white pride month? The fact that we months set aside for the people who have a different skin color or the fact that we have a month set aside for people who like the same gender. That is BS. Where is the white appreciation month, where is a Military  appreciation month? I don't care how much crap I will get for this but this is all BS, if you have a problem with me, my name is Logan Hanner, come look me up!
75% of the NFL is black males, 6% U.S. population is black males, 21% of crime is done by black males, 51% of murders is done by black males. Maybe white fans should take a knee to protest the real problem because it isn't the country or the flag or the police that's causing the problem.
Is this the pot calling the kettle black? Only idiots would run an outfit like ISIL.
Your continued lies are what is disgusting. The killer of the five Dallas police officers was blacklisted by Black activist groups.
Bullshit.  If you are black the rules are different.
If ethnicity, age, citizenship, skin colour and economic status are relevant in one case (e.g poor, black or brown, Middle Eastern born in Canada) they should equally be applied each time, so in this case, millionaire white American born in the USA) should be applied each time this act of terror is referred to.
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI! - Hypocrisy is worse than racism.
Real news. Hate it when black clad fascists interfere with free speech! https://youtu.be/2gCntTniJgo
Dinerstein is a anti poor ......anti black ...person
What you wrote shows you did not listen or follow along with the narration of what occurred. On a serious note I am NOT defending Nazis. I am stating reality, which you willfully ignore.  What you and the other trolls keep ignoring is that I have stated many times here I am from a multi-racial family. We are black, white, Mexican, Jewish, et al. I also had a family member murdered by the KKK, so save your ignorant accusations for those in your bubble. People like you are as ignorant as the racists because you only believe what you want, reality had no part in it.
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI!
They didn't bother suing the cop because they knew the suit would go nowhere. Clearly, you don't have a clue about what it is like to be black in the US. I wish I could sit you down with my daughter-in-law or her parents.
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI! - Hypocrisy is worse than racism.
They look at them as a Democratic Vote. The Same way that LBJ approved Equal Rights for the Blacks. Democratic Votes ...
A. You can NOT get HIV from spit, you are spreading falsehoods and that is dangerous. B. The TPS as an institution has been racist, homophobic, transphobic and have targeted people of colour for carding in record numbers, far exceeding the population. That the police chief is black or any other colour does not guard him from being a police officer first and foremost. I assume you have heard of the 'blue line' where officers protect each other even if it lacks the truth of the situation. You really should look up the incident that was captured on video tape and there are many, many others that are not recorded. And C. to your point that the police are not a minority or cultural group...EXACTLY! and that is why they have no standing to be in the Pride parade unless they are GAY cops and then, very welcome. Perhaps you have never been hassled and good for you, probably white privilege but many others are on a regular basis. Again, the TPS are the ones that need to step up, not Pride.
Since most interracial rape and homicide are black-on-white, I'd say yes, we need a WLM movement.
Then of course, there is the "mirror" site, "black opinion" where the "B O staff writer" is either the same "staff writer" of the WMC leaks articles, or has no problem with plagiarism. The notion that Sam Sole has ever been suspected of being an apartheid spy is just rubbish. http://blackopinion.co.za/2016/10/31/amabhungane-bull-dogs-white-capital/  It's hard to keep comments civil. These "publications" are all part of a scheme to rob of this country blind - and it is all those people who had to bear the brunt of apartheid who get the worst of it. Whoever is publishing this rubbish  is complicit in the crime.
"Playing the victim." Ever work in the feild you will hear those words out of abusers mouths like clockwork as justification. That's standard abuser lingo. I agree it's time to stop playing the victim lol, my personal opinion is to cut them down but I don't think my personal opinion should dictate to others situations I know nothing about. As stated by the amazing woman this article is written about, "it's not black and white." At 18 and a parent what were her options? All I know if you just made an abuse victim feel that much worse about herself. WTF man, have some compassion.
If you noticed, he said both sides were to blame.  How does that equate to support for Neo-nazism and violent racism?   Do you support blacks killing cops and other white people?
Blacks should be profiled.  Theycommit a hughely disproportionate amount of violent crime in America.  Stastistics overwhelmingly bear that out.
Okay, you're defining "conspiracy theory" differently than I do. To me those are just examples of media being ignorant and/or in the pocket of government and not doing their job uncovering pretty normal (though often criminal and/or evil) government secret operations or political strategies. Since most secret plans by definition involve co-conspirators, I can see your point.    In my view "the government created HIV" is a conspiracy theory, as is "the government created crack to destroy blacks," or "chemtrails." That sort of thing.   What makes a "conspiracy theory," to me, is the lack of substantive cui bono. A person or people suspects "X" of doing "Y" for some inchoate, yet grandiose, purpose. There's typically reams of "evidence" for the means, but nothing really rational for the purpose. No defined end game, just underpants' gnome logic.
It's easy for a white person to claim another ethnicity commits all the crime, just as easy as it is for a black person to cop-out and say the white man is holding them down, and ADN's consistent omission of ethnicity details is borne of the stupidity of others. If a person commits a crime, ADN has the moral obligation to tell the public whether they are white, samoan, black, or Cree Indian. ADN Pay attention: not including these details make you look like a bunch of idiotic college-level SJW's that are committing the intrapersonal crime of cultural appropriation, being offended on another culture's behalf-and being overly sensitive. Grow up and do the work, enough is enough.
Being white became a unifying agent for the folks that Europe didn't need or want. The easiest way to become white was to learn to fear and hate black folks. Of course, any racial minority will do in a pinch. This country has been a giant affirmative action program for white people. That also means that all lives don't matter here and never have. We still have a lot of work to do to become a "more perfect union". Trump is the preferred candidate of white racists so we won't get there in the next 4 years. They have re-entered public life with his election.
Well Richard,  His skin color has everything to do with it. When he was elected for his first term ,all of the racist came storming out of the closet and haven't turned back. If you can't see that, then you are one of them. Obama didn't fail at anything, it was all hate from day one. He kept his cool, so he'd not be labeled the angry black man, and the I told you so crowd, couldn't say 'see what I mean'. Like AKJammer first instinct was to blame Obama for something he had nothing to do with. If it wasn't for all the hate, Obama would be labeled the G.O.A.T. POTUS!
Of course they think that Alaska natives are uneducated. Their leader thinks that all black people are "uneducated" and live in "inner cities."  The GOP is the official party of vile racism.
Well Gary, If being tired of the ignorance those on the left constantly display and being annoyed by the lies they propagate defines me as a 'bigot' so be it... I don't see a genuine reason to buy into the term. As far as being a racist - NOT a chance. Most of the liberals we are hearing from during this election and post election time are the true racists. It isn't a 'black or white' thing anymore, it's gone far beyond that. For the RECORD - I care about the 2nd amendment and so do millions of other people... The CRAP about women being 'second class citizens' is just that. Trump has a great track record towards women, do some research and actually check it out instead of believing all the left wing garbage. Of course there are racists across our country - I'm betting more on the left than right. Every time i debunk some crap a left wing nut posts they end up calling me names - including racist - they don't seem to like the truth for some reason so using the 'R' word is their defense.
Yes, slavery may still exist in one form or another throughout the world, but to confront the reality that slavery is alive and well in Africa in 2017.....where blacks may be enslaving other blacks...is....disheartening.
White people generally allow their police to abuse suspects of color, including with deadly force, when it is not required.  Police don't get a free pass anymore, or won't if white voters take the BLM demands to heart.
If this dude was black they would have smoked him.
BLM=bullies.  Where are BLM when blacks kill blacks? Where was BLM when the black female police officer was shot and killed by a black man in Florida?
LOL Women who hate feminists are like black plantation workers who hated abolitionists. Maybe feminists are trying to put some light into the darkness and keep the Church from emptying out.
Home Depot and Lowes must remove rope and chain. Rope and chain are serious "triggers"  American blacks will not succeed until they quit playing the victim.
Jeff Sessions is well known for judging people by the  color of their skin, and judging black Americans as unfit to share public accommodations, including public schools, with white people. Also Sessions is a shameless liar, claiming to have desegregated public schools. The content of his character isn't up to the standards Lynch upheld.
The Civil War monuments of Gettysburg are next for the Army of Antifa, race- baters aad black historians to attack. It has stopped being the history of slavery and the Confederacy   but about eradicating anything old. They  can't change history, but they can try to create something else  to replace it.
Not clear what your point is.  Seems to me that if you're dead, who did it doesn't make much difference.  You're just as dead.  I'm trying to have a rational conversation here without taking sides.  There are cultural issues in play here that aren't being talked about, and the Democratic party engineered them, I believe, to keep blacks poor and dependent on Democrats.  It's called the poverty trap.  After WWII, the unemployment rate for black men fell steadily up to 1965.  When the welfare programs started, the black unemployment number leveled off and the number in poverty began to increase because it paid better.  The blacks were set up to fail by the Democrats.  They created a situation that made crime the logical thing to do.
Trump is a super dumb ass mental case who will get all of us on this planet killed, or do it himself. Please white folks, come to your senses and choose another Great White Hope. We (brown and black folks) mean ya'lls no harm
Are you a white person talking about what the black community thinks?  Go sit down. ALL the way down.
You are talking out of your arse again kirigirl.  If it was that simple don't you think we would have done that years ago?  Wake up and smell the black powder, Trumpster is coming and he has baking powder up his nose.   Game over!
They don't care for this country. They are just so happy because they think he is going to be the Messiah of whites who will save them from immigrants,  Hispanics, Black and so on.
Sorry, Mr. Berg, Hobby Lobby was wrong.  It put us on to a slippery slope.  So now I can discriminate for those things I can use religion was my back-up.  Don't forget how many preachers (priests?) used the Bible as justification for slavery.  So now I am free to exclude anyone be they gays, Blacks, Hispanics or anyone else who doesn't appeal to my fancy.
1/ Now that is some major nonsense right there. Trump didn't need to explicitly endorse white supremacy to dog whistle to white supremacists. Lee Atwater's explanation of the Southern Strategy is helpful.  <blockquote> You start out in 1954 by saying, “Nigger, nigger, nigger.” By 1968 you can’t say “nigger”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “Nigger, nigger.”</blockquote>  https://www.thenation.com/article/exclusive-lee-atwaters-infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/  Neither did Trump personally have to have to "agree" for white supremacy to assume a central role in his campaign.
How is Trump racist when his ex gf of 2 years was black?  Sure a racist will go with a black woman for 2 years.  know your facts
this is wrong, this dude killed someone in tonga and should be tried for his crime.  he is subject to the laws of tonga.   just because he is white,  trump's government is protecting him, if he were black, he would be extradited immediately.  why should this murderer be allowed to go free and possibly kill others in America.  another racist conduct by trump.  hope he hangs so justice will be served.  so stupid.  tillerson is a joke just like Kelly who defamed a congresswoman and does no want to apologize,   what a coward.
Trump is Hitler incarnate.  The Fourth Reich begins Januar 20, 2017.  He has already announcedhis targets:   Mein Trumpf Vol. One: A Reckoning 1. The Hispanic Peril 2. The Arab Peril 3. The Black Peril 4. The Female Peril ...
So whats next, a play where the black President gets lynched? These are very sick people in NYC.
Are you saying that the valley was racist because there has not been a black person voted in before now?  Maybe no black person ran or no black person was as qualified.  Why does it have to be racist?  Also, as for the comments he heard from strangers like the little girl...everyone has heard comments from strangers.  Stop painting the valley as racist just because of a few unnecessary comments by ignorant people.  I will bet if any white person lived in a predominately black area, there would be comments also.  Does not make the area racist.  Keep fanning the flames though.  I am sure that it helps.  NOT!
It is so sad that someone would have to endure such extreme violence and hatred as "foul mouthed demonstrations." Instead, these liberals whine about non-important stuff like wanting to be regarded as human beings.  And in the case of black lives matter...actually believing they should not be murdered by police.  Such snowflakes they are
There are so many things wrong with this article that I don't even know where to begin, this is truly a CNN level of fake news.   The rapes at the Swedish music festival were committed by immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, which is the reason police are investigating the immigrant connection. Muslim men have been committing huge numbers of rapes since Sweden made the mistake of admitting so many members of a 'rape culture' into their country.  As far as violence being committed against women and minorities every day by white men, the group most responsible for murdering black men in the US, by a wide margin, is other black men.   The wage gap is a myth. More men are raped every year than women. Far more men die every year in war, industrial accidents, murders and suicides than women. The 'testosterone empire' you're whining about really isn't a great advantage for men.  Yes, female-only screenings are sexist. Try having a male-only screening of Batman, and see how that goes.
So then logic dictates that "Black Silence Kills", by not standing up for the Police when the "Black Lives Matters"group promotes killing cops....and also when Muslims do Not stand up against Muslim Terrorists. It too could then Logically be termed : "Muslim Silence Kills".
In fact "Black Americans are twice as likely as white Americans to be unarmed when police kill them"  "Overall, police shot and killed 978 people in the yearlong period that immediately followed Kaepernick’s first protest, according to the Post. Black Americans made up roughly 21 percent of the victims"  Since Blacks are just 13% of the population, clearly they are being killed at a disproportionate rate. And let me remind you of the skin color of the Las Vegas shooter, Dylan Roof, Timothy McVeigh, the Sandy Hook shooter, the Columbine shooters..............  Yes, police are targeting black men and they are being killed at a disproportionate rate no matter how you want to spin it.  Get real.
The players are employees, and the owner can introduce a new policy.  ESPN, not a conservative network, suspended one of it's host for violating a company policy, regarding social media. What's the difference form suspending an employee, or benching an employee? Oh, the ESPN employee is black and female, a doubled protective class.
"white trash"! Wow! If black was substitute for white the term would be seen as racist. But then again only whites can be racist, right?
No mention of the race of those involved? Any bets the shooter is black and the cop white?  Because if it were the other way around, guaranteed race would be highlighted. Lets see if I am wrong.
APD keep an eye open on this as it looks like a couple of these thugs have some ties with the Samoan and Sudanese thugs and in looking at how they interact with each other i sure one nigga is going to try and outdo the other nigga .lol as they say to each other
You were clearly slamming President Trump.  If he was a old black woman, would you call him that?  So you hope for more diversity in power?  Would that include Sarah Palin, Ben Carson and Caitlin Jenner?
We're talking about black on black and white on white crime here, genius. And the rate for white on white crime is higher than black on black crime. Why do you get so butthurt about simple facts?
HabFan, most of Ralph's comment had to do with black pioneers in Ontario.  Orthodox jews and mennonites take their religion seriously, too - do you find them ridiculous, too - and laugh at them online?
Yes. The fiasco is going to be worse than the Bush/Cheney economic collapse, Katrina and 9/11.. They will need at least 5 Black Presidents to clean up the mess....................
You wrote:  <<How could you have thought for even a split second that I was under a "professional duty" to go around to public schools warning kids about the consequences of federal crack charges?>>  It seems like an utterly reasonable assumption to me. You think educating the public about the law is outside your professional sphere? Uh, OK.  You wrote:  <<But you assume that I and the great majority of whites need to be reminded that black lives matter. As I said, that in itself is a hateful, racist charge.>>  BS!! Racism is a profound social problem, and many white people are simply in denial or indifferent about it. So yes, it's important to note that black lives matter. You seem confused about what racism is, and your insistence that BLM is ratcheting up racial tensions is histrionic. Maybe to white guys who think it's "racist" to point out that black lives matter. What exactly do you expect black people to do when they're treated as second-class citizens? Just sing the blues?
I've never even SEEN a black person in Warsilla...LOL  I thought they were banned there... Good for him!
No half the country does not agree with stella.  Also, her talking smack about liberals, and the young is a really great way to build those bridges and stop the angry rhetoric right? I mean she only starts the conversation belittling those on the other side.   Also, it is the liberals fault for what happened under Obama? We formed tea partys and wanted to block everything the communist/muslim/kenyan/black/socalist/dictator/idiot Obama did right? We created that atmosphere?  I am sick to death of the right wing attempting to pin their negative attitude of the last 8 years on the left. The only reason they are doing this is a severe case of buyers remorse with Trump. Trump is doing exactly what he said he would and now they are realizing how badly it will affect them, but they can't attribute blame to their ignorance of his policies. They whine about how everyone so mean and how Trump is so awesome, even when present evidence to the contrary.
You speak for black people? You missed my point about the twmifications of legal discrimination.  It is very simple, the baker is asking to be able to legally discriminate. That is un-American.
The President was unequivocal. He said on all sides. That not only included the KKK and neo nazi party, but also black lives matter and antifa
Black folks are hunted by the police, whether they are racists or not. They have a license to kill us.
big surprise, another black criminal.
lying  black  bastard,  happy?
The 2nd Amendment is a white privilege. Black folks are shot on the mere suspicion of being armed. That includes black children.
You mean Nixon care?  It hasn't failed although it needs to be improved.  Shame republicans are so incompetent.  Yes Hawaii is a democratic state so most of government is controlled by democrats.  So what?  What makes you think republicans would not be far worse?  I remember the days when Hawaii was controlled by republicans.   As my mother used to say, try and find an Asian or black member at Oahu Country Club.  Discrimination anyone?  No problem.   And as for the federal budget, yes that is all republicans.  Clinton left the country with a balanced budget but you so called fiscally responsible republicans blew it up and finally left the country with a trillion plus deficit.  What hypocrites you are.  Disgusting!
Cosby gives Blacks a bad name, no? After reading so many techniques he used with his star celebrity status, he is the BEST rapist I have ever heard of. Wonder if someone will write a crime story about him when more facts come out in the trial. It's going to be a challenger to the OJ Simpson trial. Please do hurry up and start it. I don't want him or I to die of old age too soon. It's going to be a fascinating trial. What I'm curious about are these questions. Were these women given monetary gifts afterwards? Were they looking forward to an adventure of being "raped" by a black man, especially a Hollywood celebrity? But were angry that they fell asleep and missed the fun? Why did they continue to stay if they realized they entered a room full of only well-dressed black men? Were these victims angry because they gave sex thinking they were going to get glamour or well-paying jobs? Prepare yourselves. He may just get ACQUITTED.
What a bunch of crap ever since we had a Black Muslim President from Kenya for 8 yrs. These jerks trying to follow the Jive Man ways. { Oh it is o'kay a male can go into a woman rest-room, It is okay to use drugs, all the bull crap he spread thru our nation some people are still trying follow  his ways. Enough is Enough People back our old respectful ways of America.
Vader Jakob:  now you are binary, I am the least politically correct person you are likely to encounter:  Being anti-NP in the 80's did not mean I was pro-ANC or pro-black Being anti-ANC now does not mean I am anti-black or anti-poor  though, I will admit a strong bias against short dumb fat people and snakes
This editorial is spot on. Folks, we fought a war against white nationalists. I was curious as to what was being chanted in Charlottesville. I watched the HBO special called Race and Terror. If all I heard were the chants it would've been enough. However, the white nationalists that were interviewed claimed Jews and black people must be kicked out of the Nation. They firmly stated that our Nation was built for white people.  Only they made our Nation great. I've read portions of Mein Kampf. These people mimicked the words I read.  I guess our WWII veterans were alt-left. Ridiculous. It has nothing to do with left or right. It's simply right and wrong. Trump was horribly, horribly wrong. No good people marched with the Klan, white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville. I expect others to counter-march and not tolerate this BS. Let me tell you I'm a senior citizen and I know Nazis when I see them. We lost too many good warriors in WWII to let this disgrace go unnoticed.
They ( liberals ) are trying to destroy our freedom by divide and conquer. They are implementing racism on all sides where there is none. Did anyone notice its white liberals doing this? They are stoking the fires of racism to gain votes for the democratic party. The democrats, antifa, are pimping the black man to do their bidding. They are using you. They are using us all. They are practicing the same technique they have used to topple governments all over the world DIVIDE, AND CONQUER. Unity is their worst enemy, and the media is their machine gun.
Black Lives Matter is a pile of garbage that is reportedly saying its members feel unsafe around cops and so the cops have to go way.  Apparently the irony is lost on them, that what they are reportedly saying towards cops is historically what white folks were saying about black folks in the southern states...  ... don't feel safe around you, you have to go away.  So much for inclusion. Black Lives Matter is comparable to the Klan.
The ultimate irony with the Hebdo cover is that literally thousands of Texans fought and died in WWII, many on French soil including during D-Day to help liberate France from the real Nazis, Hitler's Nazis, not some imaginary fake Texas Nazis who don't even really exist. Many of the dead flood victims were poor, African-American and Hispanic Texans who didn't have the means to escape, including that woman whose poor kid was clinging to her floating body before being rescued. That kid is black. Oh, but she "deserved" to see her mother die, it was "karma" because the state she happened to live in leans Republican and Trump got all their electoral votes. That's the sick, twisted logic of ignorant liberal-progressives.
So if they refuse to dance for a black official or a gay official, you are just as approving?
Very offensive username..."Taksipak(Big Black Person) "Usuk"(Whale penis).
and popolo's icon had to be black. coincidence?
The sad part is most black people in Baltimore won't do a thing to stop the violence due to being hypocrites. They burned down a portion of the city for a crack dealer (Freddie Gray) when the alleged perpetrators were white, but when black street thugs break into a black US veteran's home and execute him, it's no big deal and just another day in Bodymore, Murderland. No progress will be made until the black community drops the "us vs them" attitude and starts holding their own people accountable for their crimes.
I guess he's run out of black rappers, prosperity-gospel preachers, and hotep comedians to meet with; apparently those are the only black people that exists in his world.
If anyone, including those in the NHL don't want to be involved in the political ridiculousness, that is there choice. They are athletes. To say that Matthews is white privilege and he never experienced hardship, well you don't know if that's true. While he might not have gone through what Black people do, he may have had to deal with something else. As many people of all races do. I am for what Kapernick stands for. But I am also for everyone. Everyone is shooting everyone. Everyone is scared of everyone. And Trump has instilled more of a hate culture. And remember this idiot was voted in! As was another infamous dictator who instilled hate.
Some are now calling it "black lives murder"
Over 800 black males have been shot or killed by other black males in CHicago this year so far.   On a national level, black males are about 3000% more dangerous to each other than are cops. But the Globe, Clinton, Obama, BLM, and all other left wing political critics of Trump steadfastly never talk about it.
Black Lives Matter is a pile of garbage that is reportedly saying its members feel unsafe around cops and so the cops have to go way.  Apparently the irony is lost on them, that what they are reportedly saying towards cops is historically what white folks were saying about black folks in the southern states...  ... don't feel safe around you, you have to go away.  So much for inclusion. Black Lives Matter is comparable to the Klan.
"As George says....ignore the white nationalist and nazi protesters."  Yeah, I'm sure it is SO easy for Blacks and other minorities to just ignore the white nationalists and Nazis. Like really, what is their problem?  /sarc
All FBI stat's prove is that black life's don't matter, to BLM. 90% of blacks that are murdered, are murdered by blacks. I guess looking in the mirror, is like reading Alice in Wonderland. "remember what the dormouse said; feed your head..." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl89g2SwMh4
Yep, black people. That is why they are uspet. Am y of those weirdoes gaslight the protesters, saying thst what they feel and protest are not real. It is what abusive people do to keep their significant others close.  I shade conservative, but I have zero problem with protest.  I wonder why these “red blooded Americans” support Trump who hates veterans and war heroes and is a draft dodger and a coward. I guess they are hypocrites and hopelessly stupid.
Haha. I do know that Shelby Steele is black. And I have read your comments lo these many years. And you do possess, shall we say, intellectual ardor for the racist Trump. Therefore...
Except his statement starts with black and white law - that is not the gospel starting point; even for a bishop.  We are Christ-centric; build our church on relationships before we start *dis-inviting* people.  Sorry, a known public pronouncing racist is very different from folks in a gay marriage - your comparison alone is contemptible.
What a bunch of vomit. How about the cost of providing viagra - I notice you dont mention that. And the CBO study does not mention transgender soldiers at all, so citing it probably wasnt the best strategy here.  Every concern raised can be addressed in many ways besides an outright ban.    The worst part of this nonsense article is the idea that we should ban trans soldiers because other soldiers might not want to shower near them. Sorry, but that same argument could be applied to anything - like black soldiers, for example. We dont want to make the racists uncomfortable, do we?  This article is vomit.
Black lives matter is a pile of dung or do you actually think cops don't beat up people of other skin colors?  If black lives matter then perhaps they should try to educate their children more and take on leadership positions.  How you would feel about a 'white lives' matter campaign. Yeah, that's right.
LFS: If you think that racial discrimination ended in 1953 you should research redlining.   And as far as current efforts to address discrmination go, there are many as a quick internet search would reveal. One of the things this progressive is doing is speaking up when I encounter people, some of whom post on this forum, who think that blacks are more likely to engage in crime or other incivilities simply because they are black.
No, YOUR posts have been ranting about white people and "white supremacy" over a case about a Latino cop. You cried "murder" and provided no evidence. All you have done is parrot neo-Marxist narratives which came from Critical Race Theory circles.  You have SERIOUS racism issues. I'd love to see you rationalize how it's racist to assume is a criminal for being black but it's not racist to assume someone is being a racist if they're white, or even a brown cop.  You have issues. Big time.
So you agree that black children should be killed. I got it. So much for innocent until proven guilty. That is a white privilege too.
I beg to differ.   Blacks have been getting into spots that they may not be qualified for because of affirmative action and the like for decades now.
"We've seen criminal photos of blacks and Pacific Islander adults wanted or accused of felony crimes."  But we never see photos of white adults wanted or accused of felony crimes. LOL!!  Now crawl back in your hole racist.
What you've just described is the "progressive" approach to politics.  Their politics are so lacking in foundation that the only chance they have to get elected is to paint their opponents black.    Remember "Harper is dangerous"?  Really?  Stick-handling our economy through a world-wide recession to the best outcome of all G-7 countries is dangerous?    Remember, "Harper has a secret agenda"?  After 9 years in government, even those in the whispering character assassination campaign couldn't tell us what the secret was . . . but it didn't stop them whispering it to anyone stupid enough to believe it.  There are a lot of people who bought into the progressive's anti-Harper hysteria who now, upon sober reflection and having had to endure the futile government that is Trudeau Jr. for a couple of years, really miss having the cool hand of Harper on the tiller.
I agree that Lee was doing his duty and was an honourable man. However, the guys trying to stop the removal of his statue aren't interested in that, they are interested in a form of white control of the South and having the black people put back in their places.
We do have white racists, the big problem is that we have millions of black racists, also, who are calling out white racists, and are on the streets, every day,  proving that fact! Perhaps if it were only one race with racism,  we may be able to find a solution but, that is not the case!!
Freeheels, and Brills, what real name these folks live annonymously while being 18th century. First off Jack of trades is the senator is an American African, not an African American. For us constitutional idiots in the world, streets run two ways. The problem you have a white reporter, slim of the earth, Trump even hates them more than all the others on his list. Reporting the American victim s crime, I was assaulted by A minority, that is old as slavery, no. #1 in my America. Cops and you are quick to beieve Blacks folks kidnap, or do whatever the white host alleged, pure American horse manuer, won't see a white reporter aledge that of  trump or any white guys. Not a contest, equals out, so they throw those out. But mighty funny the agitator (reporter) is poking a senator, A minority is right. The last American African senator, that let aguy get really close and pray with him and others membrs at church was killed.  Dillion roof after prayer executed nine God loving, fearing folks.
Yup, she is a girl and it is disgusting that the ADN is allowing these hateful abusive comments to stay up. Would they let comments calling black men "boy" and use of the "N" word to stay up. They would not, but because this story is about a transgender person and whoever monitors these comments doesn't have the proper amount of knowledge to discern abuse in this instance.
New York City Trump and his billionaire friends would not let the average Trump voter mow his Mar-a-Lago lawn. Trump voters hate for a black man in office is so strong that they turn a blind eye to lying, perverted talk, and security risk for our country by standing with trump. As a plus though..we now can openly be racist thanks Don and his followers. By the way..I work in the oil industry of North Alaska..I make a good living..have good insurance....and I see right through Donald Trump.
I hate the FACT that it's mostly black and Samoan criminals that's waging havoc in the community.  Prove me wrong, please.
you gotta be kidding.  trump a Christian, nope, he is the devil, he hates blacks, Hispanics, muslims, gays, Asians, etc.
So I get what you're saying if more blacks kill other blacks then it's okay if everybody does it too. This wasn't  a hate crime but whites will still take this opportunity to paint all black as bad. But that's what y'all been doing hating on blacks 😂
Liar.  Really pisses you off that Obama's black huh?
One of the many things I like about this thread is that's it's possible to compliment someone like Norman Rockwell without being assailed by a gang of vicious, ignorant progressive trolls who loathe the very concept of a traditional America where such rights as free speech were honored at town hall meetings;  the speaker was not drowned out by hateful shouting, a standard operating procedure of progressives. Witness any US campus where a moderate or conservative is invited to speak -- e.g. James Comey at Howard University a few days ago had his speech drowned out by blacks and this counter-productive lack of civility is repeated relentlessly across America by progressives.   Norman Rockwell was truly a great American.  Thanks.
Nobody is refusing to serve blacks, the blind, Christians, or gay people. This is what fake news is all about. The florist in this case serves gay people all the time.
Mr Mbalula. You are the Minister of Police. When can we expect your corrupt colleagues to be prosecuted? I believe charges have been filed. So stop pretending to care and take action. Your words are meaningless hypocritical drivel until you do. Oh, and please refrain from commenting on economic concepts. When did you ever run a business? When did you ever contribute a single cent to our GDP? You clearly think only of taking from the people who do to give their hard earned income to your buddies and voters...and then you call it redistribution. Is this form of organised theft to buy you votes really the only policy you can offer? Maybe you think your black colleagues are simply too useless to compete in an open capitalist economy ? If I was one of the many highly competent black businessmen and women in this country I would be quite offended by you.
racism. Gotta undo what the black man built!
In related news: citing the fact that 93% of black lives are taken by blacks BLM has asked that blacks be banned from Pride.
If criminal was a 'black motorist' then the 9/11 hijackers were 'muslim pilots'
Unfortunately some of the racist loudmouths are becoming too emboldened for their own good. Won't be long before some some young brown or black hot heads give the racists a good beating.
Wow... what a stupid response. The challenge was to find examples of Christians committing the same amount of attacks as Muslims, you mainly posted about white people.. not only is your comment far reaching but also slightly racist against white people. For example- you pointed to Sandy Hook. Was he white- yes. Christian? No... that is equivalent to me saying that a black man shooting someone is a Muslim attack. And shall we compare death tolls to your examples vs the daily attacks in the name of Islam? While I was writing this post, several people were probably murdered in the name of Islam for offenses such as apostasy or homosexuality. Do yourself a favor and start paying attention to the REAL concern of Islamic terrorism. Also, read the Quran a bit.. then study the history of Muhammed, a man who beheaded many, many people and also married a 6 year old girl. Then ask yourself why you are defending this religion.
I'm sick of these black anti-American idiots constantly attacking the President of our country because their leftist ideology lost and is being buried by Americans as too far left  and not in the best interest of the country...  Blacks have overplayed their racist card and their victimhood - its pure leftist anti-Americanism now.....
I don't particularly care if Margaret Sanger was a racist, spoke a KKK rallies, and ate black babies. I do think abortion should be an option to women in almost every circumstance. I also think women AND men should be responsible for preventing unwanted pregnancies. In this day and age, unwanted pregnancies can pretty much be avoided. Fund Planned Parenthood!
What is the name of the racist Black Panthers now? Black lives matter or something? They are no different at all. I have heard them called "The Klan with a Tan".
Guess you have no problem with the black drug gangs. the huge number of Hispanic gangs, etc.  Any thoughts on your kind anarchists, bigots attacking innocent citizens because they support Repubs/Consv, rioting, burning, looting, etc. You're ignorant enough to talk about white nationalist??  Plsssss walk down parts of Chicago, DC, Detroit, Oakland, LA and see who comes out to meet and greet!!  Plssssss, you're the type that richly deserves to come face to face with real hate, racism & bigotry!!
Geez Ms. Harrop, aren't you a bit late to the party?  Like REALLY late?  Mainstream media have spent a TON of time minimizing and excusing the behavior of drug addicts in general, both white and black and brown etc.  I agree this is a matter of a pregnant drug addict being stupid and paying the ultimate cost for her stupidity.  And for those who might come trotting along to decry the judgmental nature of your column and my comment, let me point out that this woman was the perfect example of how nothing is going to help these addicts until they help themselves...this woman was court ordered into treatment which she promptly ignored.  In other words, you can lead an addict to treatment but you can't make them participate.
Even though a non christian, I believe in what goes around, comes around. I believe true justice, is to have everyone of the haters of President Barak Obama's skin color, come back as blacks, to experience what happens when stupid and littleminded prejudice rage filled self rightous indignation, fills ones life with deliberate suffering, oppression and death. All of us have to stand in front of our Creator's, whatever race we are, or what we believe. If I go to the whitemans hell, so be it, but, many of you all will surely be there also.
lol, why is stating the truth dangerous and not true?  Racism still exist.  Just because we had a black president does not mean that racism in this country went away.   As for sore losers, it seems that it's the phony conservatives are the whiners.  For once it would be nice for them to be consistent but no, everything is ok if you are republican.  Wonder what Reagan would have to say about today's republicans who are buddies with Putin?  Republicans really should have a warning label that cautions against whiplash.
Why involve the fat guy with the tie? Doesn't matter which side takes to the streets. Get suited up, (Don't forget to protect your head) bring the appropriate weapon and see who prevails. Tyrants of any breed are likely to be cowards. The skin color isn't important. It's always a pleasure to see some jughead go down, regardless of who they might hate. Everybody likes to see some fascist dummy hit the deck, be he black, white, gay or straight. In the meantime, get armed. Could be anybody coming for you soon.
In Canada the most acts of vandalism are still directed at the Jewish population although cases of vandalism of mosques is growing. Overt acts and words of intolerance are felt by a number of visible minorities including aboriginals, blacks, Sikhs, Muslims and Asians. Those bigoted acts however seldom reach a level which could be described as terrorism. Our white Christian majority is far from perfect but there is no comparison to attacks by Muslim extremists in Europe and the UK, attacks on Coptic Christians in Egypt or the more numerous attacks on Muslims by Muslims in the mid east and Africa. So far Muslims are much safer than blacks in the US or aboriginal women in Canada or Christians in Egypt. We should be ashamed of small acts of bigotry but let's not pretend that a single death in London totally counter balances all the deaths on 9/11 or throughout Europe in recent years.
Your racist bigotry against all religions except christian and all government except pure conservative Republican no matter the topic spews forth again.  Obama is to blame for everything being a black man daring to hold the highest office in the land.  If only more Bush, Trump, Cruz, ad nauseum were in charge, the nation would be just hunky dory.  Stupid.
I do not agree that Dr. Marrus' comment was "stupid," "hurtful" and "racial." That is an unfair characterization of the words he spoke.  I interpret Dr. Marrus' words as wry humour, most likely at the expense of Hugh Segal, the Master of Massey College. Far from being stupid, the humour illuminates the anachronistic use of the term "Master" at the U of T. As for the comment being intrinsically hurtful, it's clear that it's not. The black student and Hugh Segal CHOSE to be hurt by the humour, but they could've just as readily brushed it off. It clearly wasn't a comment intended to impugn them personally.  Finally, the editor asserts that Dr. Marrus' comment was "racial," as in racist. That's absurd. A racist comment is one that proposes, supports or evinces racist views. That the words spoken may have had a racial theme in no way means that they were racist.  Dr. Marrus is essentially blameless in this affair. Hugh Segal and Massey College are not.
This article is poorly written, poorly researched, offensive, and completely out of touch with any kind of reality. As a millenial graduate student and state government employee, you're saying I can get what I need in housing, which is apparently turned down for 3 auto loans and living with 4 other people in a poorly maintained house in a poor black neighborhood, displacing folks who have lived here for generations and are less well off than I, commuting by bike and bus because I can't afford a car? Really?  Interesting how the comments on this article have to be civil, but the article doesn't. Thanks for being insulting and for your classist, ageist, wealthy old white guy perspective. Must have been nice being able to afford a house before you hit 30.
I do not  support mr. bryson either....But the "White trash" talk is racism. Can you imagine the howeling and knashing of teeth if we referred to some of our lovely young Black Criminals as  just "Poor Black Trash"?
What is the source of your numbers and why are you only posting the numbers for blacks...kinda fishy...
The pride parade is fine- - but 'Black lives Matter' could use a good fire hose(ing)  or two
You're mad at someone because they used the term "African American"??????? You're not black but you have a black friend is that right? That's where all this self righteous indignation comes from? You're upset on behalf of your black friend?
I think a black guy tried to kiss Sylvia in junior high and she is still suffering trama
Are these your words Gene! Correct answer is YES, you can argue all you want but your words speak for themselves.   Did you not say "He had little more going for him than that", (that, being he is a black man). Once again your words,  But you earlier stated  "His genetic color is only relevant to a racist. Are you not making his genetic color relevant? . That pretty much indicates, in your own words, you are a racist.  . Your further statement "Obama is a black man, Obama ran as a black man" doesn't help your cause.  .
CSIS highlights white supremacist threat ahead of radical Islam  Citing recent academic research, the unclassified documents note extreme right-wing and white supremacist ideology has been the “main ideological source” for 17 per cent of so-called lone wolf attacks worldwide.  Islamic extremism accounted for 15 per cent of such attacks, the document noted, while left-wing extremism and “black power” groups followed with 13 per cent. Anti-abortion activism (8 per cent) and nationalism/separatism (7 per cent) rounded out the list, while in 40 per cent of cases there was no clear ideological motivation.  "The threat from the far right in Canada is real," Ryan Scrivens, one of the new report's authors and PhD candidate at Simon Fraser University, told VICE News. "It doesn't get the same kind of attention and publicity that Islamic extremist groups get, but they have, historically, done more damage in Canada."
". . . they started hurling racist slurs at every white person within their sights."  If a white person stood there and started hurling racist slurs at every black person in sight, they'd get arrested.
And after the shooting the family will say he was a good kid, turning his life around, and the racists  cops just shot him because he was black.
Do we question why white judges in the South for years threw black men in  jail with no evidence or sense of equitable punishment?  I do AGREE that we all carry bias and that includes judges.   And if bias is inescapable, and it is, then maybe we just have to work from the assumption that bias is going to show up in human behavior regardless.   I also see positive bias (which matches mine of course  lol).  A bias to love children is not common to all.  A bias for financial safety is a reaction to our more primitive instinct for self preservation* *cavemen didn't build up IRA's.     In a diverse society that requires cooperation, is a bias to one's own tribe going to damage the social structure and potential strength of the community?    If religious bias leads to charity, empathy, compassion, I'm OK.  If religious bias is toward killing non believers, I have a problem  Maybe the best we can do is recognize our bias consciously and deal with it.
Oh, so you are exposed as a liar.  "I judge by what's on the inside" is just code for "as long as someone exposes views that I agree with, then I judge them to be a good person".  You and your attitude and your actions are what is wrong with America.  And I mean that very seriously.  You are afraid of actually becoming enlightened to views that are different than yours.  It's so sad that black people like you put down other black people just because they don't walk the party line. Very sad.
BOOKS White People Commit the Most Heinous Crimes, So Why Is America Terrified of Black Men?  The new book "Suspicion Nation" addresses the Trayvon Martin injustice and why we keep repeating it. Lisa Bloom, 2014  Bigots read this book if you dare.
Like Pitts I won't point out all of Obama's failures on many important issues today.  As a white person I'll just offer comments involving race .  Obama , as the first black president , had the opportunity to bring the races together . It didn't require votes in congress or new laws.  Instead of bringing us together he divided us based on the color of our skin . When incidents hit the front page he always sided based on color---supporting blacks . Instead of acting like everyone's president and calling for calm he fanned the flames of racism . In the D. C. black break-in case he said " police acted stupidly " painting police across America in a bad light . In Florida , instead of calling off the lynch mob he said if he had a son he's look just like the victim .  In Furguson , instead of letting police do their job he called in the Fed's . In Baltimore and Furguson rather than strongly calling for calm he allowed black thugs to steal and burn.  Race relations sank thanks to Obama.
Straw man is what folks who have no argument claim.If you read all posts you will see that Mike Casola quoted a poll by Rasmussen. Trumpsters should not quote polls since they've told us over and over that polls are phony. So my straw man just became the tin man, funny huh. As far as religions that don't honor our flag, that is not a straw man since we are talking about folks not honoring our flag. Do you think a religious conviction is a better excuse than a moral conviction. Again no straw man. So our white society over all thinks if your a white church goer you can sit but if your a black athlete you have no right to voice a moral concern by doing the same
This is a huge pot calling the kettle black, and to think I just praised this clown yesterday.
Most people are either a Democrat by design, or a Democrat by deception. That is either they were well aware the racist history of the Democrat Party and still chose to be Democrat, or they were deceived into thinking that the Democratic Party is a party that sincerely cared about Black people.  Which was it for you Gary? You appear to be up to speed on current events surely you knew the history (thru today) of the party of racism when you signed up ?? Why would anyone want to join a racist organization like that??
If all lives mattered then there would be no death.   black lives matter, what a joke.  However, ain't a GODDAM thing funny.  Look at the wretched ass condition of the CONUS nigger and the adverse impact on the standard of living and the quality of life that results for CONUS and consequently the entire WORLD.  Read:  jerrywalkerspeaks.wordpress.com., not to mention the HOLY BIBLE, the BOOK OF REVEALATION.  WAKE UP WORLD!!!
His friend beat the Delaware criminal justice system.... murder charges dropped and he was set free. Now he's trying to help his friend using same concept, poor black man. He is stupid..... made comment to media that when Smith was arrested for assault, made him cut his hair after that incident, BUT on the night of the shooting he had his dreads intact, that was one of the IDing charateristics. If cut his hair after, shooting makes his friend a co-conspriter.
Yeah, that's right.  Black, classy President Barack Obama turned the nation against each other because he was  born a black man and managed to pull himself up  by his left wing boot straps and caused the wrong-wingers to stand and spin on their head.  There's no changing President Barack Obama's skin color, his eight year presidential legacy, or the FACTS that he's a well educated constitutional lawyer who just so happened to win the Nobel Peace Prize.  What've any of you naysayer wrong-wingers ever done in your pathetic lives?
I am directing my programmers to have the Russian bots communicate with the Black Lives Matter bots and George Soros bots as we speak. They want to know if you have the IP addresses for their servers handy, then they will get right on it.  My closest black friend, going back to university, is a successful Real Estate agent in Maryland. He is not dumb enough to wade into this quicksand.
Obama's only legacy will be the first black caretaker president of the USA.
Pretty funny that you had previously called LGBT folks hateful and prejudiced.   Pot calling the kettle black.
Anti-racists say there is a RACE problem that can only be solved when the third world pours into EVERY White country and "assimilates."  What if I said there was a RACE problem that could only be solved if hundreds of millions of non-Blacks were brought into EVERY Black country? How long before people realize I'm not talking about a RACE problem, but the conclusion to the BLACK problem?  They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-White.  Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.
Perhaps those black men should get off "the streets" and into school, or work or church.  Hanging out in gangs on corners late at night doesn't do anyone any good.
Now Rupert's plan to divide and rule is really succeeding. As per reports, EFF has joined hands with him against Zuma. They kinda made a deal with the devil himself. This will misguide many black people.
Bill, that "all lives matter" stuff is so trumped up. Do you bash organizations about breast cancer because "all cancers matter?" Do you bash MADD saying "all bad driving matters?" You oppose abortion, I gather ... what if I complained that you should be saying "all lost pregnancies matter?" The BLM movement, right or wrong, exists to address a perceived injustice and imbalance in police treatment of black people. They are not saying "kill whites" ever; they are saying "don't kill blacks." It's different. Opposing racism is not racist. As long as they want a level treatment, equal to all, everybody who isn't racist should agree with them.
The wall intends to completely and absolutely put to a stop illegal entry into the US.  I have yet to see any Anti-Trump come up with issues.  There's  the yearly trade deficits in the billions and yearly budget deficits in the trillions.  There's the vanishing of factories from the US leaving economic desolation behind. There's the US becoming a pushover by China, Russia and even Iran.  There is the ever increasing number of homeless - caused most likely by unemployment, underemployment and the rise in the standard of living - rent, food and medicine.  Of the deterioration of inner cities populated by Blacks and Latinos.
Nice try but all evidence supports Bello was not a nice guy.  Black or white, trash like him is better off dead.
Patience, Brother. Homophobia must defer to Islamophobia, which itself must bide its time due to the fact that Black lives matter more than yours...Jack Layton was wrong. Politics are more powerful than love, and only marginally more powerful than hate, which Trumps love each and every time.
Those stupid liberals are just awful!!! I mean, how can they think that its fair to infringe on our rights to shoot the gay and latino and black people, and keep the women in the kitchen!  I mean, isn't it just an outrage to assume that these people have civil rights???
When black crime is in proportion to their  8%  of the general population, their problems with the cops will go down too.  In the US blacks make 13% of the population.
quote:"..noting that black women are more likely to be victims of domestic violence." And why? Because the number of violent crimes committed by blacks is triple the average per capita for non-blacks.
Can black students pack too?
More clear evidence of white privilege.  Whites must work harder to kill whites in order to eradicate this blatant example of bias and racial inequity.  And how about Asians?  They are killed at even a lower rate than either whites or blacks.  Maybe that has something to do with fewer Asian illegitimate births, a strong inter-generational Asian family support structure, a desire to be well-educated and have a good job and stay out of trouble.  Asians are much less likely than either whites or blacks to use hard drugs and engage in criminal behavior.  White privilege is very bad indeed, but Asian privilege is even worse.  Asians must abandon their successful life strategies so that there will be more racial equity in homicides, illegitimate births, criminal convictions, lack of educational achievements, and unsuccessful lives.  It's just common sense.
These ugly "monuments" were put up mostly during Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Movement as an attempt to intimidate and remind black people that they were "less than" and still inferior in everyday.  To defend the statues staying is a tacit admission that you support the ideals of slavery and white supremacy.
Blacks and browns are huge drains on society!
Maybe they should be black to celebrate victims of everything, everywhere.
https://youtu.be/aiD_lGRkSmU  I surmised that Charles was a black man (actually, he mentions it from time to time), but the rest I was unaware of.  Guess you know him better than I do.   You sure answered my question regarding civil discourse, though.  Boy, howdy!  I couldn't get ttthe link to go, either, but never mind.  The Polite Chipmunks you ain't!
Ducksoup:  I agree with you about Japan but you are forgetting that Japan does not have the populations of black men and women, white men and women  or any men or woman  that have PTSD, mexican men, latino men, Huge numbers  of Mentally Ill etc.  ALL High Crime folks...
"first black female state court judge in Las Vegas, Nevada"? What took so long? Already got lots of Japanese, Chinese, Hawaiian, Koreans, Hispanic, and planty hoales.
Nice try! Called out on your cherry picking, and this is what you resort to? LOL! Pathetic.  Seriously, why is it so hard for you to admit that whites commit more murders than blacks?
"Blacks commit about 6x the rate of murder of whites"  That doesn't sound right, since 83% of homicides against whites are committed by other whites, and 89% of homicides against blacks are committed by other blacks.  The population of whites is about 5 times larger.  To get to 6x times the rate of murder of whites by blacks, you'd have to assume that virtually all of the 17% committed by non-whites are all committed by blacks, and all other races are angels, which isn't the case.  Feel free to prove me wrong with some legitimate statistical sources, but my impression is that inter-racial murder is relatively insignificant.  I haven't found a source yet that supports your assertion, but my patience has limits.  Maybe you meant "as whites." As a percent of population, that might make sense.
This kind of rally was a stupendously foolish and inexcusable way to express a very valid point.  White-washing (sorry for the pun) history in the blind pursuit of political correctness is not the way forward.  Worse yet, it won't make a difference.  Militant blacks have attached themselves to the "original sin" of slavery the same way Canada's aboriginals have attached themselves to the "original sin" of colonization.  No number of apologies, gestures or (in Canada's case) financial payments will ever suffice.  Name one prominent black or aboriginal leader who has publicly said "I forgive the white race for their historical transgressions.  Let's work together in building the future rather than re-living that past" and encourages others to do so too.    Given an unwillingness to forgive, there will be no true reconciliation.  All that's left is empty posturing and pandering in the pursuit of political correctness.
Neil Black.  Just think how much better you'd feel if he was hacked up with a chainsaw instead of shot with a gun.
You never try to have any sort of rational conversation with anyone as I often read your commentaries. White is white, black is black, Asian is Asian so you speak in ignorance because it is your nature to troll. I am not the only one to think that people of the Slavic background is considered...."white". Maybe you have another word for it?? But have it your way, you started this trolling, I did not.
I love the comments below.....a black woman speaks and the crap comes out of the wood work... Trump produce your proof.....other than that, STFU!!!!
Do they make rolling papers that big ? Also, do black "dudes" smoke better than white "dudes" ?
Or Senator Robert Byrd... Also a long term clansman who  Despite being the only Senator to vote against both African American U.S. Supreme Court nominees (liberal Thurgood Marshall and conservative Clarence Thomas) and filibustering the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Byrd later said joining the Klan was his "greatest mistake." The NAACP gave him a 100% rating on their issues during the 108th Congress. However, in a 2001 incident Byrd repeatedly used the phrase "white niggers" on a national television broadcast.
Rodney King jeopardized others when he was driving drunk but in fact the only person harmed was King himself when Officers Powell and Koon beat him before witnesses. I assume Find Truth did not use "like a wealthy black man/woman" since even wealthy black Americans are frequently treated like social inferiors by racists whites who are unfamiliar with their celebrity status. All the prominent African-Americans you mention have spoken and written about their experiences of racism in the U.S. Your claim that the experiences of white celebrities are the same as the experiences of Black celebrities, therefore, is entirely specious.
Well Skeexix, in case you didn't know, CD is a black man that hates white people, white privilege, white power, white government and white leaders.  If you're white, he probably hates you too.  I, personally, hate racists of all breeds, especially white supremacists.  But seriously dude, have you ever heard CD EVER say ANYTHING positive about white folk?  Not gonna happen, he's prejudiced.  (also I'm a dinosaur and can't read http/youtu.be/etc., what does that mean?)
It is easier to control the actual murderers (if anyone is willing to testify against them "snitches get stiches").  Black people who kill other black people have no 'responsibility'?
Couldn't he have just used his hands? Just make up girl's names like Rachel for this right and Lavona for his left. Too dumb to use his imagination and stay out of trouble? Gives blacks bad name.
Myself, my family, friends and my employees have agreed to ignore the Pride week unless this is overturned. Every person who stays away will perhaps send a message. When BLM gets involved bad things happen. They should be concentrating on black on black crime and how to stop it ....not ordering our Police Force around.
Hey Nicholas Kristol why don't you worry about you high priced Taxes in your stupid State, and quit kissing Obama's rear-end like you people have for the pass 8 yrs. It was you people that caused this mess when you put Black Muslim Barrack Hussein Obama  from Kenya for President, so stay out of Alaska business. Go President Trump you are doing a good job. You Democrats cause way to much trouble in our Country. Like duh Nancy Pee Brain & Chuckie Shoemaker.
I see on the Twitter summaries, Ms. Rampell has discovered H. L Mencken.  Here is one of his other quotes:  "I admit freely enough that, by careful breeding, supervision of environment and education, extending over many generations, it might be possible to make an appreciable improvement in the stock of the American negro, for example, but I must maintain that this enterprise would be a ridiculous waste of energy, for there is a high-caste white stock ready at hand, and it is inconceivable that the negro stock, however carefully it might be nurtured, could ever even remotely approach it. The educated negro of today is a failure, not because he meets insuperable difficulties in life, but because he is a negro. He is, in brief, a low-caste man, to the manner born, and he will remain inert and inefficient until fifty generations of him have lived in civilization. And even then, the superior white race will be fifty generations ahead of him."
If I had made a political statement or protested how police handle blacks while I was being paid for my job, I'd have been fired. Protest on your own time. Besides, they have totally lost the original meaning of the first kneeling and now KIDS are doing it. Some role models these clowns are.  They are over-paid anyway - why do we pay them hundreds of thousands while paying teachers, cops and firefighters fractions of that - and people who risk their lives every day at work can't protest and make a fraction of what these protesting jerks make for working part of a year. (playing a GAME, not saving lives) Americans created these idiots - now live with 'em.
Kenneth Conklin: Your constant attack on EVERYTHING HAWAIIAN, has reached an all new low! Here, you have managed to denigrate & greatly offend a whole race of people! To suggest that Hawaiians have a better chance to be "cleansed" on the Continent is extremely offensive & racists.  If your AMERICA is so great, why not go back there? America the land of mass murders, lynchings, brutal slavery & rapes of slaves, bombings of Black Churches, where it's open season on Black's by Cops, & a country on the verge of a race war.  Yet, you hide in passive Hawaii, where it's safe for you to continue to spew your hate against everything Hawaiian. You know full well that the majority of our prisoners are Hawaiian. Maybe your family is toxic to you. For you to project your own familial deficiencies upon Hawaiians, is not only insensitive, but pathetic.  You don't like Hawaiians go back home!
This is a good example of how welfare payments and unconditional grants to the poor just paper over the real problems, while creating a profit-making incentive for politicians.   Since the end of Apartheid, substantial portions of the black population have been allowed to fester in poverty and ignorance and indolence. Many millions are no closer to becoming employed than they were back in the 1990s. South Africa could have been the economic engine of Africa: all was there to do it. They had the best infrastructure in Africa, the most investment wealth, the most advanced industries and universities, and the world's good will for them to succeed. Since then, a corrupt black uber class has misruled the country, seeking to just get political gain for attacking whites and even threatening to kill them on mass. Today's SA is broke, broken and heading towards being another failed black African state.
This was already posted in Huff Post Black Voices.  I'm a fifth generation Canadian of Scottish background.  Immigrants can never say my name nor spell it. Even 'old stock' Canadians have trouble spelling it. Who can I complain to? One idiot was rude to him, not the whole country.
"After the Last BIG MISTAKE, I hope we are done for a while." says a black man.
I am sure if a cop with a hammer raised over his head were to approach a black guy with a gun, the cop would be shot.
When you can't win on facts, just start spouting statistics. Whites commit more murder than blacks. Why are you so, so butthurt by simple facts?
This nitwit is probably the most hated individual in the south right now. I bet even the white racists probably want a piece of him as much as anyone else. Thanks to him, the famed symbol of the south, the Confederate flag suddenly became persona non grata all over the nation. I read somewhere that he had a black girlfriend who rejected him and that set him on this path of hate. Anyone else read that?? Death penalty is the only solution for an individual like him.
Black on black crime.  So sad.
The majority of white folks don't realize that our race relation issues were created by white people for white people. We minorities have had very little say about our public policies in this country. Heck, our 1st black president was followed by the guy that said he wasn't born in America. White folks did build our racist heritage. We have been working on becoming "a more perfect union" ever since the founding of the nation. The 2nd Amendment was necessary to commit ethnic cleansing and building the macro economics of the nation on race based slavery. Murder and rape were part of the business model for the nation. Clearly, Christianity doesn't prevent white racism, rape, or murder. This country is proof. The beauty of white racism is that it allows the average white person to go through life thinking they are innocent while collecting their white privilege. For example, white folks aren't racially profiled. This despite the fact that most mass shooters are loner white men.
BLM is a collection of racists intent only on promoting their hatred of police, white society and anyone not black. Pride was hi-jacked they have now lost their claim to promoting inclusion for LGBT residents and our multi-cultural community. That BLM can garner support from our politically correct politicians is shameful. Black uniforms and fist pumping are the trademark of thugs and gang members.
A "fascist" has a Jewish son-in-law?  Black members of his administration?  Supports Israel?  What am I missing here?
My life in this world, is only temporary on my journey, as is others. What I would worry about is after I pass on. I have to go over, and explain my life's actions, with my Creator as you will have to with yours, as will every one else, white, brown, black or whatever. I would like to be there though, when the racists, bigots, corrupt, and the ones who took part in the subjugation of races of people, including genocide, for white collar parasites and leeches who steal Native's lands and resources they covet, when they have to also explain their life's actions to their Creator. Do they get to go to their heaven, or to their hell? My bet is they end up in the same frying pan as the Islamic terrorists
Ha, yes, I see what you did there!  Interesting how when it's a white guy we focus on the individual's circumstances, but let it be a black person or muslim or pacific islander, and it's instantly "all those people . . . "
So, you are justifying your racism now?  What about black assaults and murders of policemen and others?  Should they also not be called out?
Okay icon, if he really said these things, they reflect badly on him.  Given the intensity of dislike for the man, however, can we trust these recollections?  I just googled the laziness quote and found:   "Laziness is a trait in blacks."  "That line, however, is not directly from Trump. It is found in a 1991 tell-all by a former Trump employee, who alleges in his book that he heard Trump say those words to a black accountant at a Trump-owned establishment, according a 2011 article in the Huffington Post."  When a person does not like another, vindictiveness comes easy.     Thank you for your civil comments and please have a good day.
Since the trolls have shown up and are are accusing everyone they disagree with of being Nazi sympathizers, while copy/pasting their comments, I'll do the same with my response.  Now this is hilarious. When you have no argument and the facts aren't on your side ad hominem attacks are what you use. BTW, facts aren't racist or bigoted. Try to ease up on your obvious biases and maybe you'll open your eyes to the truth. The following is what makes your comment beyond hilarious. I am from a multi-racial family. We are black, white, Mexican, Jewish, et al. To top all of that off I had a family member murdered by the KKK decades ago, so unlike you, I actually have valid reasons to hate racists and Nazis. People like you just throw out personal attacks, while having no clue about anything. Pathetic.  P.S. My name is a combination of matter (as in forms of it based in science) and AK as in Alaska...you know, the state I'm in.  So much fail from the trolls
Stupid people use the silly term "African American" in a desperate attempt to be politically-correct.  They don't realize that Africa is a continent - not a country.  Omar Sharif is from Egypt but lived here. Dave Matthews and Charlize Theron moved here from South Africa. I guess that makes them all African Americans!  What do you call a black guy in Canada? An African Canadian? An African North American?  Some folks just can't think for themselves.
I like our PM, but he's not anywhere in Trump's league as a negotiator. The other day the Globe had a picture of him sitting next to Trump, with silly flourescent socks, a bright blue suit and tan shoes. Trump is in a black suit with red tie. This is the guy who wrote the book on personal branding, and his brand is to be all-business, while our guy looks like he wants to be the prom king/queen/non-binary-kqien. Now Trump is boxing him into a corner, because his team will know that Trudeau is obligated to Quebec first and foremost, and that Quebec dairy is a political force. This will be the second time Justin hits the mat, and he hasn't hit Trump once yet.
Does this surprise anybody...brothers of a feather always stick together...blacks.
In the words of the greats, Tupac and Nasir; a decade apart.  "America's not ready for a black president."
I'm still trying to understand the phrase " change the narrative ". Whose narrative?—2Be4Peace  The narrative is that Blacks are interlopers.  Changing the narrative means that the American Dream and the American Dilemma are two aspects of the same reality.  Dealing with this reality demands that truth determine racial politics, rather than racial politics determine truth.  When Blacks are assumed to be real Americans in the United States, the narrative changes and everyone else is also included.  When Blacks are excluded, no one else is risk free.
No one is comparing "spoiled" "black" athletes to our "Good" (are you high on crack cured in lead paint?) "American" president. Straw man alert! Racist alert!
My experience has been the opposite.  With a few notable exceptions, most of the white southerners I encountered when I lived in Mississippi, North Carolina and Missouri and when I visited relatives in Aransas were white supremacists, either openly or surreptitiously (what we used to call "uptown Klansmen").  In an Arkansas town 15 miles from where my in-laws live cops claim a black kid in their custody shot himself despite being handcuffed, with a gun that was never found, and they're still on the force.  The two white kids that were smoking dope with him got let off with a warning.  Tell me: are your feet wet?  Do you see pyramids in the distance?  'Cause you're DEEP in denial.  Or are simply lying.
This is about mass murder.  It's not about what a lawyer said on T.V.  You could care less how many people died or were injured. This is your time to shine. It's the liberals fault, right?  I wonder if instead of a old white male mass murderer, have it be a black dude or any color really. I bet you'll stay on subject then because that's your M.O. On display everyday, all day. So much so that you have to be getting paid. That or one extremely motivated useful idiot for the Russians.  When nobody responds to you. You spam the thread. Especially Sid's column. You spam that shamelessly. Well over 40% of 160 comments, probably closer to 50%.  Troll
The Republican Party is tripping over themselves trying to distance themselves from the Alt Right. It's all lip service. The Aryan Nation Party (GOP) pitched a hissy fit when the Obama administration tried to put white supremacist groups on the terrorists watch list. It is the their white trash president that for more than eight years demanded to see President Obama's birth certificate. It was their white trash congress that obstructed at every turn, even denying President Obama's Supreme Court nominee for nearly a year. It was because he was the first Black President. No the Republican / Aryan Nation Party owns this. No amount of lip service will suffice. It is time to call out the entire party. The entire Republican Party, every single Republican voter all the way up to the party heads, has the blood of this weekend on their hands.
This has nothing to do with "asserting rights," and Parks was a CPUSA member.  Quite amazing that you think that means that I want blacks in the back of the bus. A rather wild imagination on your part, loaded with the very knee-jerk blanket prejudice you claim to stand against.  Do you normally launch into verbal tirades against people that breathe in the wrong direction in your glorious presence?
yeah, now listen to all the Clintonites whine about how horrid O'Reilly was.  I watched a TV program the other day where an attractive but slightly overweight black woman said, while nearly in tears, " O'Reilly came right up to me and said "How's it going Hot Chocolate?"" She then nearly broke into tears. WOW  It kinda sounded like a compliment to me. And not nearly as outrageous as Bill Clinton getting a blow job in the oral, I mean Oval, Office.
True but some clarification here: this has nothing to do with race or a white person shooting a black man...it was a black cop. So go protest blacks i guess. Or in tulsa, go protest white woman since it was a white woman. The caricature of the yosemite sam white cop attack blacks is just as stupid as the caricature of blacks as  crackheads and thugs...
And black racism has been playing in the law ever since then.
"Happy" I find it sad that you believe what you posted. I am White and consider myself 'average' for the most part. I have NEVER IN MY LIFE thought less of others of ANY race for what they are, what they look like, what they know or anything else. I'm retired Military and have traveled the world and met many peoples, all have their good points... All have bad...  I only knew one black family until my 18th birthday and had NEVER seen an Asian person until I went to boot-camp for the Navy! In my LONG life I have done my best to accept people for what they present to me..  Trump is NOT a racist, you listen way to much to the crap presented by the left.. He poses NO threat to any of us unless you plan to break some serious laws. We needed someone to support the 2nd amendment, think of our Veterans, fix our health care system and balance SCOTUS.  We could not survive as a free country if we were socialist bunch of left wing nuts (like Bernie wanted) where everything is supposed to be free!
John, he was shot by a black police officer.
Suppose the opponent doesn’t want to compete against a black athlete, or a Native. Would that be OK with you?
Gene Miller, "You have never heard President Trump say anything racist" True I have never heard Trump say anything racist, nor have you seen him commit adultery but it is also a fact.  . The New Jersey Casino Control Commission fined the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino $200,000 in 1992 because managers would remove African-American card dealers at the request of a certain big-spending gambler. A state appeals court upheld the fine. . Trump disparaged his black casino employees as “lazy” in vividly bigoted terms, according to a 1991 book by John O’Donnell, a former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. . Trump has also faced charges of reneging on commitments to hire black people. In 1996, 20 African Americans in Indiana sued Trump for failing to honor a promise to hire mostly minority workers for a riverboat casino on Lake Michigan.  And you call me a liar.     .
These are clueless young boys misusing the CBF, which most citizens, like you, haven't a clue about the accurate history of this flag!!  Any thoughts on those illegal aliens that flag their different flags, thus rubbing them in our faces, about being here illegally and staying here and how they want to make America Mexico??  Or the hateful, racist Black Panthers, or those that fly the Iranian, ISIS flags, etc.  No comments, right!!??  Yes because these are all people of color and liberals haven't the courage to discuss their racism and ignorance.
They have no interest in improving it.  They are against government  involvement (except Medicare and Medicare part D for Drugs which was a Bush program) and particularly are opposed to a system put in place by Democrats lead by a black guy they hated.
Hope Dylan is put in a cell with the biggest, meanest black guy who has a giant chip on his shoulder re white people.
I'm not a liberal but thanks for the assumption. So as a business owner, it is my right to not let a trans people, black people or muslims or ? use the restroom?   If I am an individual business owner, I should be able to dictate who uses my restrooms. What about redheads? Those people are weird for sure!
The disgusting fact is that most of the left-leaning decision makers at universities and black students want segregation again, don't go blaming the white man again for the social issues we face today. There are far too many people with complaints about the current state of our country but all the idiots rioting and claiming racism have no solutions just more complaints and then they seek help from the same people they revolted against. The welfare state may have been a good idea one point in time but without major reform the welfare state will be the death of America.
Everything you need to know about America's gun culture can be summed up in this statistic: the gun industry is in crisis. Since the election of Donald Trump gun sales have plummetted to record lows. Nobody is buying the things. The NRA has started a TV channel out of sheer desperation and most shows aren't even ABOUT guns - just about how evil liberals are.  What does this tell you ? Americans only buy guns because they are petrified of a black president ? ? Perhaps more charitably: they buy them because when somebody says "Obama and Hillary want to take your guns away" - they are stupid enough to believe those lies despite the fact that no democratic presidential candidate has ever proposed a gun ban or confiscation program.  When nobody is afraid of guns being taken... somehow, nobody seems to want to have them either. Now if the only reason you want something is that you're afraid you may be told you can't have it... then it's an idiotic thing to want.
PROGRESSIVES are a CLEAR and PRESENT DANGER to WHITES KILL a PROGRESSIVE and TWO NIGERS and 5 MUSLUMS to PROTECT HUMAN LIFE
Ah, I get it now.  You actually have no idea what the NRA does, you just implied blacks are criminals, and you think a responsible gun owner is the same thing as a criminal in Detroit.  Perhaps we should start with getting you educated on these topics, first.  Then we can talk about my gun rights and why you think you know something about them.
If he had been Muslim, Mexican, Puerto Rican, or black POTUS would be frothing at the mouth & tweeting uncontrollably.
"My Way to Peace,"  Sanger recommends that the government: . . . keep the doors of Immigration closed to the entrance of certain aliens whose condition is known to be detrimental to the stamina of the race, such as feeble-minded, idiots, morons, insane, syphiletic, epileptic, criminal, professional prostitutes, and others in this class . . . apply a stern and rigid policy of sterilization, and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is already tainted or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring. (Jan. 17, 1932 [LCM 130:198].)  And this is precisely what Hitler did.  And what Oregon did.  Although Oregon also sterilized 'wayward teenage girls' and homosexuals as well.  Hitler put pink triangles on the homosexuals and sent them to slave labor in the death camps instead.   Both based their acts on eugenics.  Sanger targeted the poor blacks in the infamous "Negro Project" along with W.E.B Dubois.
I know that .  It's  just that Obama appears to be only pardoning black drug dealers . I wonder what the ratio is ?
This is the kind of hate crime that Donald Trump has given rise to.   In fact, shortly after this occurred a member of the mosque was taped saying that this was because of Trump, but this was not mentioned in this article.  Hate crimes against Muslims, blacks and other visible minorities have skyrocketed throughout North America because the man in the White House has given them license to do so. The very day the world is sent into chaos because of Trump's Muslim ban from 7 countries that the Cato Inst. says are responsible for 0 American deaths (but excludes Egypt, UAE. and Saudi Arabia, who are responsible for hundreds/thousands of American deaths because  Trump  has businesses there),  this tragedy occurs. Trump and Bannon this is on you.  You fan the flames of racism and hatred against our brothers and sisters of colour. You said on TV you favoured Christian over Muslim immigrants!  Canadians don't want your condolences.  Keep them and lift the travel ban against Muslims NOW!
last time with QUAIA (Queers Against Israeli Apartheid) marching in the Parade and playing politics the City did not cut funding  this time do it right and cut funding the funding is for gay rights and gay pride politics and not for politics like Black activism, anti-Israel activism  cut the funding and stop the nonsense already
I think you know the difference between gay pride and white pride Outsider, but I'll bite. "White pride" has a lot of overlap with white supremacy, which has a history of terrorizing and often killing black people.   "Gay pride" is more of a celebration. I'm straight, but I would be welcomed at a gay pride event. The Scandinavian Festival is certainly a celebration of white culture, but everybody is welcome. Gay pride is like that.
Also, all you people out there "of color", be very, very worried and do something about it with your vote on the next go round.  Trump is a White Supremacist, obviously picking on blacks, THIS TIME.  He has no problem pandering to the racism of his "base", stirring it up in a racist frenzy.  He's used Mexicans, Middle Easterners, Jews and Blacks as his foils to do that so far.  This is getting bad.  Even NFL owners, risking offending their white customer base, are pushing back - and they have NO PROBLEM killing their employees to make money.  Very bad.
Actually the pack districts with black voters, leaving 2 or three bordering districts lilly white and more likely to vote Repubulican.    They 'cleanse' the conservative district and isolate the black population so as not to 'infect' the voting pool that Republicans target.  You got it right in purpose though.
What else is new, but more lies from another corrupt Communist Leftist?  This biothc is a member of the Black Caucus, which is nothing more than a group of black Communist militants, who want to instill Communism in our country.  POTUS Trump would never disparage a military family, but this corrupt pig of a Congresswoman has shown a history of lying and hating throughout her time in Congress.
Blacks are more likely to kill cops than be killed by cops. This is according to FBI data, which also found that 40 percent of cop killers are black. According to Mac Donald, the police officer is 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black than a cop killing an unarmed black person.  http://www.dailywire.com/news/7264/5-statistics-you-need-know-about-cops-killing-aaron-bandler
Your site shows the Hispanic women more poorly compensated than the blacks, the whites or the Asians.    So they should be having the most abortions according to your 'suggestion'.
rimrock, your heart must be black as well as your blood in your veins.   Why don't you call yourself 'niggar heart' instead!!!???  LOTFL!
The darling of the left wings can say as she pleases, the progressive media will treat her with kid's gloves.  Don't forget her "The White House was built solely by black slaves" The lady is a racist one for sure.
The whole anti-white-male underpinnings of contemporary liberalism is just one of many  irrational, pseudo-intellectual pathologies that has been adopted by the Democratic Party. This pathology is a subset of the overall assault on the masculine and manhood that we find in the culture.  Any culture that has such an approach to men or the masculine is sick, sick, sick. It is this sickness that the above article advances.   We have seen what this anti-male, anti-masculine  spirit has done to the Black community and what it is now doing to American culture in general.  We see that this anti-white male view is actually a form of racism against the white race in general. This theme has infected all of Liberalism and the above article with the animosity it engenders not only lacks charity but is thoroughly anti-Christian.
Why doesn't any one riot when a black cop shOOts an unarmed white person? It happens a lot more than people think. Maybe it has to do with being more civilized.
The south rebelled in part because they feared a bloody slave revolt.  Haiti had just had a slave revolt where they killed every white and many mulatto.  Only those cornered in a port city survived.  The north was going to cause a similar slave revolt with all the propaganda.  Today we live the violence from blacks every day.  The South was right.
Wow and people wonder why many black people just wont "let things go." If i were one of them i'd dislike me too. But it's people like you who are a disgrace using God's name to try and justify your sophomoric thought process. And pretty sure God doesn't give a shit about politics as much as he does about people created in his image treating each other like garbage, and saying ridiculous things like you did.
But there are hot lesbians in prisons. I've seen Orange is the New Black. I know what I'm talking about.
You are implying that I want to blame all black people. That is dishonest, insulting, and exposes your racism. I am just pointing out the hypocrisy and the racist bent of the media. If the suspect in Florida was white, it would have been reported. Just like they did in the other referenced article.
This editorial is embarrassing, it cites loud public belches from the uncouth as hate. Hate is Kristallnacht, Hate is lynching or beating a youth across from that pissy little rebel rag. Hate is angry, resentful, doped-up life failures like Dylan Roof, executing his victimizers. The banner, "White, proud, unapologetic",  could easily be applauded by the currently hysterical if it were written as "black, brown, red, turquoise, etc, proud, unapologetic". Stop discounting Hate, real Hate,  and the blood  and dying that flow from it and its worshipers. Walk around with sanctimonious signs, hug, and cry if you want. Or buck up and breathe. The answer to real Hate comes out of the barrel of a gun, you'll know when it's time. Death is the only outcome of Hate, it's also its only answer.
A person is a hypocrite if he tells someone not to do something but he does it himself. I didn't do this if you look at everything I said. Blacks protest things like discrimination and being killed by cops unfairly. When a old white man tells Blacks to go back to Africa, he is saying stop complaining, you are lucky to be in the U.S. If a white man from the mainland complains about how inferior Hawaii is, then the response from a local will be, if this place isn't good enough for you, go back to the place you are happy with. I wouldn't agree with anyone telling Micronesians to go back. If you complained that Hawaiians discriminated against whites, and they told you to go back to the mainland, I would be against it also. You did not give any example and I am only talking about the superior white man situation.
More whites are killed by police than blacks. Look it up......
I'm not talking much about my personal feelings about this nonsense, only to say , 'I'm out, not even the home team any longer'  This black 'inequality' talk, finally shoved me over the edge.  If they will allow disrespect of our flag and anthem, perhaps next, I will see favorite foods disappear from the shelves over some black nonsense.   Maybe a favorite tv show, because it doesn't have enough blacks in it.   Nah, go protest on your time, not mine.
USA hasnt won a war since 1945 but they showed up late and let our people shed the blood. Their Military is not that great compared to other great nations of the past. Poor hispanics, poor white people from the trailer parks and blacks from the inner city do all the fighting. Bankers, wall street crowd stay home make money and cheer them on. What an interesting system they have created. More data is needed.................
All one has to do to understand BLM is look to Africa where blacks run the continent. What a laugh ,blacks do not understand equality, they do understand violence and something for nothing .
If obummer said exactly what the Big Tweet said it would be handled completely different. Just to give you an idea of how this crap works with MSM inc G&M. The fine Senator from New J is on trial for being a filthy pig. His buddy an ophthalmologist has just been found guilty on 65 counts. So NY Times does a 1100 word story on the mess. Never once bringing up the pig is a Democrat. Then when they get blow back from folks reading the mess they say it was a oversight. Yeah right. So Newsbuster does an analysis on the coverage of Menendez trial between Sept 5th and 20th. ABC 20 seconds CBS 2 minutes and NBC a big fat 0. CNN 1/3 of the time devoted to Spicer, Emmy appearance.   Folks we aren't getting the news anymore just the MSM version of the news. 760 murdered in Chicago last year and vast majority black on black crime with a tiny fraction killed by cops of any color. The MSM is killing democracy with their agenda. That is how the BIG TWEET got elected. Plain and simple
White supremacy still running rampant. I don't see too many conservatives upset about a black man, being beaten by white supremacists (those champions of free speech, remember, and just really Very Concerned (TM) about conserving "history" - as if people use statues to learn about history.) and then getting served a WARRANT for fighting back against those evil racist thugs.   Seriously, what is the message we are supposed to take from this? If you are black, don't fight back against white thugs who are beating you because they are blatantly, openly racist, because you are not considered their equals?   https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-brutal-beating-of-black-man-by-white-supremacists-still-roils-charlottesville/2017/10/10/e5994132-a515-11e7-8cfe-d5b912fabc99_story.html?utm_term=.07c9e9f11d6e
Yes!  Those black-clad fascists were out in the streets.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/20/anti-donald-trump-activists-try-block-access-inauguration/
Yet this "racist congresswoman" is speaking the TRUTH. I know you hate to hear that, because it's doesn't fit the narrative that you would like (which is that this black woman is racist, and the honorable POTUS is honest Abe).  But you are wrong. It's not an opinion piece, this news is the damn truth. Wake up.
Was the perp tanned? White or black? What was his race?
It's the Black Lives Matter activists (a species of Islamic Black Power movement of the 1960s), within the administration, who are spear-heading this survey. It's their modus operandi. I just got shut out of a TDSB continuing ed course (beginner Spanish) by a rude intake agent (black); the other applicants were even older but white Caucasian -- and they received tender loving care. Obviously they're trying to limit the number of Asian-looking students in order to facilitate enrolment of others, preferably white. The Continuing Ed programs raise much needed $$$ from fee-paying students.
This is fantastically wrong.  Why on Earth do you think that BLM doesn't mind black on black crime?  Thats just silly on its face.  The movement was created about racial inequality in police shootings.  You think they are a joke because they are too narrowly focused? Also, the arrogance you have to assume that you have the solution to crime in black communities is astounding.  You listen to one episode of Rush and suddenly you are an expert?
I consider it Southern food, but that does not take away the slap in the face of black Americans.
Mr. Trump restarted the fire. His spewing hate and anger fueled the burning racism. He knew the embers of hatred of our President had been kept alive in our Least in spite of our best. His incitement and encouragement emboldened them with hate and reinforced the fears of these ignorant, stupid, damaged and defective among us.  When cops kill for no valid reason and preferentially kill blacks it isn't necessarily because of Trump but it is to those they target an act of terror against them. It is an act of terror toward those communities and peoples they are supposed to protect. Trump  told them, black and white, that our country needed to fight fire with fire and kill the innocent families and loved ones of terrorists. So that is what the Dallas cop killer did to the family of cops. They love their fellow officers and stand together like a family. I hope all the haters and Trumpets understand that we didn't start the fire and that Trump has doused it with gasoline
Hancock knows the Black Community will vote 99% for a black candidate, no matter how little that politician does for them. He can screw them over all he wants to try and get the Hispanic vote. Throw in the 20% of white voters who love to pat themselves on the back for supporting illegals and he is untouchable.
Wikipedia is not a credible source, it's crowdsource opinion.   Documented quotes from Margaret Sanger.........  "The most merciful thing that a large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it."   On blacks, immigrants and indigents: "...human weeds,' 'reckless breeders,' 'spawning... human beings who never should have been born."  The purpose in promoting birth control was "to create a race of thoroughbreds,"
Are we going to see letters from Hispanics/Latinos to La Raza or the Mexican Mafia or M13? Blacks to Black Panthers or Crips or Bloods or Vice Lords or Gangster Disciples? It appears that there's only one problem in the U.S.?
You are the one making the false claim , back it up. The fact is you can't. White people get shot by the police too, more black people are shot by police, but it may be due to the fact 6% of the population(black men) commit 50 % of the violent crimes. They have more interaction with police. We don't have a police problem we have a black crime problem. That stat comes from FBI crime data and is well known. Unlike the lie you keep repeating.
Hillary Clinton is a white supremacist too, by their very own standards.  She lives in an all-white community, had an ex-Klansman for a mentor, and called blacks super predators. But I bet most of them voted for her anyway.
More unarmed whites have been shot by police in 2017 than blacks or hispanics. That is according to the bastion of conservatism the WaPo and their 2017 Police Shooting database. So I guess by adding two minority races to skew the numbers you can reach your conclusion, but I wouldn't say that 44% versus 56% is "far fewer white folks". I would say that "far fewer" unarmed hispanics are shot than whites (11 vs 19) and "far fewer" unarmed blacks than whites (12 vs 19) are shot by police. The data would seem to suggest that when unarmed and encountering the police you are almost twice as likely to be shot if you are white than if you are black and almost twice as likely to be shot if you are white than if you are hispanic.
And I'm sure you apply that same formula to everyone right?  By your "logic" thuggish black people turn all black people into targets, right?   Same same, right?
Agree.  What is Marcus doing in that photo?  Is he protesting with the same thoughts as his black teammates?  I doubt it.  Did he get indoctrinated while in Oregon and Tennessee?  Again, I doubt it.  He should have just stayed out of the protest.
It's interesting to note that Black Lives Matter is extremely involved in this investigation. But shouldn't they be interested in the black on black murders that happen daily in Chicago instead of constantly pointing fingers at law enforcement if they are to live up to their name? Apparently Black Lives Matter Only If Shot by Police should be their actual moniker.  http://www.blacklivesmatterchicago.com/
After 7 years, the report card is in. The grades are not pretty. By every key economic measurement, blacks are worse off under Obama. In some cases, far worse off.  What about poverty? In 2009, the black poverty rate was 25.8 percent. As of 2014, according to Pew Research Center, the black poverty rate was 27.2 percent.  What about income? CNNMoney says, "Minority households' median income fell 9 percent between 2010 and 2013, compared to a drop of only 1 percent for whites."    What about net worth and the black-white "wealth gap"? The Financial Times said: "The median non-white family today has a net worth of just $18,100 -- almost a fifth lower than it was when Mr. Obama took office. White median wealth, on the other hand, has inched up by 1 percent to $142,000. In 2009, white households were seven times richer than their black counterparts. That gap is now eightfold.  When looking only at "black net worth" white households are actually 13 times wealthier than black households
Actually Mr Racial Stereotype, I used to be a radical leftist, probably more radically left than you are. A common myth among leftists is that conservatives were "raised that way" and will "die off" leaving a progressive utopia. Wrong. LOL.  Deflecting to the deeds of some dead white people has nothing to do with your unwillingness to accept the fact that 1) blacks commit the highest per capita rates of crime, and 2) blacks commit nearly all interracial murders, and as such 3) white folks have a right to discuss it.   What you want to do is tell whites to shut up about being victimized while you can prattle on bashing whites and their history at will as a crutch.  You're a racist and a hypocrite, and you're deeply in denial.
I hope this passes! After all my years going to Boulder, having an office there, I've found the people there, though progressive and ultra liberal, ONLY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR WAY OF LIFE! Everything in Boulder is so lily white though the liberals there all yell and scream for diversity... and also... NIMBY... not in their pristine world. Just got finished dating a Boulder woman there and I could not be more disappointed in her as a person! She harped about equality and racial values yet not once did I ever see a black or Latino among her or any of her friends. What a bunch of hypocrites there! Plus, nobody except for trust funders or very wealthy folks can afford to live in Boulder anymore. She poo-pooed Denver neighborhoods yet I live in a completely paid off beautiful ranch, on 1/4 acre in a quiet neighborhood and she lives in a cramped townhouse that's claustrophobic and she paid $600K for basically a micro townhouse to live in Boulder. Haha!
Leonard Pitts is a black supremacist
Jinx, you're a classic scumbag, dirty cop. Whether someone is a "felon" or not is irrelevant. What other derogatory labels can you affix to folks? How about Nigger? I'd also like to point out that you have no way of knowing who anyone on the internet is, as it's anonymous.
You sound like a mindless parrot talking about how you are in a militia like in the colonial days.  What’s the name of it?  Do you allow black people now?
if someone comes at me with a hammer or screwdriver and I have a gun I will shoot them.  I don't care if they are black, white red or have polka dots.
The South African government will never produce a comprehensive and credible land audit. It would  imply thinking and proper analysis. It would also produce metrics by which their progress can be measured and judged: a first step toward accountability, but the ANC could not give a hoot about the landless or poor blacks. Their primary motivation is the personal enrichment of their leaders and their friends. Also it is useful to say things like "they stole your land and made you poor" at election time and the masses will suck it up like honey every time.
Louisiana cop resigns after Facebook post about drowning white daughters who date black kids
Given the fact that Black Catholics are scarcer than hen's teeth, I'm almost always startled when they're mentioned on any of these sites.(I'm the Resident Protestant Gadfly on these sites; I'm African-American.)---The papal bull issued by pope Nicholas V in 1452 entitled "Dum Diversas" comes to mind; after all, it's responsible for my ancestors being on this side of the Atlantic in the first place. Mull and reflect...PEACE😐.
You're happy to purposefully 'step on the rights' of black, brown, AND WHITE people( that's what you meant by 'these people', right? we all know it) when you speak of confiscation of all handguns/semi-automatic anything, and making sure no one is allowed any long guns unless they meet your strict storage laws, but mention a crackdown on any 'particular area or particular persons' and you'd scream OMG RACIAL PROFILING  MY RIGHTS MY RIGHTS DISCRIMINATION NO etc etc.  Funny, most of the meth heads, shoplifters, thieves, low-lifes, and drug dealers in my neighborhood are white... no stepping on rights of 'brown or black' people here... didn't see that in the article either... hmm...
I was wondering what was going on in Town then I seen Al-chipmunk-Gore & Black Muslim Obama, and knew the world must be coming to a end. [ Now if you want to learn Science start reading books and listen to what your Scientist say.]
Go to *anywhere* in Asia, or the Middle East and ask what they think of 'Black people'. They will tell you calmly, openly that Blacks are a 'lower form' of existence in one way or another. --------------------------  and yet some immigrants from Asia and the Middle East will scream that there is racism in Canada and their human rights are violated in Canada
Fact: Black people in the US come the highest on negative rating like crime / jail inmates / rapes / absent fathers / pregnant schoolgirls / etc. Instead of expending energy on these issues they suddenly cause havoc around events of 175 years ago. Makes no sense to me and does not seem to be in their best interests?
Not likely if he was a 69 year old black man living alone. Quit it with the race card already.
My problem with what you said is that proving that the stop was for "driving while black" or "driving while latino" is impossible to prove. Thus, saying that the person so stopped should sue is futile, since the suit would go nowhere, and merely cost the person money.
Yet had this punk, regardless of his color, shot an innocent person, people would be up in arms at the police for not stopping crime. Oh wait, that's only if the perp was white and killed a black person. It's okay of black people kill other black people. Just look at Chicago.
Remember the Chump and his dad had a scheme going on in the seventies to avoid renting their properties to black families. I'm pretty sure that would qualify him as a bigot.
You are adding oranges to the apples in a weak attempt to tweak the numbers.    You have been called out for your deceit multiple times by many people and you respond with childish insults and unfounded allegations of racism.  Is the truth that black people murdered almost a thousand more people in 2015 than white people that painful for you?  Own it.
How do we become racists? By watching the news. The high crime rate of young "black men" is astonishing and scary.
I don't agree with the criminal trial verdict, but: 1) A lot of attorneys felt the lead prosecutor Marcia Clark took excruciatingly long to present what should have been a straightforward case for the State, and 2) The defense destroyed the police detective Mark Fuhrman's credibility because of Fuhrman's racism against black people. Care to try again?
Give it up, Black.  You don't belong on this site.  I'm sure there's a KKK site waiting for your input.
Many such claims have been made but nothing has happened over the years. Rupert and co. have accumulated wealth at the expense of black tax players. And raced ahead blaming others on the way. The KPMG incident reeks of their hand in it.
Minority borrowers are still more likely to get turned down for conventional mortgage loans than white people with similar credit scores. An Urban Insititute data analysis found that mortgage denial rates from government-sponsored servicers are higher for black applicants with bad credit than for white applicants with bad credit:  A study published this year in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that participants estimated black boys to be older and less innocent than white boys of the same age. When participants were told that the boys, both black and white, were suspected of crimes, the disparity in perceptions of age and innocence became more stark:  White Americans use drugs more than black Americans, but black people are arrested for drug possession more than three times as often as whites. Black men receive prison sentences 19.5 percent longer than those of white men who committed similar crimes, a 2013 report by the U.S. Sentencing Commission found.
Way off. 13% refers to men, women, and kids. White men 31% of the population.  Black men 3.5%. Black men are FORTY times more likely to commit a violent crime. I love it you think wikipedia is reliable. Go to the Us Census and the DOJ. That's where I get my "lies" OK Ericsnot?
" ....after an apology for past instances of racism (dressing up as a geisha, fetishizing black women’s hair). Her penitence seemed empty...." Taken straight from 17th century puritanical philosophy. Why not just sit Katy Perry at the front of the church and humiliate her like a 17th century pregnant teenager, or make her wear a hair shirt, like the monks of old, or set up stocks in the town centre where she can be really ridiculed and physically abused. In fact why stop there? Run her out of town. Prohibit her from selling records. Ruin her career.  This is how you victimize someone who is a major supporter of LGBTQ. This sanctimonious column is a disgrace to the Globe and Mail.
I guess you can believe whatever you like.  But "these gays are out of control" is a hateful thing to say.  I suppose you think blacks and Hispanics have their place, too.  Imagine anyone's audacity in asserting their rights.  You are the one who needs to get a grip.  These folks affect you in no way whatsoever.  Why didn't you simply say "I hate gays, and enjoy getting myself worked up worrying about what they're going to do?"
If the risk is high enough that someone would have to be a complete idiot to take part in it, why don't we have open seasons for the trails and closed seasons? Single track fatbiking in the winter has minimal chance of a bear encounter. Get real... its not black and white.
http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2016/11/wes-bellamy-charlottesville-twitter  Read up on Bellamy, he is a black supremacist.
Where did I state, all non-blacks, are racist? I didn't. Now move along, please.
The hard truth is that many minorities simply can't compete academically with Asian and White students. What most people don't know is that the best predictor of success on the SAT is race, not socioeconomic status. Even poor Asian students fresh off the boat will routinely outperform wealthy blacks and Hispanics. This isn't racism. It is what it is.
VERY well said.  I would add: the push for universal human rights is not an issue any group owns. No one gets to police my legal, empathetic, and productive push for rights by acting as ideological hall monitors. Sorry, you can try, but no. Too many SJW persons (a noble calling) don't understand that rage and verbal attack are, well, Trumpian methods. It's a mode that fails to accord with what it calls for in others: empathy, tolerance, dialogue. It's the overheated strands of SJW rhetoric that actually helped Trump, dividing the left and creating a back lash. Consider Rorty's GENIUS prediction of the Trump movement: "One thing that is very likely to happen is that the gains made in the past 40 years by black and brown Americans, and by homosexuals, will be wiped out. Jocular contempt for women will come back into fashion. … All the resentment which badly educated Americans feel about having their manners dictated to them by college graduates will find an outlet."
Trump haters won't say a word about the cops who were killed during pro-black demonstrations, but they'll come out in force when the colors are switched.
Ridiculous.  President Trump denounced the neo-nazis.  What he correctly refused to do was lump everyone who opposes the removal of beautiful, historical statues together.  Your response is quite Taliban/Daesh.  If you do not like a work of art, then you believe that you have the right to destroy it.  You, like Dobbs and the rest of the scofflaw progressives condone black criminals like Taqiyah Thompson who wish to destroy art and America.  The lying, corrupt progressives are the disaster, not President Trump.
i am white. no one disputes a right to express oneself. but you ought to have a good reason if your going to do it this way. they're saying there's a problem with the country in general, not just the police or some particular issue. your saying, despite all the anti-racism efforts in this country, that this country has/is oppressing black people, and by inference you're saying the very whites in the stands are blameworthy. meanwhile whites quietly put up with the massive amount of crime blacks commit. we're absolutely disgusted.
Stop pointing at the Chicago police as if they are the sole problem in that city.  Chicago has a massive Black-on-Black murder problem.  Young, Black males are overwhelmingly committing most of the murders.  'Just because you can have a baby, it doesn't mean you should,' Lemon said. 'Especially without planning for one or getting married first. More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers. And the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison and the cycle continues.'"  http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/chicago-75-murdered-are-black-71-murderers-are-black
The uneducated minions voted trumpf in. Duh.....took grammies medicaid and meals on wheels,and ebt away. Dosh gone it. "Ya'll thought only black ebt and medicaid was going to be dash"? Lol.
I'm reasonably certain that you don't really believe that the people running our government are Democrats and Republicans. There's a reason that they encourage division among the proletariat.   The rich are doing all they can to ensure that if major shooting starts, it will be upon mosques, Muslim neighborhoods, Black neighborhoods, Mexican neighborhoods.  You don't have a list?
Another false, inane comment from one whose political ideology is directly opposed to the Constitutional Republic and all human rights and freedom contained therein.  Still hanging onto all of the false mythology of spitting on soldiers used by the same anti-American Republicans, White Supremacists, CONservatives and all of the rest of those responsible for the incompetent, criminal occupants of the current government, nationally and locally.  Patriotism exists only in the outward signs of flag waving, lapel pins, and clothing covering the black hearts and souls of traitors to the nation.  Denigrating one of the best columnists and this column which truly addresses the real veterans' issues ignored by this ideological moron.
Definition of mob rule: control of a political situation by those outside the conventional or lawful realm, typically involving violence and intimidation.  Taken in context with the rest of your post referencing the "hazards of tyranny," I would say I understand the intent of the phrase, "mob rule."   Are you comparing the peaceful march in Seattle to people hanging blacks from streetlights?  I'm not sure how you can draw any comparison between the two.  Women began fighting for the right to vote in 1848 when they started to organize nationally and convene women's conferences all over the US.  They organized parades, pickets and marches.  They were beaten, jailed and went on hunger strikes.  To suggest that after 72 years of fighting, women were given the right to vote because of the intellect of the Republican party is an ignorant conclusion that ignores the years of struggle and pressure women put on both the president and the congress.
The darker the dumber.  59 percent for blacks in DPS.  What a waste of taxpayer money!
Talk about posting the same old boring crap! POT.........................KETTLE.........................BLACK
He also said it was ok for the black community to blow of a little steam.
Nazism wants to eradicate all non-white races. This is a call to violence and an attempt to incite violence against those groups.  I do not disagree that we should allow everyone the ability to say what they want, up until it calls openly for the death of other people. That is against the law and that is what the nazis are doing. They want to kill all jews, blacks, and LGBTQ persons, oh yeah and anyone else they might have beef with that day.  So yes if you defend the words the Nazis are speaking then you are a nazi sympathizer and are equal to the nazis.  If you are defending their right to speak openly about it, then I agree, however only to the point where the start calling for the death of fellow Americans.  We(as a nation) collectively get pissed off when N. Korea kills one kid, or when ISIS says they will destroy our country, but we cannot be upset a bunch of nazi larpers want be able to openly call for ethnic cleansing the USA. That is silly. They are calling for mass murder.
Tom: The Southern Poverty Law Center is the leading organization for tracking racists and hate groups in the USA, outside of the FBI.  And they list the Nation of Islam as a racist group that spreads hatred.  And Ali has been a member ever since 1964.  They are an extremist fringe sect of Islam with less than 40,000 members.    So it is not I that is judging the Nation of Islam, the Southern Poverty Law Center is.   Just read what they say about the nation of Islam at the link I have posted:      https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam  Here is quote from their description of NOI:  "The Nation of Islam's theology of innate black superiority over whites and the deeply racist, anti-Semitic and anti-gay rhetoric of its leaders have earned the NOI a prominent position in the ranks of organized hate."  I guess that you are OK with their bashing and denigrating of LGBT people too.   I condemn all hate groups listed on the SPLC website.   Do you???
You are correct by any definition. The difference is that the founding documents of the US did state that all are created equal and we have been striving to live up to that ideal ever since. The founding documents of the confederacy flat out stated that blacks are slaves and only count as 3/5ths.   In other words, the US had an ideal that all humans are equal and we have tried to live up to that ideal ever since. The Confederacy had the ideal that only whites could be free and blacks were chattel.  Slavery and white supremacy are evil and deserve no honor.
If you want to have a conversation about prejudice begin by teaching real historical facts.... Which Eugene 4j does not teach!  The journey of a black slave to life long servitude often began in the interior of Africa with his or her capture as a prize of war by other black tribesmen, as tribute given by a weak tribal state to a more powerful one, or by outright kidnapping by black local slave traders. European/white slave traders very rarely ventured beyond Africa's coast regions. The truth is blacks enslaved blacks! In America the culture of white guilt syndrome has become the poisonous ignorance of sensitivity cupcakes teaching [more like breeding] in public schools more ignorant sensitivity cupcakes the hallmark of Eugene 4j.
Read  Colin Flaherty's " Don't make the Black Kids Angry " and visit his You Tube channel for more truth , if you can take it .
I never thought I would see the day that we would have s RACIST president in the white house that would bring this out in people to the point that we don't watch football because his absence minded self says it's about the military and disrepcting the flag. THIS SHIT IS FUNNY. I still watch football on Sundays Monday night and Thursday but it's planning on what good team is on. GOD is just shacking his head and crossing his children off his list to get into his HOUSE. All of this with the president is someting that the more and more he changes the focus off of him to something or someone else it's better for him and people just do what the KING says if your a REAL FAN of football your going to watch the games regardless, if your not watching your not a TRUE fan at all. But since it's about BLACK MEN WHITE don't want to hear it or talk about it like they say it's no rascism in America. BLACK players making all this money what r they complaining for. SAD all of u
No, he's not.  And you just dropped a steaming pile of denial: "no comrades to support a whiff of scandal in DC, on either side."  Let's see, he's been in office for what, 5 months and has had to fire multiple members of his campaign and administration and us now being investigated for obstruction of justice.   Yeah, he's the worst president this country has ever had, hands down.   Clinton is competent and did this country great service over her 30 years in office. Like all spoiled children who hate and fear mommy, the right wing just can't handle that. Just as they couldn't handle an intelligent, charming, accomplished black man as President.   Go back to your cave, knuckle dragger.
Good thing for those who pulled their guns that the cops didn't get there before the shooter left.  Otherwise, the cops would have shot everyone with a weapon.  Oh, wait, they only do that if its a black guy.
Actually, in Oregon, the percentage of Hispanic Felons pretty much matches their demographics in the census.    11.7%  of the population and 8.3% of the Felons.    It is possible that some of those Hispanics are no longer in the Pen because they were sent back to their country of origin, of course.  Now, the blacks are 7.7% of the Felons and only 2.1% of the Oregon population.  Blacks are three times more likely to be convicted of Felonies than their numbers alone would justify.
100% BS.....even "conservative" bishops spend 20-50X as much money on liberal social justice nonsense than they do on "conservative" issues like opposing abortion and defending marriage.   The Catholic bishops have been whores for liberal garbage like Nancy Piglosi, Ted Kennedy, Biden, and the rest of the Democratic Left.  Meanwhile, the civil rights of WHITE ETHNIC CATHOLICS have been under assault for decades:  forced busing...racial quotas....affirmative action....diversity garbage.  The black political establishment is the ENEMY of Catholics and the Church.  A Chuch whichi is 97% white has no business ass-kissing anti-Catholic Negroes.  Time to act accordingly.
@lukecanada - people like you, who attack the black community, are the hateful and racist.
Shocker. And somehow the GOP keeps pretending they are the party of the little guy and that they really do care about flyover country and getting so many to vote against their own economic interests.    Guess they couldn't stomach seeing a competent woman run things. And had so much unexplained rage about the black guy.
Your premise is truly stupid. No one was removing the statue at that time, and the march of the NAZIs and KKK was through the racially integrated University of Virginia. The chants were "You won't replace us" and "Jews won't replace us." It was a white supremacy march against an America where black and brown people have equal rights. It wan't about some cheesy statue of a general who became a traitor to the nation of his birth, the United States of America.
Your comment is insipid.  I never said there is no racism, so stop your brainless accusation.  And think about the implication of what you say --- that unless black and whites are picked up in equal proportions, the reason must be racism.  What idiocy.  Does it ever occur to you that the incidence of black violent crime far outstrips white violent crime?
Considering the volume of information, protests, riots, marches etc., re: persons of color and law authorities this makes little sense. Why would a black man, enter someone's home, refuse to leave, carry a weapon in his backpack AND when police arrive refuse to cooperate. This a recipe for disaster. Suicide by cop? Dumb burglar? Makes no sense ergo, there must be or had been something seriously wrong with this individual. Thank goodness it had the outcome it did.
WHEN is that guy in the white shirt and dark glasses, short hair going to be apprehended/arrested?  He has shown up in several photos, mostly notably he was one of those beating up that black teenager in the parking lot. geesus.
Thats right wave, we dont like obama because he is black. Really, is that your argument? We all are just prejudiced? Yes obama did some good things but overall he was a terrible president.
And he is now added to the statistics of another "black male only prosecuted because of his race" I keep reading about.
The German National Socialists are the more obvious ones....also North Korean Communists carry out massive torchlight parades...a pox on the White Suprematists , BLM and the globalist black hooded rent a riotists.
The protest of the treatment of (criminal) blacks by police is impudent because  the treatment of (criminal) blacks by police is completely justified . It is a dangerous job. Fire those football players who hate  the  civilized America and disrespect the anthem. But maybe they only have brain damage from frequent collisions..
If this woman was black or brown and a Muslim the jury and the courts would impose an immediate, maximum sentence.
Imbelli is sycophantically echoing his publisher's bias. The so-called therapeutic culture is hardly the major obstacle to "the obedience of faith."   It's probably fairly rare for anybody to say, "Gosh, thinking of myself as a black guy is preventing me from being transformed by the gospel into believing it's kind of OK for the police to beat me up." But it's a lot rarer for anybody to say, "Wow, enjoying being a jerk to people is preventing me from being transformed by the gospel into realizing that I have better things to do than fill NCR comment boxes with priggish faux-piety all day long."  And rarest of all is anybody saying, "Oh, look, constantly congratulating myself on my ontological superiority is preventing me from being transformed by the gospel into realizing I'm really just a lazy, drunken, obese grifter."
What were  Sanger and W.E.B. Du Bois' motives in promoting The Negro Project?  "Sanger suggested the answer to poverty and degradation lay in smaller numbers of blacks. She convinced black civic groups in Harlem of the “benefits” of birth control, under the cloak of “better health” (i.e., reduction of maternal and infant death; child spacing) and “family planning.”    'DuBois, in his article “Black Folk and Birth Control,” noted the “inevitable clash of ideals between those Negroes who were striving to improve their economic position and those whose religious faith made the limitation of children a sin.” He criticized the “mass of ignorant Negroes” who bred “carelessly and disastrously so that the increase among [them] ... is from that part of the population least intelligent and fit, and least able to rear their children properly.”  http://www.citizenreviewonline.org/special_issues/population/the_negro_project.htm
if trump is the orange poodle does that mean obumma is a black monkey?
Your comment is ridiculous.  Should I protest at a hospital because I want less military spending?  Disrespecting a symbol of why you are free to protest/have dumb thoughts on a subject/are safe does not make sense.  The Flag and Anthem are not symbols you disrespect just as I would never burn a cross, Star of David or Koran.  Those are symbols and things held dear to people.  If its fine to dis the flag, what if they decided to burn a cross? The whole BLM movement is a racist farce in America.  Stats show there IS NOT any genocide of black men or anyone by cops in America.  There are very, very few black men shot by cops in questionable circumstances in America.  Ferguson is one example.  The cop was almost killed and Mike Brown deserved what he got.  The false narrative was that he was knelt down and shot in the back of the head by a racist cop.  Sorry, didn't happen.What does happen is thousands and thousands of young black men murder one another and BLM ignores that horrifying stat
If your Black president had said the same thing to a Gold Star Family nothing would have been said. Mr Trump has  contacted most of the familues of those killed in action. Give Him a break.  Its the hardest thing for a person to do!
Oh, Trump has a "black friend". LOL  The DOJ and the Urban League caught Trump committing illegal anti-black housing discrimination. He instructed his supers to mark applications from black applicants with a "C" for colored. The Urban League sent test renters to Trump properties, some black, some white, all with similar qualifications. The white applicants were accepted, black applicants were told "no vacancy" or they were steered toward a predominantly black Trump property. A black husband went to a Trump property and was declined. His white wife went to the same property almost immediately after and was accepted. Segregation. This isn't just words. This affects freedom of movement of black Americans. It's illegal. DOJ went after Trump a second time because he didn't adhere to the first agreement.  Did you think it was an accident that neo-Nazi Richard Spencer and Klansman David Duke and the international white supremacist movement were so passionate about Trump? Segregation.
"Black privilege"? That's a new one on me. Why no homeless blacks in Eugene? Maybe we have a shortage of blacks, in fact, I'm pretty sure we do. As an alternative I would suggest that black people have it together better than a lot of what you most certainly call white trash - you know, the folks down on their luck and short of life skills, who get sucked into the alcohol/drug world of giving up on life. In other words, our pariahs reflect the demographic. Now, I'm ashamed of having spent so much of my precious time on Earth lecturing a dolt.
Sister and everyone else should resist the temptation to lump half of the U.S. into the same basket as the German's who supported Hitler, or who lynched Blacks.  I ask again, all NCR commentators -- STOP equating voters for Trump with criminals.  Stop using terms like bigot, fascist, KKK and Nazi to describe the party that won the presidential election.
really, what are you going to do without having someone to criticize for governing while black?
Why is President Barack Obama the worst president, twosail?  Because he's black?
Wouldn't it  just be too funny if Oprah Winfrey ran for the Democrats in their next election and became POTUS. Those Trumpsters would sure have their knickers in a twist. A woman and a black woman at that. Lordy, Lordy.
Most Republicans don't. Its only the left that's shocked. Shocked he's black and a Republican!!
Its emotion which cause people to think their feelings are more important than FACTS !   NEVER heard about racism when Obama was elected. You are INSANE to think that electing the first black president was racist.
Oh that poor "little (white) guy," when he realized he's really not that different from the poor brown and black people he decided to do what his 1% masters tell him. "Vote for the far-Right," they said. And he's so well-trained he did. He will be rewarded some puppy bites and won't be able to figure out why he's still hungry but he'll wait patiently because master says he'll have his special place in the racial hierarchy. He's so obedient and loyal, the 1% man's best friend.
Get a load of this: "A rant from a misogynistic, homophobic racist is allowed on 'Civil' comments." That's just stunning! Fedup808 has labelled Frank_96740 a woman-hater, a gay-hater, and a black-hater, but HER OWN comment has apparently passed muster as a "civil comment". What a hypocrite! Where are the controls?
The problem is that despite of their relatively small % of the population, statistically young black males commit most violent crimes, leading to under the table profiling, unconstitutional or not. There are no winners in this case, one person is dead an others lives are destroyed. We have to find a workable fix to break this deadly cycle.
No, it's you who's been thoroughly discredited here. You either don't understand what you're looking at or purposely misrepresent it. Either way, you've been owned. Blacks DO commit more homicides as a raw number than whites, even with hispanic/latinos factored into the "white" category, and a vastly disproportionate amount per capita. I've already linked to the data, you can keep your head in the sand and cry "racism!" all you want, but you're done here.
Trump responds to accusations of racism with fake photo of black supporters.   At a Friday afternoon rally in California, Trump sought to highlight his support from minorities.   “Look at my African-American over there,” he shouted.  He seems to have made things worse, with many noting that his phrasing implied ownership over the man.  This morning on Twitter, Trump was back at it, highlighting the support of an African-American family.   Just one problem. The photo is fake.   It was not taken at a Trump event. Rather, it was taken at the “The 27th annual Midwest Black Family Reunion” held in Ohio in August 2015. Yhe annual event attracts more than 100,000 people over 3 days.  Last year, Trump attracted controversy when he retweeted fake statistics claiming 81% of white murder victims were murdered by blacks. The actual figure is 14%.  “All I know is what is on the internet.” Donald Trump
Do you support the fascist anftifa?  Is so why?   Why do you support a group whose name claims only Black lives Matters?
I guess the marchers wearing hoods, shouting expletives about Jews and Blacks, and wearing swastikas, and doing Nazi salutes learned real well. Yes, they want to live it again - hah... the smell of burning flesh and hanging of uppity Blacks, and gassing of the Jews. That's the history they long for. If you want to keep your children ignorant by feeding them that hate, that's your prerogative. Most parents teach their children about right from wrong and you don't need a history book for that.
Jimmy! OMG ! : (Obama's) support of Black Lives Matter - certainly controversial but not disgusting." Whaaat?!  Not disgusting to agree with "Kill the cops, fry em up like bacon", Etc. Etc. - oh yes, just Lovely comments.  He most certainly Was/IS an apologist for Muslim terrorists -just google it!
So if a mosque has one jihadist member, they must all be jihadist? Since one black guy is defended by others for a violent crime, they are all violent criminals? Since a few anti-white Israelites show up to a black lives matter march, they must all be racist Israelites? Since a few members of antifa go full on terrorist and attack with weapons and acid, they are all domestic terrorists? Or do you just draw the line at righty-whitey and excuse the rest...
LMAO... MLB is putting on captivating  Playoffs..... while nfl Negroes  laugh and tell the folks who pay all the bills  to pound sand. Sadly, these illiterate racists are too stupid to realize what they are doing. Without White folks, Western Civilization, free market capitalism and America they're sitting on rocks eating bush meat.
If the shooter was black he'd likely be dead by now.
If you really are a Latino, you are reading from the wrong book. You need an update. The days of immigrants becoming white by learning to hate black people are history. The only Latinos for which that that strategy worked are old Cubans. This is the 21st century.
This is the same exact STUPID thoughtless comment we see all the time. you can't even come up with an original thought. THINK.. Do they have NON handicap parking spaces?  These celebrations come about because of people like YOU..People who oppress those who are not like you.. People who think THEY are the only ones who deserve rights.. These parades and celebrations are to remind folks like YOU that these people exist and are worthy of exactly what you are worthy of.. when these celebrations are no longer NEEDED to remind you dolts then YAY... We will be one nation.. Until then America is NOT great and never was.. America is filled with BIGOTS who say things like "What I can't stand is that we have this black history month and gay pride month" .... THINK! for ONCE in your life.. THINK !
Lincoln's solution for the Slave Problem was to ship them back to Africa. In Lincoln's home state of Ohio he signed bill to forbid black immigration to Ohio.
'oldvalleyguy' Your screen name says it all for me.  God forbid it happens to someone in your family and I promise you will sing a different tune.  Whether they be Black, White, Hispanic, or Other.  Resisting arrest does not give anyone the right to shoot an unarmed individual at point blank range.  You sir are a jerk and that is being kind!
Give scholarship to black kids.
Wow.   This is probably one of the most (if not the most) asinine,  lefty fascist propaganda pieces I have read in a while.  Göebels would be proud of Seattle Weekly.     There are no white supremacist bands here. I love how it says "it is more common for white supremacist bands to promote their ideas subtly".  Yeah,  that way the leftist fascists can call any band or person a racist or a Nazi, and distort their words into bullshit.   Also,  Death in June is not a Nazi band.  A Jewish,  gay,  immigrant who loves black dick (Milo, of course) is not a fascist.   The adjectives listed above of what he is, is every one of the things that Nazis hate.  And Anti-Sharia March was exactly that --  an anti-Sharia march against honour killings, FGM, and killing of gays.
I remember that, it was horrible what they did to those two white people.  They kept this so under wraps because the vicious criminals were black that it was sickening.  We wonder why there is so much tension, the media just stokes the flames.
Milwaukee is the most biggoted city I have ever lived in.  Every ethnic group hate the others. The only agreement amongst them is hate for Hispanics, Blacks and Asians.
We live in the west, my family killed Nazis, only dealings with Jews was in school, neighborhood, friendship, business, Hunting, fishing trips, ect. Don't f-ck with my friends. I have had hunting and fishing friends that were native American, married to one, white boys, Negros, Chinese, Hmong, great hunters, some mutts like myself. This society has gone insane, letting a small group of manipulating revolutionaries control the weak minded, drug impaired zombies.
Agree with Rowman.  The baker is ok refusing to make a cake with gay men on the cake, or with swastikas on it, or breasts on it.  It is not ok to refuse to make a cake for a black person, a gay person, an asian, an American Indian ... get it Richard Stacy ?   Tough concept.  I say let him refuse whatever classes of people he wants, and post it in the store prominently ... then ALL reasonable people can avoid him and find a baker that is not a bigot.
Mr. Sherman... Quoted from Patrick J. Buchanan, We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude? What more opportunity is it that the White people need to give to help the Blacks? If the poor white got this much opportunity there would be no poor white or lower class of white trash people!! The main problem why black people are not progressing is the, "They owe me factor"!! Get it in your head! No Body Owes You Any Thing!  Talk about new 'ladders of opportunity' for blacks. Go to Altoona? And Johnstown, and ask the white kids in Catholic schools how many were visited lately by Ivy League recruiters handing out scholarships for 'deserving' white kids? Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America?
"If you count the authoritarians and those that assume the worst of blacks and Latinos, it is everyone who voted for Trump for reasons other than party loyalty or dislike for Hillary." What a ridiculous statement.   Someone that voted for Trump due to economic or religious reasons is considered an Alt-right racist according to you?
Of course no mention of the fact that the reason more blacks are arrrested and tossed in jail is because..., hello! They commit more crimes!!  Astounding is it not. Simple facts once again.
On blacks, immigrants and indigents: "...human weeds,' 'reckless breeders,' 'spawning... human beings who never should have been born."  Margaret Sanger, Pivot of Civilization, referring to immigrants and poor people  On sterilization & racial purification: Sanger believed that, for the purpose of racial "purification," couples should be rewarded who chose sterilization. Birth Control in America, The Career of Margaret Sanger, by David Kennedy, p. 117, quoting a 1923 Sanger speech.  On the right of married couples to bear children: Couples should be required to submit applications to have a child, she wrote in her "Plan for Peace." Birth Control Review, April 1932  On the purpose of birth control: The purpose in promoting birth control was "to create a race of thoroughbreds," she wrote in the Birth Control Review, Nov. 1921 (p. 2)
does the fact that he refused to rent to black people count? Or is that fake news?
No, absolutely not.  The difference is the reason behind the speech.  We can't yell "Fire!" in a crowded room, unless of course there is a fire.  Part of the problem is that too many people can't express an opinion without going a bit too far.  Don't like a movie, okay, but some have to prove he movie is unlikable and make insulting comments about the actors.  I loved the original Ghostbusters and wonder about the remake.  However, when I see it I may like it.  If I don't, I won't take it personally or feel it necessary to make hate-filled comments.    One of the reasons I think Donald Trump is dangerous is that too many of his supporters feel empowered to apply hate labels to group historically discriminated against: women, blacks, Latinos, Asians, etc., etc., etc.
The Republicans longest running lie is that they don't recruit white racists into the GOP. That recruitment started with Barry Goldwater. They have been very successful with their recruitment efforts. I remember when Ronald Reagan kicked off his successful run for president with a speech in Philadelphia, Mississippi. That town was famous for one thing, the murder of Swerner, Goodman, and Chaney. They were murdered for registering black folks to vote in the 1960's. The Christian KKK did the deed with the help of local law enforcement. The crowd of white folks loved his speech.
"I've actually seen members of your party defend slavery, and say that blacks were better off when they were enslaved."  ===  Those who would are idiots.
ENOUGH! Charles. Your brand of racism is a huge part of the issues in this country. You want danger, you want to fear for your life as you constantly bemoan about? Go to the inner cities, you know the inner city black neighborhoods. That is where you will have real fear, and it will not be white people or cops you would need to fear. Hear is a news flash for you, my son was MURDERED by a black person, and his grandfather, (dad was in prison) had the nerve to stand up in court and blame whitey for his grandson murdering my son. The murderer got all of 3 1/2 years in jail, that shows just how bad our system is right Charles? My life has been threatened many times, not by cops, but by blacks. FACT! Should I become as racist as you are? Your generation, teaching hate to the next generation is a huge problem. You should be concentrating your energies on fixing the huge family problems in the black community, but your happier just spreading your brand of racism. Shame on you and your ilk!
Yes- Since most shootings are within racial groups and since the vast majority of shootings in Chicago are by its black citizens, a white person is much less likely to be shot. Inane.
Perhaps you could substitute the word male (or men) in the article for women or blacks, or Muslim.
All you can comment is this garbage? And you're a practicing Catholic? I've been part of the Catholic community since I was baptized over 50 yrs ago. " just flag all the alt-reich commentators". Yea, as if that isn't calling the kettle black.
Max,   Please reread what I wrote.  I merely stated that skin color is not a behavioral trait.   Sometimes you need to ask questions and look at context.  Are all black people good absolutely not, but that doesn't mean that because they look different than you that as a race they are bad.    What facts am I denying? I also didn't complain about unfairness or play the race card.  The article is about the discrepancies between crimes committed by race.  I'm not partisan, I just believe that pointing a finger at others doesn't solve problems.
dear scottd  Pride gets public funding for gay pride and gay rights  yet allows non-gay politics to march like Queers against Israeli Apartheid and Black Lives Matter  is this not incompetence? using public money for purposes the money was not intended for
Sorry, but white supremacists aren't the only bigots.  We now have black  supremacists and religious ones as well.  Most bigots I see are liberals. "Bigot:  a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices." https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot
For decades the 'black church' has endorsed candidates from the pulpit, why not the white evangelical churches?
I pass by this place to and from work every day and noticed the new art this morning! Hopefully, Lars Larson won't get wind of this. He and his Trump-sucking listeners all have a major hard-on for murals of Black men.
The first thing the cops did after they shot him was yell for handcuffs while he lay motionless on the ground. Then they hand-cuffed a black man dying of a gunshot wound.  To give the cop some credit, he only shot him once. That really angers me.   The other day in Tulsa they stood around and watched a black man die.  There's some real cop bad conduct going on here.  Anyone can carry a gun in that state.  It's common for people to conceal a small gun with an ankle holster like.....white people.
Replace age 66 with black, what do you get?  A racist who should be driven out of town.
It's no more than 'burning and looting' done by the same 'oppressed' blacks.
Unfortunately, it's a stupidity that is encouraged by regarding Brown as a righteous victim.  He was anything but that.  As a consequence, more young black men --- whose lives could have been spared had they been told the truth --- are going to die in fits of a well-schooled "stupidity."  Black lives matter, indeed.      How about a new movement called "Tell the Truth"?  That actually COULD save some black lives.
The author writes (with the editor's consent):  "It’s mostly speculation at this point as to what Trump will do."  So why not also publish an article entitled "Will Trump be putting black people in chains and repealing women's suffrage"??  This kind of writing is ridiculous.
Dat knee grrr was a thug. I normally use N word right bout here. Blacks support anything without knowing about it first.
Look like another ignorant racist needs some lessons. a) Jews are Arabs (confirmed by DNA testing) they were classified as whites by Apartheid government (whilst other Arabs where not)  So in fact there are 6 whites and 10 non whites. b) The minister specifically pointed out Afrikaners not whites.  How does this  endanger anyone?  Lets look as some realities 1) If the Bantu education system was so bad why were there more black lawyers than white lawyers in South Africa during apartheid, more black doctors than white doctors? All these blacks got their degrees from Universities funded by the Whites. The thousands of blacks who got their degrees during the 70s and 80s are proof that blacks did have access to good education, the problem was most were to lazy to make the sacrifice needed to get educated. 2) Whats stopping you and all other blacks from joining the 2 blacks on the list, after all they had the same hurdles to jump you did? So stop blaming whites for your lack of will power.
Jinx, you're a classic scumbag, dirty cop. Whether someone is a "felon" or not is irrelevant. What other derogatory labels can you affix to folks? How about Nigger? I'd also like to point out that you have no way of knowing who anyone on the internet is, as it's anonymous.
You're a black-hearted witch with  a B.
The self-righteous hypocrisy, pomposity and arrogance is strong on this page.  Almost as strong as the stupid. You know who you are.   Yes, Black Lives Matter is a chapter-based national organization. Yes, for ha variety of reason, black people are stopped more frequently by police than whites for the same behavior. Similarly they arrested more frequently for the same behavior and they are often charged and prospected differently than whites.  So, it's not that black people commit more crimes than whites.
Black males are 80 times more likely to be shot by other black males than by a cop of any colour.  Experience teaches us many things, but you don't want the police to learn anything from what they  experience daily .
There's no grouping, clueless!!!  Check out the FACTS, which apparently don't fit your liberal views.  70% out of wedlock birth rate among young black females and to many of the males leaving them alone.  Black on black crime rate up double digits in Chicago in 2017 alone!!  And the lists go on and on.  I'm no where near as ignorant and arrogant as you sound!!!  Just so you know I was born into a military family and was going to the same schools, riding the same buses, walking the same streets, scout troops, sports and eating in the same lunch rooms as blacks, Hispanics and Asians.  And this was in the 50's & 60's, long before you ever saw the first minority.  And guess what clueless??  We  got along, because we "all" were held to the same standards expected of military personal/dependents living on base or in the surrounding areas.  Just a little personal knowledge and experience!!
Jesse Jackson is a politician. Al Sharpton is a minister. Neither one is anywhere near as bigoted as you. And in the Jim Crow South, lynching of black men, often following their genital mutilation, was done thousands of times, with many photographs of whole white families, men women and children, pointing and laughing at the hanging corpse. Real family entertainment, post-Reconstruction and continuing into the 1960's.   (  Allen, James. "Musarium: Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America")   Benjamin Tillman, governor of South Carolina and later a United States Senator:  "We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men, and we never will. We have never believed him to be the equal of the white man, and we will not submit to his gratifying his lust on our wives and daughters without lynching him."    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching
I am sure black guys will have a big problem with cops who carry riot shields. That can be seen as racist too: like cops use nicer riot shields on white people,.
In every case he inserted his view in the national media rereatedly from the college professor to michael brown to ferguson etc. etc. official investigations, trials and grand juries proved him wrong 100% of the time. It was always with him if the incident involved a black person and always against a policeman or white they were always abused because of their skin. Choosing always by race only=Bigot...look it up!
I do enjoy watching snowflakes melt. Allie and boots, are the best. Regardless of the news it's the same reaction. And Allie,   we don't all miss Obama. We don't all respect the job he did for 8 years. In fact, when the dust settles and historians pen the facts. Our first half black president will be neck and neck with Jimmy Carter, at the bottom of the heap.
Privileged Black Africans abusing other Black Africans.  I like it.
Why did these women go willing into a room alone with Cosby? Did they not know black men have big schlongs and practice rough sex with drugs? Were they looking for pay-4-play money action? Quaaludes were very popular during those days and were used as payment for sax just like cocaine, pot, heroin, etc. Why didn't they report their rapes at the time it happened instead of now when everybody is claiming it. Opportunistic lottery ticket? That 15 year old. What was she doing in a Playboy mansion. Wanted to be sexy woman and was willing to take drugs and be a playmate like all the beautiful pin up stars? Is there a thrill about being stoned out paralyzed and being raped by a black man with a humongous flagpole? Something like a sexual fantasy like bondage, whipping, and wearing shiny black vinyl bikinis like in Bangkok? I think Cosby's going to be acquitted.
Al-Salaam alaykum wa Rah'matullahi wa Barakatu: here's how it works: If an individual Muslim, black person, or Mexican does something wrong, their behavior magically reflects on ALL Muslims, black people or Mexicans. If a white guy does something wrong, it only reflects on HIM. Not the entire white 'community'.  This is why these arrogant, self-entitled white supremacists (a more accurate term than merely 'racist') will defend ANY state-sponsored murder by a cop, no matter the circumstances, as 'justified' because 'so many black people are criminals' according to them. But these same hypocrites remain utterly SILENT when it's pointed out that 79% of mass-shooters and 80% of child molesters are white.  White percentage in the overall population is only 62.5%.  They're disproportionately represented among mass-murderers and child molesters.  Eh.  That seems fairly consistent with white American history and culture, so not really surprising.
Stupid people use the silly term "African American" in a desperate attempt to be politically-correct.  They don't realize that Africa is a continent - not a country.  Omar Sharif is from Egypt but lived here. Dave Matthews and Charlize Theron moved here from South Africa. I guess that makes them all African Americans!  What do you call a black guy in Canada? An African Canadian? An African North American?  Some folks just can't think for themselves.
You mean like how they are taught by black thugs, since those black fathers are missing, or how far too many young men and women are indoctrinated in the strict version of Islam and Sharia Law. Any thoughts about those people, or are they off limits because of color or religion.  They are according to dishonest, PC & cowardly liberals!!
short is short on empathy....he knows nothing about black experience...a lily-white Virginian...I am a white older person who Is happy to see that the players are more than their considerable salaries and are concerned with their racial brothers.  he and udell are seduced by the great blond leader....who has no intellect, scope, ethics, empathy, etc.  udell is so seduced by his leader as to not identify with his background.  I am surprised that he has not immersed himself into a vat with bleach.
Yo Rahm, I understand you don't care how many blacks kill each other in your city, but this sanctuary nonsense is ridiculous !!
The thing that saddens me the most about the black face incident, is the lack of any concern by most white people about why we have never had equal protection under the law for all Americans. It seems obvious to me that white law professors that are ignorant about the role of white racism in every aspect of American life, including our justice system, contribute to us not having equal protection under the law. Of course, it is hard to see a problem when you are the beneficiary of that problem. Or maybe, equal protection under the law is just another white privilege. Most white folks seem happy with the situation. They think being polite and respectful to black people is like being lynched. BTW, the GOP wants to go back to the original Constitution. Land owning white men were the only citizens with full citizenship rights in the good old days.
On this I agree with Trump.  These multi-millionaire athletes who insult the anthem or flag don't belong here. Send them back to the Hottentot chimps of the African league in Uganda. They're just silly uneducated folks that enforces the mental inferiority of many black athletes.  Put them in a military uniform and see how long they'll last.
Wow D. Nationally (according to the FBI) 83 percent of white victims of murder were killed by white people. "Hispanic perps" are less criminal than the average white person on just about every count according to just about every source. And Black killers, just like white ones, are overwhelmingly likely to kill people just like themselves! This is all above and beyond your suicides. You people got to stop killing yourselves each other and finding ways to blame black and brown people for all of your problems before you roll out your white pride alternative facts.
Should I remind you and very other bigot here that Dylann Roof, a self-avowed White Nationalist and supporter of the KKK, is not sorry for what he did. He shot and killed 9 good Black Americans who had just bowed their heads and closed their eyes to pray. Then Roof unloaded 77 bullets into them. There's your hate-born and raised white man.
Are you supposed to be a journalist, Lizzy Acker? Does the truth mean anything to you? If you were assaulted by a black man, and the police asked you for a description of your assailant, would you say he was white? Would it be racist to say he was black?  You're so busy slapping labels on other people and their comments try this one, and see if it fits you: fascist.  By the way, I don't believe for a second that you are graciously keeping up these comments you have deemed "racist" just to show you're not a censor. No, dear. You left those comments up because your new comment system hasn't been generating as many comments as you would like.  I know this because I, like other commenters here, have received e-mails from "Civil Comments" inviting me to post more comments.
HAH---this newspaper is almost a bigger joke than the fed.govt!  ---NO, they both strain the credibility  of the public.---This "liberal newsletter of the Organic-farmers-of-Diversity"---in a  Pacific Northwest that has very few black people----WHY DO YOU  THINK this state and county has so many liberals living here?---Because its so WHITE HERE.
shame on the gutless cops for caving in to BLM...shame on Pride for signing all the demands in last years parade..it seems that Black gays are more important and entitled then non-black gays
So it's skin color and "black curly hair", like black people have? Tell me Don, were you born racist or were you recruited?
Time that PRIDE banned BLM from their parade.  Black Gays welcome to march with everyone else but Ban BLM from any inclusion in the event.  Bunch of spoiled brats
Totally agree.  He is pathetic.  He won't release his tax returns as they OBVIOUSLY contain information which will not show him in good stead, he has denigrated a war hero because he was captured, he stiffed his contractors, he desperately wants to get in bed with Putin, hasn't paid taxes in 10 years, he is a pussy grabbing misogynist, does not like blacks, latinos, muslims, people with disabilities, LGTBI and other minorities, stacked his cabinet with zealots, cronies, billionaires and people who have never had any experience running government, mercilessly criticizes and even threaten anyone who disagrees with him, he is a climate change denier, he did not win the popular vote, he lies with impunity, eg, denied Obama was a US citizen. But, he is now the president, so we will dutifully allow him to strip medical insurance from millions, build that wall, reinstate stop and frisk, reduce taxes for the elite, build infrastructure, just to name a few, but where's the money coming from.
Dude!, you mentioned Trump, "I notice some Muslims, Hispanics, and Blacks are claiming the the media, Trump, and Police are slow to call this terrorism, because the shooter is white, and likes guns and country music. " If that is not mentioning Trump, then I don't know what is.
Marilyn Mosby is not a [public prosecutor], she is a radical black activist who has shown herself just to be another hate filled progressive liberal.
JUST LET ANYONE TRY TO "TAKE BACK"  A RACIAL SLUR AGAINST BLACKS.  NO!
The fact that the Conservatives are linked to such a repulsive group of people is very disturbing. Bringing one of RM's Board members into the inner circle of the leader's advisors means a giant step backwards and a lot closer to the Reform Party where I recall one of their elected members said he would not allow a black person to work in the front of his store. Digging their graves for the next election.
I met some sexy-dressed Black hookers camping in a tent near the back entrance last year! They were funny as hell. How do you dress like that and stay in a small, flimsy tent? They pulled it off! Came to my cabin on their way back to Anchorage for a sit by the pit and a joint/beer.
tie clearly shows that trump is a bigot and being supported by other white bigots.  they want to make America white again.  America came too black with Obama.  hence, this race is bigoted whites against all nonwhites.
how's my boy gonna get his money if he don't steal. direct quote from a mother of black boy who was caught stealing.
Sounds great! How about a hearing on black supremist terrorism, and progressive supremist terrorism while you're investigating the topic. Oh wait, I forgot it's okay for everyone else to assassinate cops and burn cities. Why don't you do whats right and investigate them all? How is one better than the other?
The Jones Act was immediately lifted to help Texas and Florida. It took the nation two weeks of shaming Trump before he acted to help Puerto Rico. He spent that time making lame and nonsensical excuses for why he couldn't lift the ban. In other news: Trump continues to shore up his racist base by dropping more racial dog whistles. Now he says NFL owners are 'afraid' of their black players. Yep, the plantation is under threat by the uppitys all over again. Trump is a racist. And a traitor.
There are Jews of every race, so that won't score any points when you play Blame the Race Game. Your observation that "52% of homicides committed by black are only convictions" is a much stronger play when you embark on the fool's errand of trying to correlate melanin levels and crime.
The way some of you throw around calling people racist, Nazi sympathizer a is pathetic. You have no argument so you deflect and try to falsely label people.   Again, I'm from a multi-racial family with black, white, Mexican, Jewish, et al members. And unlike you I have actually had someone in my family murdered by the KKK.   According to your logic I am racist and anti-Semitic against myself and family. Do you see how ignorant your comment is now? Probably not because you don't deal in reality, only wishful thinking and willful ignorance of said reality.
Not a peep! Those Antifa were throwing feces and urine at people, Liberal Journalists were attacked.  That is a Bio-Terrorists attack.  Remember when Antifa blocked an ambulance that needed to be re-routed and this delay caused a death.  No word from G&M.  Or the brutal death of a white couple, in Kentucky, raped, hacked, burnt, bleached or the white man who was pulled out of his car and beat by BLM.  These Leftists are the same group who will gladly destroy private property, kill Police officers in a cowardly fashion and pepper spray girls point black.  They are the true bigots and by far the most dangerous.  Lawlessness, Godless and full of hate.  Odd that Obama didn't get this kind of treatment when Lakeisha Holloway drove over people in Las Vegas because she was "frustrated" and killed a young woman in 2015; or when Abdul Razak Ali Artan drove over people and then got out to stab some at Ohio State last November but then again Barry couldn't be bothered to attend NO after the flood
If a poll were taken of most black people and most gay people, the police would be welcomed. A tiny minority of hardcore black racists like BLM Toronto should not be running our city.
Idiot author is doing nothing but parroting the mainstream media talking points.  He was not stopped for a broken tail light, but for investigation of robbery.  The small handful of white police officers shooting black suspects is significantly outweighed by the number of white suspects shot.  Only a tiny fraction have ever been found to be unwarranted.  It's people like Parker who enable the BLM terrorists.  She's a large part of the problem, parroting a theme that isn't correct in order to push an agenda.
So a rumor without source posted in the NYT, one the nations most focused anti-Trump hate centers, is the best reporting this POS rag can do?  Ya know, some black indigent used to throw your worthless paper in my front yard. When possible, I threw it back. When not, I left it in the street for the city to clean up. Nothing much has changed.
How would that look, a black woman on the brown bill...
Cause he is black.... and a democrat.......   If he was black and a republican (shivers)...... We have some really screwed up people running this........... NOT running this country.
Women do not do anything better than men except get pregnant and give birth.  They don't raise children better or nurture better, we are not better parents.  This is more nonsense designed to justify sexism in our church.  Men don't represent Jesus Christ better, therefore there is no reason to keep women from ordination as priests, bishops, cardinals or popes period.  To insist upon highlighting every flesh difference one group has verses another in hopes of making others see that group as more different and therefore in need of restrictions is  a form of hatred.  Whites have done this to blacks and so has our church done this to blacks.   People do this to justify ethnic disparity of treatment as well.  Any discrimination done against a group of people based on flesh is an attack against that group's human dignity and all Christians must stand against the individual who purports this hatred no matter who they are and critique that person's behavior for the sake of that person's soul.
Most white Americans don't know their true history. I'm glad you got a good education. However, the folks that just elected Trump don't know or believe that history. You need to own your lesser cousins that are the majority of white folks. You have some family work to do. Just like black parents have to give their children "the talk". The talk that explains that we don't have equal protection under the law and that they could be killed for no particular action they take. They must be always aware of their behavior in the presence of cops, from the point of view of cops that may think they are about to kill them. Unfortunately, being innocent until proven guilty is a white privilege most of the time. For that matter so is the 2nd Amendment. Every time a cop gets away with killing an unarmed black person, they claim they were in fear for their life. It does not matter that they were not actually in any danger.
Niggers on knees get killed!
Your comment epitomizes a lack of decency and humanity.  To not only suggest that because Blacks kill each other, what's a few more being lynched by white racists/supremacists and then to implicitly equate/associate the lynching of innocent Black men and boys (as young as 14) with white criminals and rapists by suggesting that latter were also murdered by said white supremacists, is beyond reprehensible.   BTW its 2016, not 1980s.  According to the  Southern Poverty Law Center there are some 190 active KKK groups in the U.S. with between 5- 8,000 Klan members, a rise which came with the election of a Black man to the presidency.  Its also curious how there the constant chant about black on black murders (`90%) but never any mention of white on white murders (`83%).
Burn baby burn. SeaTac is Ground Zero for the Democratic Resistance Movement against President Trump. We want anarchy and violence because we lost the election and we cannot come to grips with reality. We are mindless fat white women that wear pink pussy hats. We will burn the whole I-5 corridor until we get free healthcare and free McDonalds. Black Lives Matter. Fat White Women's Live Matter. We are Fat and Proud. Long live Patty Murray, Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters. Gotta go...I just farted and wet my diaper.
"It requires listening to people and thinking about what they say."  Yes, it does.  I like to think I have.  Do I "think Brown deserved to die because he was imperfect?"  No.  Do I "think his life was not worthy of a protest over his death?"  No.  Do I think bad things are NOT going to happen if I start fighting with a police officer?  No.  Brown was an 18-year-old black male.  Some white males that age do dumb things.  I do not "think" this - I know this.    I'm going to assert that some 18-year-old black males also do dumb things.  At one level, I'll concede EVERYTHING'S about race.  At another level, however, it's all about people, irrespective of race, doing dumb things.  Brown did something dumb.  Your article might have placed more emphasis on stupidity, less on phenotype.
The Left hate on Left White Women in race for the Georgian Governor's Race: "One of the main mantras of the chant was #trustblackwomen" http://www.opslens.com/2017/08/14/when-the-left-eats-its-own-white-female-gov-candidate-shouted-down-in-georgia/  I expect no less from your Racist Party! lol  BLM, Barry, Jesse, Al, Fredericka and Holy women Ms. Nadal and Ms. Brazille should be Proud of themselves. The New m.o. of the Democratic Party, anti-Whites! You got duped crafted by the Democratic Racist Tools
The Congressional Liberal Black Caucus is unfit to serve.
I care about all children. I just don't see that most conservatives do. For example, they don't seem to care about the children in Flint. They were poisoned by Republicans to save a buck. There were no Democrats involved in that decision. Those kids still don't have access to clean water. For every conservative that claims to care about children, there are just as many, if not more, that think killing 12 year old Tamir Rice was justified because he was black and playing with an air rifle in a public play ground. BTW, Ohio, where he was killed, is an open carry state. I guess the 2nd Amendment is just a white privilege for conservatives.
In too much of the US, if you still have one drop of "black" blood, you are Black...it is pretty obvious that few saw President Obama as biracial.
You conveniently don't mention your cohorts who call for extermination of Jews and Blacks. With guys like IQ006, IQ22, and the rest in your corner, well, I wouldn't call you  loathsome or deplorable like them but I think " imbecile" has some merit for your selectivity.
Are you kidding me ?  The only blood on anyone's hands so far is the shooter himself. The latest tool used by thew crazy and terrorists is cars and trucks . Do you plan to call for a end of their use as well so crowds don;t get run into ?  How well are the strictest gun laws working in Chicago ?  Blacks are slaughtering blacks by the thousands there with no end in sight.   Do you think criminals will start obeying even stricter gun laws once you take away our rights and end the NRA ?   The only thing that's not ok are liberal knee jerk reactions with proposals that will not save lives.   If like magic all the guns were taken away---people would use knives .  Do you want to ban them next ?
Anti-abortionists--I refuse to refer to them as 'right-to-lifers' because they're anything but that--are overly selective about which children merit that right.  Seven year-old black kids playing with toy water pistols don't.  And these white 'conservative' so-called Christians leap to defend any cop who shoots a black child, regardless of the circumstances.  And of course Iraqi, Afghani, Pakistani, Sudanese, Lebanese, Palestinian and Libyan children are excluded from that right on two counts--they're the wrong color AND the wrong religion.  I think the next time these clowns show up to protest at the Planned Parenthood clinic, I'll show up with my own photos of murdered children: like a particularly horrible one of a Palestinian toddler with the top of his head taken off by an IDF rifle-bullet.  Or another of the remains of a little girl in Fallujah who died screaming as she dissolved in a toxic, super-heated cloud of white phosphorus.  Where was their right-to-life, O "Christians?"
Exactly right. Illegal immigrants, which most of these foreigners are, are a total burden on the South African society, most of all the poor black people.
NO country with black leadership, has ever prospered"  President Obama, a black man, brought us back from the Great Recession. And that's with white conservatives attempting to obstruct him at every turn.  You alt-right guys have no sense of actual history.
The only attack on the demonstrators was the shooting of one by black wannabe gangsters. Is that Trump's fault?
my goodness when that crazy white boy went in and shot the blacks in Charleston there was a 100 comments by now.
1. Reality: robbed by knife to my throat at State Fair: 10 Black Boys.  2. robbed by 1 black with gun to my head at a grocery store 3. 1 Black swinging a car jack at my head trying too collect a debt owed: friend with me got 60 stitches in his head.  He missed me.  4.  Home robbed on Christmas Eve by group of blacks.  5. Threatened by 12 blacks with 2 x 4's and baseball bats surrounding me and my two little chidren while picking apricots in a field and threatening death to us.  Blacks robbed me numerous other times.  Is this the bigotry you are talking about ?  There is NO BIGOTRY.  It is all  in your imagination.
You can't use race in this cuz that's not what it's about. They were wearing ski masks. And it's almost hypocritical to say black lives matter when the suspects and victim were both black
Not True...but let's roll with your statement and modify it to reflect our past President: "President" Obama is an apologist of "Black Lives Matter" and violent racism toward Whites and also LE; as well as an apologist of Muslim Terrorists. He is un-American and an intensely disgusting person. He shames all Americans and soils American democratic institutions. His presence in government denigrates the nation." Yes...Sooo True.
I am really enjoying the new Martin Luther King Jr stamp - just think about all those white bigots, licking the backside of a black man.  ~ Dick Gregory
What do you know about the Native culture or beliefs? You seem to have a real problem with Alaskan Natives. Well farmer, the Alaskan Natives were here FIRST! So if you don't like it then you can be the one to leave. The Alaskan Natives btw played a key role in after Pearl Harbor got bombed. They were the ones to help the soldiers survive the freezing weather when they were under equipped and did not have the necessary clothing or food to survive. Pick up a history book and get educated about this culture and "teaching their young to disrespect civil laws". They are just as much a Patriot as anyone else. BTW when have you ever heard of Natives rioting in the streets and behaving like so many in BLM movement? You going to say that black people are living in a Sovereign Nation? Sounds like you are quite a hateful racist.
"That may have an atom of weight if you could point to anything in this whole affair that suggests racism by Trump."  I am so very glad you asked.  Kaepernik says he is protesting the killing of unarmed black men by white police officers.  Trump says Kaepernik has no right to do that.  This is all about race and freedom of speech.  Trump is wrong on both counts.  He is just throwing red meat to his racist base.
They're bars. We're not talking blocking the doors of universities to prevent blacks from getting in. Or preventing women from getting a law degree. They can have ladies' nights, men's nights, men with ladies nights, hardhat nights, whatever. I've heard some people complain that the other six nights are already men's nights. Well, waaah. I think men tend to go to bars more than women, so if it's true, there may be a reason for that. It reminds me of when someone filed a discrimination complaint against Hooters because Hooters didn't hire as many male servers as female servers. Um, that's kind of the point of Hooters. Besides, most men in low-cut t-shirts look silly.
Those on the right also seem to struggle with nuance, everything is black and white to them.  If I say that one group of Trump supporters are racists, they hear it as my saying ALL Trump supporters are racist.
The irony of BFLF aligning themselves with an apparent or alleged Hitler and Nazi  supporting individual or grouping is breathtaking, although I guess they are both fascists.  Does Andile Mngxitana and his motley melanin endowed crew not realise that Nazis view black people as "Untermenschen" - sub-human vermin worthy of extermination?
It's pretty obvious, Hancock and Chief White collude in withholding black crimes to the media and social media to avoid racial stereotyping (part of their "Change the Culture " initiative). If you follow DPD on twitter, they never follow-up on crimes committed in predominantly black neighborhoods. It's sort of swept under the rug.
I wrote the July 28 letter.  LIke most of the letters I submit to the Mailbag, I was pointing out one of society's double standards.  The "sin" of graffiti is that the "artist" imposes their aesthetic standard on the rest of us, whether we like it or not.  As were you.  As also is public art, architecture, etc.  Your own and the last two examples are products of society's "overclass", while those that sheriff's work crews disconsolately scrub out are produced by society's "underclass".  That society treats the two differently is what Randy Newman described in his song 'Rednecks' with the phrase "...keeping the niggers down...", no matter what color those niggers might be.
Except that's not what he said, now, is it? He said blacks commit more murders. Blatant lie.
That would make her a Black bigot, by definition.
I don;t believe it's been established that whites break laws against crack at the same rate as blacks.  In fact, I thought the left's argument was that the crack laws are racist precisely because blacks violate crack laws more often, while powder is the white boys' crime.
“White supremacists, white nationalists, they’re not a part of anybody’s base,” Gardner said. “They are not a part of this country. They’re a part of hatred, they’re a part of bigotry, they’re a part of evil.”  Wish people felt the same way about the black panthers, BLM (black lies murder) and the anti-fascist and were demanding Democrats congressional members and Obama to speak out and condemn those groups. I detest the white supremacists and white nationalist and all they stand for. I also detest the selective outrage from Democrat supporters who stand by and say nothing or very little a best regarding the illegal and violent actions of the BLM and anti-fascist groups. My guess is the attacks by the anti-fascist group that actually started the chaos in Va were totally supported by most Democrats.
So I'm clear, there are 2 groups - 1) kneel/not visit white house = not racist 2) stand/visit white house = racist???? What's its like to live in a black and white world, forgot the irony that you work at a newspaper....oh, and for the record, Trump is a complete idiot and a terrible POTUS but I think there are better ways to combat racism than simply kneeling - that's a Holkywood answer if I've ever seen one...
Blacks could have just gone to a different lunch counter in the 50s too!   Follow the business license you agreed to.  Can a waiter refuse to serve a fat person because gluttony is a "sin". where would it end?
Sure, on paper it looks one way.  But once you understand institutionalized racism, which includes republican gerrymandering to suppress the minority vote, slanted laws that unfairly prosecute minorities as compared to whites who commit the same crime (crack epidemic treated with incarceration vs. white heroin epidemic being treated as a health issue, affluenza case, Stanford rape case, MJ offenses creating minority felons exponentially more than white), etc.  As a white person who has done very stupid things as I was younger and always got away with it, I easily recognize when my son (who is a person of color, never done anything against the law in his entire life and is graduating from a University in December) is followed around in stores by people who are just positive that he's going to steal something.  The way we're racist, is very devious and sure - it won't show up on any traditional chart.
"whites commit more murders than blacks."  That is not correct.  FBI table 3 (Murder Offenders by Age, Sex, Race, and Ethnicity, 2015) clearly shows...  White: 4636  Black: 5620  Other: 283  Unknown: 4787  I'm sorry you're having such a hard time understanding all this.
Hope Roof gets repeatedly and brutally beat up in prison by some black men. That will be karma.
What a pile of horse doo doo. Check the stats. The majority of shootings are conducted by black youth against black youth and it's not because they don't have the opportunities to improve their lot in life, it's because they want to emulate what they see on t.v..  Big chains on their necks, pants hanging below their anal opening and walking around with a big swagger.
Of course he wasn't legitimate because he was black. Isn't that your point. You racist fucking asshole?
But they were fine with Obama refusing to condemn BLM after a black nationalist activist shot and killed 5 police officers at a Black Lives Matter anti-police rally in Dallas.  Hypocrites.
Let's talk about the experiences cops have with member of the black communities  and not just the other way around. Let's talk about the abuses cops must endure.  If criminal behavior in the Black communities of Canada and The US were in proportion to it's portion of the population, 3% and 8% respectively, the number of police shootings would follow suit.  95% of all shooting deaths in black communities are by other black males.  But you won't change your own behavior so you blame police.
The discussion appeared to be about how he is perceived, not how he sees himself.  African-Americans perceived him as one of their own, and voted accordingly.  When they were faced with the same programs from an older white woman, they bailed.  There was a letter from prominent religious leaders in the African-American religious community pointing out to her that much of the program of her party was diametrically opposed to the core religious beliefs of their churches.  She did not even bother to acknowledge it.  The inability of the losing side to face squarely the reasons for their loss, not just at the national level but across the country, and insistence as this article demonstrates on attributing it to the stupidity and dark desires of "deplorables" seems to indicate that its run has ended unless the Republicans - as has been their custom - completely blow it.
The illegal counter protestors dressed in black and wearing helmets and carrying sticks?  We all know the KKK (Democrats) and neo-NAZI radicals are just A-holes and idiots.
Richard Rhyner, look at their black faces! If we want crime to stop, we must end this multiculturalism in Alaska!
This week, our Pope, in a homily stated that gay men are not fit to be priests basically because they are feminine, he made jokes about how an old cleric was making fun of a new priest because he was examining his look in his fancy clerical garb just like a woman would.    Gender segregation is a split by gender.  Most men are married in our church, so they too have no authority.  Optional celibacy will open a flood gate to married men-which is why this priest, in the article, described that thousands of married men will jump right in, the moment the pope gives the ok -thousands in Brazil alone.  So all those women who have been leading parishes as lay ministers are gone & replaced, even if they are made deacons they have no authority.  Celibacy causes no one harm so it is not wrong & no one has to be a priest.  I have no problem with optional celibacy if we are ordaining married women too but it should not be at the cost of women.  Black men have a voice in our church.  Women do not.
i denounce white supremacists AND black lives matter AND La RAZA.  what else did i leave out?
(Cont'd) The other abandonment of principle relates to the nostalgic "make America great again - like when the "in's" were all white and "out's" were either all blacks or some "white trash".
"...destroy the black family." "...creating an entire generation that it (sic) is okay to live off the work of others." Okay, show me where I've made either one of these statements. Obviously I'm not out to destroy the black family or any other family. Nor would I advocate for any generation to live off the work of others. jgd, could you kindly explain why you think I would be in favor of either one of these outcomes?
It is interesting how the DP is harping on this story, but they quickly buried the story last month about the African-American man in Fresno who shot and killed three people because they were white.
The first thing The Mad King does when he wakes up every day is ask himself "What spiteful thing can I do, preferably something harmful to the environment, or something that obstructs science or disadvantages ordinary people for the benefit of the rich? What beautiful thing can I make more ugly? How can I get back at those millions of Americans who dared to like a black president so much more than they like me?"
Who mentioned percentages? He said blacks commit more murders. A blatant lie.
The black regiments built the Tok Cutoff, not the Richardson Highway. You not only don't know what you're talking about, but you don't know where you've been.
"white racist nation" LOLOLOL.  History shows that Barack Hussein Obama was elected POTUS because of black privilege.  He's been the Supreme Poobah (black supremacy) for eight years.  His grandmother was a "typical white person" who clung to her guns and her god.  Now what were you saying about thin skin?
Non sequitur aside, is that what your protestant public school teacher taught you about the EC? What else would you like purged from the Constitution. More importantly, what is more "racist" than white leftists keeping so many inner city blacks trapped in crappy schools and indefinitely dependent upon the welfare state?
Eminem must think that blacks and leftist whites are a majority of his audience, LOL. Detroit will "take care of you" Marshall. Bye bye now.. don't say we didn't warn you.. keep sippin on your cyanide home brew..
The rich who really run this country don't care all that much if US citizens are armed or not. Because the pro-gun crowd---so vehement about using their assault rifles to fight "tyranny"---are so distracted they haven't noticed that America...economy, government, media and religion---have already been purchased. You are now owned but don't even know it. The rich know well that, if major shooting starts, it will be upon mosques, Muslim neighborhoods, Black neighborhoods, Mexican neighborhoods. Until their incessant wars and fossil fuel emissions do us all in, the rich are safe for now...and they know it. The anti-gun thing...like abortion, gay rights, etc. is nothing more than a distraction intended for simple-minded folks---well-armed but not with awareness.
Go into any late night Chinese restaurant at 3 AM and watch how the black patrons treat the Asian staff.  Then try to tell me with a straight face black folks can't be racist.
He was shot by a black officer. That's gotta make BLM squirm.
Ya'll ? I haven't killed a black man, what responsibility do I need to take?  If were placing blame on wide groups of people, does the black community not hold responsible for all the deaths within its own ?  How is the proclivity to pin the blame on every cop for unarmed deaths but not on the black community for black on black violent crime?
Mr. Barclay...."I felt sick about it" you say.  Have you felt sick or even lost sleep for the hundreds of thousands dead and millions dispossessed in the Middle East because of the behaviour of your country.   " Such reckless government decisions can give license "....you say.  Indeed . Like the police officers being killed by blacks in your country inflamed by your president's racial anti cop rhetoric?   I'd be happy if you turned in your Canadian passport sir.
If she was worried about violence she would be volunteering some time and money with her fancy pants movie star friends to stop the black on black killing in Chicago.  She is a hypocrite, pure and simple.
When our pathetic racist president Obama said police acted stupidly in the D.C. case he declared open season on police across America. He is to blame for the racial divide in America today.  And in other news , blacks continued to slaughter other blacks last weekend in Chicago. Where is the protest over that ?  Black lives clearly don't matter if blacks are the ones doing the killing.
A courageous man, in and out of the ring. When few would speak out, he risked his life's work to correctly point out the misguidedness of the Vietnam War. Certainly, he joined a Muslim religion, but this must be looked at in context of the black struggle of its day. I'm amazed at the conservatives who hate him for his belonging to a group seeking rights for its minority members, and doing so in a forceful way, yet these same white folks have no problem in strongly supporting idiots like the Malheur vigilantes whose only goal is to personally profit from land that belongs to all of us.
He's in Georgia and he's black. No surprise.
You make it sound like we just liberated Black Americans from being killed in churches or lynched for family entertainment (really?) this morning. Lest people forget, we have elected a black president (to 2 terms), we have black leaders in every facet of business, politics, law, education, etc., etc. It seems to me that the closer we get to the end of President Obama's final year the more the racist ranting ramps up. Shut up and start dealing with people based on their ideals, work ethic, family values and actions...not on the color of their skin.
Perhaps I'm coming across wrong.  Most blacks are good law abiding people . When I talk about thugs I'm talking about those roving groups that en mass are breaking into stores and burning things people spent a lifetime to build , using the current event as their excuse for doing it . When I say average American's I'm talking about all those who obey the laws and don't harm anyone else--regardless of their color. In Furgunson Obama sent in the feds when it was clear from the beginning the thug , who just a half hour before was shown on video robbing a store , attacked the policeman. Even though the policeman was cleared he will be in hiding for the rest of his life from blacks seeking to hurt him.  The author of this story claims the problems today are exactly like 50 years ago--claiming nothing has changed. That's an outright lie.  Obama has bad mouthed police so badly blacks feel empowered to disrespect them when ever the opportunity presents itself. Police are hero's , not assassins.
"No, America needs resentment management."  Very useful point.  Clearly, the resentment that has been building up among some whites over the last eight years has been very hard on the body politic.  Soon, the black president will be gone and the whites who voted for Trump have elected a man who will Make America White Again. As soon as Trump has Made America White Again, the whites who voted for him will no longer be eaten up by resentment.
Spoken like a Black Racist! Well done. Let your hatred continue!
NUKE the Rothschild-Bauer FORCED occupation of Israel. Talmudic infant killing blood drinking Jews created the Democrat, Socialist, Communist, and Liberal all to destabilise nations. Now we have Jew funded factions like Antifa'g popping up all over America. The Jews primary enemy has become the Moslem! Jews demoralised America over the last 100 years with Satanic Qabalist Hollywood. They RAPE our children. Their music "industry" screams modern slavery. Besides this TRUTH.... Why fight JEW Battles? Whites and Blacks usually get along... The Crypto-Jews ran the transatlantic slave trade. So why are White non-slave owner Americans in 2017 under attack? One answer.... Devious Evil JEWS.  Don't be fooled.... I am a Jewish anti-semite. I like being an anti-semite. When you study Jewish history for 47 years like I have you KNOW damn well who the enemy of humanity is. I am Judeo-Christian. I am on the right side. All blessings be to Jesus Christ and G🕍d!! #AmericaFirst #SimonOfTrentsRevenge
Probably got bumped to let Obama in. I was on the UCLA campus recently. Asians everywhere. But, it is not that they are bumping Asians in favor of whites.  They are bumping Asians and Whites in favor of Blacks and Hispanics.
I am willing to condemn the murderers; not apologize for their crimes just because they are black.  I believe in personal responsibility; not mass white guilt or mass black guilt.
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI! - Hypocrisy is a greater crime than racism.
And when was America great the first time? Was it during the Vietnam War 1960's, or the racist and sexist 1950's? America wasn't great for blacks or women or the poor.  The Soviet Union was great, really great. Then the oligarchs grabbed the reins of power from the faltering empire, and now Russia is gaining power again, on the backs of its poor and powerless.  It is obvious that Trump and his Wall Street 1%er buddies are going to carve up this country, starting with destroying health care for the poor. Then after two Clarence Thomas type Supreme Court nominations, Roe v. Wade may disappear.  Goodness knows black voter suppression will be in play, as it was in the 1950's. I mourn the deaths of American troops who will die in the next needless war, all to make the war machine rich and the Republicans stay in power.   It is as was in "Harry Potter'..."The Ministry (of magic) has fallen, the minister of magic is dead". We are in those times. Think Cheney.  Hugh Massengill, Eugene
When black folks profile white folks as criminal suspects for just being alive, get back to me. Until then you are just another white man happy to be white. I admit your most most valuable asset is your skin.
An overlooked tragedy is the fact that young black men in thier early teens are continually coorced to join these gangs and become criminals. That baby faced teenager was told to get in the car, now he's going to prison forever.
I'm Stella's age.  I remember being able to afford a health insurance policy and a country that led the world in scientific discovery.  During the last three decades, private health insurance became outrageously unaffordable, a big chunk of our population lost it's critical thinking skills and now it's an actual "thing" to not believe in science.  I blame the Republican Party.  They cozied up to the crazy evangelicals, and the idiocy became contagious.  I left the Republicans about 25 years ago, and have watched in dismay as they have sunk deeper and deeper into the abyss.  Hatred and division under Obama?  Yes, sadly it turns out that the racism never completely went away, and a lot of white people just could not handle having a black man as their president.  And the people who voted for Trump feeling a bit forgotten?  I wonder how forgotten they'll feel after he continues the Republican assault against the middle class in favor of the ridiculously wealthy.
well put:  The bipartisan consensus on social policy that prevailed for three-quarters of a century has been eviscerated.  This is not about what is best for the American people, this is about revenge against the Democrats and what a Black man did in the White House
Voter ID's laws aren't racist, and neither is getting rid of this asinine law.  Actually- Blacks Say Whites Who Think "Voter ID Laws Are Racist" Are Ignorant Racists: . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llDM-44Zb8w . BLM is the SAME thing as Antifa and the KKK- they preach and practice violence, oppression, and race-based hatred-- from the Washington Post: . https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/yes-antifa-is-the-moral-equivalent-of-neo-nazis/2017/08/30/9a13b2f6-8d00-11e7-91d5-ab4e4bb76a3a_story.html?utm_term=.8bcc5949c3eb . Your hate and intersectionality is evil, and your racism is bringing this country down.
I think I heard one of the white guys yelling (between his rants about the Jews and Blacks) , " leave history alone, in fact we want that history where we could lynch the Blacks back". He was so nice about it - he said "please, let us have that history back".
Yes, these white people, for instance Alaska serial killers Israel Keyes, Robert Hansen, Joshua Wade, all reveal they are inhumane, arrogant and indifferent to the suffering of women, young people, Alaska Natives, blacks, etc.   What do you think should be done about them?
Well, that's just plain stupid. The Black Panthers weren't going around lynching people, stopping whites from voting, or anything even close to what the Klan did. Do a little research on the subject, then come back and pontificate if you still feel like it.
Oh come on and get off the black, white, blue lives matter merry-go-round.  Every human life matters.  Period.  We don't need bigotry and racism poking its ugly head up every time a police officer or an ethnic or white citizen is shot and killed.  Stop fueling the race game.  If you don't have anything constructive toward the healing of our nation, then keep your cotton picking mouth shut.  Go away.  We don't need to hear from you.
South Africa is one of the most violent and corrupt countries in the world. Its current leader is looking more and more like Mugabe in neighbouring Zimbabwe.  In Zimbabwe Black gangs terrorize, rape, and murder white farmers. This is the example that the Liberals use?
You literally just said that because he is black. There is nothing in the photo that is gang affiliated. You are a racist, plain and simple.
Have the black kids been murdering anyone who is not their religion for eons?   Muslims have been murdering Christians, quite a different scenario.
Because rap has done so much good for the Black community.  Drugs, illicit sex, strippers, rape, and Michelle's fave, anti-white racism!
I'm sure they're well aware of the statistics.  Kaepernick and many other black athletes have donated money and time to community programs.  However, blacks that kill other blacks tend to go to jail.  Rogue cops, not so much.  That is what they're protesting....plus Trump's buffoonery of the past week.
The KKK and Nazis hate Jews. Trump is surrounded by Jews. His daughter is a convert and his son in law is Orthodox Jewish. Trump's grandchildren are Jewish. Before you go there, Trump also has a black friend named Dr. Ben Carson.
Kaepernick said, "he can't stand for a flag or an Anthem when some are lying in the streets." This whole protest has been about the flag and Anthem, and those kneeling wouldn't admit it, because of  any reaction. Trump forced the issue. And those who were offended by Trump's words, are you also also offended by the words many of these black players listen to daily. Words like women are b i iches, kill cops, f this and f that and f f f f f. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that more blacks idolize these rap entertainers and they have a bigger influence then Donald Trump will ever have, regardless of any words.
Hey Lil Dicky how stupid are you it's because black people are sent to jail 10 times more than white people it's called white privilege you racist piece of shit
Will the black race now be the leaders of our country?  Will those who have the knowledge and comportment to do the job, stand up.   NO country with black leadership, has ever prospered, and yet, that's what they left sees as 'just' for America.  Not equal, but above, what absolute nonsense.
Strange? Not every vote is democratic. Let's say the referendum is a vote to restrict the rights of the black population. Or the French speaking. Or
Then there's kool-aid drinking "journalists" like David Pellegrin who write stories with titles like, "Five Officers Shot and Killed; Seven Wounded Amidst Peaceful Black Lives Matter Protest in Dallas".  Peaceful? Are you kidding me? Are you stupid?
Totally wrong! Freddie Gray. Michael Brown. And hypocritically enough, nobody from the BLM "movement" is parading and "protesting" black on black crime. There were no BLM protesting against Freddie Gray any of the 19 times he sold drugs to other black folks. The only time you people get your dander up is when you feel the need to persecute cops and law abiding gun owners.
Progressives aren't going to fire progressives. Moreover tenure prevents it. What I would like to see is nationally televised Congressional hearings on the state of American education. Think of a hack like UC Chancellor Janet Napolitano being asked to explain why she accommodated black students' demands for segregated college dorms, or a public school supervisor being asked explain why kindergarten classes should have the transgender agenda--in all its scientifically unproven glory--rammed down their throats.
I don't get it.  I'm sure other races do it, but it baffles me that whites want to blame other races for some intangible issue.  Blame the blacks, blame the Chinese, blame the Mexicans. Uh, what are they really taking from us whites personally?  Nothing substantial I can put a finger on.  Certainly nothing from me personally that makes a hoot of difference in my life.  I've got it good.  I could have it better, but the only one to blame for that is me.
Yes! I, a deplorable, basement-dwelling, bucket of idiot, b@st@rdized Catholic, needy Latino, everyday American Black super predator, Muslim ne’er-do-well sand Negro, shall vote for Clinton. She shall unite us all — just like she promised at the convention! I know that the Russians are trying to rig our elections by telling everyone how we tried to rig our elections. It does not matter that Bill turned the White House into a brothel, lied to Congress, and was disbarred for perjury, then had to make a nearly $1,000,000 settlement. Bill is not running for president; his enabler is. There is no story here!
Yea but we are all done with the black monkey!   !!!!
Really, your post is a good example of the ignorance you complain about.  Pride Toronto was formed in the crucible of the bathhouse raids in the early 1980s; those raids were precipitated by the abduction and murder of a young Portuguese boy.   Stonewall, and other uniquely American experiences/individuals aren't relevant here and your allegations of whitewashing are patently false.  Speaking as the son of non-WASP immigrants and the spouse of someone of First Nations heritage, Canada, and Toronto in particular, is a place of immense opportunity for people willing to work hard and engage with the broader community, irrespective of their cultural/language/racial background and examples of success abound.    Lincoln Alexander, Chief Saunders and Drake to name but a few from the black community.  As for being in 'orbit' with black/brown/FN/ethnic people -- the rest of us call them friends, colleagues, teammates, managers, reports, lovers and more.  Your stereotypes are shameful.
I've been told by brown people, asian people, black people, white people and indigenous people to shut the ef up. I never took it as racist. This broad should do the same.
what`s horrible about it?  participants set their own goals, and there are no penalties.  oh, wait, i think i know what you don`t like about it:  obama is black.    amirite?
Nancy Pelosi is right. She is the top Democrat fundraiser so black, liberal and transgender Democrats should best shut up and stop complaining. It's her party and she is the boss.
"Responsible dissent" to some like Ms Tesa Ann means "being like the Tea Party, not like BLM, OWS, or other 'socialist' groups." Funny how the same people who think that the Tea Partiers (who didn't start protesting till after the black guy got elected) were patriots, but the current crop of anti-Trump protesters are un-American, isn't it?  As for Trump and abortion... well, he was pro-choice until he saw that his political fortunes lay with the other side. If I were a betting woman, I'll bet that very few of his campaign promises will be fulfilled. He's already backing off on gutting the ACA, building "the wall," getting out of NATO, jailing Clinton, ending SSM, etc. Tis what happens when you believe a con man.
I didn't know Jesse Jackson or Rev sharpton were racist  I just thought the just cared for black perpetrators  Loser Don't cry 😭 just bullying  You
"Some people debated whether Corn Pops have a gender."  Cereal has no damn gender. Jesus F'n Christ.  Somehow I bet he doesn't have a problem working on a character called "Black Bolt" who is actually a white character. Just as stupid.
The shooter was a black cop and the felon was armed on PCP and not responding to police commands, pointing the gun at police.  Now watch how they lambast me for point out the facts.  Fantastically brainwashed useful idiots.
SAYS THE OLD WHITE LADY HER SELF outsider77 have to make it about so called oppressed niggers. and old people waiting to die? come the fuck on your're a moron
Was his mother there? Gots $1M? Probably wouldn't pay it knowing the truth about his offense. Hard if you're born black. Hard! Hard! Hard!
Then maybe those Nazis should stop holding up swastikas. They should stop believing that being born white means superiority.  No, they are not the same creature. Colleges also have the freedom to keep people off their campuses. It goes both ways you know. The alt-right use PC has a shield to be as nasty as they want to be. Calling people ragheads for example, isn't against PC but just plain mean, rude and stupid. It shows a level of intelligence that wouldn't rise to double digits in the IQ department. You really need to be in the here and now. If you think the KKK and neo-Nazis are liberals you've really got a comprehension problem. Again pointing out hate, doesn't mean you're a hater. Pointing out racism doesn't mean you're a racist. It is the actions of haters and racists that make them so. They blame Obama but all he did was get elected while being black. No logic involved. Just ignorance. I'm waiting for these mensa members to explain what Obama has done that is so bad. Still.
Worse than now?   You tell me.    I look at it as if Al Gore and Dan Quyale (misspelled on purpose) can do it, my pet duck can.    If kid rock beats the democrat and republican from the mainstream, then that is OK with me.   He seems to be on the right side of a lot of things , has 25 or more years of high money business and corporate experience, and is creative.   So what is wrong with that.   Look at  Obama,  No business experience, no real schooling other than a basic law degree, no real job, and terribly non creative.  In fact he is pretty stupid.   But he ran on race and didn't have a bad black jessie jackson accent, so he wins.  Much to our detriment.   And I am over 70 and a retired rocket scientist and attorney.  Maybe that is why I support Trump and more importantly, his ideas.   The more educated one is the more they can understand Trump.  Most politicians communicate with the lame.
Jinx, you're a classic scumbag, dirty cop. Whether someone is a "felon" or not is irrelevant. What other derogatory labels can you affix to folks? How about Nigger? I'd also like to point out that you have no way of knowing who anyone on the internet is, as it's anonymous.
Basketball Black team beats another basketball Black team. Where's the equality in the NBA?  Look at the picture. Not a White guy in sight.  11 out of 13 players on every NBA team are Black. This is a sure sign of discrimination and racism!  The only cure is a type of affirmative action where the owners must only hire White guys until there are at least 7 on each team. (penalized them by one because they must pay for these most egregious past transgressions). Oh, and in keeping with the whole equality thing lately, Lebron must give me half of his money.  You know, so we are EQUAL. We can flip a coin for the Lamborghini.
I am so sick of the rhetoric that all white are rich and all blacks are poor, because it is a lie!  Of course there are wealthy whites, built on many generations of hard work and, yes, abuse of influence, bribery, murder and all things that we find repulsive.  But to generalise is to have an agenda that is clearly aimed at covering up the reality of black monopoly capital.  Just one look at our political leaders will show you how to amass wealth in less than one generation without a single contribution to the economy. You also talk glibly about the SOE's.  Every one is a basket case, run by inept, unqualified cadres.  Your comment about SAA deserves special scorn.  Without taxpayers money, this company would no longer exist.  How many times has it been bailed out by Treasury.  Just look at SABS, SABC, SANRAL, SFF and all the others that your government has ruined. By the way, what do your finances look like??  Bet that you have plenty tucked away for a rainy day.
Once again it is political correct to say WHITE people are out of touch with BLACK people, but if I say I am a RED skin Chickasaw who disagrees, I am shouted down as a racist by political correct morons.
Step one: Demoralization Step two: Destabilization Step three: Crisis (Civil War/Invasion)  Destabilization = Don't trust the cops (authority). Blacks think conservative Whites are all racists. Feminist think all men are oppressors and predators. Gay/Transvestites want to break what is considered a model family unit. Stifle speech by calling it hate speech. Re-write history, etc.  So if you are part of the BLM or ANTIFA, of Femi-nazi's, or any of the other groups, you are just a tool being used to tear this country down so it can be restructured in a more controlled manner (Communism).     If you think that's what you want, understand the final step: Normalization = Kill all the tools that think they will control any part of the country or cause any type of protest. So the new government will not tolerate BLM, ANTIFA, Feminist, or Gays.
So, the NFL players are telling us that they have no problems with crimes committed by black people.   What they want is to reduce their punishments.  No doubt that crime victims feel differently.
BLM encouraged hate. They wanted blacks to attack whites at their gatherings . Why are they not charged with hate crimes? If a white person so much as insults a dark person they lose their job and are publically vilified. The police and Trudeau's government to not speak at all. They are all enablers and suck ups to dark hate groups . There will be pay back.
The baker wants to be legally allowed to discriminate.  If he is successful people will be able to not serve say black people and say it is because of religious views. That could be easily done by quoting bible verses.  How is the baker injured by making a cake for a gay wedding? He is offended?  The baker could stop making wedding cakes or move to a state where discrimination against gays is allowed. He should not agree in writing to obey laws when he knows he will not do that. That is hypocritical.
Jackie:  Your post here is based on INCORRECT information.  "These are black kids who's "crime" was they touched a white chick" is NOT true.  the young woman involved was AfricanAmerican.  If you read the Police Report you will see that the "race" box for the victim is marked AfricanAmerican (Black).  Spinning this incident to be a racial incident is really a shame.  I, for one, would appreciate it if you would either delete your post references to this as a "black on white" incident or make some correction.  If you doubt my information, do a little research and see it for yourself.  Thanks,  Gary Crum
Dumb Trump openly favoured Le Pen during the election which won't make his dealings with France any easier if Macron wins.  Trump's an amateur, and worse, incompetent and foolish. To much of the world, Trump's a black joke. Or maybe an orangutan-orange joke. Ha ha ha.
This editorial is fine with me. I don't agree with Antifa's methods although I support most of the same causes.  I say the ends don't justify the means. But apposing Antifa's methods doesn't make be swallow the false equivalency of "on both sides" because I saw the video of the nazis marching and chanting with clubs and torches, the terrorism that killed a woman and injured 19 others, and the savage beating of the black guy in the parking lot. There were no good people marching and chanting as nazis. Trump's stand on Charlottesville encouraged nazi groups and KKK. And "on both sides" is code for white supremacy and racism. It's a damn shame that antifa, a small fringe group, feeds the whole false equivalency baloney. This fringe group on the left is wrong; but doesn't counterbalance the bulk of racism and white supremacy and KKK, and Trump's in-code approval of them.
I agree...."to the extent that bishops ...used pro-life and anti gay rhetoric...."  My point with Cordileone and the conservative hierarchy and the Southern Poverty Law Center is that the Church had bonded with extremist groups that condemn "whole" segments of society as worthy of hate...and hostile efforts. Specifically...the Church has linked itself to anti gay groups relative to marriage...and now, apparently... anti Semitic groups....  The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) defines hate groups as those who deny whole classes of citizens their fundamental rights based as a "whole class" that is...ALL gays, ALL JEWS, ALL BLACKS etc are to be hated and hurt....  AND some bishops AND Trump have recertified this concept each in their own appalling way...  My Dad risked his life in the Second World War  to protect ALL these folks.....  It would appear that his Church and his political party don't honor his ....And his comrades efforts...
"This does not mean, however, that Canada is immune from the waves of white supremacy, venomous nationalism and xenophobia sweeping the West".   hmmm...I await Ms Kendzior's denunciation of BLM Toronto co-founder Yusra Khogali's assertion then at a recent protest that we have already succumbed  "Don't cheer," Khogali said. "We know what that is, we know what that manipulation is, it is what this country is founded on—erasure and silencing of the real history of this land. The genocide of Indigenous people, in which the state is founded on. The enslavement and genocide of black people, in which the state is founded on."  Khogali continued, "When Justin Trudeau says that he is a liar, he is a hypocrite, he is a white supremacist terrorist."  Now I know Justin Trudeau is not a white supremacist terrorist...but then I also know that Sarah's weekly excessive hyperbole detracts from her message
criminals are the problem. anybody who thinks there is not a good reason that there are more blacks per capita in prison is in denial. they commit more crimes than others. fact.
Since I'm black, I have no arguments with my family about Trump. I hope the white folks that elected Trump enjoy watching the  cops kill unarmed minorities on the evening news. That is about all they will get from Trump. Of course they already have that. Maybe Russia will care about them, but I doubt it. Putin is not known for caring about the poorly educated.
"HTG, with so many more important matters at hand, do we now have to pay attention to whether we wear 'racially appropriate' jewelry?" I guess many white folks can't handle diversity, even when it does not effect them directly, like how black women wear their hair and jewelry.
Some ISIS recruits aren't necessarily all Middle Eastern looking. To further educate your puny little brain, there happen to be even black and Caucasian ISIS recruits.   ISIS does not discriminate against age, gender, skin color or race but are allowed to discriminate against religion. LOL
So now all they have to do while holding a gun to your head is ask for your keys, your phone and your gun. So if you get off a shot and they return fire and you end up in the hospital with an organ shot up or brain damage and problems for life or worse dead and you knew you were within your rights does that help. Or maybe you should start shooting at every couple of black guys that come toward you and find out they're from the church after you killed one and you go to jail for years does that help. But if they are caught and eliminated that might help but the do gooders will cry foul and the Civil Liberty pukes will cry foul and the laws will soon require that other race couples are being discriminated and should be holding women up as well and the liberal legislators will have to write new laws and so on. Dumb isn't it?
Color or race has nothing to do with it . In comments to others you seem to be the one pushing the race card.   The court must feel this person isn't a flight risk to make bail five grand.  I base my comments on the story that's reported.  No person----white , black , any race , any gender should be out walking at night in the roadway.  Anyone who does this is rolling the dice with their own life.  Very little good happens out on the streets from 11 pm until about 6 am .  People who love their families are wise to tell them not to be out on the streets between those hours.  Of course they have the right to be there , but those who want to live longer should avoid it .  Sadly , one has the right to ride a bike on slick winter streets . Only fools with no common sense or a death wish do it.  Everyone needs to protect themselves and avoid all the risk they reasonably can .
There were several trials.  A couple to a black Judge.  Acquittals.  The (Black)Obama Attorney General refused Federal prosecution.    Your beliefs or biases are irrelevant.
No one has claimed that PP was founded at the same time as Roe v. Wade, what the hell are you even on about? Yes they were founded in the early 20th Century, when Eugenics still held currency as popular mainstream science. Margaret Sanger’s mission in life was to stop black people from reproducing by helping them kill their children. This is practically common knowledge that leftists just shrug at, because they are fundamentally misanthropes with no respect for life.
If white supremacists were going around killing Native Americans in the name of the American flag, I would agree with you. But instead, white supremacists are killing black people in the name of the Confederate Flag, like Dylann Roof. Your false equivalency doesn't work here.
Computer programs like this are forced to be made to show some modicum of objectivity because lawmakers don't want to be accused of 'raaaacism' by black racialists and white Liberals on something we all know.  Here's the good news about facts and statistics: they don't care about your feelings.  Blacks- specifically men- commit a grossly disproportionate amount of crime. There. That's a fact.  According to FBI data, 4,906 black people murdered other blacks in 2010 and 2011.  White males are 40 percent of the population and committed 4,582 murders. That same year, black males were just 6.6 percent of the population but committed a staggering 5,531 murders (http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf)  Employment history and family structure are also important: so why do Leftists refuse to accept that almost 75% of blacks are raised by absentee and single parents? (http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/walter-e-williams/true-black-tragedy-illegitimacy-rate-nearly-75)
Being used only by the democrats... Over 80% of black voters vote D.... Look where it has gotten them...
Democrats picked a white Hispanic over an authentic black man?  Don't black lives matter anymore?  I hope one day the democrat party old white leadership is replaced by people of color.
I can find no info that Alexander Marlow is an orthodox Jew. So Republican Tim Scott supported both Sessions and Bannon, that's unusual. So does Ben Carson but that hardly means Bannon isn't a racist, xenophobe, misogynist. Milo fit right in with breitbart. He was a troll trying to upset as many people has he could by throwing out his idiotic comments. Your defense of bannon sounds like the people who claim they're not racist by saying some of their best friends are black!
So, if two black males in a dark sedan come on both sides of my car and try to open the locked doors and steal my cell phone. ..I don't own a purse. ..I should grab the flare gun.  To Signal a cop of course. I would never think of invoking Willie Pete.
"What's wrong with the dark side? " lesparKKK at it again...."She is very racist".....sounds a little like the pot calling the kettle black to me.....
The unarmed black men and women in the news who have been killed by police were not committing violent crimes.  I think one was for a broken tail light, another for selling cigarettes on the street.....  I mean, pul-lease stop being an apologist for a horrible reality that black people are almost twice as likely to be killed by the police and it is wrong.
Oh? Since blacks commit 6x the rate of murder of whites, what do you suggest per your program of racially targeting legislation?
that movement only applies when white people kill black people.  not when black people kill black people.  confusing?  yes, very.
Because 'people of color' means only black people durr
be truthful, you don't love ben, you love what he stands for - anti rail.  about muslims, whose religion hates women, hates all other religions, will kill anyone who so much denigrate their religion, hates gays, etc.  do you love them?  do you love whites that hate blacks and all minorities?  or hate them?  do you hate native Hawaiians who hate haoles?  you are a hypocrite.
Happy now Gretchen Carlson? Maybe the same thing will happen to that black actor who will all thought was squeaky clean all these years. Wili C's his name, right? Also that angry egotistical news personality who slams, yells, insults, interrupts people while bloviating and selling his books on TV.
The argument that black folks are at more risk of violence from black folks than white folks is disingenuous on its face. When has the current incarnation of the Republican party cared about the lives of black people, much less doing anything that would improve their lives? The gang bangers are buying their guns from white gun dealers in red states. I have to go back to 1965 to find any national event that Republicans supported black people having full citizenship rights. That would be the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The current Republicans have done their best to gut that legislation. At least Democrats think black people should have the right to vote. That is more than I can say for Republicans.
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI!
This goes far beyond incompetent. It illuminates the black, evil mind of Trump, and his utter disregard for American principles.
Your stats are wrong.  Top put it simply , even though there are far fewer blacks , by proportion they commit  way more crimes.  In Furguson , after just robbing a store a half hour earlier , the thug charged a policeman . After he got killed in some form of twisted logic blacks thought they had the God given right to steal and destroy others property . Property owners who had nothing to do with the crime.   You didn't see whites hit the streets stealing and burning after Reginal Denny was pulled out of his truck by blacks . Nor did they riot or protest when O.J. was found innocent . Blacks celebrated someone getting away with murder .   Where are Black Lives Matters leaders this weekend as blacks slaughter more blacks in Chicago ?  Where's the march over that ?  It seems the only time black lives matters is if by bad luck a black is killed by a white policeman.   police were killed in Dallas yet there are no marches that include stealing and burning.
look it the censors removed my post saying the shooter was black. and that he could be a black supremacist
if the City does not cut funding  then we the taxpayers of that funding should BOYCOTT the parade  Pride Toronto is totally incompetent with public money  first there was  QUAIA (Queers Against Israeli Apartheid)  now Black Lives Matter  what do they have to do with Pride's mandate - gay pride, gay rights?
Women earned the vote by offending people, blacks earned a better place in the world by offending people, we earned basic human rights and shed the grip of the church and monarchs by offending people.
orange monkey? does that infer that obumma was the stupid black monkey?
Being rich and privileged and crying about oppression is laughable.  The values that anthem espoused and the  men that have died , still die and sacrificed for it are devalued by a bunch of lazy selfish, spoiled athletes who don't even do their research. News media SEARCHES nationwide for stories of white cops killing blacks and in a nation of 320 million  you can find them. It is a rare occurrence however, Cops killed 1100 people nationwide in 2015. 300 were black. Twice as many black people are murdered in chicago every year by other civilians than are killed by cops nationwide.  There is no "epidemic" of cops killing blacks, more whites die every year by cops, and when you look at the FACT that blacks commit crime at much higher rates than any other group  you'd think the instances of cop shootings to be higher. Black males account for 6% of the population and commit 50% of the homicides . Let that sink in.
Sessions hates marijuana even more than he hates African Americans. He jokingly told someone years ago that he "thought the KKK was OK until he found out they smoked pot."  More disturbing garbage from the worst administration in our country's history.
If Obama get credits for all the good things....he get credits for all the bad things. It is not the right of anyone to suppress free speech. And I am not talking about KKK or holocaust deniers but people whose views simply may not be in line with college cowardly neo-fascism that you support by your comments. And really, few blacks get shot, most of them are legal and clear. Then there are few bad apples (out of tens of thousands of good ones)  and all the sudden they are tried of being shot by police while thousands of blacks are being shot by thousands of blacks?? What sort of political creature are you??? All of your statements reflects that you are some sort of misanthrope or at worst, hypocrite. Being a minority myself, I don't blame white people for being people. I am not sure where you get off on your racist rant about white privileges and all that fantasy. Another invention of Obama.
Being an old black man, my first thought as I read the article was this guy must be white. He clearly is weak on African American history. The Obama years have been an improvement over the Bush years for us. For that matter, the last 7 years have been an improvement over the previous 200 years. Our future is bright. Of course, we don't have any white privilege to lose. Like most Jews, black folks are very good at identifying the source of life threatening danger. The ones that don't figure it out don't live long. The police make sure of that. I will never support the GOP as long as they are the preferred party of Klansmen and Nazis. I'm disappointed that the rest of the GOP seems unconcerned about this simple truth. The GOP has set a very low bar for Democrats to look less racist than them. At least the Democrats want us to vote. That is more than I can say for the GOP. The only thing the GOP is offering us are police bullets.
An African hero! "...20km to sell rat killer, passport covers and toothbrushes" Jesus, I have to admire these people. I would not get out of bed for that!  And it the reason why we need to see sense. We need to unshackle the economy. We place it in shackles with BBBEE and AA thereby restricting it so places are limited. Hey presto, you need BBBEE and AA because the economy is not expanding and therefore competition for jobs is fierce. A zero sum game if ever I saw one. It is not working except for the lucky and connected few. So what do we do? We ramp it up. Be brave. Try something new. Get rid of the restrictive red tape. The economy will expand, investment will arrive and, guess what? More jobs will be created. Blacks will fill most of those positions simply because there are not enough whites to fill them. Money does not care about colour.
Obama was a failed social experiment. A "community organizer" who showed the world he couldn't organize a two car funeral. A failure right to the end. Criminals let out of prison at alarming rates....most of them black.
"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color."  ". . . a country that oppresses black people."  Ha!  Some "oppression" Kaepernick, a black man, has been subjected to.  Like Obama, who went to an elite high school, an elite college, and then Harvard Law, where his unprecedented mediocrity as a law review editor --- he published no articles --- was given a pass.    So thank you.  You vindicate my view that Kaepernick is fundamentally messed up, as are those who buy his leftist crock.
Underlying much of that subconscious racial bias is the most enduring, corrosive racial stereotype in America: the black-as-criminal mindset. Historian David Levering summarizes it:  “Whites commit crimes but blacks are criminals.” While whites can and do commit a great deal of minor and major crimes, the race as a whole is never tainted by those acts.    But when blacks violate the law, all members of the race are considered suspect. Remember Zimmerman’s false syllogism? A few blacks committed burglary, Trayvon was black, therefore Trayvon was a criminal.  Similar logic is used daily in the assumptions police and citizens make about African Americans, especially young males. Lisa Bloom 2014.
Its a sporting event.not celebrating a national tragedy or holiday. Where in the nfl rules it says you have to stand. Tebow keeled and y'all loved it. Kneeling to say a prayer. Well during the anthem watch players eyes closed they focusing. They can do the same thibg kneeling its not disrespectful to the flag and people talk about I served this and that. Well yes you served for our freedom and freedom of speech is one of them you morons. Coach Pop of the Spurs in nba is a vet and has deep military roots and maybe yall should look at what he said. Trump doing what he wants gets people divided and you morons are simply dumb enough to let it happen. The truth is people are still racist and mad cuz these are black people. If it was white NASCAR I doubt we would hear such an uproar. Racism is still around big-time and this proves it.
I won't use the word "white" if there were other non-Indians out there. But nearly all the non-Indians happened to be white people. If there were nothing but black people out there, I would write "black sycophants".  If a black man beat up a little old lady, I would called him a "black thug". If that person happens to be white, then its "white thug".  I don't see how a descriptive word could be considered as a racist. If a male attacked a female...would that be a sexist term?  Indian Lovers is a universal term is it not? Why would it be racist? If I am a Motown lover, would that make me a racist?? If you love haiku, would that make you a racist. I think we are throwing that word "racist" too much in this world.
WOW! If YOU aren't the 'pot calling the kettle black'! You'd better take a very serious look in the mirror. Your comment is nothing but TOTAL reverse DISCRIMINATION, hypocritical & offensive!! Don't stand too close to me (not that I'd let you) when lightening strikes! How do you know anybody here is white?! (yes I do happen to be a white male. So I guess that makes me a racist pig, eh?!) Here's an old saying, 'don't judge a person until you've walked a mile in their shoes. As far as I'M concerned, racism of ANY kind (including reverse-discrimination) is UNACCEPTABLE in today's world. Unfortunately I don't see YOU changing your POOR ATTITUDE anytime soon (I hope I'm wrong). People like yourself need to take a cultural sensitivity course. Don't take Hallowe'en so seriously people! It's supposed to be 1 day a year when kids can have some fun! As long as they aren't acting like criminals & dressing-up like, for example, terrorists then who cares?! Let kids have fun while they are young!
""All the time he was a problem,” said Dr. David Lazala, who trained Bello as a family medicine doctor. When Bello was forced out in 2015, he sent Lazala an email blaming him for the dismissal."  If Dr. David Lazala is of Mexican decent then we can safely assume Dr Bello, a black Nigerian, was a target of Mexican hate crime against blacks so Bello got even. Tons of public crime data supports  the countless hatred, discrimination, violence and homicide rates against blacks by Mexicans. I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if Bello was falsely ousted with unproven allegations to make him go ape $hit crazy and kill others and eventually himself.
The officer that shot the man was black.... what do you mean "white people"?
If our economy continues to improve and the stock market keeps everyone's 401k's from disappearing, and employment number go up, people may hate him but they will vote for him. The disgrace to the office of president was Bill Clinton. He is who trailblazed for Trump. Everyone gave Clinton honors and awards, so why wouldn't they vote for a Trump ?  Clinton was and is a vile perpetrator of sexual harassment and sexual assault on numerous women. Hillary made sure that the victim's of Bill were drug through the mud and called them trailer park trash and looney toons.  So, in the long run, the Democrats are going to have a tough time coming up with anyone except Bernie !  Run Joe Biden and see not only the way he vilified Anita Hill but the way he treated a black man. Not so good.  Maybe the Democrats will run Governor Moonbeam ! How about Vicente Fox ? Better be Bernie !
Where your article tries to switch the truth to make the narrative what you want it to be, PROVING that yu are as bad as the rest of the CORRUPT NEWS AGENCIES!! For IF YOU WERE HONEST you would have accounted for the TRUTH ABOUT CRIMES FOR THE FACT REMAINS AND PEOPLE THAT AINT LIBERAL SHEEP WILL SEE THIS!! That even though the blacks only make up 13% of the population THEY COMMIT MORE THEN80% OF ALL CRIME AND YOUR 6% OF BLACK MEN COMMITTED 60% OF ALL MURDERS!!! THUS WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THEM BEING TARGETED NOW??? IF IT WERNT FOR YOUR DISHONEST BEHAVIOR YOU WOULD NOT BE A LIBERAL NEWS AGENCY!!! YOU ALL SUCK AND YOU ARE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY. MAYBE IF YOU HAD SOME INTEGRITY YOU WOULD NOT BE SUCH WORTHLESS SCUM!!
Wow you are really stupid Trump will wack any goof that tries it. His black ops teams and hte military love him because he brought back mad dog.  You have no idea what you are dealing with. This guy ain't no pussy You are thinking about jughead I think
Milwaikee is the most biggoted city I have ever lived in.  Every ethnic group talks trash about the others.  The only thing they agree upon is their hate for Hispanics, Blacks and Asians.
I DEMAND the black bigot socialist  SENATOR xbxtxch from Missouri be jailed at once for threatening the President of the United States and fomenting civil unrest. PUT HER THE XFK IN JAIL NOW.
Black men are also more likely to be killed by other black men. That little stat goes right out the window though right. My privelage must be I work extremely hard for everything I have with zero gains from the government or social assistance. Poor benefit but I'm not complaining , or selling drugs, commiting crimes or joining gangs even though they exist here in good old Alberta. I can certainly thank my privelage for that, not my morals lol.
Show me any Rep. Politician in a public venue using Race as part of their qualifications for their elected seat other than a Democrat(s)? Isn't this Racism in itself? People using their Racial make-up as a means to say they understand your Racial plight in itself is playing the Race Card for votes that's creating Racial divide in the US in itself.  Any White man running for public office let alone talking with someone like that be PUMMELED, called a White Racist Bigot!  This racist remarks can only be played by a minority race in ANY Party. A Black person standing up for a White man, be called not Black Enough or Unko Thomas! Insane  I accept groups for what they are, Racists is Racists no matter how big of thing they make or not. Using one's racial background in a good way to attract votes is Racism in my Book! they may not be using their race in a bad way but it's still Playing the Race Card! Democrats m.o.  Playing the Race Card has NO place In America!  Mahalo Barry! and Friends!
Take all of them, of the left, of the right, white power and Black lives matter goons and put them all in the same compound and let them marinate.
Piffle. There is no "assault" — symbolic or otherwise — on freedom of speech in M-103. There is nothing particularly tendentious about Islamophobia. It is abroad in the land and it is recognizable for the irrational fear of Islam that it causes among the ignorant.   There are many seemingly normal Canadians, for example, who believe that there is a vast conspiracy to overthrow Common Law and subject Canadian citizens to Sharia Law. The only explanation for belief in such a fantastical and potentially toxic falsehood is Islamophobia.   The Conservative amendment is typical of the reactionary, gainsaying/smokescreen deploying mode of Conservative thought that comes up with slogans like "all lives matter" in response to "black lives matter," which was coined to call attention to the fact that black people (not "all" people) are systemically subjected to state violence at a level proportionally higher than other people.  There is nothing Orwellian about it.
She one CUUUUTE Korean and smart, too. Later married the black Mayor. Smart and hard jazz tiny child who actually executed hard decisions. Got national media coverage. Fought the teachers' union and lost. Too bad. Now black kids stay stupid. Are we going to support Ms. Kishimoto? That's only half the battle. The other half is trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Our kids are stupendously STEEYOUPID!!!
So black people are a small percentage of the total population but commit vastly disproportionate amounts of murder, and this has nothing to do with the comparatively less disproportionate amount of deadly interactions with police? Okay...
If black people cared about black lives. Then they would spend their time and energy getting black people to stop killing each other.
I'm not sure BLM has earned its place at Pride either, not unless BLM wants to address all of the black hate towards the homosexual community... black rappers advocating to "kill the batty boy", and numerous black African nations where the leaders condone the use of violence and worse against the gay community.  Funny, not a peep from BLM on this kind of violence and hate towards gays.  Howcome?
…(cont’d from above)…  In a controversial case in 1989 that’s been characterized as a modern-day lynching, four black teenagers and one Latino teenager — the "Central Park Five" — were accused of attacking and raping a jogger in New York City. Trump immediately took charge in the case, running an ad in local papers demanding that the teens be executed with the headline, "BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!" The teens’ convictions were later vacated after their innocence was scientifically proven and the city paid them a $41 million settlement as compensation for their 7-13 years of wrongful imprisonment…yet the xenophobic Trump said just this past October that he still believes the black teens were guilty, despite the DNA evidence to the contrary!  (cont'd below)...
There it is... can't prove a damn thing and is simply being a racist pos. What the F does it matter who does what crime. I'll call APD and report anyone anytime so all of you better not speed like an A hole, Tailgate, run with busted light and like and ass drive through my hood looking out of place or give me the slightest inclination you are up to no good cuz I'm a human lie detector and White Black Mexican Asian Polynesian I could care less!! All you law breaking POS are gonna go down sooner or later in my town and even if APD does nothing with my calls as I give them your plates or description, next time you have a run in with them I doubt they'll be letting you off the hook. Simply being an Ahole on the roads has me calling you in cuz you'll likely risk my life or someone else's with your disregard for public safety let alone your children buckled in the back seat. This is a warning I'm looking for all you.
Christopher Mercer who killed all those students at the community college at Roseburg Oregon October 2015, was just as black as Barack Obama.
"Hillary got a huge percentage of the black non college educated male vote."  Of course.  Why would a black male vote for a white racist?
Quote: "Michelle Obama is taking some heat for recent remarks she made on gender, but I'm struggling to muster outrage given the sheer incoherence of what she actually said."  True, I've rarely found what Michelle says coherent, but I suspect that what she's saying is primarily directed at black communities. She could have gone much further and bluntly stated that blacks coddle far too much the criminality and paternal irresponsibility in black males. (I won't call them men.) That's glaringly obvious and different from mostly white schools where ordinary boyishness is attacked as "toxic masculinity."
You're obviously talking about poor whites, but that's OK. What would you talk about if the people were black? Referring to people living in "trailers" -mobile homes as, implicitly, ignorant or plain dumb, is racist. So is the word redneck. The LA Times has banned  that word from its comments. You yourself are a snob,  probably without any right to be.
So you can't answer the question, huh?  Prove that most black people killed by cops are killed by black cops. Let's start there with your race obsession. Let's see you provide some facts first. Killer strawman at the end, though.
Strom Thurmond was a far right extreme bigot/racist all 100 years of his life.  Matter of fact, he was so racist that he drove that point home by impregnating a black slave assigned to his family.  Thurmond managed to keep this black daughter a secret from the rest of the nation unto his dying day.  How do you like dem apples?
Friggin players disrespecting our soldiers who laid down their lives for our flag should pull their heads out of their a_ses. What the hell does our flag and national anthem have to do with their false narrative of cops out to kill black people.
This country has a history of killing black people for all sorts of reasons. Profit was a common motive. We have never been treated as equals to white folks. You have no idea of how much rape, robbery, and murder has been done to give you your white privilege. You don't have to know about the violence to receive the benefits.
folks    come on now-  this is bill maher- how soon we forget but only when we want too-  the same jewish man (ok half jewish which is full jewish in some books if your liberal enough tough but only when they want to be one for argument sake) who by the way used the word nigga on nitional tv only months ago-  and boy that helped create this mess-    now he is blaming everyone else-    now he's  telling us who the real nazis are- do they use the word niggers like he did (oops as poops he slit or i meany slipped as sipped and had too much to think again)  he still has his job-   not even a whimper from the far left-  hows that for fairness and we are stupposed to listen to them closely on matters of faith and truth-    hey if it works in israel against poor palestinions as onions i guess they figure wrong that they can pull this crap in americle dig
1) So race relations have not budged since the mid-80's? Maybe update your "teaching": materials, more than 30 years have gone by and a lot of change has taken place. This invisible backpack thing is badly out dated.  2) If a teacher can shut up a white male with an insinuation straight out of Kafka's The Trial, then...what power/privilege exactly does this white male have? What systemic/institutional power is the white male using here? He is silenced, and powerless to even state an opinion. Where is all this power he has? Power is contextual, no one has all power all the time.   3) The black population of Canada is less than 3%.  White population is 80%.  Maybe, just maybe, white people have so much representation because they are the overwhelming majority. This is just a fact. There's no malice, no grand conspiracy....unless you are so racist as to think that white people are having and raising children simply to spite and hurt minorities.
Mr. Hecker, you ask what this country is coming to but maybe the question is "what is the country going back to?"  Remember those black and white photographs of the racist southerners, their faces pinched in expressions of hatred aimed at African American children attending schools in the segregated south? This is what America is embracing--ignorant white trash culture. Mmmwah! Americans are embracing vulgarity and brutality like an old friend.
Rich,    Yes, human nature tends to be prejudiced.   But the more primitive and simple societies seem to have no problem with prejudice.   As for Cuba, I don't praise them because they're socialists. I've seen documentaries and news stories through the years that indicate the whites, blacks and browns get along. Maybe because they are all equally poor. Maybe it's communist propaganda. But I believe corporate capitalism thrives on racism and discrimination, socialism and social democracy don't.
Oh the irony.   Mostly black millionaire professional athletes protesting on national tv for equality!  What a hoot.
You might be right Neko, but I think it was the fact I dared compare innocent Sandy Hook elementary school children gunned down by assault weapons with innocent children in the womb.  The compartmentalization I speak of is predicated on who does the killing.  White men with assault weapons are somehow different from any other class of human engaged in taking life.  White men with assault weapons are mentally ill, every other human class are murderers.    I think the one thing that really threw me about this incident is my first thought when I read about it at 1:30am out of a dead sleep when my phone when off.  "Please God don't tell me the shooter was Muslim or Black." When I realized this I was like 'how is sick is that thinking?'  And then I realized, it wasn't really all that sick.  It was the sign of the times.  I have subsequently found out I was hardly alone with that first initial thought....and that is representative of the sick state of affairs in this country.
I think the argument regarding "black on black murder" is that they riot in the streets when known criminals (armed or not) are killed. Meanwhile, young adults and kids are literally slaughtering each other and it gets little attention.  My argument is we should worry less about the color and stand strong against all unjustified killings regardless of the race/religion/profession/etc. of the victim and the killer. Focusing only on a single grouping only continues to keep us divisive as a people.  Do we really need to be exclusive? Fine, "American Lives Matter".
So if black people are being killed off disproportionately then who is doing the killing?
"Eight years ago, when Barack Obama was elected, a lot of people weren’t happy but for the most part they moved forward to give the man a chance."  Donna, is this with the fact that hate groups in the U.S grew at an alarming rate after that election, in mind or without? And, is this with the meeting of top GOP'rs at the Caucus House Restaurant in D.C. to plot to obstruct the new (black) President at every turn, on Inauguration Day 2009, in mind or without?   I'm sorry that guy was a jerk to you, but do you not see a disconnect as a Christian in supporting someone who brags about grabbing women by their privates? This is not to mention every other demagogic, xenophobic, and otherwise horrible un-Christian things Trump said during the campaign, and continues to this day. Or are you one who just blames media i.e. kill the messenger and doesn't believe a word of it?    https://www.splcenter.org/   http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/03/The-Conspiracy-to-Commit-Legislative-Constipation
The only white guy that I despise is the Chump. He is sick, vile and disgusting. He is dividing our country. My comments are merely pointing out the fact that a white male opened fire on an audience at a country western music concert. In all of the news reports that I have watched. I haven't seen a Black,Muslim, or Asian. Only Whites and Latinos. Thos why do you think the gunman chose that specific event to accomplish his unimaginable massacre.
I don't understand your comment at all. Black kids did not want scriptures read in schools about "killing the unbelievers."
Obama humiliates Trump by his mere existence. Eloquence and wisdom coming from a Black man...no wonder why Trump and his White Supremacists hate him.
What an absurd comment, "J. NEVER asked Roman..." He couldn't.  He wasn't a Roman citizen. He called his Jewish religion to live up to its care of the poor. Republicans largely are Calvinists.  You are poor because you are not right w. god. Jesus upended this view when he said how difficult for the rich to enter the KofG. The disciples were amazed because common interpretation was the rich were right w. god. For Jesus, they were rich because of exploitation. If Christians took J. literally there be no need for government but because Christians here don't, secular government do what Christian don't.  Same for government's 14th amendment, equality & due process of every citizens because the dominant Christians didn't treat native Americans & blacks as equal, providing due process.  Rather, Indian removal, lynchings, etc, largely by Christians here!  Who were the savages, civilized?
Obama is a nice little black man who is a wonderful speaker and only if he was Gay.
Hugh: Ali would have looked down on you, and not respected you, unless you yourself are black, heterosexual, married to a black woman, and a Muslim.   If you don't fall into that category, then you would have been a devil in his eyes.  When asked by a BBC reporter about his beliefs that black people should not associate with whites, he said this:  "There are white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?"  That is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.  The fact that his analogy for white people was that they are rattlesnakes says a lot.  What if a white person said that of blacks??
Hey, where's your buddy david duke? You guys going to do some docking and talk about the evil black man?
You only fought for our Constitution, not some Fascist definition of forced, sappy Patriotism.  Salute, cry, sob, brag....whatever.  It's your choice.  It is also just as Patriotic to say NO to the white racists who oppress, demean, demonize and attack American Black Citizens.
So am I.  And every time I read posts urging leniency and patience with this guy I can't help but remember a lot of the same posters leaping to defend cops who blow away unarmed black guys without a second thought.  Hypocrites.
Good one--"if blacks don't vote for Clinton." You might add "if the earth stops spinning on its axis."  Also, I don't think name calling is all people who hate Trump have left, rather I think they simply enjoy venting their spleen on him since he has made Americans look like racist idiots. Plus, he's so butt ugly--he obviously only gets laid by having piles of money.
What don't you agree with BLM?  The reason why they are protesting or the manner in which they are?   I've seen horrific videos of black men being shot by police officers and the black man in the video was acting COMPLETELY nice, polite, and was NOT a threat to the cop at any level, yet he gets shot in front of his girlfriend, who's also behaving completely appropriate and she watched her boyfriend die right next to her and all they did was have a broken tail light.   The police officer was completely wrong.  How would you feel if that happened to you?   Yes, there are a couple of bad apples that screw it up for the rest, but they are upset about being racially profiled, and there's been a rash of killings of blacks by cops and that's just not right.  Yes, I've seen cops behave inappropriately toward whites too.  I don't know what the problem is, but there are a lot of cops, not all of them, but a lot that have been just not behaving properly and groups like BLM is the result.
Another factor you fail to point out is that blacks commit a disproportionate number of crimes when compared to EVERY OTHER group. Being stuck in jail without bail money has far more to do with poverty than the color of one's skin.
I'm sorry that you were called nasty names by a moron.....and I appreciate what you have done.....but here's the deal from my perspective.....  There is an assumption by many that cops always close ranks around their own.  Prior to getting into education, I was going to go the Criminal Justice route.  This concept was mentioned in my first CJ class, so I do know it exists to some extent.  I had classes with many that had no business being cops.....and I imagine that at least a few of them became cops.  I now refer to those people as "George Zimmermans".  Even though the cop in Ferguson was cleared (rightfully so, if you ask me), a DOJ report found a number of smelly things going there with regards to its police department and city government and their interaction with the black community.  I don't recall any law enforcement people publicly urging Ferguson to clean up its mess.  Very few in law enforcement speak against instances of brutality....and I see that as an issue.
Yep.  Better to say negro.
You should have looked in those statistics further.  Whites represent 80% of violent and sexual crimes against children--they are convicted of such crimes three times more often than blacks and five times more than Latinos.  And mass shootings?  Ye gods and little fishes--about 90%.
Missing from the raw statistics are the denial, deceit and delusion surrounding who shoots whom...and why.  Pretending that suicides and homicides are symptoms of comorbidity in an otherwise disparate geographical area is lumping explicit discernible factors into one single cause - gunfire.  Suicides have virtually nothing to do with homicides.  There are as many reasons for suicide as those commit suicide.  Homicides, on the other hand, are clearly divisible between the three major categories (crime, random violence, & personal conflicts) as well as the occasional murder-suicides.  Blacks make up the majority of homicide deaths and have the highest rate of homicide of any racial or ethnic group.  Young black males are predators at a rate wildly out of proportion to their percentage of the population.  Whether the victims are black, white, hispanic or asian - the trigger is most likely pulled by a black male.
In 2012, white males were 38 percent of the population and committed 4,582 murders. That same year, black males were just 6.6 percent of the population but committed a staggering 5,531 murders.  In other words: black people–at just a fifth of the size–committed almost 1,000 more murders than their white counterparts.
Yes...that is just like when evil, unscrupulous traders in the Old West gave the American Indians Blankets...But infected with smallpox.  Yes...offer free abortions in predominately Black or Latino neighborhoods to often poor people..."YES! FREE!"...while all the time there appears to be a hidden agenda.
generally you are correct.  but as I see it, trump's candidacy is due to the Obama's presidency.  many white folks were startled that a black man could be president of the us.  now, these folks were trying to take back America and make it white America again.  many of trumpy's policies are based on racism, anti minorities and gay, isolationism, etc.  Obama during this administration appointed many minorities and blacks to high level positions in government and the military and the whites felt discriminated by this.  they feel that America has become brown and want to make it white again.  I am referring to the white suprememists, there are also many whites who truly believe in race equality, but there are many, many whites who believe that they are supreme.
Hmm. Arab, crazy white guy, black dude with a chip on his shoulder? Tough call, but I'm going with Abdullah and Allahu akbar. I've got $500 on it at -140.  But to better my odds I've got a whack black as a 2nd choice $300 at +105. The white guy odds are +375 but it was a country music festival so...staying away.
Let's not forget about Beyonce''s 'black power' and Lady Gaga's satanic 'fallen angel' halftime routines...who needs this new world order garbage shoved down our throats???
Doubling down on your double standards while playing the race card and invoking 100 year-old crimes in a weak effort to deflect from the thousands of black murderers in the last ten years and the three in Denver right now.  Wow. I'm stunned.  And I'm still waiting on you to provide the links that prove all the wild claims you have made in this thread.  Seriously, please, don't ever change.
King Zwelithini's Ingonyama Trust alone owns over 60% of ALL land in KZN. Over 2.8 million hectares. Not only that, but they pay zero taxes. I don't know how many people live on that land.  The point is that those who claim that whites own something like 80% of all land are clearly ignorant. And why do they always want to expropriate the land of white farmers when so much land is in the hands of kings and chiefs?  If black people do not have land, then why not give them title deeds to all this land? And what about all the land in State hands?  Then there is the small issue of something in the region of 90% of all expropriated land lying useless. And those who had been rewarded with this land not having the farming skills, selling off implements or the community rather wanting the money. Many of the cases at the land courts are backlogged because they fight about rather having the money.  This doesn't look like people want land. It looks like they want money. All hate-whites politics.
I bet the black coach did not make him work hard over the two weeks.  Not in their DNA...
That is not what I am saying and it is that kind of nonsense you just posted that turns people against your issue. Had the protesters, protested in a different venue they most likely would have received more support.  I noticed in those reports that the majority of murders were also done by members of the AA community and it is has been shown the majority of murders in Chicago for example is black on black shooting. But that's right I am not allowed to get involved in that discussion because I am white and I don't understand.
Cracker is a disrespectful word  used by Blacks for Whites. It is the same as using the N word for Blacks.
Dave, we have to be careful about equivalents. Start with the fact that the white supremacists and Nazis want to purge America of Jews, blacks, minorities and immigrants. That in and of itself is the antithesis of what America is. They are hateful, racist and anti-semitic. Black Lives Matter wants to call attention to (in addition to many other things) the systemic aspects of our justice system that result in the deaths and incarceration of black people at a much higher rate than other populations. They not only do not advocate violence, they advocate justice, peace and love in engagements with others. Now, the reality with both groups may be that there are people who claim affiliation who act with violence (or others claim that the violent are affiliated with the organization.) But that does not make the groups equivalent. They are not. And to believe they are is to admit to some sympathy with the white supremacists. There is no other possible conclusion.
O.J. is not just any black man. He is wealthy and famous. These things buy justice, regardless of color.

I guess the centuries of female transgressions do not exist... for Denise, its ... what are you talking about?   straight white men are the evil ones....  women are without fault in this. When progressives operate, its whatever convenient lies will work. Take the Muslim student council female who made hateful remarks about white people. Now the progressive professors and students are claiming that when Dalhousie intends to hold her accountable that free speech is threatened. What a laugh... if a white person had said those same things about blacks, asians, muslims, native indians, GLBTQ people.... there would be a human rights trial and firing, dismissal, shaming and new stricter rules and laws. LYING HYPOCRITES... all of the progressives. Hateful and racist themselves.
They call it "ObamaCare" instead of the "ACA" to remind everyone it was Obama's signature bill. They tell lies about it because they cannot stand that an African-American man could possibly have achieved what Bill Clinton and the Bushes could not, to craft a workable health care bill which was so promised before. In the end, Trump and his followers agenda is to undo all the great things President Obama did, quite simple because he was not White. When I see all the hatred in the GOP / Tea Party ranks, pure and simple racism is behind most of it. How sad!
Head over to the Chicago Tribune.  If you can stomach it, read about how many black children and other innocent black people have been shot or killed in Chicago by black gang members in just 2016 alone.  What Kaepernick should be protesting is the black culture of dropping out of high school to become a gangsta or a drug dealer, and how victims of violence refuse to give names or descriptions of perps to detectives....so the cycle of violence rages on and on and on while grieving black mothers wail on tv.  A black person choosing to not finishing their public education to get a decent job is neither a police problem or " oppression "
Shooting someone running away and unarmed is a clue. Trump relies on the soft bigotry of whites who do not believe that they have any racist attitudes, that if only black people would quit talking about race these issues would go away. That is simply not the case, as any black job applicant or potential renter or homebuyer will tell you. Racism runs deep and ignoring that is racist.
It's not based on their opinions..any more than a "criminal" is viewed on his or her opinions.  It's based on their ACTIONS, or inactions.  Does the opinion of an all white utopian society, elimination of "human weeds" such as "Negroes and Jews", elimination or sterilization of those in mental institutions and prisons sound like someone with a mental illness?  Because those are "opinions" of the early 20th century "progressives" who not only "opined", but acted on those...and even Hitler borrowed some of their ideas.  The loons who "opined" on the evils of drink got the 18th Amendment passed, and the federal government finally resorted to putting wood alcohol in the grain alcohol, because everything else they put in to stop people drinking was distilled out.  As a result, the US Government murdered around 10,000 people.  Opinions are fine, and widely held...everyone has one.  Evil opinions put into action however, IS a mental illness.
""We are as rife as anyone else in intolerance, bigotry and ignorance.""  Utter and total rubbish.  You've obviously never been outside or borders.  'Racism' is the *norm* outside the Anglosphere.  Go to *anywhere* in Asia, or the Middle East and ask what they think of 'Black people'. They will tell you calmly, openly that Blacks are a 'lower form' of existence in one way or another.  Most places are extremely ethnocentric.  An African cannot get a remotely normal job in most Asian or Middle Eastern countries.  Most nations outside the Anglosphere have pretty strict form of social hierarchy - at least in UK, Canada, US, Australia - we recognize it and have policy, action, we make amends.  Admittedly, they try in South America but it's still open-air racism.  The US had a *black President*. There won't be a Black Head of State in any Asian country for at least the next 1000 years.
Putin killing 300,000 people was OK because it was in his 'backyard'?   I suppose the KKK lynching blacks in the south was similarly OK. Y'know, the whole backyard thing.
In general the usual result of a revolutionary change in government is to replace one repressive regime with another often worse one.  Stupid white elitism is now replaced by stupid black elitism.  The civilised world needs its elites. To date no one has found a really satisfactory way of ensuring that they are not stupid.
Stupid people use the silly term "African American" in a desperate attempt to be politically-correct.  They don't realize that Africa is a continent - not a country.  Omar Sharif is from Egypt but lived here. Dave Matthews and Charlize Theron moved here from South Africa. I guess that makes them all African Americans!  What do you call a black guy in Canada? An African Canadian? An African North American?  Some folks just can't think for themselves.
Your comments prove my comments. This is why BLM should not exist, you all get all riled up when any black guys gets killed but when it's another race white, red, yellow they don't give a damn. That's not what equality and liberty is about. That's not what MLK was marchin for. BLM is a fancy way of saying that black people will loose their minds if cops kill any blacks! But they can kill other races and they won't bat an eye for the loss. That's why BLM is a joke. Even if one time they would show support for a white death and protest the same way they do for would be criminals it would bring a little validity to their cause. But as of now they are just the other side of the KKK coin.
who kills the most blacks? blacks. if a cop says stop, do it. don't approach him, don't keep on walking. thank you to all the policemen that keep us safe. and while there are bad cops, most are good. (which is more than can be said about most of our politicians.) obama started this garbage. fergusen brought his death on himself. most do.
It's Trump's fault.  He's out to get blacks.  I demand an investigation.
The pot calling the teakettle "black"! They're all truth twisters and withholders. To the point where most of them wouldn't know the truth if it dropped in their heads. Wouldn't let any of them pet my dog.
Xenophobia and Racism have come to be an extension of a long history of tribalism, which also regularly has it's fires stoked by leaders whether elected or un-elected purely for political expediency and their own re-seating of (waning) power. by observation the term is applied one sided in some fallacy of Political Correctness and attempt to perpetuate the myth that black people cannot be racist ( a thought of much counterfeit currency)  The results of both  end up being the shit-show citizens live daily yet still refuse to even acknowledge the clear unbiased, and un-politicised facts of as a nation, let alone capable of addressing in a civil manner - stupidly led by their noses and falsehood of our leaders, corrupt, puerile, blinkered and self serving as they are, unable to conduct themselves in a civil manner in private or in public it would seem. How do we expect the rest of the citizenry to respond and who's example do they follow? And the leaders achieve their goals of servitude.
UGH  Why do so few people understand this? Political thought is not protected. You do not have to make a cake for a nazi, a democrat or a anarchist. You do jage to make a cake fr an elderly person or a black person.
Prohibition gave us the mafia.  The Drug war gave us the cartels.  In both cases the public's respect for the law and public institutions eroded.  Your stance encourages violence, creates and actively promotes black markets, diminishes civil liberties, and demands an expansion of government power.  Your post is one of the most historically ignorant, economically illiterate, intellectually bankrupt, morally defunct, and downright dangerous abuses of the English language that I have read on this site.  Please, please, try educating yourself.  Also, try not to tell you neighbors what they can or cannot do?  Power-hungry, dictatorial, unconstitutional nonsense is all you are saying.
Please, your response is simply stupid. The KKK has always been right-wing. When the Democratic party of the late 19th and early 20th centuries was most racist it was a right-wing party. The early Republican party was left-wing--the anti-slavery party of Lincoln. Pro-slavery was establishment and therefore, right-wing. Anti-slavery was anti-establishment and therefore, if a political tendency must be chosen it would be more left-wing. The U.S. Nazi party was right-wing. George Lincoln Rockwell's ANP was founded in 1960 on the ideas Adolf Hitler espoused. FDR disdained Nazism while Henry Ford who rain for the GOP nomination in 1924 and was a Nazi-sympathizer like Charles Lindbergh.  The reality is that poor people--and Blacks are over represented in this category due to racism--are both the most victimized as well as the biggest perpetrators of crime. White collar crime costs $300-$600 billion per year. Wealthy white people commit the majority of those costly crimes.
Bottom line is: Black athletes think "The rules don't apply to us."
You attribute magical powers to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Act itself did not suddenly "create all equal" simply because someone wrote on a piece of paper to that effect. I called you nothing other than what you implied about yourself and assumptions when you wrote this:  "If Blacks would act Human there would not be a problem” (paraphrase)." Arthur Ashe would not have written anything that implied what your paraphrase does. You have taken liberties with his meaning and no one need read his book to ascertain the truth. YOU asserted via your paraphrase that if African-Americans would only act human they would be treated like humans but 300 plus years of American history defies your claim, what is more, that same history makes the case that it was in fact white people who failed to show humanity toward their fellow human beings by writing into the laws they wrote that persons of African ancestry were less than human.  The Dred Scott case is instructive in this regard.
Why didn't you post the full statistics that show blacks kill blacks more tahn any other race? Why just cherry pick the data you want and turn a blind eye to the rest?
What? You dinks blame resident Triumph FOR ANYTHING that doesn't tikcle your dope smoking, sexual deviant's infallibility complex. Get real, because your black clad antifa queens are going to face a retribution they didn't see coming-and of course it'll be President Triumph's fault. lmao. Ignorant snowflake.
I'll try to respond to your comment,  Agirlwhoknowsherownmind, but understand it's entirely out of charity as I don't really understand your "English." To clarify, I have not expressed "outrage" in any comments made to Mr. Wilson's letter because I'm not outraged in the least. I liked your video and I'm surprised you failed to mention Hillary's performance of Hebrew ethnicity in quoting the book of Paul. You'll notice Hillary good judgement in omitting to don a wig and smear black pigment on her face and hands when she quoted the gospel singer James Cleveland. All those Black folks were standing up and applauding in the video you suggested so we can assume they understood the meaning she was conveying by quoting him. Not that you would be in a position to correct anyone's grammar but why would anyone with that capability correct the grammar or alter the dialect that inheres in a particular quotation? Wouldn't that do injustice to the quotation? I don't mean to talk over your head.
Peter, yes I am saying they bred their slaves like cattle. It was cheaper and more fun than buying adult slaves with skills. If you read the memoirs of Mary Chestnut, you will read her comments about how she and her girl friends resented the fact that so many of their slaves looked like their husbands. She was cited in Ken Burns documentary, The Civil War. Most white folks don't want to know this. Most blacks with English surnames are descendants of slave owners. That is how they got those names. Slave owners didn't consider themselves to be racists or rapists. They considered themselves just capitalists. So much for Christian morality. Raping black women was also common practice throughout the Jim Crow days. Black families sent their daughters to school more than their sons because their daughters would be less likely to be raped as a condition of employment if they were teachers, or nurses. Remember Strom Thruman's black love child?
Kayden, religion has nothing to do with this. Hinduphobia- no it's cult and self seeking power hungry crooks like your man Butler that jump on the religious wagon who have no qualms about lying and cheating their way up the political ladder.  In Tulsi Gabbard's case, her guru has taken advantage of her cult beliefs she was born into and abused the fact that she is beholden to him. As he says when he initiates his disciples, you are now mine and I will instruct you how you can serve ME. Fanaticism not religion.  Cry yourself silly with all your talk on religious bigotry, homophobic backed support, Hillary Clinton money, and whatever else you can lash out with.  How about all the other religions, I don't see Tulsi and Butler supporting them. In fact she down right degrades the Muslims. Butler has always spoken very unkindly of Gays, Blacks, Muslims Christians and Jews.  Beware Hawaii, Tulsi and anyone who adheres to him, has no place in our democratic system.
Look at the stills and user-posted videos posted on the web. Initially, the gun does not appear, then it appears, then it's in a different location, then it disappears. Before or after the crime scene photos??? Odd, huh?   Now, look at the picture above .... the hammer is cocked, but ... NO MAGAZINE. Sure looks like a dropped pistol to me. If this was 'really' in the victim's possession, it would make a good case for 'suicide by cop.' Also, if this were truly the case, he would have held the gun out with his hand, visible, and in a threatening manner. This didn't happen.  Incidentally, more blacks are killed by other blacks than any other shooters.
Wow! That's quite the Straw Man. Kaepernick did far more than just "kneeling", and everyone knows it. It's about what his kneeling represents. 1. Kaepernick accused white people of today of oppressing black people and people of color, which is an outright racist Lie!  2. He then equated today's police with slave catchers! Another despicable racist Lie!  3. He then said "America has never been great for people of color." all while he is making 17 million dollars per year in a country led by a black President! More anti-white hate and rhetoric. 4. He publicly supported Fidel Castro, while wearing a shirt with him on it. 5. He wore socks to practice depicting the police as Pigs! 6. And to top it off, here's what this genius said about both Presidential candidates Hillary and Trump: - "Both are proven liars and it almost seems like they’re trying to debate who’s less racist."  .  Yes, Kaepernick is an anti-American, anti-white, racist hatemonger. As are those who follow and support him.
Actually Trump aloud and weak up the race car again, We was coping and dealing with this never ending issue in the U.S. with calm, Then Obama brow back it because He was Black, Now again we are dealing with this stupid same old story.
Would it have been racist if the only black corn pop was the one riding the skateboard?  I'm not sure at what activity the outrage should begin.
That whenever one tries to generalize about groups of people, one might be accused of stereotyping.  He could also be accused of stereotyping in saying that black people are wasting their money in strip clubs.  While there are complaints about the line being perceived as perpetuation of an ancient stereotype, it's also clear that Jay-Z's thesis is that to overcome oppression, black people should emulate Jews in America by accumulating inter-generational wealth.  Whether you buy the capitalism as cure thesis or not, it's clear his intent is not to put people down, but to build them up.  My two cents:  MLK didn't dream that his children would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the contents of their bank accounts.
I don't agree. White people commit crimes just like black, samoan, asian, etc. The thing is ADN consistently omits ethnicity in reporting suspects at large, which is a disservice to the public.  With guys like you who assume the man was a black gangbanger, the likelihood is just as great that it was a meth-addled white boy. A sad commentary on your bias. What I am asking for is ADN to tell the whole story.
Black lives do matter.  If there were no blacks, there would be a million white cops in the US with nothing to do.
What a ridiculous outdated thing to say.  The police are not a minority or cultural group.  They are a government agency made up of a cross section of Canadians.  Where is your proof of all this undue harassment, this is just fake news.  What cop said what?  In some situations it is possible to get HIV from spit sorry to tell you, it may be remote but it is possible.  Police are often dealing with injured and bleeding people so you cannot speak for every instance.  The police chief is black and many members are gay, countless others are not white or males. Your arguments are archaic and not even true.
You are not going to win here. Being well read doesn't mean you know who every tom dick and harry on the radio is, particularly when you don't listen to talk radio. You don't understand what discernment is - look it up. In your tiny world all black people know each other. That's silly, and it's not true. Do you know who Ian Haney Lopez is? No? See how that works? How myopic of you. And you don't know the first thing about me, other than an exchange on a message board, so I reject your "hypocrite" label, and need to let you know that your opinion doesn't matter to me one way or the other. Have a nice day!
It's OK a black man call you a white trash,  but if you say they are black, you get arrested for being a racist.  They pretend to brush it aside when ISIS killed innocent people and they are OK to let Muslim women wear Burqa on our streets but you wear a Great America hat, you are fired. They don't respect democratic vote and pretend to embrace in democracy.  Fck all these liberals idiots, they will turn your kids into Muslims one day.
Can we say that these white men are lazier than most because profs don't do much except repeat the same thing to every class they "teach" year in and year out?  Could we say that people like Herron want her race to get more of the "do nothing prof jobs" because they are also lazy?    Who knows what her objective was to post that on a blog.  All I Or most can see is that she is a racist screaming for more blacks in lazy prof positions.
Jimmy: If you want to support a person who is a PROFESSIONAL BLACK  RACIAL PLAINTIFF, that is your choice. I do NOT, and I believe she should be exposed for the lying, cunning, slick willy person she is..............Ooh Rah.........
NFL Negroes kneeling!
No, it's always about race from the media and liberals when they only take stories about black people killed in altercations with cops and make them viral.  Note a black Muslim immigrant shot up a white church and the media threw it into the memory hole as quickly as they could, while they prattled on FOR MONTHS about the legitimate shooting of Michael Brown, bashing cops and America in the process on a daily basis.  That's not an accident.
Charles have you shot your limit on racist pigs yet?   Instead of celebrating the death of a black man, we now celebrate the death of "whiteys".  After all, we have to get our revenge, do we not?   Have you disowned Nelson Mandela yet because he would not let black South Africans get revenge on "whitey"?
Nobody has explained it. It can't be explained for two reasons. First, the whole protest is based on a lie . Secondly, there is no study or FBI stats that back up anything they are saying. When 6% of the population is committing 50% of the violent crime, they are going to have more interaction with police. We don't have a social injustice problem, we have a black crime problem.
Exedus,  If Sessions goes who does Trump put in charge of gerrymandering? Who does Trump detail to make it harder for blacks and other minorities to vote?
The Black community is not immune from law enforcement, despite what they would like..
8 years ago the country was ready to consider and elect a black man as President...we just collectively made a bad choice and elected the wrong Black man....The country is again ready for change and consideration of electing a woman as president....like the black man 8 years ago the media is squarely behind the woman now....even though serious wrong doing attends the candidates....They seem willing to do anything to help cover up those crimes...Obama has certainly been the greatest disrespecter of the law in our history until Hillary came along...and took this disrespect to a new low with Obama's help..!!!  for all American voters, and especially Alaskan voters the Obama/Clinton crime families must be sent packing in November 2016...Trump is the only choice for all freedom loving Americans....especially Alaskans...
The ones using disproportionate force and on their own population are black "citizens" themselves..
White Amerika is that portion of the population who have expressed their hatred of Barrack Obama since he became President.  The expansion of White Supremacist groups since his election along with the huge quantities of gun sales well-documented throughout the media displayed the evil underbelly of the nation dedicated to everything Old South Confederacy including Battle Flags and intimidation of black citizens with open carry.  The Tea Party became a legitimized haven for all of the fascist elements within the nation allowed to express their hatred for Obama and all colors other than white.  Every gun publication and the NRA fed the old fears of mass revolution against white citizens led by Obama.  The Bundy crowd in Oregon and Nevada used armed threats to dare anyone to stop them.  Finally someone did.  The insane purchases of weapons and ammunition throughout the nation serves only the profiteers in the industry and puts all citizens at risk from these fascist pigs.
Why are there five black people torturing one skinny little pale person?   Were none of the other   white girls willing to lay hands on and listen to screams?  Agree the Asst. Coach is also culpable, and am wondering why the lawyer dude was also fingered.
"The amount of out of working Americans has never been bigger" Source? "the violence among black has never been worse" Source? "[Obama] created ISSI" I assume you meant ISIS?  Source?
We have the racists Filipinos who call themselves FBI (full blooded Iliconos), SOS (Sons of Samoa), the caucasians who have Irish blood, and the black guerrilla felons.
I find your facile comparison and equating of the lives of black baby boys with those of your filthy friggin' cats insulting in the extreme.  All the 7.2 million feral cats in North America along with the 50 million free-roaming 'owned' cats aren't worth one skin cell off one of MY 'black baby boys'--either my son or grandson.  Scratch a ha'ole 'animal welfare' cretin and a white supremacist pops out like pus from a boil.  That's why all these mewling simpletons shrieked and flailed when that great white dentist drilled 'See-So dw WYYON' but shrugged their shoulders in indifference when cops gunned down 1,500 of their human neighbors last year--mostly unarmed, disproportionately NOT white and in several cases children as young as six or seven.  Too many in my family lived under Jim Crow and knew EXACTLY what it was like to be held in less regard than a friggin' animal!  Make that indefensible, arrogant argument to someone else!
ok.  the pot has called the kettle black and the kettle has returned the favour.  this is silly, now shush, or no dessert, you two!
The problem with your argument, like those of this professor, is that they assume that all whites hold their positions only because of privilege, and that none of them actually earned or deserved anything that they have. Her comments like "by keeping your job and your other unearned privileges..." and "...you are the problem. Your very presence", are inherently racist and sexist, promoting the idea that white men are inherently undeserving simply by dint of their race and gender, and can never possibly deserve their positions, no matter their individual merit. It's clear from her rants that she favors only people exactly like her (she specifies giving up their positions in favor of minority women, not just minorities or women, because if you're a white woman or a black man, you still need to go to the back of the bus to give her your seat). As a non-white in academia, I simply don't see this as true. It's blatantly bigoted. If she's not getting ahead, she likely hasn't earned it.
Now suddenly you invoke crime data when you think it suits you. Cute. Blacks are 13% of the US population and commit over 50% of all murders per year, but you tell us we can't talk about it while you browbeat whites at the same time.
another black mark against united, somehow they don't like Asians.  well, I won't ever fly united again.  it is a piss poor airline with racists employees.
I guess if your IQ is about 65,you rule the world (see:Trump,Donald),and that includes the music industry.I couldn't care less about Taylor Swift (except that she shares her birthday,Dec.13,with Ferguson Jenkins,who happens to be my cousin),but I believe she's a bigoted,though (sort of)talented airhead who uses token women of colour in her "squad" to advance her brand and deflect likely well-deserved charges of prejudice. (I couldn't image her EVER having a black,Asian or First Nations boyfriend.She's essentially the Tammy Wynette of this generation.)
"if a guy came to our Jummah and started spewing hate and being violent, he would literally have 300 brown and black kids jump at him.” --- Yet no one did that when the PSDB faith advisor hosted an extremist guest last year.
How do you know the guy is black?
Your ignorance of black history in the south is amazing.   How many deaths and rapes of blacks would you need to  feel any degree of outrage for those preaching white supremacy.   Is 50 ok, but not 500?   And German Nazi are not uncommon nor the skinhead movement that they created.     I know you can read Out, surely you know this?  I'm happy to say that I hate racism.  I don't hate white people, I won't attack or kill a racist unless they presented an immediate danger to me or my family, (and that applies to any person, not just racist), like a car driving through a crowd for instance.  I never thought I'd see you as an apologist for racial bigotry.
Ms. Harrop, do you think your faux anger is really helpful?  How do you even know how someone else might have written a story about a pregnant, black, rural heroin addict???  You don't!  The actual point of your story about blaming her death on her living in a rural environment was actually interesting of and by itself!  So, just stick to the facts.  We, the readers, aren't as dumb as you may believe!
yes .............. the black are illegals  .................. the decendents of slaves
Richard, How about you do some actual first hand investigation? Go and drive around the streets of Hillbrow in Jo'burg and Central in Port Elizabeth. On any number of street corners, some black guy will whistle or gesticulate to you to try and initiate a drug deal, and nine times out of ten, he will be a Nigerian.  It must be the easiest arrest on the planet to arrange a simple sting operation and arrest these dealers, but the Police appear to do nothing.  The only logical conclusion that I can reach is that the Police are paid off.  Of course Zenophobia is to be deplored, and the country would hardly be any better off if the foreign drug merchants were replaced by local drug merchants, but whilst Mbaks is undoubtedly a clown and idiot, there are occsional grains of truth amongst all the chaff and effluent that spews from his mouth,
Yeah, how dare Kaepernick oppose "the pervasive evil of white cops killing black men"? He should be proud to be in a country where white cops kill unarmed black men (like him). He is wrong not to rejoice in a country where the president says that those who march with neo-Nazis and the KKK are "good people".
They are too busy having sex and giving beat downs on teens and black men.
Ask the Korean neighborhood in LA during the 1992 riots... or ask the black men in Ferguson MO protecting their white bosses convenience store during their riots if they would have preferred double barrel shotguns against angry mobs... you shouldn’t be so quick to curb anyone’s liberties. Tomorrow it may be your turn.
This is truly the worst of the worst, born and raised in Alaska (6th generation, with grandkids that are 8th), I have black, brown, and gay friends, because I choose the lesser of 2 evils I am now a racist? Your cheeks have to be a little red on this one Elise. I am truly embarrassed for you, maybe tomorrow you can write an article on the origination of the term "Super Presdator"? PATHETIC!
Racism is racism.The Globe and Mail editorial board has demonstrated their position is to uphold white privilege.  The history of editorial pieces demonstrates this without question.  A bunch of white guys in a board room do not get to decide what redress for violence against black students should be.  All racism is a form of violence.  I speak from personal experience.  So go ahead and enjoy the board room circle jerk dear editorial board.  We already have your number.
...and if it turns out to be a white guy who shot a black guy, then we will put it on the top of the DP for weeks, but if the shooter was a black guy then we will bury the story and you will never hear about it again.
"A terrific performance by the cops."  Thank you, Thomas Laird Twyford the second, who says "the real problem is black people performing badly."  I would suggest that as long as we have Twyfords reaching for the shallow side of the pond, rather than seeking possibly painful solutions, nothing at all will be done about the deplorable misery into which poor black families and their children have been condemned for life.  Speaking of life, have a good one, oblivious of the suffering of others, Thomas Laird Twyford the second.
Trump is just playing to his base. You know the deal.  Black celebrities can and admirably do bring racism to the public focus. Trump is playing to the bigoted idiots that liked his 7 years of "birther" horse excrement. He gets em all fired up over nothing, pretends he is all presidential, tweets his brains out. Next day its some other trivial attention seeking headline. Tired of winning already!
It's great that you can acknowledge the overabundance of black crime in America by trying to justify it.
If SOB to an NFL player is offensive, then lets talk the words to the music they, black players, listen to before, and after the game. Like kill cops, women, are b i iches, f this f that, f f f f f. In the week since Trump used SOB whats happen with the protests? Oh and by the way Colin Kappernick said " he couldn't stand for a flag or an Anthem, while bodies lie in the streets." The original protest, was about the flag and the Anthem.
Orange, as opposed to clown that is 1/3 black?
I had a call from one of these scammers about Microsoft windows. I did everything he told me to do & kept him on the line for 7 minutes plus. The only thing he didn't know was that my computer was in the other room & was not on. I played so dumb the caller started getting angry with me & I told him I didn't like that tone of voice, So if he keeps talking like that I'll hang up, he toned down his attitude & after talking a little while longer, he called an associate to take over. It went on & on (me playing dumb & him trying to scam me), he got so frustrated with me, he asked me if I was Black. That's when I told him what does race have to do with this? He finally hung up the phone & I thought how rude(NOT). They never called me back after that. Note: I am not black but Asian.
"To suggest it's black food is simply racist." Well I think that's what the fuss is about. As they had previously invited latino students over and served them tacos, they were trying to match the food with skin color. Collard greens and corn bread is what they picked for the black students. At least they didn't pick fried chicken and watermelons. Anyway, what they did isn't racist, just misguided. Likely all of the student groups would have been more comfortable without themed food.
"a surge that coincided with the election of the first black U.S. president"  Unless the author is accusing these people of racist behavior, why is this statement in the article? The author could have easily used Barack Obama's name instead of his preferred racial identity.  "...Jerad and Amanda Miller, killed two police officers and a civilian and also died in a Las Vegas shooting rampage."  Given that the article had just stated Soper had tried to get the Bundy group to leave the Refuge, and that Bundy and other leaders in fact had nothing to do with the Miller's actions in Las Vegas and would certainly have condemned them, making at least two significant points of separation, why is this statement in the article?  It appears these people are sensible, support the Constitution and family values, and have the widely held sense to distrust the government as did our founders. Does the reporter perhaps have an agenda to paint these folks as crazies? Why does the RG reprint this garbage?
I live in Bend, and many people were upset when 10 Barrel sold to AB. Two years later, they are still brewing right down the street from my house, employing locals. I had a Sinister Black just last night - just as delicious as ever!
When you have an organization which says "Black Lives Matter" whenever  police shootings are involved, how can the fact of the race of the dead person not be relevant enough to put in a headline?  Especially in a State where only 2.3% of the population is black and most of that population is in Portland?    Not mentioning the race of the alleged victim could be construed as white censorship.  As in: "We don't want people to know that white cops are killing black kids!"  Pick your headline and justify it.
Whites kill whites and blacks kill blacks more often - a function of being in closer proximity to each other.  Meaningful discussions are so much more possible when one presents the complete facts.
It sounds like this woman may be a white lady. These were black men killed and a black woman that he had to pretend he gave a fuck about so I would like to know the race of this woman. He still gets no brownie points with me....
The confederate flag was not a white supremacist flag you morons. It was the division of the country.  There was a North and South with both black and white on both sides.  Stop crying racist every time you don't like something. Go back to school and learn REAL history.  Am so sick of the race card. And just how does a flag make you feel unsafe?  The kid has as much right to to the first admendment as you do. Oh that's right it don't fit your agenda. Instead of whining and boo hooing you are oppressed, you have just as many rights to make something of your lives as us so called white supremists. In reality you have more resources to use than we do. Get off your soap boxes.
To be accurate he was half white and half black.
I wonder how I'd feel if I were a black person in Charlottesville reading your comment...
Hard to miss the rhetorical delirium enjoyed by so many writers@theGlobe (abetted by a cadre of “progressive” academics at masculinity-is-toxic.edu) in fanning the flames of male dread. The n-word is used mainly as metonymy in Fuck Finn (= black slave) but the book has become “toxic” in the minds of some because of its one famous use as metaphor (= inferior human). The same in reverse is the case with the insidious ways the m-word is deployed by angry feminists: powerful men are “garbage”; all men are powerful, by definition. Ergo…  It's imperative to take down "predators," not so to suggest, even semi-equivocally, that “rejecting masculinity” is key to being "fully human." You rarely read anything in the Globe that takes women to task for their part in the "semiotics" at play in the ways men negotiate "the spaces between archaic ideals and modern reality." It's true that the Globe employs Maggie Wente, who pleads for balance, but she's the lost-leader equivalent of NYT David Brooks.
That's what I'm talking about too, Mensa. Read the data if you must. Blacks are killed by other blacks at a higher percentage than whites are killed by other whites. Let me repeat-Black on black homicide was about 90% in 2015, compared to 81% for whites.  Are you slow?
Demographics would like to differ and tv ratings. Majority of blacks, Chinese, Jews and Flippinos prefer Basketball. These groups combined together represent a powerful force in demographics and  finance.
You are a liar. I have made no declarative statement that black people should be gunned down. You are projecting your own hate on me. Never denied profiling, but you are profiling me with your false statements in your post or you're just dishonest. The officer was not charged. Do you have evidence he should have been ?  Did you read his report. He was asked him three times not to grab his gun. Police are not going to wait til he shoots them to protect themselves. If the guy would have followed simple instructions , he would be alive.
"We reserve the right to refuse service to ..." Blacks, Jews, Irish, gays, Catholics. That what you mean?  The right of the private owner to practice discrimination is a bogus "right".   The government has always defined the rights of citizens. It's one of the things that governments do.
As usual Wavemaker rants of racism but where is her complaint about the DOJ civil rights leader Vanita Gupta formerly of the ACLU appointed by perjuring Holder, who prepared this report while her unit was accused by a Federal judge of falsification of evidence in another police case? Then we have Mayor Rewlings/Blake who hired Anthony Batts from California in  spite of his 4 charges of domestic violence there to be the Baltimore chief of police. Then after the riots she fired him. Recall the riots where Rawlings/ Blake ordered the police to stand down so the black rioters could "riot"?  Then back to Batts and his police department staffed with 45% black officers, in Baltimore where the ratio is 64.3% black . So the racist black cops are arresting too many black criminals in a town run by Democrats and blacks for 30 years? And the DOJ calls it racism?
Yeah right. His years of birtherism wasn't racialy motivated! Snort. And his hobnobing with Bannon and David Duke were just friendly chats. And his discriminatory actions start in 1973, when the United States Department of Justice went to court with a discrimination complaint against the Trump family business, which rented apartments across Brooklyn and Queens. Next in the Trump record on race came a 1991 book by John O’Donnell, who had been president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. O’Donnell quoted Trump saying,“ Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys wearing yarmulkes… Those are the only kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else…Besides that, I tell you something else. I think that’s guy’s lazy. And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. In other words, Tyrone, you are wrong. Trump is a proud bigot.
Blacks and hispanics are more fat than white people? You can't say that. It's RACIST. You need to change the chart to show more diversity. Yeah yeah I know, it would show false information, but being diverse and accepting gravity challanged people as they are, is more important than the truth. Show some sensitivity!!!
Let the  aging American   baby boomers watch these  melodramas chronicling  their  draft-dodging days rather than recall their  real life selfish contentment with letting  black ghetto kids go to Vietnam while they oozed   Clintonesque  hypocrisy and duplicity. Canadian branch plant yuppies-in-training  just  safely  soaked in the stuff from north of the border
NO! HE WANTS OUT OF JAIL!!! DENY THAT POS ANYTHING HE WANTS!!! MAKE HIM WAKE UP EVERY DAY UNTIL HE IS 90 AND DIES IN JAIL!!! SOLITARY CONFINEMENT!!! BREAD AND WATER ONLY!!!!  A BIBLE THAT TELLS HIM JESUS WAS A BLACK OR DARK SKINNED MAN!!!
You do not say WHY "we need new black firms to take over" leaving the impression that you are racist.  You also ignore that the CEO at the time, Moses Kgosana , IS black.  It is you who are linking race to integrity.    Pikoli, Madonsela, Khosa and Motsisi are black, but so too are JZ783, Gigaba, Selebi and the majority of the perfectly corrupt ZANC.   So what?  We need honest people in government, in the professions (including auditing), in business, in politics and in general.  Full stop.    The ZANC just does not make it.
And this kind of gross generalization doesn't help at all.   I can only guess that you watch only Fox News.   In my especially broad reading of the "institutional white media" I encountered quite a few black analysts and commentators, as well as rational, aware white authors.  -- Paul
Bigots huh,  tell me something,  by stating the obvious that most crime in Alaska or in fact the US in general is committed by blacks or other non whites,  by stating the obvious you liberals like to hand a name like bigots or racist on any one that disagrees with them,  shameful
Again, typical hateful double standard clueless liberal!!  So what where you live!!  That doesn't mean you even came close to experiencing anything like what many hard working, taxpaying, law bidding blacks live with.  Because whether your hateful butt is in or leaves  the neighborhood, your not black!!  Get it clueless!! No you don't because you're all knowing, all feeling, etc, etc.  Pls don't point out individual cases of people you know behaving as responsible citizens.  They should, all of them!!  And your friend is right, it should be between them and Allah; but either you're clueless enough to believe the majority feels that way, or you're a liar??  See in Islam, lying is expected and accepted to further the spread of the religion.  Guess you base your life and ideals on that, with the BS you're peddling!!
As bad as this story is, and it is bad, I find something very interesting.  ADN has buried it, and I truly wonder why that is?  Actually, to be truthful, I know EXACTLY why that is.  The fact that the officer that shot the young man, and the young man himself belonged to the same demographic, and not only that, they knew each other.  So, ADN, obviously black lives do not matter UNLESS said lives are taken by a white individual, especially a Law Enforcement Officer of said race.  Why is this not upon your own front page within HUGE letters, as, as slaves of the Washington Post you seem, nay, actually do so often?  This young man was shot and killed by a police officer, and has sparked many a riot and destruction within the community.  Why is the story buried, ADN?  Have you no dignity?  Have you no independence?  Have you no respect?  Apparently not, because you, ADN, and so many of your own compatriots within the Liberal\Marxist ideology care only about one thing.  Votes.  Bastards.
My feelings are not "astonishingly sensitive" and why should I or anyone else forget it?  Suppose a white entertainer got paid extremely well to come to college campuses to insult black Muslims.  Would you and your fellow progressive trolls be calling the feelings of black Muslims "astonishingly sensitive" and wonder why they just didn't "forget it?"  Gregory was a black racist who was paid handsomely for being a bigot;  you and the politically-correct progressives think that is wonderful.  You and your leftist pals are similar to racist, right-wing scum in your methods and extremism.    Radical, violent extremists from both the left and the right need to be purged from American society.
Or drive the speed limit, or serve black people at your lunch counter, or not sell meth to school children, or wait for permission to immigrate.    The America you believe in is a ridiculous and juvenile fantasy.  You should read up a little on the idea of the social contract.
Pitts ,you are the pitts,dumbo..a negro will never be happy less whites give 'em every thing their wittle hearts desire
He said this after he threw a serving glass at a titty bar at the bartender?  Nice!  He's too black oops dumb to know never burn a bridge especially in the NFL.  It's a business numb digger!
Keyboard lefty on another anti- American rant.  Hey lefty, put this in your meth pipe and smoke it:  Liberal checklist: Let the criminals out. Let illegals in. Mainstream media 100% gospel. Let boys in the girls bathrooms. Condemn police officers. Don't care about the veterans. Eradicate history if offensive. Believe Healthcare is a Constitutional right. Kill the unborn-Stomp on and burn the American flag. Accept barbarity in the name of Islam- hugs,love and no borders will stop terrorism. Protect the Sanctuary cities. Black lives only matter. Coddle the lazy. Encourage hate crimes.  Call for the assassination of our president, talk of overthrowing our government. Burn businesses, attack innocent bystanders, destroy City property, call for, and try to incite a civil war. Refuse freedom of speech on others, while demanding their own political and government obstructionists.
Your a fucking racist I’m sure. Judge a book by its cover. That dude is actually a really good dad and did everything for his kids. He held down a job always. Unlike a lot of people I know. Don’t be so judgemental when all you see is a black male with tattoos. Racism is real and people like you and comments like these that make America so ungreat you fuck head!!
You're right! Take to the streetss!! I heard Rachel Maddow say that Trump is going to Repeal the 13th & 14th Amendments by EO and allow slavery again. Or maybe he was going to Deport Blacks and make Slaves out of judges? Either way, he's evil. (try reading the article buttercup)
Yeah, let's whine about someone's socks in the NFL while having no problem and arguing for the right for one of its franchises to keep a Native America as their logo and to be called the Redskins (hypocrite much?).  So what if he wants to wear a Fidel Castro shirt, when you actually use your brain you can see there is no difference between that or wearing a George Washington or other founding father t- shirt as they oppressed blacks and others (the Constitution originally had blacks at 3/5ths a man), which I am sure you would have no problem with.   He is upset at police officers abuse of citizens, specifically blacks.  Google police excessive force and stop closing your eyes to the issue.  He has every right to protest on this issue.   He had a platform and chose to use it during the anthem, not the game.   The reason why he is having a problem finding a new job is that because of whiney white people like you like to ride the wave of fake patriotism.   Get off your imaginary high-hor
You think it was white voters who handed the DA all those metros last year ? That was from a massive growth in the black vote. You want to go back to a party who can ONLY win ONE city and ONE province - and even in THAT province they don't do it with the white vote, they do it because they have, for years, had the bulk of the coloured vote (as did the NNP before them). Nowhere else is there a demographic where they can remain in power, let alone grow, unless they can get black votes. Just 2 years ago - it seemed impossible for the DA to win anything in the north except (very white) Midvaal.   They're black support has grown a great deal since then - and they need to keep doing that. To be a viable opposition party requires having an actual chance at winning, to do that they need black votes - lots of black votes. And while they may lose some (perhaps many) racist white votes if they stop entertaining racists - they'll not only gain black votes - they will gain mine.
So take your Nazi salutes and your Confederate flags and your endless juvenile attempts at bogus equivalency insert them up your malodorous fundament as far as they will go. The responsibility for the 800,000 lives lost In the Civil War definitely does not rest with black people. Lincoln should have hanged Robert E. Lee.
Black Lives Matter means just that... that black lives do, indeed, matter. Why is that even controversial to you? You think they don't matter?  The name was derived because 400 years of white supremacist anti-black behavior by a large swath of the majority white America has proven without a shadow of a doubt that many do NOT value black lives. 3/5ths clause for starters. Current neo-Nazi and klan rallies for current perspective. If you don't see racism, you have the luxury of not having to pay attention to it. Black Americans don't have that luxury.  How ironic that on a thread about Trump caping for the KKK and neo-Nazis, your take-away is how "racist" the simple, straightforward non-exclusionary phrase, "Black Lives Matter" is. It doesn't state that 'black lives matter MORE'. Or 'ONLY black lives matter'. Nope, just "black lives matter".   Eliminating the concept of race is a nice goal for the future, but not feasible when racism is so prevalent. I remind you we have a nazi problem.
Why not use this quote instead, CM?  "In 1955, Mr. Buckley started National Review as voice for “the disciples of truth, who defend the organic moral order” with a $100,000 gift from his father and $290,000 from outside donors. The first issue, which came out in November, claimed the publication “stands athwart history yelling Stop.”  It proved it by lining up squarely behind Southern segregationists, saying Southern whites had the right to impose their ideas on blacks who were as yet culturally and politically inferior to them. After some conservatives objected, Mr. Buckley suggested instead that both uneducated whites and blacks should be denied the vote."   https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/business/media/27cnd-buckley.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share NYTimes: William F. Buckley Jr. Is Dead at 82
Violence may well start when someone calls another *fag.  Name calling is not meant as endearment. Calling a guy afag is not to promote positive intetaction. The fact is thatfag and a few other choice references to gay sex are intended as put-downs. Should we go along in our ignorant bliss because that's what we learned, we may as well go back to the terms of endearment for blacks, Germans, Jews, Japanese and Chinese. I find you to be a tiresome asole and I say that with the utmost admiration, obviously.
Five police officers in Dallas were murdered by a (Black Lies Murder) supporter so it is true they are a radical racist terrorist group. In addition the Soros sponsored Antifai are just as disgusting as the White Nationalist, KKK and Neonazais  As for you statement regarding BLM it was all started and based on the "Hands Up Don't Shoot" lie that was promoted by the Micheal Brown shooting.
what about racial profiling involving blacks?  this does not involve federal law, but may local police do stop blacks for no good reason, other than they are black and look suspicious to them.  proponents of profiling say that it is necessary to determining who might be a threat, to prevent a crime or violence before it starts.  if such profiling is based on color or race, especially one type of race, is it constitutional?
You mean they shouldn't be black and if they are, they should stay in their place, be humble and mumble, be servile and apologize for existing. How about that black guy killed in his car at the gas station in front of his girl friend for doing nothing?  What could he have done?  Maybe you think all blacks should wear white face and if they don't, it is their fault if they get racially profiled for DWB or wearing a hoodie and killed.  Is that it?
I also want to leave another comment in hopes that at least one person that is responsible for burning our flag reads this. First, you have no idea the tears, sweat, and blood that our four fathers put into defending this soil that your unappreciative self dwells upon. The freedom you have is because of that flag! You wanna scream gay rights or black rights and disrespect the president on his big day? That's spitting in the faces of all of the men that has fought for this country and made your lavish way of life possible. Do you know that in many other countries in this world would kill you for being gay and that you wouldn't have a right to speak out against the government. You would be beheaded, stoned, or imprisoned for life for burning a flag. That's just something for you to think about the next time you decide to riot and burn flags. Go spend a couple weeks somewhere else in this world, you'll come back kissing the dirt of the USA! It's to bad you understand that.
just mirroring what the Re-Bumpkins did for 8 years while someone black was governing.
Boots>  Not being truthful!!!!  This is a PHONY issue, where have you been lately???  The truth of the matter is that these ignorant NFL players (mostly black players) are using a sports event as their platform to display their political issues.  People pay good money to see a good sporting event, not the players political issues or protests.  POTUS put the finger up their bu**s, and they don't like it, typical spoiled crybabies, that they are!!!!  Also, no one person can pass legislation in our government, am I correct????  Well, if the congress won't do their job that they're being paid to do, then their pay should be docked for non-performance of their SWORN DUTY!!!!  Shameful of congress and you!!!!
He would be dead if he was black
As a black woman, she gets 12 strikes.
You are correct. If abortions were only being done by black women, there wouldn't be so many single black mothers with children who  have so many different fathers!
"make it harder for blacks and other minorities to vote"  by that I take it you mean illegal immigrants?  seriously guy take off the tinfoil
This silly smiling halfwit needs to face some basic truth. First, her appearance suggests her ancestors probably were brought out of Africa as slaves. This has given her hug advantages. Sub saharan Africa had no written language, no buildings more than one story high, and the only real wealth was the number of slaves. Often everyone was 'owned' by whatever potentate held power. They welcomed Europeans with goods to exchange for slaves. Slaves were originally brought from Africa because religious leaders in the civilized world thought it morally wrong to 'enslave' primitive humans found in the 'new' world and on the Hawaiian islands. It was acceptable to purchase those already enslaved by their own people. If this professor's ancestors had not been brought out of Africa it is most unlikely that she would be a professor. It was white people who ended slavery, over the strong objections of black Africans. She has no gratitude.
By not mentioning the race of the cops in question using undue force on helpless black people  it is assumed all the bad cops are white.
Bunk.  There are plenty of blacks living the dream.  Legally.  And there are plenty of whites in poverty living legally.  Young black males need to pull their pants up, buy a belt, get a job and get their poo together.
FBI has a reputation of policing themselves. Good for them. If they don't, then nobody will (except the Justice Department which is what is happening with the Russian-Trump angle. Called independent counsel. Read the newspapers every day. This may be historical). Finicum probably got what he wanted. Martyrdom. Just like a lot of cop-on-black shootings. Lose the cop murder rap but reap millions in big bucks. Now blacks gonna dare cops to shoot them if they can get rich. Just make foolish false moves.
Do you actually want the media to ignore what the President says?  Do you also want the media to ignore criminal wrong-doing by Presidents?  Why do you find ignorant and hate-filled messages, whether in tweets or speeches, to be a media-created problem rather than something to be reported and exposed to the 'light of day'?   Would you say that the real problem with the lynching of blacks in America during the 20th century was simply the media reporting those crimes?  It appears you simply want to turn a blind-eye to repulsive, and often anti-Christian, rhetoric by politicians you support.
I know African-Americans who have been pulled over for the crime of "driving while black". Every time, nothing happened to the cop.
These were screaming, raging, angry white men with torches, they surrounded a black Church and were going thru town rampaging against PoC. If brave, good people DIDN'T stand up to the terror these white supremacists were inciting, WHAT MORE VIOLENCE would the racists have inflicted!  Of course Trump defends his fellow white supremacists, is anyone surprised. He's a racist, bigoted hatemonger, plain & simple. He's a disgrace.
No, the GOP in Colorado clear back then was headed towards the conservative side.  And KKK in Colorado, was NOT about racism , but about being against Catholics and Jews, not blacks.  Sadly, Conservatives likes yourself, have a LONG history of hate and going after others. Look at how your leader trump is going after muslim refugees even though 100% of evidence is that he will not pick up a SINGLE terrorists.   As to the klan in the south, it was almost always about blacks.
One polite black President seems to be smarter than the entire GOP, they voted 60 odd times to repeal maybe they should have proposed ways to fix the problems instead of grandstanding to idiots. The ACA and multiple GOP/Russian investigations as well as dodging the tar and feather crowds seem to be taking up a lot of time can this be called "a total lack of competent leadership"?  We could give them credit for allowing big coal to ruin streams, doing away with Dodd Frank so Banks can defraud the masses, getting rid of the Consumer Protection folks so if your stove explodes your house it's your fault since stoves don't kill people, you plugged it in wrong. Probably the worst is the GOP's insistence that trickle down economics works in the face of a continuing slide into poverty of working folks and the accumulation of wealth by the 1% and corporatio
You need read more. Little hands has been a racist for quite a while. Check out how he treated his black employees at his casinos. Or how he went after Native Americans who wanted to open a casino. This is not new for him.
Your true agenda is that superiority attitude I see among "Christian" white males  What is that "Traditional value", was it whites live here and blacks live there.  Was it I'm a Christian and your a Muslim, and your religion isn't REALLY a religion.  Was it I'm not gay so I'm better than you, and if your gay your a sinner? Your superior attitude was tried by a country called Germany.  Didn't work.
OJ made history by being the 1st black man that was involved in the death of a white woman, that bought his way out of a death sentence by hiring a dream team of lawyers. That ability had only been a white privilege before him.
Jules Bailey would have us overlook his church's discriminatory policies simply because he says he disagrees with them.  And anyway, "we're family", as if it's just his crazy Uncle Imago Dei in the attic.  Mr. Baily's religion is his private business.  Nonetheless, as a candidate "running to be a mayor for everybody", the organizations he chooses to join are a very valid indicator of his beliefs and values.  (Jules, there are hundreds of churches which do not deny civil rights to the LBGT community.  Did you even look?)  Portlanders care deeply when a mayoral candidate chooses to join an organization which denies civil rights to any group.  What if Mr. Bailey chose to join an organization which denied civil rights to blacks?  Women? Moslems?   As they say, Mr. Bailey, "you can choose your friends but you can't choose your family." In this case, you have chosen to affiliate yourself with "family" which denies the LBGT community full civil rights. Portland voters will not overlook this.
I'm sure my Korean Step-daughter, my Hispanic grandson-in-law, my Black former brother-in-law, my Chinese brother-in-law, my black buddy on the PD, who I'd come in early and ride with him half his shift, and he'd stay over and ride with me, half my shift, who I would CERTAINLY have never doubted he'd have my back in ANY circumstance (as he knew I had his)...I'm sure they ALL, and other in my life of various races, ethnicities, etc. are Soooooooooo happy that I have finally been uncovered as a racist.   You, sir, are an ignorant ass.  A left wing loon who can't debate on the facts, the truth, or common sense.  Who's only recourse is to project their OWN labels at others.  Perhaps you should read some history of left wing ideologies...that's where the RACISM, the hate, the scorn for others, etc. is always found.   Go on a diet!
the thing Mr Trump 'Donald Duck ' Trump is using the Muslim as a crock to keep the other parties at bay but he has now crossed the line and need to be put in his place fast or the United States will lose business from most other countries,  the thing is he is focusing on the wrong group and he and his party the republican will feel the backlash sooner then later if he keep on pushing the Muslim ban from 7 countries there are more broader group then than that involved in ISIS there are white kids from rich countries like Great Britain   United States and of course Russia and black and hispanic kids from spain and of course from India and China also from Australia and Africa and last but not least from New Zealand, Filipina too,  all kids are radicalized by imams in those region and countries to fight the evil Americans his ban is a little narrow in scope and is going to heart the United States over the long hall.
"They talk about solidarity and the inclusion of people who are brown and black, Muslim, native, LGBTQIA (the I and A “visibilizes” intersex and asexual individuals), disabled and those of diverse faiths"  The above smacks of the exclusion of white women. Those are not 'cool'. What a horrible article!
Obama is too busy spending money to influence the election in Israel.  Why would he spend money helping his country when he can illegally do what he wants without the stoneless repubs doing anything because he is black.
What's wrong with the dark side? Are they never satisfied? She's a Senator for God's sake. Work for all people, not only black. She is very racist.
I think we are reading different stories. My reading is, white chick gets drunk, has consensual sex with black kids, feels shamed by that....days later (remember...she went to breakfast with them, stone cold sober, the next day), files complaints, and the Lilly white University of Oregon helps destroy the lives of these young men for being "colored". The black kids file suit for being destroyed and an Oregon alt lib judge seems to think that's not good enough grounds for a case.  If the Nineth Circuit doesn't overrule this decision, there is something seriously wrong.
I was living in house with 2 other people, one who was a black university student. One day the front of the house was painted with N......R, KKK, WHITE POWER, N....R GO HOME and swastikas. As it turned out, the graffiti was painted by a black friend of my roommate who was a Ryerson sociology student. My roommate forced him to apologize  for the damage and trauma he caused us all. However, he finished it with "You white folks have no a sense humour". Was that not a hate crime?  I think it was, but  I was not permitted to report it, which skews racist hate crime stats.
"rather than be subjected to the double piercing of oppression: on the one hand from the democratically elected government and on the other from farm owners (a discussion for another day)." How exactly do farm owners oppress the local people? These people do not live on their farms so the farmers have no control over them. This is pure race baiting and basically trying to encourage black people to kill white people as their "Oppressors"
Rap is not music.  It is for people that can't carry a tune.  Good riddance to all rap.  The only reason all the media is carrying on about it is because the rappers are black and the media caves to blacks at every conflict.
How would vulnerability express itself in the real world? Would the most vulnerable not be the most common victims? If a poor black man is more vulnerable to murder then a rich white man, would we not expect more poor black men to be victims of murder?
Again, Trump was already a proven racist before he was elected. What would you call someone who refused to rent his properties to blacks? And now there can be no doubt that he is a white supremacist, since he is giving political cover to Nazis and KKK and being praised and thanked by them for doing so.  Anyone who supports Trump in light of the above, is also a racist. If you stand with Nazis, you are a Nazi sympathizer, pretty simple.  Name one time in history when ignoring racism stopped or diminished it's effects in society?   I haven't said anything about antifa, so I'm not going to address your pathetic attempt to deflect.
Trump voters are too ignorant to follow the money. They think poor black and brown people have the money. Trump loves "poorly educated" white folks. He can count on them voting against their interests as long as they think minorities will suffer more.
Carding is a violation of the Charter. Stop targeting the black community.
The black athletes (and tag-a-long whites) are deliberately insulting patriotic Americans by kneeing during the Anthem - aiming it at white people specifically. They know it. Its intentional... But what is the crux of their argument for the knee? Social justice? Police brutality? Equal in all things to white people?  If these rich, mega-millionaire black athletes really want to help blacks...they would move out of their million dollar mansions and build a mansion in the black community and spend  their $$$ there. None of them will do that - they all prefer the WHITE community. That make his whole thing FAKE.
Im not sure if people are being willfully ignorant or if their experiences differ vastly from my own and my spouses. I am a Black Woman and I have started a Family with a White Man and we are madly in Love and have always been. Yes we enrich each others lives in so many ways but there are challenges and they have the potential to negatively affect our union. As a White Man it can be extremely maddening that there are parts of my existence and Identity I simply can not discuss with him as he CAN NOT identify with, understand or feel my plight as a WOC. It is extremely frustrating that there are parts of who I am that simply don't resonate with him in any way at all. If you all want to trivialize that challenge that many IR couples face, as someone on this post commented on as well, then you are all clearly in denial. Talking about race relations, differences and challenges should not be taboo in any relationship as they are an intimate part of our identities in many capacities. Wake up
Just like being black makes you an AFRICAN American?  Last time i checked, people of color come from all over the word.  I LOVE it when the LIBERAL FINGER OF ACCUSATION points at me and my heritage.  Shows your own ignorance.  Boy.
But these are the guys doing the heavy lifting in keeping sex offenders in check in prison. Surely, Republicans can see that they need white supremacists. I mean, the cops can't keep blacks down all on their own. No, they need to partner up with like-minded folks.
That, to me, is a a viciously racist statement, and why I consider BLM to be racist.  If, in recent times, American whites, in general, thought black lives don't matter, then whites in general would have tried killed blacks without remorse, and harm them whenever possible.
Lot's of blacks and browns.  Failed people.  From failed countries.  Continue to fail and always will.
Then BLM will pipe in with: "We have to take away all of the cops, because they killed a black person trying to kill white people with a car and a knife."
No more than the animal abusing, spouse-abusing, steroid-using, overpaid, overindulged atheletes who take a knee during the national anthem to "protest" how blacks are treated in the country.
run dmc's song is so appropriate here........."nigga wonda why nigga gotta die"
I always hated, a white man impersonating an Asian man, or a white man impersonating a black man, in the old B&W movies.  It was somewhat of an insult.  What is wrong, with a Hawaiian, acting as a Hawaiian King?  This is the 21st Century.  Or, has political correctness, taken on a new definition?  Should there be, a white man acting the part of Dr. Martin Luther King?
Imagine the Media outrage if this passenger had been black!
Plus they have given a firm two fingers up to the Black murders in the US, Chicago alone has 50 to 60 Blacks murdered a month (just imagine equals one Las Vegas every month) and no one cares. In a majority of Democratic run cities in the US Black murder rates are like Chicago high and there is zero kneeling by some of the highest paid, spoilt athletes in the world.
The KKK and neo-Nazis just rallied in Virginia under the banner of Unite the Right. The Republican president is in lockstep with neo-Nazis and the KKK on the issue of venerating generals and politicians from the traitorous, white supremacist, anti-black Confederacy.  Who would have guess a man named Donald Trump who was busted by two different Departments of Justice for repeatedly committing illegal anti-black housing discrimination would turn out to align and defend KKK and neo-Nazis and their ideals. The segregationist real estate mogul is the hero of the segregationist movement. What a surprise.
He was shot by a black cop, please do some research not everything in this world is based on race.
Allie the illegal from the Mandan village is no different than the illegals from south of the US border whom hate black people.
You are partly correct. Reagan began his 1980 campaign in Philadelphia, Mississippi. This was where the KKK and some law enforcement officers murdered three people who were registering blacks to vote and buried them in an earthen dam. Bush Senior's campaign did use the Willie Horton ads as anti-black dog-whistles to energize their campaign. But the first Republican to use a "southern strategy"  to move Dixiecrats from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party was Richard Nixon in 1968.  That only leads us up to today. Drumpf has refused to reject the support of David Duke, former grand wizard of the KKK. He also has refused to reject the support of American neo-Nazis...in fact, one of his campaign tweets was a retweet of a poster from a neo-Nazi site. If you lie down with dogs...or neo-Nazis or the KKK...then you will wind up with fleas or become known as a bigot and a racist. And I am not even mentioning his attacks on almost all Mexicans as rapists and thieves.
I would take Pitts more seriously if, just once in a while, he would pontificate on something other than the poor downtrodden black gangster...er sorry I meant black victims. Unfortunately that is something he cannot do.
Hispanic 10 points under a majority, whites sixteen points above a majority. How could the demographics be any more favorable for a sadistic bigoted creep like Sheriff Joe?. So racial profiling isn't a crime, and a lot of white people (very old ones from somewhere else, who live in restricted communities or otherwise segregated neighborhoods) like the idea of stopping dark-skinned people and hauling them in for investigation and holding on bogus charges as intimidation. I'm certain you can figure that one out.  So hey, you imply that the response to criminal activity is an injunction? Look, I know you are capable of, and immensely enjoy, inflating BS balloons all afternoon. Also, you love to denigrate people not like yourself. Just be aware, I'm not the only one who can see through your transparent brain.
Look closely at the comments in this page.  How does this comment get rated below civility standards?  This appears to be just another way to science other opinions.  "There are multiple black organizations that want a black nation. Would you have the same vitriol for them? I choose to ignore them. These groups are no real threat. If they become a threat the authorities can deal with it. Vigilante justice isn't appropriate just because you sympathize with it. Tolerance isn't just accepting people you agree with or feel sorry for."
Sylvia's mother was frightened by a Negro when she was in the womb.
Well, since you only seem to have disqualified the ones you know about, I'll present another opportunity for you to move the goalposts once again:  “I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. Those are the kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else. . . . Besides that, I’ve got to tell you something else. I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is; I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.”  Donald J. Trump, some time between having built his Atlantic City Casinos and going bankrupt... but several years before he called for the death penalty in a rape case involving several black children (who were later exonerated, to whom he never apologized).
All I am saying is that your 'target acquisition system' malfunctioned.  You want to kill the people  who weren't involved and are trying to atone for the mess of others instead of the low-life scum-sucking dogs (to give them the benefit of the doubt) who actually made the mess.    You 'knee jerked' because they were frat rats.  It's sort of like saying 'all blacks',  'all women'.  You are saying 'all Frats' are evil just because they are frats even when they weren't involved.
I see the 'sanctuary city/county/college' "don't tell about the criminals here because they are Hispanics" paradigm as having a similar result to the refusal of blacks and Hispanics in high crime areas refusal to "tell about the criminals" in their neighborhoods.  In both cases, other people become victims of the same criminals already identified as being dangerous.  The liberals aren't the potential victims, of course, so they are safe.  When that three-time deportee and four-time felon attacks a U of O student, then a change might occur.  Until then, the blinders are on.  Or maybe it will be ignored as just being 'anecdotal' evidence!  Or justified because it's the victim's fault.
As someone who supports the president I find your comment about the KKK laughable as your ignorance on the subject.  It was the Democrats who supported the KKK, it was Democratic governors who would not allow blacks in the white schools.  Robert Byrd a Democrat Senator from West Virginia was a grand cleagle of the Klan. As far as Mr James another ignorant  democrat
Racist ? yes, you certainly are carpa.  No one brought racism into this argument until you brought it up . Why do rump and kelly keep LYING about offending a Gold Star widow? Absolutely disgusting the way kelly brought his deceased son into the argument to give bonafides to his Blatant LIES? Talk about politicizing the death of a soldier, kelly apparently has no bottom to his barrel or any moral turpitude. How blind do you have to be to defend a Lying draft dodger ? Do you think bringing racism into the argument will help people ignore the truth that rump doesn't care about soldiers black or white? ..≥.Can rump tell a LIE so big, that even you won't swallow it?
Because Thor likes to throw black people into the conversation whenever he can.
Ted Stevens, because there were blacks on his jury, got Colin Powell to be a character witness. You'll remember Powell:  He was the one who lied to the Security Council for 45 minutes in an attempt to get them to support the invasion and occupation of Iraq to cover for his bosses' ineptitude in allowing 9/11 to happen.
There is no racist stink from the Democratic Party, so it must be yourself that you smell. The racists formerly called Dixiecrats were all Southern racist bigots, and we gave them all to the Republican Party 50 years ago. If, on your deathbed, you still smell the stink of racial bigotry, you will know for certain it emanates from you. Every one of your posts that doesn't insult a particular forum liberal, insults the black race. Don't think everyone hasn't noticed that stench of hatred emanating from GBA.
Harry Reid predicted that Barack Hussein Obama could become the country's first black president because "he was light skinned and had no negro dialect unless he wanted to have one."  Yah.  That Harry Reid.
Yep.  Watch out for all that 'black crime', ladies and gentlemen.  That way you won't notice that 70% of serial killers, 80-90% of mass-shooters and child molesters are white.
Of course he would say "he knew what he signed up for"...to the black family's dead solider...but not to the white families.
Let's assume that the Michael Brown shooting was 100% legitimate. According to your theory, that proves that slavery didn't happen, that all cop shootings of blacks are legitimate, that Rodney King was not wrongfully beaten by cops, and that no black has ever been racially profiled by police. You're simple, which is why you're a Republican.
"Jewish greed isn't something  Jews do; it's something they have whether they like it or not. I'm Jewish, and I don't like it; I don't think it's fair, but I still know I have it..."  "Black violence isn't something Black people do; it's something they have whether they like it or not. I'm Black, and I don't like it; I don't think it's fair, but I still know I have it..."  Do you get it, now?
The reality is, who ran the black slave trade? The whites? Hardly.  Who owned all the boats? Who introduced abortion, crime, aids , drugs into black communities? Whites? Think again  Why did Israel deport 70K black Hebrews? Some say the real Hebrews are the black Americans.  Blacks aren't thugs, gangsters, criminals, and whites aren't against them.  In fact I would say we embrace black culture.  Blessed to have known great blacks, funny, great musicians and there is something magical about a Black Christian women, child, God's children.    But then who are the Devil's children?  Black brothers, the worst thing possible is a divide and conquer strategy.  I don't like Islam per se, but a know a lot of Muslims who are great as well and they have had their countries destroyed for the Greater Project for Zion.    9/11, the catalyst, whatever happened to the 5 dancing Israelis?  Who really hates America? USS Liberty? Who owns the Federal Reserve? The corrupt biased Media? The Devil is here
Death is too good for him. Leave him in a jail cell with the biggest, baddest black m.....f!
"Diversity" is just  a code-word for ANTI-WHITE, especially ANTI-WHITE MALE. Nobody ever says the NBA or NFL are not "diverse enough" or have too many blacks. Why does Canada take in an absurdly high 300,000 immigrants a year??!! That is a ridiculously high figure. We should be taking in a maximum of 50-60,000 tops.  And why so many from the third world? Easy votes for the Liberal party perhaps?
You know racism occurs on both sides, don't forget BLM or black panthers, oh that's right, it's not PC at this time, just white shaming.
Slavery is a far outcry, nay, a far more serious tragedy in this country than merely not baking cakes for someone entering in a gay marriage. That was a preposterous statement/claim to even compare the to. White racist savage landlords ruthlessly challenging the lives of people's having come from or descended from persons from the Africa Continent is barbaric. Refusing to make cakes, is not.
Heck with it. Just turn everything over to the government to run. With the government in charge everyone will be equal. Every one work the same hours, same pay same color house can't be white,black or red or yellow or any color that is offensive to someone somewhere. Except government management they because of the work required of them to make sure the rest of us follow their rules will be paid at a much higher rate. Intelligent people need to round up these fools and ship them to the say north korea they would fit right in.
This also clearly adds to Trump's racist, white supremacist pedigree.    Some of the people marching under NAZI flags in Charlottesville (all white) were apparently "fine people".  A part black guy, and other black guys, making what are actually a completely legal protest, albeit portrayed and communicated during the ritual of the singing of the US national anthem, is a/are SOB(s).  Trump is co-opting as well as linking the concept of Patriotism to White Supremacy.  Lot's of people do acts that openly "disrespect", and sometimes defiile the flag (as others point out, a constitutionally protected act),  Like, for instance, the Nazis in Charlottesville (including the "fine people" amongst them) who waived swastika flags in lieu of American Flags.  Trump chose the SOB moniker for blacks.    He's a racist, White Supremacist.  No doubt about it.
Donnie Two Scoops doesn't care. And he doesn't care what is in it. He won't read it or understand it.     He just wants to sign something so he can declare victory over the black guy, since he is a racist dirt bag.
And it turns out that Obama's ancestors were slave traders. The Obama's are black Arabs, not African Americans
Right. Because they bring all of their problems on themselves. Now white people are the REAL victims. Right? Must be rough being a victim of black people’s “perpetual victim hood.”
ROI on blacks and browns are an immediate loss!
It's like the pot calling the kettle black.  They all should face criminal charges.  The money is gone with nothing to show.  Oracle bears some responsibility for the failure, but the state should bear the biggest part of it.  To me, it was the stupid commercials that gave it away.
The reaction by Lilly white Oregon, both alt left and alt white, is telling. These are black kids who's "crime" was they touched a white chick. They were ruthlessly destroy by the white bigots from the left and right, who apparently agree on putting uppity colored folk in their place. Michaels, seems to me to be the only decent white personal in this mess.
Note the difference between the government killing black people, and non-government blacks killing black people. There's a difference.
Since black people don't like anything Confederate, maybe they should erect a monument of the first slave holder in the U.S. His name was Anthony Johnson, who BTW was black. They could add a mural of the African tribesmen hunting them down and selling them to the white man.
Pocho>  Where's all the LEFTies and LIBs today????  I guess they cannot argue the fact that this black-american lady made such a disturbing statement, they have nothing "good" to say in her defense, huh????  Well this is a prime example of "STUPID" as can be.  I hope the Secret Service is knocking on her door at predawn to ask her to come with them downtown for an interrogation on why she made that statement.  Ha, ha, ha!!!!  Stupid is to nice a word to describe her.  They are all  calling for her removal from public office.  My request is she be charged for making a threat against the POTUS and be tried for that in court.
STUPID NIGGERS
"Blacks can ride any public bus they please, as long as they sit in the back"?  Wrong and your thoughts on blacks are abhorrent.  Blacks should ride on any bus on any seat just like gays should be able to buy any pre made cake, because its right.
Born racist?  What about the recent viral reaction to the little white boy wanting to cut his hair short to match his buddy so their teacher would be confused as to who was who.......the white kid did not see the black skin of his buddy.......born racist? Give me a break.  Parents and others in society TEACH hatred for another person that is 'different'.
Johnny, your comments have been well rebutted above. But let me add, as a taxpayer and a business owner who has employed dozens of disadvanted Black and Coloured township youngsters, I have every moral authority to comment, to criticize, to stand up against and condemn looting, theft, incompetence, disgraceful arrogance and stupidity. Every voice in our country under our constitution is free to speak up and be heard. Your argument is disgraceful.
"Steve Bannon's editor-in-Chief at Brietbart is a devout Orthodox Jew," Your sentence implies that the current EIC is an orthodox Jew. No mention of 2012. You might want to read up on what Ben Shapiro is saying about bannon today. He doesn't seem to be a supporter. The breitbart editor in chief is Alexander Marlow. Not a Jew. I don't find it unusual there are black people supporting 45. Not every black person is the same. Like not every Jew is the same. There are idiots in both. For example Ben Carson and Bibi Netanyahu.  I don't have to prove bannon is a racist. I've read what he's said and did you know he's a self proclaimed Leninist? Btw, I've been aware of breitbart longer than two months. I have right wingers in my family so I've been shown the intelligence of right wing news sites for quite a while. Yes, Lars, you are defending bannon. AND not doing a really good job of it, I might add.
I didn't vote for Obama because he's black, I voted for him because he was the best person for the job. And that has proven to be true.  Look who you voted for.  Pathetic.
What's next?  Banning black vets and women vets?  After all, the women just had their parade (march).
Well, at least the Russians are white, for heaven's sakes.  I'd rather have to live next to a nice white drunk Russian than a black Muslim Kenyan whose children's names are Satanic anagrams.
Don't forget the Armenia holocaust of 1 million Christians and that six million number has been officially revised by the Holocaust authorities themselves.  Let's talk about the Jihad against Indians shall we, Koenard Elst in Negationism in India gives an estimate of 80 million Hindus killed in the total jihad against India and let's not forget why the Crusades happened! It was because of 400 years of islamic barbarism,  Can we forget how Mohammed thanked the Jews who helped him in Medina? He killed them, chopped off their heads.  Some prophet, killing God's chosen and those Nazi's weren't Christians! It is also estimated that Over 110 Million Blacks were killed by Islam.  So Christians can hardly be considered the biggest mass murderers, it isn't any surprise who really are the biggest mass murderers in history, estimated at a whopping  250 million and that is muslims.
So one who asserts rights in this country become a communist?  WOW!  Sounds like, if you had your way, blacks would still be sitting in the back of the bus (No harm done in that, right?), and gays would still be looking for a bakery (No harm done in that, right?)
#6 Trump is the anti globalization President ..Hillary just the opposite. #7 Jesse Jackson gave an award to Trump a few years ago for his promotion and advancement of black people.  #8 Look at how much things got better for black America under Obama ...a black man...blacks went straight backwards under Obama. If there were ever a voting block in this country voting against their own interests it would have been the black vote chasing Obama in 08 and Hillary in 16.
Ask any American black  The election if barak obama has no effect on US racism
Busted! You didn't include all white people. You cherry picked the ones to try to prove a point.  "Hey guys, watch me cherry pick numbers to feel superior to black people".  IT's unfortunate you don't understand the information being provided.
Well, I am in the game-both Holder and Lynch were some of the worst racist AG our nation has ever known. Lynch is nothing but pet slave of Al Sharpton and his brood of black racists. How bad can Jeff Session truly be?  Funny thing about racism today compared to racism of 1960s and prior is that racism is not longer the monopoly of the white folks. I should know since I am not white guy myself. Racism now comes from every color of every ethnic groups. Blacks are just as racist as white, so are the Hispanics or even Asian Americans or natives. Nowadays, anyone can call anyone..."a racist" and due to that, it has become almost worthless descriptive word. If Mr. Putski called me a "racist", and I do the same and we will be down to a level of couple of children calling each other names and resolving nothing. I think there should be ban on the word "racist" because it really means NOTHING in this day and age. But I doubt if that will happen since its a favorite attack word of an misanthrope.
B L M blacks love murder
He maybe YOUR president.   I impeached him 8 years ago.  What a disgrace. The first president EVER that never had a yearly 3% economic growth  and  added more to the national debt than all of the other presidents combined.  Oh....I don't give a $!!+ if he's black, blue or yellow.  Take your racial crap elsewhere.
So basically he doesn't disagree with Obama's stance on Climate change -- he just didn't like the black guy making progress in the world so he's dismantling everything Obama ever did that was positive and will just redo it with his own name on it.   Yeah - sounds like the sociopathic Trump I've come to know.
Funny. The only reason I want to read this news is because she is young and pretty. Bet u nobody would be interested if she was ugly, black, fat and short, etc. Maybe she'll get a short term and then run for President.
The recent black president Obama was going to solve all of this. This man did NOTHING. He is a disgrace.
So, it's okay to tell a black couple, no we won't serve you at our lunch counter, but we'll be glad to sell you some Spam and a loaf of bread?.
Uter Annie, what don't you like, tacos of criminals illegals that are SUCKING our country dry.  Waiting........cluck cluck cluck  Lefty checklist  Let the criminals out. Let illegals in. Mainstream media 100% gospel. Let boys in the girls bathrooms. Condemn police officers. Don't care about the veterans. Eradicate history if offensive. Believe Healthcare is a Constitutional right. Kill the unborn-Stomp on and burn the American flag. Accept barbarity in the name of Islam- hugs,love and no borders will stop terrorism. Protect the Sanctuary cities. Black lives only matter. Coddle the lazy. Encourage hate crimes.  Call for the assassination of our president, talk of overthrowing our government. Burn businesses, attack innocent bystanders, destroy City property, call for, and try to incite a civil war. Refuse freedom of speech on others, while demanding their own political and government obstructionists.
It's about racist targeting of black men on the part of police.    San Francisco effectively fired Kaepernick and no other team has hired this Super Bowl quarterback.  No racism or punishment here, move along now.
I suspect it is primarily white liberals that have been surprised by the level of racism and bigotry Trump has managed to harness. Since I'm black, I get reminded daily of the racism in my fellow Americans. One of the more subtle effects of racism is the constant concern minorities must have for the emotional fragility of most of the white people here. If you are black and ignore that, you will never have peace, a job, or you freedom. The truth is that as a nation we have not made peace with our racist heritage. Being polite became "political correctness" when us "others" demanded the same rights and freedoms that white males have. For example, the 2nd Amendment is a white privilege. Cops routinely kill black people on the suspension of being armed. White men can attend political rallies while armed. We have never had equal protection under the law. I would pity the white people that are losers in globalization, if they didn't think killing black people would solve their problems.
Once again a unarmed Black man is executed by rogue cops in Oklahoma. Hillary objected heart and soul. Trump and his white supremacists said absolutely nothing.
The "thinking" might have gone something like, "If a black man could do it ..."
Hay Dana.....Speaking of "political violence", I see Hillary fans are rioting, looting Wal Mart, lighting fires, assaulting police and hating white folks because a black police officer shot and killed and armed black man.  These anarchists are voting for Hillary right?    No mention of this story in the RG.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/21/protests-break-out-in-charlotte-after-police-fatally-shoot-man-they-say-wielded-firearm/
It is odd how the bad things about a person get so glossed over, and we look at them through rose-colored glasses after death.   Ali was a bigot.  He looked down on white people and Christians.  The radical Malcolm X himself converted him to follow the Nation of Islam, which is a well recognized hate group with strong antisemitism, and gave him his name of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.  And he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: "I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough"  And he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam "a white man's war", and said that "My enemy is the white people!"    Other quotes from Ali: "All Jews and gentiles are devils",  "The sins of drinking, smoking, prostitution, homosexuality, stealing, gambling: It all comes from white people."
If I want to see a bunch of black thugs running around trying to steal something, I will watch the news..
The overwhelming majority of black children who are shot are shot by other black children and black adults.
Taqiyah Thompson must be one of Dobbs' heroines.  She is a black in Durham, a member of the Worker's (sic) World Party (WWW) who is facing criminal charges for illegally pulling down a public Rebel statue.  Ms Thompson sides with Kim Jong Un against President Trump, as many on the left do, and believes that North Korea will rid the world of "American imperialism."  Where does this end? With the black Chicago pastor who is demanding that statues and parks in Chicago honoring George Washington and Andrew Jackson be changed?  Dobbs is leftist who ignores leftist crimes: torch Berkeley, attack rallies of their political opponents in CA and IL;  of course, Dobbs ignores Northern bigots in Skokie, the Bronx, and South Boston so as to focus his venom on the entire South.  The neo-Nazis at Charlottesville are detestable scum, but so are the left-wing extremists such as WWW, BLM, antifa which provoke even more violence.  Dobbs knowingly ignores the leftist scum.  Dobbs lies.
Carrying a weapon is the quickest way to get shot by a cop, especially if you're male and black. Your best bet is to simply be polite and refuse to cooperate if you're convinced you're in the right. Do not physically resist under any circumstances. You may be arrested, or even knocked around, but if you pull a gun, you'll be dead.
Simply because a black woman led an objectively justifiable counter-chant that contained the words "black lives matter" (in conjunction with several other repeated phrases of defiance) is not evidence that a national advocacy group bearing the same name sent a formal delegation to this white supremacist pig-circus; on the contrary, there was in fact no such formal presence. Conversely, however, the "highest profile" traditional national white supremacy organizations (eg. the American Nazi Party, the Ku Klux Klan) not only did send hate-mongering, cowardly, heavily-armed, addle-minded, yellow-stained representatives in riot gear to this rally, they organized and staged this reprehensible public display of racially-motivated hatred, simple-minded fear and colossal human ignorance!
Have to be able to keep those blacks in line.  Second amendment was added to allow southern states to be able to control their slaves.  Fortunatly Gary, we no longer have slavery so the second amendment is not needed.
Mostly, blacks kill other young black males.  Those statistics are consistent for decades.  "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homicide was indeed the No. 1 killer of black men between the ages of 15 and 34 in 2011, the most recent year with statistics available.    Compared to other ethnicities, the numbers really stand out. Forty percent of African-American males 15-34 who died were murdered, according to the CDC, compared to just 3.8 percent of white males who died.   Overall, 14 percent of all men 15-34 who died in 2011 were murdered."  In Portland, Oregon, reading the Oregonian, it seems that the two most likely places for a black person to die is outside of a strip bar or on their own front porch.
Equal pay. Reproductive rights.  Protection from discrimination, harassment, bulkting and assault. (Like pussy grabbing) Not being charged higher insurance premiums based on gender.  Trump akso said "there has to be some form of punishment " for women who have abortions.  Muslim womens rughts  Dreamers rights.  LGBT rights.  Black rights.   Just because you can't (or won't) recall  that many of our rights are threatened doesnt mean its not happening.   It means you are either out of touch or willfully ignorant. Bith are curable
No kidding Neko.  The real statistics are abysmal for blacks, but I will say the police do an equally good job of shooting unarmed mentally ill.
"There were nearly 900 hate incidents across the U.S. in the 10 days following the election, a report released last month by the Southern Poverty Law Center found. Those attacks include vandals drawing swastikas on a synagogue, schools, cars and driveways; an assailant beating a gay man while saying the “president says we can kill all you faggots now”; and children telling their black classmates to sit in the back of the school bus.  In nearly 40 percent of those incidents, the SPLC found, people explicitly invoked the president-elect’s name or his campaign slogans."  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/president-donald-trump-racist-examples_us_584f2ccae4b0bd9c3dfe5566
It is not a faith thing - traditionally Arabs looked down on blacks and they were very active in the slave trade.
But "All Lives Matter" would also be an obvious and therefore pointless slogan. None of the Black organizations named espouses one race over another. Black Lives Matter is a response to the American criminal justice system which is racist. I might add to my contention that Donald Trump cannot change the fact that the U.S. is a multi-racial, multi-ethnic society, an additional fact: not all racism is the same. I'm white and I discriminate against whites. I wouldn't hire a white person who I knew to be a Trump supporter. These are the whites that are stinking up the country with their idiocy. I'm embarrassed to be associated with such people merely by function of my skin color. And all the ooga booga tribalists grunt, "race traitor"!  Even lackadaisical vetting could have avoided this humiliation. LOL, Americans allowed Donald Trump to be their president!
You make a lot of assumptions, Steve, but can you point to any acts taken by this administration that were taken with any intent but to make the country better?  Trump tries to improve the country, and you want to divide it and attack it.  I don't know who organized what in Charlottesville, but what were there a couple hundred of them?  Wow, sounds like 1968 all over again.  Please.  Those liberal halcyon days of having something real to protest about are long gone, Steven.  Those evil, straight, White Christians vote for Black, homosexual and non-Christians  all the time.  You're protesting a myth.
Well excuse us for being confused.  The President won  an election despite  desparaging every minority group.  until recently he had a known white supremacist as a lead advisor (Bannon) and Stephen Miller is still writing his speeches. his response to Charlotettesville was to side with racist Nazis who were chanting dispicable racist slogans in a public space.  he pardoned Sherif Joe (a known racist).  and now attacks black athletes (calling them Sons of Bitches) for protesting racial injustice.  It's really hard to not see him, and all those who continue to support him, as bigots and racists.
You, Sir have one short memory.  You bumped your head and forgot about the Tea Party movement, protesting W.  Bush -oh really- bunch of old  rich guys started that movement, which begot the Birthers movement, ala King Trump of said movement, which begot the Alt-right, which was very much apart of the Trump campaign.  You, Sir ain't got no clue to the truth!   Trump not a racist, rofl!  "Don't freak out" you tell me!  No I ain't black, but I'm a woke white boy!  Don't blame me for you being blind!   Jesus is a glorious God and he shows me the truth, and revels the darkshadows of the lies before me!  Get right with the glory and you will see the light!  We are brothers and sisters the dark and the light!  We must pray forgiveness for the sins the we do and the lies that we make! You defend Trump and say I read too much into it???  I'm trying to show you the truth!!! We all sit blind to the truth and we all spend too much time looking stupid!  Find that truth!
60% of poor people are white, yet you say that Planned Parenthood clinics "are "conveniently" and "coincidentally" located near low income black and latino neighborhoods." I would imagine that 60% of those clinics would be located near low income white neighborhoods. You don't acknowledge any of this. Innuendo seems to be one of your trollish tricks, along with sucker-baiting and switching sides when you feel like it. Your false implication that PP clinics are exclusively black and Hispanic (come on, you only mention black and Hispanic) is innuendo, implying only black and Hispanic women get abortions, get them at PP, or that PP only serves black and Hispanic women. That isn't true, it is false, it is innuendo intended to slur black and Hispanic women, and it is slimy.  You seem to think that repeating your falsehood endlessly will make it true.  It will not.
Those five police officers would still be alive if the police themselves didn't allow dirty cops to run roughshod over the people, especially blacks.
Where did this insulting stereotype come from? The black-as-criminal image has been with us at least since the nineteenth century, when explicit racism portrayed African American slaves’ essential nature as ignorant and savage, in need of the “civilizing” influence of the white man.  At that time little black crime actually occurred, as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled, and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the slave owners, who acted as judge, jury, and executioner.   On average, an African American man, woman, or child was hanged, generally by a white mob, once a week, every week between 1882 and 1930, as police actively participated or stood by and condoned the murders.  Lynchings continued until the 1950s, as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like “disputing with a white man.”
Name me any group of so-called citizens that all act responsibility??  Problem is now, thanks to gutless, dishonest liberals "some" citizens are able to hide their hateful, criminal, etc, behavior behind color, race, religion or immigration status and it's a fact that it certainly isn't a majority of whites getting away with it.  Minority Repubs/Consv are treated both cowardly and despicably by liberal blacks and whites-FACT!!  Listen to CNN, MessNBC, etc, with their rhetoric about mediocre Negros cozening up to Trump.  Imagine anyone else saying that? A hateful bigoted liberal black did! And I don't have to expect better behavior from myself, I've more that carried my weight, taxpayer, etc.  And about you & yours being  all that good citizen stuff.  Shouldn't you be??  What need medals for being a good, decent, etc. American??  We give out to many pats on the head, and meaningless trophies for just being good! Showing up! Look at racism in your NAALCP, they don't except Consv blacks!!
Your analogy fails as does your argument.  Trump did not run on the basis that he is a white man, he ran on the basis that he represents everyone.  Obama ran on the basis that he is a black man and the time had come for a black man to be President.  Obama is the racist, not me, I could care less what race a person ascribes to be.
Sure are a lot of blacks in Anchorage terrorizing the community, better call TRUMP!
OMG, unbelievable that white males like Scat here could possibly believe criticism against racism, sexism or even discussions about equality are equivalent to the hatreds meted against people of colour, Muslims, women, etc. (mostly by white males).  Pathetic #WhiteMaleTears.
Ahhh..."lilly white" - an undeniably Racist term. I can only assume you are not only a Negro, but a Racist as well.
And then the blacks wonder why no one will hire them.  They think it's ok to violate workplace policies.  like refusing to serve police at restaurants and such.

I am surprise she still in office after her tweet about trump should be assassinated she should have resigned or step down and the press should have gone after her, but they will not do that because she is black, remember the other lady who was in office, the one who said Michelle Obama looks like an ape in high heels they went after her and she resigned because she was white, that's how racist the news media and this black woman are.
Black Lives Matter!!! If you think anyone else's life matters you're a racist, xenophobe, bigot, misogynistic A hole!
All of you white folk #trump supporters have the audacity to make comments and judge and you don't have your facts straight. Let's keep it real....you're upset because a black woman #OBAMA is in charge and running things and you don't like it.....wait.....are any of you black.....thought so.....carry on.....    Take off your WHITE hoods, reveal yourselves, know the facts before spewing your ignorance and feces about the internet. Don't you have a rally to attend?  #trump #kkk or something????  Shall we meet for coffee and chit chat?  Let's go.......I'm in!!!!!
I'm glad to see the progress in Seattle. I hope Portland makes the same progress. We should not have a list of unarmed people killed by the police. Fortunately, the EPD has not killed any unarmed people lately. That is good. I hope Sessions doesn't undo the good work. I'm sure he doesn't mind police killing black people, armed or not. There is nothing in his past to suggest otherwise.
My niece wanted to go to Stanford. Like many young people, she was qualified. She also had several internships on her application courtesy of her step-mother's position as dean of biotechnology, so she got in while others didn't.   While attending, and bombing at her first major, she met the love of her life. This young man is bright and talented, like my niece, but he majored in something silly. After graduating, he attempted to get into graduate school in computer programming, but was found wanting on his merits. Thanks to his step-mother-in-law, he was able to do a biotechnology training program and land a job at Genentech. While working there, he made the most of his talents and interests and is now doing computer programming, with an offer to have graduate school paid for while he works with admission guaranteed.  And that, friends, is white privilege. There are no black or Hispanic people who have those family connections that can make careers from whole cloth.
Where were you when the media, blacks, and liberals kept bringing up race every time there's a police shooting? Your double standard is glaring.
I was glad to read that I was not called an imbecile, ignorant, and the rest (but the day is young). To answer your question, I would guess because I cannot recall any city where there is a concentration of whites killing whites, proportional to black on black murder rate in places like South Chicago. The drug cartels and Mexican gangs also propagate senseless killing, but they do receive a lot of exposure as well.
Where are Obama's thoughtful comments about blacks killing white cops?
When these Mormons  get to prison they will be able to talk about the legal system with the Blacks and Hispanics prisoners. They may get a different view of our system.
Oh Kathleen, as a member of the media, you too want the candidates to play the game your way.  If it comes down to Trump vs Clinton, I'll probably go for Trump.  Clinton is in my book a glad hander who will say what voters want to hear, but will do that which most suits her rich woman needs.  Her real friends are not poor blacks, but the rich and powerful.  Trump at least is willing to take on the media's notions of political correctness.  Underneath all his bravado and slogans, Trump probably has some brains.  I don't sense that he is evil.  Sans evil and having brains, what would he do if elected.  I would like to hear the media ask him about his views on American interventionist wars.  About his views on prison reform and mandatory sentences.  About the drug war.  About funding social security.    Kathleen, you do not address such issues in your negative slam against Trump.  You address the insubstantial, the personal, that which cannot be quantified.  As the media so often does.
Attention stupid brain-dead retards: The standing argument is that cops kill blacks because cops racist. That means that your moronic "adjusting for population" claim is bogus because if cops were killing out of racism, they wouldn't be killing any whites--let alone twice as many. Pull your head out!
This guy is worried about "racists" but is doing the bidding of the biggest racists the Guptas who don't see blacks as equals but as "useful idiots".
griffin is as much a comedian as rachel dolezal is black. . put her on the no-fly list. let her drive to the liberal safe zones where her act epitomizes democrat hate and fear.
arming to protect themselves from mainly black men?
It's actually more black police officers killing black people but then you already knew that right?
The sad truth is that the current GOP base cares much more about being white than being Americans. The Democrats might have done more for those "poorly educated" white folks if the Republicans in Congress had not decided to obstruct anything that might help Americans for fear that Obama would get the credit. They are willing to sacrifice their poor relations for political gain. There is nothing Christian about that. I would pity those "poorly educated" white folks if they didn't think killing black folks would solve their problems. They are so ignorant that they can't follow the money. They think minorities and poor folks get more free stuff from the government than the 1%. Trump loves the "poorly educated". They are easier to con than the educated.
"Obviously Black Lives Matter does not support violence against anyone."  That statement is completely untrue. They advocate violence against police officers. A large group of Black Lives Matter marchers was caught on tape chanting "what do we want? Dead cops. When do we want it? Now!" and also referring to police as "pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon."
I know the white peoples.  We're all sitting out this weekend to protest the black players pissing on the USA
The black shirted / hoodied rioters of today , the heirs of the a black shirted fascists of  yesterday would likely vote Democrat if they voted for anyone....as for those Albino suprematist agitators who knows if they vote at all, their fore parents who inspired them , certainly voted Democrat.
Go get them! Get the bastards! The only time you know you are doing something really right is when the subject of your investigation starts to come at you with everything they have. So get the bastards. Get them for all of us who read in shock about a so called president who rules by fear, about a young woman who died just because she did the right thing, about Malooty and his dirty deals, about how the previous guys from Treasury were set up and fired. Tell the world about these Guptas, who are rotten to the core, who call black people monkeys but no one says it's racist except the media. Talk about the double standards in this so called democracy, where they brought in mercenaries to operate under a PR Bell Pottinger. Talk about crime so out of control it will be blamed on "white monopoly capital" because people who are incompetent hold the highest positions. Tell us more about the wife  with the sour face who is being pushed on us as a Gupta drone. Well done guys. Well done.
Lots of people stood firm against Nazis without being racist. Lots of banks are famous without having the monopoly on insuring slaves. You're starting to look like you're defending racism. What's next - your closest friend is black, amirite?
What a rag of a "newspaper." Constantly promoting division and hatred against men and especially white men for some reason, I suppose for click bait and the almighty dollar, rather than true social justice. The way forward is not to make every other segment of society feel better about themselves by telling them that "if only the white man didn't.........." and that white people are scum and should now be treated as second class citizens, nudge, nudge, wink, wink, but for society to truly become colour blind, including white people and just be people without some kind of qualifying modifying verb (white, black, asian, indigenous) before the word people.
Jim ... I'm a black woman and the thing I want to say to all white people is to STOP letting that word "racist" have so much power over you. And stop apologizing. Refuse to let those thugs and bullies diminish you and who you are as a person. You know who you are and need not constantly state that you are not a racist or a white supremacist. What everyone fails to realize is that true racism is as ancient as the days. As long as there is evil in this world such things will thrive with evil people to foment it. So is calling someone a racist going to suddenly make them not a racist? Of course not! My advise is to stand your ground.
Oh, yes, I'm sure you will say that because a super-minority did not have so called civil rights that we were just a dung-heap of a civilization.  Funny, those who lived in the south said that the black family was more happy and healthy than now! Many Women were on pedestals, not the unhappy lot your kind always project.  Your problem is that you watched too many Twilight zone re-runs and bought into clew-less high school drop-outs singing protest songs on the radio.
No Obama statues please.  First of all they will be ripped down in a flash now.  Second of all he doesn't deserve it, just like he didnt deserve his Nobe Peace Prize for doing nothing in the Senate.  Even he was incredulous in getting it.  He did nothing to deserve it.  Then he refused to show anything he did in college.  So, no works there.  He got a prize for being black.  lol!  That is a shame for all of the good people that got it for doing something to benefit society in a real way.  Color does not merit a prize.  If they put a stature up of him it would be a disgrace.  We are still fighting the wars he caused all over the globe.  Now it is here in America.  He is in league with George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and the MSM.  And they are ripping this country apart.
Tired of watching football teams that are 70+ percent black. Can't relate with it. It's like the NFL is now the Negro Football League. Which for the most part, are thugs and pampered idiots, that were it not for God given natural athleticism would be hard pressed to find a job paying more than minimum wage.
He not in violation of the law if he offers the same service to all. He offers a different service to gays.  That is like making blacks sit in the back of the bus.
The fact of the matter is that all people were created equal, after that comes their choice. Negroes are a defective race, if they are a race at all. Wouldn't a qualifying factor (determining race) be the question, human? or not human?
Anti-racists say there is a RACE problem that can only be solved when the third world pours into EVERY White country and "assimilates."  What if I said there was a RACE problem that could only be solved if hundreds of millions of non-Blacks were brought into EVERY Black country? How long before people realize I'm not talking about a RACE problem, but the conclusion to the BLACK problem?  They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-White.  Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.
All these photo ops to show the BIIIIG black signature, (so important  ,so so very very important!!) are ridiculous...he probably sits for hours practicing his signature, to try and make it look MANLY. No matter how tall and black he makes it, it doesn't make the hands look any bigger. LOL
Trump-tards - anything a black president does was an overreach.   Trump has done everything Obama has done times 10.
A black guy spray painted "N____R",  KKK and swastikas on my house because I had a black room-mate.  When confronted he said us white folks have no sense of humour. Nope, no racism there.
True enough.  Alas, for many conservatives the world can only be black or white, and Mr. Trump is Dubya on steroids.  Not only are you "against me" if you're not "for me," you're a loser and stupid and (choose your Trump invective here).  Hyperbole should no longer be tempered:  Mr. Trump is a "leader" in the same vein as Hitler and Mussolini.  Consistently deprecating (and increasingly openly violent toward) to those who not only disagree with him, but are doing their jobs (or not) as journalists.  Not simply a cartoonish narcissistic blowhard, but a rallying point for the ignorant, angry and uninformed.  There will be violence, and worse, coming from the Trump camp, I fear.  The Republican party created this monster in 50 years since Nixon (both their racist, misogynist, homophobic "core" and the individual now leading them), and when you sleep with dogs, you get fleas.  They have no idea where to scratch, which is both gratifyingly hilarious and frightening.
Don't blame Obama, those black officers probaby voted for him. Trump actually opened the scab of racism. Doesn't matter if not a slave now, if your ancestors were, ALL generations suffer. What an idiot statement. Hey, trumpets, go to church today.
act professional? like the rapper did? that taqsibak yelled racism after he was booted and how much of his song did he sing before he got booted? even by his own admission more than halfway through, should tell you that he was booted for content otherwise the racist GM would have never let his monkey ass even start singing at all! aint no racism just a lack of respect and huge effort to be a nigga!
And this is why the liberals are considered by many to be blatant hypocrites. They immediately scream their outrage when a right leaning group steps over the line however when groups like  BLM (black lies murder) and Antifa starts and participates in violence all we hear are crickets. Using the left criteria that would mean the Democrats support these terrorist groups and the violence they commit.
What about the black protester that shot another black protester. Was that the fault of the police.
This mo-fo be black! How he be aress? Blm need to get they ass over there an be protess this injustis agains they own! How dare this bro be arres?  Pardon the vernacular here, but, hey, he be a rapper!
Well the TrumpMonkeys have made it clear that Hillary was the standard for prosecution. By their standard perjury must be a horrible offense compared to using an unsecure server right ? Sadly TrumpTard logic doesn't work that way. All they care about is keeping brown and black people out of the presidency. They don't believe birtherism except the truly stupid ones. They despise Obama because he's black. TrumpMonkeys are just too cowardly to admit it.
Affirmative action to match the US population?   C'mon Man!  It's gonna really be hard to find that many non-blacks (other than  some Samoans) who won't get squashed flat on their first 1st down or slammed over the top by that 6'8" black forward!  You're talking like a crazy man!
" the party of angry, old, white folks"???   Doesn't sound or appear rational to myself, it appears and sounds very racist. IMO your bad  Black, Face, Jim Crow, Uncle Tom joke is in rather poor taste. And of course that doesn't address the women in the republican party. However, when considering the actual racial composition reflected with in the republican party of Hispanic, Asian and Black voters. Your statement can only be interpreted as racist! But not really that surprising that you admittedly admire Hillary who btw commemorated late Sen. Robert Byrd as "my friend and mentor". When it's well known Sen. Robert Byrd was himself a KKK member and chief recruiter for the KLAN.
What we have here is a baker who wishes to practice discrimination against gays, and he wants to claim that his "Christian" religion supports him. He is doing EXACTLY the same thing that racists in the days of Jim Crow did in refusing to serve blacks.   I am vehement on this subject because I have a personal interest. My brother is gay, as are some of my closest friends. My mother's parents and other members of my family were killed by the Nazis because they were Jews. My daughter-in-law is African-American, and her grandfather was telling me about life under Jim Crow, stories that I believe explicitly. I have been raised to hate discrimination with all my strength, and I know what happens if it is allowed to go unchecked. It starts with "No Dogs Or Jews" and ends with Treblinka.  In places like Chechnya, gays are imprisoned and killed. The Republican US Senate nominee from Alabama, Roy Moore, wants to do the same thing here. At least some people here seem to have no problem with it.
Are you Black?
Three quarters of the players in the NFL are black males , 6 percent of the population are black males. 21 per cent of violent crime is done by black males. 51 per cent of murders is done by black males. Maybe all the white fans should take a knee to protest the race problem because it doesn't seem to me the police are to blame.
Interesting.  And yet the gang rape of a white female and her white boyfriend prior to their murders by a group of blacks is not considered a racially motivated hate crime. It also seems like Baton Rouge Sgt. L’Jean McKneely made a prejudicial statement.
The police arrest black folks for living on the street. Being homeless in Eugene is a white privilege.
Asian countries for Asians.  Black countries for Blacks.  but White countries for everybody?  That's genocide.  Anti-racist is a codeword for Anti-White
Very popular President.  He's BLACK and he's YOUR PRESIDENT.  YOU HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT.  ok, let the crying begin...
Donald Trump became president-elect "because he is an outrageous bully"?  And American simply can't  resist an "outrageous bully," so they just had to make him president?  NCR also says Donald Trump won the election because "the internet' somehow managed to pump out "fake news" (precisely what, is never specified) that totally overshadowed all the major liberal news outlets, and all of America's newspapers (except one in Santa Barbara), and all of the TV news, and all of the Hollywood celebrities, and all of the TV commentators, and all of the magazines (even the National Review) -- all of hem daily extolling the virtues of Hillary while explaining all the ways Trump must never be elected president.  NCR also says, and concludes, that Mr. Trump won the election because America filled with very angry racist fools.   Evil people who for some reason, gladly voted for a Black president, twice..  Talk about your fake news.   Poor progressive NCR, spreading hatred.
maybe you niggers should concentrate on striving to be better than you actually are rather than looking for a handout, gimme something for nothing. the same attitude you ignorant racists have espoused for decades.  get off your lazy asses and EARN your place, like every else you are so jealous of.
Yet Blacks, who are only about 18% of the population commit more violent crimes than whites, who are about 60% of the population... - FBI crime statistics 2015.
Right. So when Republicans tore down the healthcare act by Hillary in the 1990s, it wasn't partisan.   The Republicans spend a lot of time convincing their supporters that tax money should not be used to treat blacks and Mexicans.
Why shouldn't a black man be able to open carry without getting shot? After all, white intoxicated guys do it all the time.
Many Blacks in America believe they can't be racist because they are black. It is being taught in schools across America and here in Canada too, that only white people can be racist, and that all white people are.
How is it embarrassing being correct? I mean, you even went so far as to prove my point for me - whites commit more murders than blacks. What's the issue with that fact? You should be proud! WHites win!
There is a difference between a person stealing axes and hatchets, assaulting a loss control employee, and then throwing those axes and hatchets at police and then charging them and probably wanting to die by suicide by cop versus a black man dying because of a simple traffic stop, or selling CD's, or running from the police and being shot in the back, etc. etc. etc. You can't blame for black people for being tired of racist b.s. and murder by cop. Turn off Fox news, open your brain a bit and maybe you'll realize not everything is black and white (no pun intended.) as much as us white folk wish it was.
I agree with you as long as you include Black Lives Mater.  It's just as racist and you didn't hear Obama condemning them did you?  Sounds like a double standard to me.
Are you just another Black man who has kids all over the place…."that my baby mama, that my baby mama too, and that one too," and don't take care of any of them? Even Black women say it's true. And a drug dealer and pimp? No job? Let a woman take care of you? That's the stereotype I've heard for decades dude. How 'bout it?
I think anybody who understands just how deep the rotten rabbit hole of corruption goes will tell you, white priveledge exists, but is definitely not our most pressing problem. In fact, anyone who goes on and on about Gupta-speak terms like white minority capital just hasn't grasped the concept of an Elite class, black,white, yellow or orange running our country exactly like the mafia. I mean exactly. It's all about kickbacks and if you're focusing your anger on white people then I say you are a racist.
Obviously Edward McClellan is defying the odds.   As far as Interracial Crime goes:   Of the nearly 770,000 violent interracial crimes committed every year involving blacks and whites, blacks commit 85 percent and whites commit 15 percent. Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks. Forty-five percent of their victims are white, 43 percent are black, and 10 percent are Hispanic. When whites commit violent crime, only three percent of their victims are black. Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a white than vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery. Blacks are 2.25 times more likely to commit officially-designated hate crimes against whites than vice versa. As far as criminal Gangs Only 10 percent of youth gang members are white. Hispanics are 19 times more likely than whites to be members of youth gangs. Blacks are 15 times more likely, and Asians are nine times more likely.  That's the data.
Maybe Lassner is afraid that he would be fired if he took action against Herron.  What a sad case of an idiotic society where one race can say racist remarks towards all other races while being protected by punishing those who say racist remarks towards that race...in this case Blacks.  I don't see many other races being represented in the math department!  It looks like only whites and blacks want to "lazy" jobs that only requires one to "teach" the same thing year in and year out.
What these idiots fail to realize is that Trump has employed and cut pay checks to more black latino gay lesbian muslim and transgendered people than all previous presidents combined.
I simply do not understand what BLM has to do with Gay Pride? The violence perpetrated against black people by the police needs to stop and be dealt with and for that I support BLM-TO, but what has that got to do with me being Gay? It isn't just Black gays and please tell me if anyone has ever heard of this, being murdered. Its every Black male who is in danger. But, I'm celebrating being Gay so where does BLM-TO fit in here?  It would be nice to know without a pile of rhetoric being thrown at me.
When they catch the guy actually killing some one should they turn them loose if they are black?
Commenter writes "Allen does not understand that there were no more slave owners after April 1865"   What an appalling statement.  Who gave white people the right to subjugate blacks to begin with?  During the ante bellum period white slave owners travelled with their slaves all the time.
What really bothers me is all these folks complaining that Blacks are excluded from high performing whit schools ..... why don't the Black Families create a high performing Black School that whites wish  to attend?
This news story has generated more letters, comments, articles, etc. than any other that I can remember in my 40 years in Eugene. Most have been thoughtful, honest, insightful, and have given me a lot to think about - particularly in regards to my own biases, both the ones I know and those I don't even know that I have. No matter how much I read, talk, watch, experience, empathize with, etc, I will never know what it is like to be Black, a Woman, a Jew, Gay, etc. I will never be able to fully know what it is like to be anyone else other than myself, and no one else will ever know what it is like to be me.   I doubt we'll ever be able to fully and collectively bridge the racial divides and prejudices in this country. We don't seem to be able to learn from our collective past without being labeled by it and stuck in it. Since I can't change it, I say live in the present and treat yourself and fellow human with as much dignity, integrity, understanding, civility, etc. as you can muster.
I do know that Masterpiece Bakery would have no problem making a cake for blacks, if for no other reason then because blacks generally agree with the owner on religious convictions.
"...whites who kill black people are 10 times more likely to win a 'stand your ground' claim than blacks who kill whites..." Wait, so this GOP-NRA push isn't so everyone can defend himself or herself, it's so whites can kill blacks with impunity? What a shock!
Same thing Trump said to the Black Community.  "What the hell do you have to lose?"  We are like the Blacks.  The Republicans ignore us because we always vote (D) and the Democrats ignore us because we always vote (D).  We're like idiots who can't think.  Only look for the (D) and vote there because that's how it's been done forever.  Everybody takes advantage of us including our own damn politicians.  Wise up Hawaii.
Jim:  We're going to disagree on this one.  You're really saying that an individual's "transgendering" him/herself is as harmful to others as is adultery.  I've known families torn apart by adultery, causing extensive damage to spouses, children and the extended family.  I know of no such impact on the welfare of others from a person's transgendering.  I feel precisely the same way about homosexuality.  BTW: You state that adultery is "as natural as can be."  I'm not sure about that one.  We know that some animals other than humans are monogamous" The Canada goose (Branta canadensis) is a large wild goose species with a black head and ..... Canada geese find a mate. They are monogamous, and most couples stay together all of their lives. If one dies, the other may find a new mate."  So it may well be that monogamy is "natural"..as well as "cultural" in origin. Hey, if it's good for the goose, it's good for the gander............and, maybe, us as well.  Gary Crum
read this.....black Harvard Poff.
Absolutely and just like some dolt criticizing black people or Muslims she should be held to account as the racist she is......it is clear she is one.....      If I stated "Black Fragility" in the same context or similar I would rightfully be held to account.
I have to laugh at you. So you believe that Planned Parenthood ignores serving 60% of poor people, and serves only poor blacks and Hispanics. Really? Our nation's largest women's reproductive health organization is ignoring 60% of women in need of health care and affordable contraception? You really believe that? Fine, but here you are trying to convince others of what you believe is the truth, without an ounce of proof. Without proof that Planned Parenthood is ignoring all the poor white mothers and serving only black and Hispanic women, you won't convince me or anyone else with a functioning brain and a dose of common sense that you know what you're talking about.  Here's AT:  "They are preying on poor people, the largest portion who are minorities." Two lies in one short sentence. PP is SERVING women with services they WANT and NEED; and the largest portion, a 60% majority, of poor people are white. You just can't get it right - your bigotry stands in the way.
Bomb them and burn out their black hearts.  They take pride in their cruelty to all age groups and have never shown mercy.  They represent the world's worst who will come back another day to conduct further acts of depravity.  Unconditional surrender or death.
This is idiotic.  White guys organize to pursue their interests just like Jews organize to pursue their interests...and blacks, etc. etc.  None of these biologically determined groups are better than others, they are all for themselves and against others.  This is what is "self-evident".  Why didn't these people care about the marchers in Tel Aviv chanting "Death to Arabs!"?  Or complain about AIPAC supporting a racist like Netanyahu?  The weird thing is to see, for example, Jewish or Black groups complaining about white supremacist groups.  On what basis?  They are just like these other groups which espouse anti racism but are racist by virtue of their mere existence.  Hate knows no race, it is present in any of these ethnically defined groups.  Guess who monitors hate?  The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish organization that finds anti-semitism everywhere.  Guess who holds white groups liable?  The Southern Poverty Law Center, another Zionist (racist) organization.  All hypocrites.
Slaves, heavy lifting for a small portion of the country.  Since Black races invented Slavery, we know that slavery was much worse in Africa.  Wage slavery is rampant in the world today and negates any guilt you propagandize for Americans.  I think you may be a slave to leftist rhetoric though.
Agreed, when I was younger we were taught to try to look past skin colour, to look to the person inside, that was the goal.  Now the progressives and university teachers are obsessed with it, they scream about black this or white that 24/7 - we're going backwards.
"Am I black, white, brown, yellow or green?" Puh-LEEZ. Only complacent, in-denial white folks come up with such weasely, evasive nonsense to avoid admitting what they already know but are too ashamed to acknowledge, because this would in turn require them to admit they LIKE those white privileges and have NO intention of giving them up. You're no mystery to me, sonny.
Wow this lady just stereotyped all black women as automatically being Clinton voters. That's messed up. People have their own opinions, "black women" is not a monolith. You can't complain when other groups do this to you then turn around and do it to yourself without at least acknowledging the double standard (if you want anyone to take you seriously).
When humans build cities on the moon, Caplan and socialistic parasites like him will complain white folks took all the good craters for themselves, leaving the lousy craters for black folks.
Tell that to a black person who descended from slaves and see what they say.
All those Irishmen and Italians have flooded the country.  Not to say those blacks who got in despite the laws against importation of slaves.  Terrible!!
“If Blacks would act Human there would not be a problem” (paraphrase)."--Just what are you saying here  Steven Hunnicutt 466? I think I know. Since you cannot possibly be so naive as to believe that the Civil Rights Act magically cured the virulent racism of many white Americans, I call you out as a low-life racist for what your post implies.
point taken. white trash is a racial slur.....and an attitude slur. if i wanted to dis a person just for being white it  -well i wouldn't cause i don't have a problem with it - i'm white. but most likely something like cracker..?  my concept of "white trash" represents a type of white person that exhibit certain beliefs that are , in a larger population, are widely to be racist and sexist.  i will divulge i do have a unfounded, immediate gut response to a certain dialect - first awareness of "that accent!"  a tape loop of biased slurs starts in my head. it is not related to color, education, age, gender, wealth.....it is just the accent and i can't pin it down.  it comes up in southern accents, but only one of the various sounding southern accents - all others are fine. being aware of myself, i can shut it down fast. i've had to check myself,  and work with people with that accent and i KNOW they are fine. it's me. and i don't know why. white or black doesn't matter - it's that accent.
..it seems that Black gays are more important and entitled then non-black gays --------------------  "Black lives matter" is not a gay organization it is about Black lives  first  and not gay Black lives  why is a non-gay organization determining the mandate of Pride Parade  consider this the end of Pride Parade but in a way serves them right for playing  with politics like Queer Against Israeli Apartheid
If a white community had a problem with white meth heads killing, stealing and intimidating the residents, guess what, they would get the attention of the police.  If Asians were doing the same, they would get it.  You're complaining that police are tackling the problem of blacks and hispanics committing crime in organized street gangs?  You condone this behavior?  Unarmed black men are killed by police officers in .001 of all encounters, so your theory of them hunting down unarmed black men is null and void.  Paid leave is paid for an investigation, if that officer is found culpable, he is fired.  Why punish an officer in a righteous encounter and response?  Show me a video that hasn't resulted in exoneration or firing?  There - I answered.
copied, pasted: The dubious Kalergi plan takes another hit. Personally I LIKE the differences between people & places. When I see a black girl I think is sexy for example, it's often the very darkness of her skin I find all the more sexy, and I am as white as Trudeau's face when he looks at the latest approval ratings. Thanks a lot so called open-borders-globalists, but I would prefer that we DIDN'T all mix together in some human stew that leaves everybody looking the same in 100 years; I like my sexy coffee black and would prefer it not all be served cappuccinos & lattes.
First of all what they're protesting is based on lies. Blacks are not being racially attacked by law enforcement. Hands up don't shoot was a complete lie. If the NFL wants to help the black population they need to change the ghetto culture from the inside. Black on black violence is by far the largest killer of blacks but the NFL players won't touch that fact. Why?
$100 dollars says it was a black male that killed them. A pointless murder in a park. hmmmm. Odds are far in my favor. Just sayin.
NAACP - I've noticed a trend, it's only black players who are disrespecting the US flag and kneeling during the national anthem.
Racist much up here in Alaska?  thehighway wrote: “This just shows how big of a joke blacklivesmatters is. Where is their support now? No outrage, no protests? The police just killed a man… Hello… Oh yeah BLM is a joke and doesn’t care if anyone else except black people guilty or not are killed by police. A black KKK all for the destruction of police offices. If BLM were truly a just cause there would be supporters at the scene wearing their oh so special t-shirts…”  So can you, “thehighway,” explain in your next comment why police nation wide try to confiscate videos made of what they have done, or why police  routinely harass photographers and steal memory cards from peoples cameras?  WTF does BLM have to do with any of that? Educate yourself or you will remain a fool. Also, why do POs lie so often when they are deposed (frequently loosing their jobs for purjury)? Why don’t POs records follow them around when they are fired for cause? Give me a break and head south ASAP “highway man.
If traditionalist 'blacks' paid as much attention to the living as they do to the dead, we would all be better off.  All this virtue signalling over dead 'black' bodies is sickening. Live up to the cry...black lives matter more than dead blacks matter.
I think that Lincoln would suffice as a hero and I was around when all of this rebranding was going on so I think I know a little about what I am speaking about. If you want to hang your hat on Nixon bringing in Southern racists into the republican party.  Think again Nixon brought in the voters that were disgusted that the Democrats brought to the table like the KKK, Jim Crow in the south. Yes, they were religious and yes they were conservative as far as racist or anti-Constitution you are wrong.  A hallmark of the Conservative agenda is preserving the Constitution, something the Democrats have tried to dismantle ever since it was written.   Regarding identity politics, clearly you are either unwilling to see what is going on around you or are ignorant. By dividing the country up into special interests Poor Whites, Blacks, Asians, Gays, Straights, Rich, Poor only serves to weaken us.
What you conveniently fail to mention is that fighting for "states and individual rights" meant fighting for white men's right to treat blacks as property, not persons, with the rights to abuse, maim, torture, rape, and kill the blacks as they pleased. This is the side Lee enthusiastically defended. There's no honor in that.
Last year, when BLM accused the entire white gay population of Toronto of disgusting racist bigotry against the black LGBT community,  nobody, not Tory, not Wynne, not Trudeau came forward to defend our long history of openness and acceptance of ALL people. That was tacit agreement with BLM that we as individuals and as a community are despicable. Even the CBC, CITY TV Globe and Star,  once our media allies , sided with BLM. As usual, we gays were tossed under the bus for somebody else's convenience. Who defends our rights to not be slandered and defamed?  NOBODY !
So brown racism,  black racism are better?  Ever see another race or ethnicity working on a farm,  other than Hispanic?  Ever manage a farm in white racist Oregon? Where did the fruit tramps,  the Okies and Arkies go?  What became of them?   Ever  have to physically separate the Mexicans from the Laos people,   who the Mexicans call "Chinitos" ,  their slang for any Asian.   Dare you practice free speech in Dearborne,  Michigan,  and set up a curbside Christian soap box?  You tough enough to keep the muslims from beating you senseless in Dearborne,  you infidel!   Washington DC's city council is passing a regulation to make sure that African Americans own most of the weed outlets,  because right now,  whites have put  up the money,  made the investment,  to sell weed to  Americans in Washington DC. and only one outlet is African American owned.    That's racism by government in our Nation's Capitol.   "Diversity" is the code word, dog whistle,   for reverse racism,  sexism by the left.
"Working man"? How about working people? Maybe if all these companies from the lower 48 stopped bringing most if not all of their people from TX and LA up to AK instead of hiring Alaskans...(the white/black/asian/etc. people who actually work that is) then maybe our economy would be better. Am I racist? No I am not... it is not secret that native corps take and take whatever they are handed by the fed and state governments...AND THEY CONTINUE TO PAY NOTHING FOR ALL THE SERVICES THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF... ever been to a native corp office?...they do nothing, but get paid for "working"...been their twice...both times a joke! Seems like they are all in a fog... always have their hands out though! Isn't that Native Land Deal already paid for dearly? Seems like we are still paying for that... am I wrong? Nope! Do some research... how many grants from the feds does one actually need when making millions in profits! How pathetic! Pay for your own shit!
Never hire a Muslim, a Black person or a female...ever!
Republicans have been enslaving blacks for years. You'll find my source when you find yours.
You are well read?   Yet you had no idea who Larry Elder is and he has a nationally syndicated talk show.  Myopic is a better term for you.  You clearly stated that you judge by whats inside, not skin color.  And here are two black men who have contributed much to society, yet you judge them to be bad.  Clearly you are not judging them by what is inside them.  So yes, a liar.  You are lying about how you judge people.  And if you are as open minded as you claim, have you ever voted for a Republican?  Are there any conservative ideals that you agree with?  Usually people who make the claims you are making are just covering for the fact that they are the complete opposite of what they claim.  Just like when people say "I'm not a racist person, but ....", those people are quite racist.  And I don't hate you at all.  I'm just pointing out what a hypocrite you are.
The President is a lawyer whose law experience is as a community organizer race hustling to keep Black people all riled up.
There are very few black homicides in any Chinatown. Oh, did you mean Chicago, which not even Whiggers call Chi-town anymore (that's way square, daddy-o). Admit it, you've never been to Chicago, a beautiful, vibrant city with really wealthy low-crime neighborhoods. I get it! You obsess over your Obama hatred so much that his association with Chicago gives you cause to vent intestinal gas. Please, not here on this forum! This is not your toilet. Use the proper facility in your home, and remember to clean yourself afterward!
All of us are treated differently....some because of skin colour....some because of ethnic sounding names....some because of age....some because of visible affluence. It is the way it is in life.  Most people treat police officers with respect, or at least cooperation.  Black culture (hip hop etc) treat police as scum who deserve to be shot. Perhaps black fathers should be present in the home and set positive examples for their black sons....or perhaps young black women shouldn't get pregnant by men who are unreliable at best.  Seems obvious to me.
The judge knows that this former investment advisor, arrested while driving his 2012 Lexus, whose charges include methamphetamine, heroin and cocaine, who is also under investigation by the SEC, and who has 20 firearms won't skip? How about if he were a black man, with no job, driving a 2000 Lexus or a Mexican in a Ford Tempo? No flight risk?
Apparently your read well, but understanding is certainly not one of your strong points!!  Never challenge you or your family the way you have mine, with your continued "little man" hateful rhetoric!! Tried to point out there's plenty of bad, worthless citizens to go around, but your clueless butt is always blaming the other side, while giving your side of anarchists, environ terrorists, Islamist, black thugs, etc, a complete pass and still going after ole whitey.  Well here's a FACT hateful:  White supremacist, skin heads, etc, aren't attacking innocent citizens, burning, looting, attacking police, but racist blacks, snowflake college liberals, radical Muslims, paid agitators are; while the so-called leaders of the racist Dems/DNaziC stand silently by, cheering them on.  With citizens like you still running your hateful mouths about whites! Don't accuse my party of the KKK, Jim Crow laws, lynching, the problems in cities like Chicago, DC, etc, that lies with liberals. Your kind!
So adding "too" will make the concept more acceptable? If I say "I have an idea!' does it mean that I think you have no imagination or that I'm smarter than you? The nexus is, the phrase Black Lives Matter was coined because it appears as though there are some who think otherwise. Those who wish to play semantics can hang on to an imagined slight or oversight. In the meantime, we watch the latest videos of  black men being shot...
You brought up the KKK, not me. Yikes! If White Christians killed 53 people I denounce that. Can you come to yourself and denounce the Liberal/Democrats Hate rhetoric? The Scalise shootings, Kate's murder, etc. Can you denounce the black on black crime in Chicago which is probably 10x's more than the 53 every year. Democrats runs Chicago, years upon years innocent people live with gang bang Wars! Barry did squat for them for 8 years. The Democrats did squat for Chicago!
Someone should reassure the NIMBY group that blacks and Hispanics won't be rehabbing nearby. Those getting treatment will look just like the NIMBYs. Could very well include themselves and family/friends.
I don't look at people as 'black natives' but it seems to give you comfort!!    There are others more competent than her and less corrupt.
This was a racist article against Eastman; cause he wouldn't kiss their butt and it should be a bill for ALL, who worked on the project. What about Orientals, or Mexicans?  Why does ONE GROUP want recognition, but not all?  So, they can later claim that blacks built the highway and not others?
I'd hate to be the partisan who has to explain away a rally of neo-Nazi torch weilders who chanted "Jews will not replace us" with "out of context" with no further attempt at explanation. Trump refused to rent to black Americans. That's why the "alt-right" loves him.  I'd hate to be the partisan who has to explain away a contempt of court charge by arguing that the DOJ was wrong and so was the judge who found Arpaio in contempt after he violated desist order. Notably you didn't try to dispute the other sins by Arpaio, the poster boy of government overreach.  Trump was a birther. For years. Even after HI debunked birtherism. Even after Obama released his birth certificate TWICE. Trump promised to provide proof of his birther claim yet he didn't follow through as usual. Then he demanded Obama's transcripts because he thought Obama wasn't smart enough to attend Harvard. This coming from a semi-literate Trump.   I pity partisans who voted for racist sexual predator who ogles nude teenagers
Why do niggers think they are the only victims in life?  Asians do not whine.  Most browns do not whine.  Just blacks.  75 percent bastard rate, 16 ACT, low college graduation rates, et al.  Useless failed losers from Africa!  Go home!
If the shooter was a Muslim man, then Donald Trump would call him a terrorist and a ban on Muslim immigration. If the shooter was a Hispanic man, then Trump would call him a terrorist thug and a crackdown on illegal immigration. If the shooter was Asian, then he would be a criminal terrorist and a crackdown on Triads. If the shooter was black, then there would be a crackdown on gang members. If the shooter voted for Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, then he would be a political terrorist and a member of the Antifa.  Since the shooter was a white Christian male who taught bible school and an ex-member of the Air Force, he is a mentally ill man who needed help. No need for gun control.
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI!
BREAKING NEWS: NBC news is reporting that  Four black Chicago youths are being charged with the kidnapping and torture of a mentally disabled white teen in a Facebook Video in which they use anti Trump racial slurs during the beating/ torture process.
He speaks and writes English a damn sight better than most of us speak and write any Black language so STFU.
The democrats have yet to apologize for their crimes against blacks.  Instead, they use the old "it wasn't us it was them" defense to try to create the fiction that their bad actors all left and joined the Republicans.  How stupid is that????  Why would they leave and join the party that actually freed the slaves???  What some people will do to avoid having to apologize is amazing!!!
Roof did no such thing!!!  He had his picture taken with the CBF!!  The fact that he misused that picture is his doing, not the flag's!!  Typcial liberal logic, blame the gun instead of the person.  And for the clueless, there's a difference between the Flag of the Confederacy or Confederate Flag AND the Confederate Battle Flag; which I don't expect to many liberals know or understand.  Just love the way Roof is so racist for his actions; yet a black gang leader(again in Chicago) lures a 9 yr old little black boy into an alley and shoots him twice in the head.  An baby really!!  Why?  The little boy's father was in a rival black gang.  Slimemedia??  Silent!!  Double standard liberals??  Silent!!!
Right.  When a black drug dealer shoots people, it's 'gang violence'.  When a Da'esh fanatic does so, it's a 'terrorist attack'.  But when a white supremacist murders nine black folks in a church, or seven Sikh worshipers in their temple, he's a 'crazy man.'  Explain to me how that works, James...
no one at fox ever claimed obama was illegit , for any reason including being black you lying sack of left wing bs loser
By the way, your map doesn't show any white neighborhoods, only black and Hispanic. You don't suppose that would reduce its credibility? It's on an anti-Planned Parenthood site aimed at black and Hispanic people. Dollars to doughnuts the site is run by white anti-abortion people.
Californians flying in to demonstrate "white pride." How very selfish and dumb. Being born a color should not invoke "pride." Your individual accomplishments should be your pride. White pride/black pride - it's just a desire to put race before humanity and divisiveness before love.
The only racists and bigots surrounding this fiasco are members of Black Lives Matter.
The CPC picked a loser as a leader. Harper 2.0. What is his plan? Throw black men in jail for weed, kiss Trump's ass, pull the plug on grandma?????? What young person is going to volunteer for these the CPC? Their base is older then dirt!!!!
Why?  With your logic shouldn't a black person then would have to wear a hat saying which African Nation they are associated with like "Kenyan Pride,' Ivory Coast Pride, etc?
It's kind of ironic that Milner is calling the kettle black when he himself is a twister and a deceiver.  Who's the hypocrite?
Don't forget the Armenia holocaust of 1 million Christians by peaceful muslims and that six million number has been officially revised by the Holocaust authorities themselves. Let's talk about the Jihad against Indians shall we, Koenard Elst in Negationism in India gives an estimate of 80 million Hindus killed in the total jihad against India and let's not forget why the Crusades happened! It was because of 400 years of islamic barbarism, Can we forget how Mohammed thanked the Jews who helped him in Medina? He killed them, chopped off their heads. Some prophet, killing God's chosen and those Nazi's weren't Christians! It is also estimated that Over 110 Million Blacks were killed by Islam. So Christians can hardly be considered the biggest mass murderers, it isn't any surprise who really are the biggest mass murderers in history, estimated at a whopping 250 million and that is muslims.
Comparing our Good American president to these spoiled black athletes is wrong, just as they are.   60 years of programs to raise the level of life for the black race in America, and what did it accomplish?  More crime, more fatherless children, and more demands.  'affirmative action' 'The Black Caucus" 'Black Miss America' 'quotas for black hiring'  'extra credit on SAT scores for black students" 'quotas for contracts given black contractors'  the list goes on and on, and they are 'protesting' once again.    Ask them this 'what do you want?'  With all I've listed,  it's never enough.  Do they want the police too 'look the other way' when 6% of the population (black males) are doing crime?  When 6% of the population makes up over half of the prison population?  It's what and who they are, not what they imagine.
I've read at least four articles this week about police lying about why someone was shot. Luckily there was video to show their lies. Maybe if you read more less racist sites you would know this. How about those teenagers in Texas that ran a black man over with their truck while shouting racial smears? BLM is not a terrorist group. They do not advocate violence unlike the people commenting here. And Richard? More white people kill white people. Where's your anger on that?
Now let's turn the tables for a minute. Imagine if the gay community staged a sit-in at Toronto's annual Caribbean Festival Parade (previously known as Caribbana), to highlight violence, homophobia and discrimination toward gays in Caribbean and African countries? I can only imagine the reaction from the black revellers in the crowd. There is a massive stench of hypocrisy to BLM: don't preach about racism and human rights to the gay community when the countries of your origin have appalling human rights records when it comes to gays. What is happening with Toronto Pride is a classic case of trying to be all things to all people: when you try to do that, you become nothing. The Pride Board had better wake up and pick its allies very carefully, and not cave in to the naked coercion and manipulation of BLM. The police and their various police services in Ontario have been a wonderful and joyful presence at Pride for many years, with their outreach information booths and colourful floats.
While cops bother Asians even now, they are on their worst behavior with blacks and still are. When they say they fear black suspects, it comes from guilt.
He does have a beautiful white robe with a pointy cap, accessorized with a beautiful armband with a swastika on it. And let's not forget that manifesto in his hand signed by Hitler lauding the killing of Jews, Blacks, and all other non-whites who do not support the supremacy of the Aryan race.
So Oupa  Magashula  is not black enough o be called the first black African. What dos a degree in economics do if your conduct is more inclined towards corruption . If Tom Moyane is ethical and honest, why then are so many issues that stick to him like a khakibos to an ass. No amount of attack of the media or law abiding citizens will wash away the current poor perception of SARS the public have.
White Privilege has been earned.  Black Men represent 3% of the population yet commit 52% of the homicides,  Black men are FORTY TIMES more likely to commit a violent crime than white men. Those are FACTS not fluffed up heartfelt opinions. And I can't wait to see how many of you snowflakes get your panties in a bunch and accuse me of racism.
Sorry, the KKK was an arm of the Dem party. Dems have a long and storied history of violence and racism against all groups, not just blacks. Heck, your party's standard-bearer, FDR, rounded up thousands of Japanese and threw them in internment camps during WW2. The Democrat party owns the history of racial bigotry in this country.  Now, do the usual and tell me about the "Southern Strategy" that has been so thoroughly debunked.
Read little lefty cry baby.  Lefty Checklist Let the criminals out. Let illegals in. Mainstream media 100% gospel. Let boys in the girls bathrooms. Condemn police officers. Don't care about the veterans. Eradicate history if offensive. Believe Healthcare is a Constitutional right. Kill the unborn-Stomp on and burn the American flag. Accept barbarity in the name of Islam- hugs,love and no borders will stop terrorism. Protect the Sanctuary cities. Black lives only matter. Coddle the lazy. Encourage hate crimes.  Call for the assassination of our president, talk of overthrowing our government. Burn businesses, attack innocent bystanders, destroy City property, call for, and try to incite a civil war. Refuse freedom of speech on others, while demanding their own political and government obstructionists.
Seriously? A guy has to apologize for not being black or trans?  These are weird times indeed.
Dude, you must have missed it, use Google to check, big Mike Brown strong-armed and robbed a convenience store and then punched the cop, tried to steal the cops gun, fired 2 shots inside the cop car and then after being told to stop bull rushed the cop and was thankfully killed.   We should be protesting negro brutality and criminality with the knockout game and other crimes by negroes.
The madman in Dallas was a military veteran who had served in a war and likely suffered PTSD; clearly he was mentally ill. He was NOT the face of BLM as much as you and others would like to pretend that he is. You are going to have to do better to defend your position, since apparently, black lives don't matter to you.
So in other words a friendly, peace-oriented gay organization got taken out by a terror group  This is how hate groups,, Marxists, Communists, Globalists, etc infiltrate simple good-spirited organizations and turn them into hate spewing, evil, and  mean-spirited gangs.  Expect more of the same in Canada  I walked in pride parades even though I am not gay. I appreciate the spirit of gay community and the general goodwill they have. This is a tragedy.  BLM is all about hate and terror. They hate whites of all walks - period. Their actions the last 5 years have proven that. What happened??? Evil happened Next up Sharia gangs in our neighborhoods.  This Black and Brown Muslim Terror thing is really the greatest threat to our society I think You can bet the announcements will be ONLY BLACK MUSLIM GAY PEOPLE CAN WALK! (If there are any left) Yup its all about inclusion isn't it?
Reichstag, fascism; you just can't help yourself. Anyone who cast a ballot or Mrs. Clinton is either a fool or a leftist; and I don't presume you as the former {though they are most certainly not mutually exclusive}. I'm not quite sure what you intend by linking Sanger's beliefs with the collection plate. It is Hillary who praises her, not Trump. Has anyone ever questioned her as to whether she believes it to be fine and dandy that black pre-borns are aborted at higher rates than whites or non-blacks?
I find this civil comment thing to be the most ridiculous muzzle, put on the users of this site by an industry that wholly believes in incivility in the interest of ratings. A black officer killed a white man last week but we won't heart about that. Flip the script and it will literally be the only thing we will see.  This forum muzzles any true form of free speech. Yes, I know there are troglodytes that will abuse it. So, a few bad apples and then you take away the chance for any true freeform conversation. Because of this new forum, several of my comments, which weren't horrible, get banned due to the thin skinned sensibility of some of the people that use this.  No conversation can be pure when people are disallowed from speaking freely, regardless of how unfounded or vitriolic.   But in regards to the news today; whether Muslim or white bread American, young men in this country are extremely susceptible to this type of behavior. Frustration with no clue how to deal with it.
What if he looked white and was still one half black would that have made any difference? What's with this white/black stuff that you preach? Why don't you grow up and start using your head?
EVentually the wall between the US and Cuba will fall. Trump would do well to be the one to do it. Obama abandoned the people of Cuba to continuing slavery which is despicable for a Black President.
Right.  So let's go back to mob justice, and forget about evidence and facts.  If the culprit has escaped, just find the nearest black person and hang him from a tree, or the nearest non-believer and stone him to death.  It worked before, whether in the US or in the middle east, didn't it?  Who needs police or courts any more when everyone on the Internet knows the facts much better than those institutions? </sarcasm>
I'll bet your not the average Black man, who saw their incomes not keep pace with the rest of the country.  But you're right, President Obama's friends and donors on Wall St. did very well.
>>Tom Z  May be read up a little bit (civilization and modern) history? Could eventually help you deal with the the black-vs-white simpleton occupying your noggin.
