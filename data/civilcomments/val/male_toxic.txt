You are CORRECT. The "Prosperity Doctrine" IS a lie from the pit of hell. It has misled MILLIONS of people who have sacrificed their own saving to a Con Man preacher who tells them God will bless you FINANCIALLY..if you send me a check. Disgusting. I am a PROGRESSIVE Southern Baptist Minister..(retired),..and it offends me when those charlatans do that to the poor and gullible.   The Lord said in His Word..in 3 John 2  2 "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospers".  NOTICE...He wants our SOUL..(Life in Him) to prosper. Financial gain is worldly. Jesus NEVER blessed anyone financially. That "Prosperity Doctrine is from The enemy of mans Soul.   That is MY opinion. Others may disagree
Man you are just dumb Nick...just plain imbecilic.  Feel for you man.
Relegating white males to the "white trash"pile is the order of the day.  I get it.  The new paradigm is to get more women in all jobs.  I get it.  Women are 60% of college grads today.  They don't get it.  Inequalities exist.    The bad deal about the white trash pile is that it is growing,   angry about society as a whole,  and will be a  handful for the PC police,  the establishment.   Jabbing that tiger just to see it growl will have a bad ending.  It appears the liberals can't help themselves,  however.  White Trash are probably the Majority in this country.    Elites are quite  limited by the paucity of exclusive private universities where they are educated,  meet mates, and live their lives in association with each other,  yet attempt to govern this country from such a small base.  Money can't buy peace in class warfare.    Overuse of  the adjective/noun "sexist",  "bigot",  "racist",  "deplorable" and others,   will precipitate   no good,  and will shake our U.S. foundations.
"'All lives matter but certainly black, African Americans have generally been that part of the population that to some degree — in some areas — gets the short end the stick. We do matter just as much as everybody else matters.""  The impetus of these marches:  Many Americans are dumber than a sack of hammers and easily manipulated by propaganda. Where should they be marching?  How about suburban ghettos, with the toughest gun laws, run by Democrat mayors and city councils. Chicago is a perfect example of the real problem. Fifty years of welfare programs and treating black people like victims has created a dysfunctional system leading to hopelessness, crime, and perpetual poverty. Chicago is 32% white, but they commit only 3.5% of the murders. Over 96% of the murders are committed by non-whites. Essentially, it is young black men murdering other black men.  We were done when it became unacceptable to tell the public the truth without being called racist.
So what are you advocating here, that we let serial rapists continue to rape because all women are liars?  I'm talking about a case that really happened. In fact, I could be talking about any number of cases where a serial rapist attacked multiple women before being caught.  What you're talking about is imaginary.  In any case, threatening to go to police isn't a crime.  If somebody repeatedly went to police to accuse men of sexual assault, the police would know from their investigation and act accordingly.  The bottom line is that most men accused of sexual assault will not have their name published, unless they're convicted.  It's a red herring.
Personally, I would much rather be vaporized by a North Korean warhead, then go to bed knowing that one of ours has  left countless thousands of women and children writhing in agony with radiation and thermal burns.  Once again, we have bunch of stupid white and Asia men who hurl cheap threats at each other, when their peoples are wondering why they don't even make the attempt to sit down and talk. Bush didn't help things by calling this kid's dad a Pygmy. I guess Pygmy's get their backs up, if 70 subs, 700 planes and 1,000,000 men and women ca be said to be a expression of hurt feelings.  In July 1914, every European monarch knew that a general war would have catastrophic consequences---you can read it in their diaries---but they were too weak and proud to avoid it. Today we have two buffoons at the controls, whose lack of people skills make them totally unsuited to conflict resolution.   As if we are not all exposed. Where is our PM on this? Ducking? When he should be mediating?
MY FATHER WAS NOT AT FAULT ON THIS MY DAD ADAM WILSON WAS THE ON THE MOTOR CYCLE THE MAN DRIVING SWEREVED TO MISS THE BUMP IN THE RD HE HIT MY FATHER AND FLIPPED HIM SO DONT TALK ON SHIT U DONT KNOW
Simple answer. You have a penis. There's a male washroom for you. You have a vagina there's a female washroom for you. Not a hard concept to grasp, not much discussion there unless you have neither.
How many ADULT MACHO MEN did it take to kidnap, beat up, tie up and dump this girl? You guys so afraid she would kick your pathetic little asses you had to bring a gun and team up 3 and 4 of your homeboys against 1 girl??   Everyone will be better off without you in this world.
Trump is a traitorous buffoon. And a petty con man.
You would know how many people have been threatened after criticizing this man-child if you read more than fox, breitbart and drudge. It's out there. Google it. What you call whining, I call facts. You sound like your bully hero. Get back to me in six months and let's see who isn't crying, ok?
So has Christianity. This is one man, one case. There are a few boneheads but this is not "widely abused".
Well, let's imagine I create a new religion where I state the following in my holy book: - my religion is going to take over the world - anyone who does not believe in my religion is an infidel and should be killed (unless that person converts to what I believe) - anyone who joins my new religion then leaves it should be put to death - anyone who draws a picture of my prophet or insults my prophet should be put to death - my prophet was divinely inspired when having sex with his nine-year old "wife" - anyone who is gay should be put to death - a woman is worth less than a man  Could I then condemn those who disagree with me as being "phobic" about my faith?   Or, to put it another way, must we be tolerant of intolerance?
Let's stay in the rational lane for a few minutes to see where it takes us.  Priests seeking same sex sex with post-pubescents is entirely closer to "gay" than a male adult sexually abusing a girl infant.     Just trying to think through the logical consequences of these different cases.
" a known liar with no positive track record..." There's this internet thing where you can access the track record of people. Here try this for starters: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_career_of_Hillary_Rodham_Clinton  Meanwhile, the "cocky multi millionaire" you describe has a known record for his misogyny, racism, homophobia, and fomenting hatred of Mexicans, Muslims, and most sentient beings who find him repulsive and disgusting. It's a clear choice for me and many others.  I'll take the high road and vote for the most qualified candidate, not an over-baked, heavily indebted, won't-produce-his-taxes, combined version of the worst in male American behavior.
OK Carnac.  Another woefully ignorant comment from a conservative who thinks he/she can determine my income level and station in life from a single comment post.    Lynn Holden is further proof that the problem isn't Trump, rather the problem is the conservative base that would elect a man like Trump.
We will see women as popes  when Islamic men stop raping women, playing tahharush, killing gays, forcing them to cover up, not allowing them to drive, stop performing genital mutilation etc. Jk we know neither will ever happen. Now run along and make my white self a sandwich honey!!
Jennifer, are you on Clinton's payroll?  Why would any respectable, intelligent woman or man vote for or support a liar, thief and disreputable sexual predator enabler like HRC?
More like dripping with facts.  Whereas you are dripping with self-pity based upon the false theory of "reverse discrimination." Firstly, there is no such thing as "reverse discrimination. " One is either discriminated against or not discriminated against. Secondly, assuming your reference to "the majority" means white people, then you perceive minorities derive some benefit or benefits solely by virtue of their non-White skin color that you as a white man do not.  Thirdly, you feel sorry for yourself because of this perception, which is wholly unsupported by any evidence whatsoever. In fact, the opposite is true: White people as a race enjoy far more perqisites and benefits than minorities and always have. Further, they have actively worked to demean, oppress and suppress minorities. That is historical fact.
White male Anti-Globalists peacefully marching = Bad. Violent masked Globalist crypto-fascists throwing bricks = Good. Shut up slaves.  MSM
The article should read how these women will clustercuck NAFTA negotiations.  Women have no right to even vote, let alone attempt to negotiate anything.  Look what they did by voting in this man child feminist.
When Trump refused to call out Nazis and white supremacists even after a domestic terrorist killed one woman and maimed more in Charlottesville, Virginia—and then averred that “very fine people” were marching under Confederate flags—the extremists recognized the signal. When, only a week later, he pardoned Joe Arpaio—a man whom white supremacists had made a cause célèbre—they saw him in their corner again. When Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the administration was bringing the hammer down on the DACA program, he cited two lies popular among far-right nativists: That “Dreamers” take jobs away from Americans, and that the program prompted the surge in unaccompanied child immigrants (who, for the record, are not eligible for DACA status).
The Church's "definitive statement" is based on neither theology nor logic.  All God's children (male and female) are made in God's image.  That image does not reference genitalia.  Both men and women are equipped to function as priests, that is, servant-leaders.  To deny women one of the Seven sacraments because women shave their legs and not their faces is bald-faced injustice.  "Either ordain women or stop baptizing them."
Sorry Jonah--the straw man fails the smell test, he's rotten to the core. I dislike Pence because he's a 'Sunday go to meeting' Christian who has lost any sense of the god of love. His policies are aweful--he left the state for the VP because he was likely to lose reelection because the folks of his states knew and felt what he really believed...it's not the Christian God but the old Testament vengeful god he follows. So his cute and a bit strange bio wasn't the issue...although he wants to do things to Women;s right I think are a crime, he can act however he wants in private. Isn't that the real point Jonah? That he should be asked to be judged by the content of his actions, of how he chooses to love others, and the policies he uses to make life for all better. In this test he's a loser!
My brother worked for Canada Trust. He was told off the record that if it came between hiring a woman in her 20's-30's or a man, hire the man. That was 20 years ago. I'm confident the situation has only gotten worse for career minded women.  This is one of Justins dumbest ideas and will only create more so-called wage gap.
A wise man once said, " Stupid is as stupid does."
Sorry but her history speaks for itself I didn't bash the victims girl did I? Besides if your so ignorant you can't agree with a politically incorrect person then that's your beef. All name calling aside she is mos def a tramp. And you can bay at the moon all you want, sticks and stones man/woman sticks and stones.
One man's opinion vs. a long-argued and studied issue?  That's darned scientific there, professor!
Toxic behaviour isn't a masculine issue. It's a moral and character issue.  I have a son and a daughter and both have successes and challenges with sorting out right and wrong, and acting accordingly.  The writer was connecting toxic behaviour to masculinity, which is as foolish as connecting virtuous behaviour to femininity.
Give me a break. White men are in other nations killing off innocent people in response to terrorist but do nothing about the terrorist in they own backyard. Stop the race baiting already.
C. Dolan wants to prevent that Catholics will not donate money in fear that donation will be used to pay for the clergy sex abuse victims compensations.  He is spinning his little brain.  You would think a Cardinal would be a men of God, pray for the Holy Spirit's guidance instead spinning his little brain.  In light of C. D's tract record, who will trust this clergy 'conmen'?
"proud" boys are really just a bunch of gay boys.
What a joke.  I am going to round up some members of the Kalapuya tribe and come protest Wweek's ongoing use of a name appropriated from their ancestors.  The company should pay them back-royalties, and some pain and suffering for having to be reminded of the conquest of their people by the white man every time they pass a street corner and see the wweek box of papers.  This can't stand!  p.s. I wonder how many of these self centered, "look at me, I'm protesting" instagram pic posters who are at this "rally" gave even one shit about colonialism (as it is used to describe the negative aspects of british expansion, not food) before they got some alert of facebook from their "activist" group that a march was going to take place. Many probably still don't know a thing about it.   This is pathetic!
Why is it fake, how about incomplete instead (assuming that ONLY men are injured or killed, which is obviously not true)? Also what difference does it make - the point is that this will prevent injuries and deaths for Canadians in general. This is a pretty useless tangent even for you AG.
I always say, in an economy bent on making the rich richer, the poor poorer, one man's job is another man's pain in the butt. In a war-based economy, all the more so.
What a headline....."freewheeling"....more like lunacy. This man is less professional then most teenagers. Only a twit lives in a twitter world and uses it for all communication. His accusations and treatment of the media is obnoxious. Where are Wilkes Boothe and Oswald when they are really needed?
So you actually do believe the police rounded up and arrested 100% of the rioters.  400 arrests means only 400 were involved.  If they weren't arrested, they didn't take part in the riot.  Am I alone in understanding how incredibly unrealistic that is?  I don't believe Trump commented on the incident last month in Fresno when a Muslim black man shot and killed three random white guys on the street because he dislikes white people.  I guess that means Trump condones racist black on white violence.  Did you express outrage over that too?
You have shown your racist side before and now here comes your anti gay side. So you think 5 gay male nurses huh? Lmao. I would bet there was both women and men. You just upset because no one ever wants to look at your package.  You trump people all have small units and that's why y'all are so hateful. Just sayin you gomer pyle looking clown
Man look at that face. She looks like the walking dead.
Moore is a terrible example of the deeply religious. The man hates everyone who isn't a heterosexual theocrat.
I'm truly disgusted by the Alaskans who claim they are Americans embracing hate. I find it ironic that the term snowflake which was started by Trumpettes implying that liberals are delicate. Now they carry machine guns and dynamite? Please stop watching Fox it has totally hoodwinked you. As the founder of FOX news said. I want to start a network for over 50 to dead white males. That are scared. You played right into his brainwashing. If your a Christian, where did your principles go? All I see is money grubbing elitest hell bent on taking away every bit of democracy we have sent young men to war to defend. If you are ok with Russaian collusion, nepotism, out right money laundering, sexual harassment, and the loss of your rights. Keep on supporting the 45th. One day you will either die or regret the decision you thought you made. And no I did not vote for Clinton. I voted for Josnston.
Democrats have given millions of US jobs to illegal aliens and are now importing thousands of young Syrian Muslim males who, under Sharia law, treat women like dogs, believe homosexuality is punishable by death, and that all "infidels" must convert to Islam or die.  If illegal immigrants can find work so easily in America, why can't young black males?  Maybe Paul Scott knows.  Why would any woman, black or LGBT vote for a Democrat?  Along with the Kennedy brothers, Bill Clinton is among the biggest womanizers in American history.
Never did become a woman.  All internal male biological markers remain including jaw and pelvis, larger heart and lungs, and greater upper body muscle mass.  Left lunacy knows no bounds.
Why don't you care about the gun dealers that are supplying guns in ghettos? White men make a lot of money selling guns to criminals. Of course, white people refuse to take responsibility for their behavior.
I actually came to ADN to look for the article on the Kansas men who were plotting to bomb a mosque. I was interested in the article because none of the articles I found referred to these men as terrorists. They were clearly terrorists. They constantly drove by and harassed the Muslim people living in the area, and were charged with plots and weapons they planned on using. Every time there are Muslim men or women who plot to attack people for religious reasons, they are deemed terrorists. Instead of finding the Kansas article, I found this one. Again, white men terrorizing a person for religious reasons. The men are made out to be racist, but not terrorist. If a Muslim attacks a person for religious reasons, are they then racists or terrorists? Journalism can affect how the world is perceived. Please label all terrorists as terrorists, or else call them all racists. Do not change the label based on the religion or race. These men may be racists, but the are also terrorists.
Same-sex marriage doesn't "confound" orthodox Catholics whom you refer to disparagingly as trads, quite simply because it is an impossibility, it doesn't exist. Marriage can only be between a man and a woman so those who think otherwise are deluding themselves and deserving of our pity and God's mercy. It is the same with the priesthood, those who think women can be validly ordained are similarly deluding themselves and in like manner, deserving of our pity and God's mercy. All this will become clear on the Last Day.
Trump goes out of his way, every single day, to prove he is not only the worst man ever to sit in the Oval office, but one of America's worst people, period.
Tough guy wasn't so tough when the judge slammed the hammer.  Remember that all you bad boys who think you're tough.  You going start crying when they sentence you.  Or maybe hang yourself.
Hello GRWA,  Not sure why you think your post rebuts what I wrote.  Look, here are two scenarios that, to use your lens, happen in the north:  1. At a clinic, a smart female clinician teaches a smart female trainee in head cover who treat a white man who foolishly and drunkenly tore off his fingers.  2. At a clinic, a smart, white male clinician teaches a smart, white male trainee who treat a native man who foolishly and drunkenly got frostbite staggering outside after heavy drinking.  Look, you can bristle at my post all you like, but this is not about what is "pretty typical" up north, instead this is about what Canada's entertainment industry props forward as its CHOSEN samples of said events.  I suspect my reference to Liitle Mosque went over your head. Watch the first episode: Smart Muslim folks with insight face a bunch of stupid, ignorant white men in Canada. Ha, ha, ha, hardly tiresome political correctness at all (roll eyes).  Political correctness poisons entertainment.
Fortunately you are not a Christian.  Otherwise you would need to care about your fellow man (or woman).
To compare a "boob man" who looks at exposed breasts is a pervert and a criminal worthy of comparison to a rapists, is bizarre and terribly wrong. Personally speaking, I am a self-described "boob man" and will look when I can. But I don't want to get caught ogling,  I respect boobs too much.
Most alt-lefties such as yourself consider most conservative white males to be nazi sympathizers or racists, especially if they're on board with Trump.  C'mon, be honest and admit it.  BTW, alt-left are neo-marxist.
Funny how skewed these polls are. I pers hav NVR been polled & can guar just like w/ US fed elect, all results skewed &/or biased. Trump has a lot of supporters in Cda, incl women like myself. His stupid "off the cuff" remark about grabbing women by the p***y was a JOKE! GET OVER IT! I've heard far worse come out of men's mouths. If gen pop can't see it as jk, just proves what a lot of us ANTI SJW/feminazi's say. They're precious little snowflakes who can't tk a jk! Also applies 2 members of my own fam, all thx to MSM propagating him as sick misogynist, while promoting Killary who's husb impeached 4 having sexual relations w/ intern! Not 2 mention flew multiX, even ditching SS, on CONVICTED PEDOPHILE Jeffrey Epstein's Lolita Express. - Fr Wash Times: http://bit.ly/1Wxqzv6 Wmn came fwd & gave testimony Killary threatened them if they came fwd about rape by him. Fr Daily Wire http://bit.ly/2cQDYNI Just do a quick google search, doesn't tk much 2 #FactCheck
Just like Jesus would do right man of god?  Bomb them back to the stoneage, what are you a thirteen year old boy?  I love the warhawk crowd that are well beyond the age to serve in the military. They seem to be very flippant with the lives of our young men and women.
man the sick delusional stupidity you live in is out this morning, get some professional help
Canada has a witch hunt of straight males, Azerbaijan has a witch hunt of lesbian women.  - The irony is not lost.
The poor hypocritical left...  White male privilege is bad... so let's gush over Justin Trudeau  Religion is bad... so let's gush over a Sikh
Of course Trump blames the black guy.  Hurricane Maria was the fault of Puerto Ricans.  The Jews caused Nazis.   Blacks force themselves to be abused by the cops.
How about ADN does an article on young people being stupid robbing the dope man or the dopeman is just robbing people and what it cost these fools.
Simple;  Canadians want and need politically correct content .  They particularly need and want content that show white men as backwards selfish stupid louts and women ,  coloured people and muslims as surperior human beings..  if you keep the focus on this approach as you have been doing people will continue to love canadian content
That is wonderful..!  You probably are a really good man, and your children sound well raised.  My wife as well is not a feminist, thank goodness, so we have lived a conflict free life, raised two adult children who are successful, and are so appreciative and happy in our GENDER roles and life together.  Gender roles today equal a crime to these rabid, family destroying feminists.
Anchorage and indeed the entire state have been held hostage by Prevo's irrational extremist views. The mansion surrounded by razor wire complete with 2 guard dogs should tell us all we need to know. He is not a religious man. He is a con artist
Watch your resources men.  As women get older, their single focus in life is how to acquire your resources.  Be warned.
What's ridiculous is women claiming to have any understanding whatsoever of what masculinity is or means to a man. Shall we call it womansplaining?  That's what's ridiculous.
and another who would welcome violence , man you are sick
This protest was as clear as Clinton's campaign.....  what was it about again? Oh ya, we are women hear us complain.   Perhaps that's one of the reasons Clinton lost, no clear message, just, I am a woman and that should be enough.   Lets go boys, put on your penis hats and penis signs and lets tell the world we are men.
And I said I'm a man of my word! Guess you'll never be able to prove that since your the one that wimped and don't take the bet! Unlike you I pay ANY bet or debt I have! Truth is you wouldn't win and you know it. I'll take you on anyyyyy day lil man anyyyy day. If you forgot I said I know my odds!!! You can't always call your shots fool. I just proved that!! Now go play with yourself  on that  video poker machine. Maybe someday you'll really learn how to bet.... Or better yet ACCEPT BETS!!
Another fanatical hysterically biased writer.  People like this man are destroyingour society and thank god they weren't around when Canada was built.
I am - for the first time in my life - objecting strongly to OLD WHITE MEN - ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH GRAY HAIR. Thanks GOP. You have convinced me you stand for NOTHING.
Can I use their safe space when they start in with their white male hate talk?
You prove the point.  White males make up maybe 35% of Canada's population (depending on who is included as "white").  So why do you think white male identity is the norm when really you're just another minority identity group?  And of course who is included as "white" is a whole other topic.  If you're a Syrian immigrant you're not white, whereas maybe if you're the son of a Syrian immigrant, say Steve Jobs, you would be welcomed in the Proud Boys' fantasy of white Western men who invented everything of value the modern world.
I'm a male small business owner who saved funds in the corporation so that I could take time off after our kids were born to stay at home, help my wife and help look after the newborn. That was my "paternity leave". Now Trudeau is saying that I was a "tax cheat"...and he is going to close that loophole and make it only available to females?  What if I need that time to look after an elderly parent or to deal with a family illness? Lots of enlightened organizations make "family leave" available to all employees regardless of gender....they do it because because it is now 2017!     Now I'm even more enraged at these Liberal idiots! The hypocrisy is absolutely sickening.
He said "Have you seen this guy" then started shaking in a mocking of his illness.  It was right after he made mention of the reporter and was exactly the same moving that the reporter does due to his illness.  This is something we would punish our children for doing. The fact that a bunch of adults are just blowing if off because their side won is silly at best.
The reason that Obama won't point his finger at the perps, be they cops or gunmen is because, undeniably, he is one of Them. He belongs to the group that commits the most crime, the most murders, the most robberies, is the most violent. He can't escape that obvious fact. You are right. Obama will never utter the simple truth: Men are violent.
Why? Your situation is still orders of magnitude than the men, and your ancestor would kill to be in your situation.  Your great, great grandmom would say "what, I get to fuck 30 different men in a year, get pregnant when I want but only when they want, spend the time I spend with house work doing all needed house work and working outside, having all the kids fathers involved with the kids and with porn, movies and internet? And you fools are complaining your aren't pampered enough, that you don't feel that there's a man who'll risk their life for you and fuck you even though you are safer than anyone I ever knew were and that saddens your hooha but you come with some molarkey of how it makes you feel unfulfilled? (it does, but we all know why) You embarrass your ancestors! Because that's what we worked so hard for you to get."
Mr. Putin, a man who says what he means....and means what he says! How refreshing! No bag lady in the Oval office ranting and raving with her pant suit cabal of pointy hats and parked broomsticks! Thank you for bringing stability to Syria and preventing our Marxist-feminist, Islam loving, shiny pony and poor selfie excuse of a leader, from flooding us out with a few hundred thousand more future terrorists!
No, I don't remember all those cases of males being busted for having sex with other males.  But based on your statement, are you saying that it's wrong for males to have sex with males?  Libs would label you as an intolerant gay-basher.  No, I don't remember what you cite, but I do remember Weiner texting his.  Lol.
Again globe, why not a comment section on these cowardly  refugees. They should stay and fight for thier own freedom , we should not be sending our men and women to die for these cowards. They come here and destroy what we have  built for our country, not them. You love them pothead and you to globe,  pick up a rifle and go fight them yourselves. Oh, my had you to are gutless cowards.
Thankyou, Jim. The leaders in SNAP are my friends as well. From what I have observed, they have a love for the Church for what it could be, if the leaders were being faithful to Jesus. I have to ask how any pope or bishop can face Jesus, when they have deliberately chosen for too many years to ignore the command of Jesus to protect the innocence of children and instead protect the sexual predators among them and ignore the children. How is it that parents are still supporting this arrogant group of men? Please see the movie SPOTLIGHT to understand more the cover up and lies by the Church and by what politicians, lawyers, judges, police, and parents are letting the Church get away with. It is very sad that people are still believing the words, and not the actions of the Church leaders.
Trump is the man! He should throw that lady in jail who came up with that lie, or at least tell her to get a real hat 😁
Men seek to dominate the priesthood because they are jealous of female fertility
Exactly dixylicious!  It's called ACTING.  Originally, woman were not allowed in theaters and men dressed up as woman and played their parts too.  That's why they have ACTING awards, because it is not easy to act as someone you aren't.  People on these streams are so hung up on race.  Just silly. Ya, got to ask yourself who the REAL racists are?
Trump couldn't believe a Black man became president. So he ran and is failing every test so far. I'm the only Alaska Native with a Pulitzer Prize medallion on my desk. Of course you will refuse to believe me because I'm Native. Doesn't change a thing.
It was a car full of young African males that the anti-Trumps tried to stop on the bridge.
Your wit is too much! You are burning my retinas with your biting social commentary....Especially the part about how evil Caucasians are. I've never ever heard *that* before. However, you are so right. Whenever I see one of those filthy Caucasians, I just assume they are serial killers and I go sit in my basement and rock back and forth and chant "sexist, racist, bigot, Islamophobic, Cis scum, white man" to purge myself.
Don't act like you are a superior white man from Los Angeles or New York and no one will tell you to go back to the mainland. Maybe you should say something like "I love Hawaiian food and music."
This fool will do everything in his power to try and dilute the incoming government's power to act.  I would say that borders on him being a traitor to his own country.  A most disgusting little man.
What none of the defenders of an all-male priesthood want to come right out and say is, "in order to confect a sacrament a penis is required." Sounds uncouth, I know, but that's basically the argument.
"I'm glad the shooter was not any kind of minority."   He is a minority.  White male.
John, a man is gay if he WANTS to have sex with other men. It does not matter if he engages in sexual acts with other men. That part is a choice: to be openly gay or not. A gay man who pretends to be straight is still a gay man.
Bradford Long, U R a douche! None of the protest makes any sense! The Rams recievers did their hands up don't shoot bullshit  over 2 yrs ago & I stopped watching then. ANY NFL player that goes along with protest bcs he is worried about NOT being PC is a faggot THEY CAN ALL be GARBAGE men like the fathers they DONT know or NEVER met. PHUC'em!
Why don't you explain to me the evolutionary value of a man sticking his penis in another man's bum and how whatever value you can find offsets the potential for anatomical damage and infection that it creates.  Seems to me that that is what makes the inclination and learned behavior in response intrinsically disordered.
That is why they all went to downtown Chicago for the March there I guess - Inauguration tickets.   And yep right now Sean Spicer is being mocked as an idiot and is a ridiculous meme on Twitter.  The man should have just kept his dignity and went to the private sector or K Street like other GOP consultants with an ounce of self-respect did in June.  I don't think that Spicer is going to be able to find a job after Trump kicks him to the curb and that is an actual fact.
I asked you for your thoughts on why a white male chose an event that was attended by a predominantly white audience to accomplish his unimaginable massacre. Still waiting for a reply. I could give a sh-- what you think about me but I'm stating facts while you twiddle out opinions.
Aw. Are the minorities threatening your white, male status?
If Obama, a black man, a Latino American or a Muslim group declared Donald Trump winning the presidency ONLY because he was a WHITE MAN and he had little else going for him except THAT (insinuating he was a WHITE MAN) you would be condemning all as racist.  . Above you clearly state  "On the premise that he was a black man. He had very little going for him than that" (insinuating his color or being a black man). . Earlier Gene Miller writes "His genetic color is only "relevant" to a racist."  . Your statement clearly is based on his genetic color and his color being relevant to his winning the election.  . Gene Millers words, Nor do I "insinuate" that Obama is a black man.  Gene states, He had very little going for him than "THAT", what does "THAT" mean?   You continue to prove my point.   Are you a racist? In your words, YES.
wow bunch angry comments here or dirty..i mean grumpy old man... lol
Sure it would be incestuous, so?  See, if you argue that homosexual sodomy should not be repulsive, then you cannot NOT argue that incest is not repulsive.    As the Ancient Greeks' pederasty culture teaches us, homosexual acts are a function of culture, not innate attraction.  They are not genetic.  More homosexual men out of the closet will lead to more incidents of same-sex sodomy acts and more people adopting a homosexual identity.
Emmonak, 816 people. But so much violence. The village keeps popping up in the news. Late night. Alcohol? Drugs? Over a woman? Stabbing a man 7 times, beating another man and slashing a women in the face. Is that the subsistence lifestyle we here about? And hopefully he will live a subsistence lifestyle in jail for a long time at State expense. The POS will never make the victims whole will he? Is this a good case for an eye for an eye? 7 stabs. Face slashing so he is easily identified as a stabber, bully and women beater. Let us give the guy who hit him with a log a medal. He deserves it, maybe, unless he was the one that gave them drugs/alcohol or whatever. Violent rage. Never good. Emmonak probably has many/mostly good people I am sure but you need to police your own and fix what ever is broken. Take anything and everything this POS has or will ever have and give it to the victims. Actually, I am tired of taking care of your village trash. Start your own subsistence jail. raise tax
A society that embraces abortion rights makes their women cheap, accessible, and exchangeable to wicked men.
wow the left wing lunatics will completely destroy our economy with bs like this based on what, the fantasy of man changing the climate with carbon, now its expanding to demand all investment ,, there is no end to the brain washed ignorance and activist destruction of our society under these nutjobs,, investors will take their money out of canada and our economy will crash..
''What has your pointing and illuminating accomplished so far?'' it's got us a spotlight on an international disgrace, disaster, and a very likely future despot who screams at ''fake news'' TV sets in the White House when he's not screaming at his justice obstructing AG and anybody else kneeling in front of him as he incriminates himself further with every irrepressible tweet. ...sad. ''Has it produced more jobs'' probably more than the guy with all the promises has so far '' Has it won special elections in Georgia and South Carolina?'' closer than ever before ''Has it reduced violence in Chicago?'' your guy flew over Chicago a few times Has it reduced illegal immigrants on our southern border?'' has it forced out intellectuals? professionals? mothers? children? mid-E. Christians? heroic war interpreters? btw, where is that wall which will cost US $BILLIONS$? or that 30 day plan to defeat ISIS, now he's joining ISIS? but, you're more concerned with peace loving pussy hats? oh, COVFEFE!
Still so many gay men in the priesthood.   A fact that makes us all uncomfortable.
Completely agree--women complain that men are "superficial" but women today are just as bad--I can't tell you how many women couldn't wait to meet when I first talked to them on the phone but after they laid eyes on me in person-the look on their faces/body language made it clear they wanted to get this date overwith ASAP (one woman even pulled out her money to pay for the coffee that was served so she could leave in a hurry)--there was a study done in 2013 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (author Andrea Meltzer) that showed that the attractiveness of a man had absolutely NO effect on the success of a relationship/marriage---which means any woman who judges a man on his appearance is a LOSER
Hillary and the woman at facebook ARE THE PROBLEM!  Those two morons cant tell me how i am or what i need.  What we need is less man hating feminists and professors harping about their out of touch insane reality to our kids and inciting hate and violence.  STOP MANUFACTURING GARBAGE AND STOP RUINING OUR HOME!
No!  We need more frilly duds made from Irish grandmothers' lace curtains!  By golly, they were what definitely filled the seminaries in the bad old daze!  Isn’t it odd that Catholic clergy have to dress like mother in order to act like father?   Seminarism:  trying to make a priest out of a man by dressing him like a girl and treating him like a boy.
This stuff seems pretty crazy but I do remember some of this craziness when I was taking my engineering degree. Of course us engineers in training, whether we were white, brown, blue, male or female, were too busy working to be whining.  And given all the interviews we do of graduating engineers for our firm, it feels like these whiners do represent a loud but very much small minority because the candidates sure want to make sure we know they are not from the perpetual victimhood crew and just want to  be known as smart and hard working and won't start crying just because they make a mistake on a project and are held accountable.
Whether the Supreme Court upholds Trump's ban or not the point is the ban was clearly intended to discriminate against Muslims and so constitutes an attack on the First Amendment. And if Trump could he would shut down his antagonists in the press because he's a dictator wannabe who admires murderous authoritarian strongmen like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un and, of course, Vladimir Putin, and, to the horror of everyone, has extended an invitation to the White House to Rodrigo Duterte.  Your ingenue act was old three years ago.
An offender committed a heinous act against a women.  This was many years ago.  The offender "became rehabilitated" and had "turned into a nice guy."  He said and did all the right things and became eligible for parole.  The judge agreed that he had turned his life around.  He was going to grant him parole until he met with the victim.  The judge told the offender he would grant him parole when his victim recovered.  To grant him parole while the victim still suffered is not justice.  So,  Ingrid, your post is nothing but fluffy baloney.
There are lies, damned lies, and statistics. There is no gender pay gap. Women get paid the same as men when doing the same jobs with the same seniority. However, if you examine what women and men take in university - where women outnumber men - you'll find that, overwhelmingly, female students choose the soft sciences and liberal arts. Where are they outnumbered? Engineering, computer sciences, and other 'non people skill' programs. And these programs just happen to be much higher paying, on average than say sociology or psychology. or English Literature. Too bad, so sad. Likewise, women in professions don't, on average, put in the same time as men. They care more about their families (for which, kudos to them) than climbing the greasy corporate ladder. Their reward is a better life, and fewer promotions. I'd take that bargain myself, to be honest.
Notey is obviously more concerned with garnering the votes of Muslim men than she is with the liberation of oppressed Muslim women.  Cynical.
"Women are not all of the same affinity any more than all men."    I never said "all" women had the exactly same interests. Is that really what you thought I meant? Really? To say there's a natural affinity among women is self-evident. If it were otherwise, there'd be no basis for Women's Studies, or "Women's Rights." Women, in general, have similar interests. As do men, in general. Your resort to arguing about a hetero man going to a gay rights parade and proclaiming his affinity to the men there is pathetic, precisely because gay men have so little affinity with men in general, the vast majority of whom are hetero. Your hypo intentionally overlooks that I was talking about men and women in general.  As to you other pathetic hypo, the Church requiring private sex acts to be ordained.  Somewhere, there IS such a church. Does it oppress you?  Your DOJ hypo doesn't work, either. I have a civil right, protected by law, not to be discriminated against for such a job.  Like priesthood?  No.
Stop whining, girly-man.  Told you we're done.  I "win", if that's what you call it, because your arguments were emotion-driven babbling and tantrums devoid of facts which exposed your own fear and hatred for all rational people to see.  And you weren't paying attention.  I just conceded that I'd LOST the debate, remember?  Now go seek negative attention from someone who will take you seriously.  Khalas.
A man who claims he is not like other humans, that he is above temptation, is not only dangerous and a fool, he is not telling the truth.
Trade or cut CJ; he cant get damn yard when he NEEDS to. Thats all. Not the expected production. Thats all. Why keep holding on?? Thats all. Move on, man.
Leyton was an extremely smart man! We as kids worked for the Laybourns. Leyton was always respectful to his father..Stan Laybourne was a drunk and shifty man..I hope he rots in prison..that's where assholes deserve to be. R.I.P Leyton! You WILL be missed..
You obviously have no problem listening to--and DEFENDING--"Amy the Talking Mule" when she reviles and slanders innocent people because of their Faith, seeks to deny others aid programs she herself took advantage of, and gets all self-righteous despite foisting another guy's bass-turd on her then-husband.  "Thou shalt not commit adultery."  Right.  Think what you want.  I already KNOW those ethically-challenged, sanctimonious hypocrites calling themselves "Christians" while defending the indefensible aren't good people.  Hypocrisy (fasiq) is the second-worst spiritual crime, exceeded only by idolatry itself.  Your Book records that the Messiah (alayhis-Salaam more harshly denounced hypocrites than anyone else:  "WOE unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, HYPOCRITES!  Ye REFUSE to enter the Kingdom of God and would hold the door against those who would enter!"  My favorite of Jesus' speeches--and English translators 'toned it down'.  He actually said, "D@MN you Scribes and Pharisees..." etc.
"But I do believe Trump's violent rhetoric and sexually aggressive, hyper-masculine, entitled behavior has given the white men who would vote for him permission to return to openly expressing a craving for power and a sense of entitlement that is dangerous to anyone who isn't a white, heterosexual man, or who doesn't identify as such." Perhaps "Make America Great Again" refers to this "return to openly expressing a craving for power and a sense of entitlement".
"Everywhere man is born free, yet everywhere he is in chains." The ANC fought for freedom and non racialism. The fought for freedom to restrict the freedom of others.. they fought for no racialism to introduce their own brand of racialism. "Oh, How odd of God to choose a Jewish God, to spurn the Jews.
Let this man sit face to face with Mr. Trump. Say what you feel to him. Go ahead get it out. I dare him. Trump will chop him up like a fresh salad. People that hop on the CNN and fire off fake facts make me crack up! Lmao. Show some proof would ya cnn? Oh that's right, your home of the nothing burger. Say that shit to Trump's face on national TV and get cut down to size. Trump would embarrass you.
Agreed.  I think the real question here is not hatred, which really only exists in very, very few people, but the length to which we should go when accommodating groups and individuals.  Surely any religious practice that marginalizes any sex should not be encouraged, or even tolerated.  For me, it isn't, say, the wearing of a hijab that is the problem, I think they look stylish actually, but the reasons why: to protect her from being molested by men, limit extra marital affairs, so they be known as Muslim women and be considered off-limits to Muslim men. (Islam.org, BTW).   This attitude absolves men from responsibility in their actions, and  makes non-Muslim women targets for unacceptable behaviour.  Why every women who believes in equal rights isn't fighting against this is beyond me.   Worrying about this, among other things, and how it effects the rest of Canadians is not hate.  It is a valid concern.  We have to stop calling it hate, bigotry, or xenophobia.
You don't seem to be looking beyond your life experience. I served the public in Oregon for more than 30 years. I know more about white people than you. The lies told about white people by white people don't effect my judgement. I deal with facts. You want to ignore the role of whiteness in this country because it gives you rights the rest of us don't get, like being considered innocent until proven guilty. Black folks can be shot dead in the street by white cops for merely being suspected of having a gun. White men can get away with arguing with a cop while having an AR-15 slung over his shoulder. The Bundy family comes to mind. That family would be dead today if they were black and threatening government employees with guns.
Right. A Church that says "women are inferior to men" is something for women to hold on to.
Anal between males is found a lot in evolution as a form of domination.  That it has involved into a loving consensual act is evolutionary progress.  Anti-homosexuality is a backlash against the second class sexuality of sex with women in the ancient world, but now I am repeating myself.  If you want to really go down the up with women road, support female ordination, a married priesthood and the ending of the practice of Continence, which shows just what the clergy really think about procreative sex.
Upper middle class white woman talking about "us" and "action".   Are you picking up a gun sweetheart?  Of course not. Upper middle class white women will do what they've done for a hundred years. Hand out white feathers to MEN. Men who are to shed their BLOOD to go fight in another middle eastern craphole (and defend our freedoms or something), because Lizzie's feewings were hurt after reading twitter comments from a "seven year old girl".
Trudeau's Liberals took careful aim at their feet and blew their heads off.  Good job!  (Man, this new commenting system is stupid.)
The usual rich Republican denial:  I had no knowledge of the content of this man's character prior to my donating millions to his campaign despite every aspect of his public life for the past 40 years.  I thought he was just one of my fellow billionaires looting the system like good boys all should.  Now that it might bite me in my personal butt, I must deny, deny, deny just like Donald.
here is the stupidest man on the planet, and his puppet, eh Butts. $#@! up Ontario and a national disgrace as well. Admit it, you are an idiot, proved it in Ontario under lying Dalton and just moved to the National stage.
should we be like liberals. ?  •should I accuse all gay men of being predators?
I would say I'm using "nobody" and "everybody" colloquially and pretty much literally. Yes, I am being righteous. I spent 10 years watching DanceHer. I had friends giggle while they talked about he "wouldn't take no for an answer" or how "if he decided he wanted to fuck you, that was pretty much it. He'd fuck you." I had other male friends discuss how he was the "perfect gateway or finishing school" for young women to enter into the Seattle hippie community.  That's only perfect if your ideal woman has been sexually traumatized and has difficulty asserting her boundaries. I had a trusted male friend tell me if I chose to engage with DanceHer, none of my boundaries would be respected. Condoms would not be used. My preference for sober sex would not be permitted to happen.  I had young men come up to me and tell me how "amazing" DanceHer was. I would respond with, "Hmmmm...yeah, he's a sexual predator." They'd look at me in shock and wonder why I was being so mean-spirited.
Another white dude stealing the black man's thunder.....
Tim-  This worthless trash will do jail time and we will learn who his daddy is during his time in jail.  I don't think this trash will appreciate who his new daddy is but over time he'll accept what his new daddy does to him as he'll have no choice! Do you think his new daddy will be a leg man?
Mr. Dalton:  I"m one of those "white liberals" who optimistically hoped the election of President Obama signaled movement toward "post-racial/racist" America."such a fool was I."  Instead, it opened the floodgates of racism as millions of "loyal, true, America-loving Patriots" attacked our President with every racist/xenophobic epithet known.  He was not just a "N#$%$#", he was a "N$#%$" who wasn't even born in America."    We now have a GOP Presidential candidate who openly parades his racism and xenophobia..and his followers love it.    I ask myself, "can we really elect such a man to be our President?"  Is the hatred and bogotry Mr. Trump's actions and comments have disclosed really OK with a majority of American voters? Do those who approve and support such a view really represent today's America?  I never believed a person like Trump could win the GOP nomination..I was so very wrong. Now I can't, in my heart, believe such a man can be elected President..I hope I'm not wrong again
This man says nothing about holding predator priests accountable.  I hope SNAP continues to advocate for victims of sexual abuse in Alaska.  Silence from "church leaders" is why Alaska remains a predator friendly state.  And the leader in the nation for violence against women and children.
Man why you spittin on minorites...not cool bruh. Probably mad you are as orange as Trump because off all that Doritos Dust piled up in your mom's basement.  Agheee bruh
He deserves the same fate as those brave men that died trying to find his deserting a$$.
I bet she was warned by her family and friends about marrying the foreign guy, but she dismissed it all Islamophobia and racism.  Her heart knew what true love is and she wasn't going to let stupid people like her mother and father tell her what to do.
Feminism is a hate group. Their mission is to tear down men and destroy masculinity. Feminists are hateful, sexist people. They go out of their way to prove it to the world at every conceivable opportunity.
It's only "crass & tasteless" if you have a mangina, you're pathetic. Hand in you're man card.
Thanks for this. Anyone who thinks for 2 seconds that racism, white supremacy and the oppression of blacks is worse today, or even worsening, needs to grab a mid-19th century history book and read up on Jim Crow and the humiliating & un-American things it did every day to  ten million blacks in the South circa 1948.  Read U.S. Senator Bilbo's "best" quotes, delivered in the Senate or on the stump in Mississippi. Trump's idiot tweeting and clumsy or inadvertent race baiting can't compare to the least bigoted Southern congressmen of that era. It was the Southern Dems in Congress like Bilbo and his ilk who protected Jim Crow from federal spanking for 7 decades while Northern Dems like FDR coddled or ignored Jim Crow's blatant sins to keep the "Solid South's" electoral vote in presidential elections. My 1948 history "30 Days a Black Man" details black lives under America's apartheid in the South.  Rothstein's great "The Color of Law" details how racist govt. policies segregated the North.
i can appreciate hope but Canada doesn't deal with the same degree of disagreement regarding how we treat our fellow citizens. A man like the dumpster would have never been a consideration for prime minister of Canada.
President Man Baby is only being the man baby we've known him to be. How anyone could've voted for this empty-headed greed monkey is beyond me.
Oregon is last in the Nation for graduating white kids from high school.  The holdover  "white trash" expendable honky from 1550 Great Britain to the Colony is still with us.  400 years of education research,  undeniable now,  says that boys are two years behind girls in emotional development,  brain development,  physical development,  than girls of the same age,  yet we still send them to public school to share a room and teacher.  98% a female teacher.  With female cohorts and administrators,  to try to give girls a boost in STEM and send rambunctious,  can't help themselves,  boys to detention for being much more immature than girls of the same age.  Doing the same thing,  over and over,  expecting a different result,  is institutional insanity,  and does not deserve a dime of public money.  Boys should be in class with boys,  girls with girls.  Education research tells us that both do better in single sex education environment.  Unions kill science,   not a President Elect.
Mariam Williams argues that men crave power over women. But she fails to note that Hillary Clinton craves power over defenseless children in the womb. She supports the "right" of women to abort any child--African-American, Hispanic, Caucasian, Native-American, and so on.
No doubt.  Sex Robots will be great freedom for men.
"The church has become increasingly aware of the harm experienced by victims, of their suffering and of the need to listen to them," Johnny on the spot. Marie Collins couldn't get these Vatican transubstantiators to even respond to letters of children, now adults, raped by priests, bishops and etc etc.   It is clear what these men value and it isn't children or their families. What must they do before they are no longer allowed on altars of worship? AW
As the mother of sons, I can only tell you what they say: women want it both ways. They want parity with men but they want the man to pick up the check, hold the door, be protective. They want advanced university degrees but, on average, get lower scores on SATs, MCATs, GREs, GMATs. Behind every man they see a rapist, misogynist. Having hosted many of these young women in our home, I can say they are often lovely and surprisingly traditional in their approach to life, motherhood, etc. but mention Women's Rights and they become uncharacteristically hostile and, worse, clueless. Look to the poisonous effects of universities and media. They have an agenda and most women don't realize they are being used as pawns.
I'm wondering if the interracial chick is letting her man know that her parents are racist? I tell you what, if it was me, I'd like to know. Especially as a black person in America. It's important.  But then again, if she up with mommy and daddy then mommy and daddies bigotry will prevail and there isn't anything she can do but suck it the funk up. Next.
And yet when Trumpty-Dumpty or Rush ("he just LOVES little black Dominican boys!") Limbaugh say unpleasant things about black folks, that's OK because it's "freedom of expression."  Double-standard much?  Oh yeah, and this is what Muhammad 'Ali (rah'matullahi alayhi) said about Frazier after their third fight: "I always bring out the best in the men I fight, but Joe Frazier, I'll tell the world right now, brings out the best in me. I'm gonna tell ya, that's one helluva man, and God bless him."  Funny neither you nor Flowers thought to mention that.
"The case has been complicated by the lack of Canadian diplomatic staff in Iran as a result of the former Conservative government’s decision to close down the embassy and sever relations."   Hypocrisy at its finest by the Conservatives who demand diplomatic action but did their best to destroy all diplomatic relations with Iran.  While this is a truly unfortunate case, there's likely little the government can do anyway since women have fewer custody rights than men in most middle east countries.
Yeah. but what does the idiot, opps, sorry, president want...  The man is going to case WWIIII if someone doesn't get him under control.  This guy can run a business that he owns, but running an international major power is not the same f....ing thing! When will his supporters realize this ONE simple FACT!
No one believes the "one-in-four" statistic.   I'd say at least 1 in 4 women or MORE---are bat-sh*t-crazy,  obsessed with feminism and hatred of males, however.
Evil men.
Arm wrestling!  Don't teach him that type of masculinity.  If you start with arm wrestling then when he grows up he will sexually harass employees.  Didn't you learn anything from Denise Balkisson's column?
There is no Pride anymore, only Shame. She is a hate filled racist and homophobe. She hates the gay white men who created Pride in the first place and is determine to steal it for her own political ends. If the thousands of gay men of Toronto stop supporting Pride she will hate them even more. All she will do is destroy it entirely if she stays on this path of bigotry and division.
The police follow due process, they don't take alleged sexual assaults lightly, as the male writer would want us to believe. It's all part of the feminist agenda and their supporters to obtain guaranteed successful prosecutions in favor of the alleged victim, regardless of evidence.
Lol I hope you say the same thing when it comes to child molestation and perversion because most convicted offenders are white males but you don't see me blaming a race for that problem. Thankfully for me I don't blame "white" people for sexual abuse  and instead a problem we should ALL be attacking. We all know your a troll Wavemaker no matter what side of the political spectrum your seeking attention from. Grow up and get some real political arguments, this isn't MySpace my top ten.
Milo is an openly gay man purports to be a Catholic and does part of his hate routine in drag.  The Cardinal Newman Foundation should have itself in vapors if such a character comes to a Catholic university.   Milo might corrupt the students and turn them gay.
I'm assuming you're talking about sending Bill Clinton back to the White House the only person regularly flies to a private island to have sex with children and who has great at least 40 women who have filed complaints... You are right we don't want that man anywhere near our children or our government
I now see that President George H Bush, the senior father who served in WWII, has now been accused of a sex abuse very much like this 4 years ago, by an actress who is a lifelong Democrat, and an ardent Feminist.   He apparently molested her from his wheelchair.    Such, filthy, dirty men these Republicans are!   How can we stop these Republican perversions from taking place???
Nolz, there is  confusion on your part about what constitutes "inclusion". It means to validate and empower marginalized groups. Because a predominantly white male police force represents a power structure, it cannot be a target of exclusion and discrimination - only those from marginalization and - in the case of BLM - violence can be.
Thank you, Sr Joan.  This election was devastating to me as an American, as a christian.  Devastating not only because a totally unqualified, uneducated in policy issues, con man manipulated voters by playing on their fears and prejudices, but also for what it says about what has happened to our country.  The ideals of America - the shining city on the hill, the ideals engraved on the Statue of Liberty (give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free) - are gone, destroyed by voters who chose a man whose statements and rhetoric are both un-christian and un-American.  America now turns its back on those who suffer.  Jesus said to love, not to hate.   What has happened to the American people that they would choose such a man?  Hillary was very flawed in countless ways. But her flaws, weaknesses and even lies pale next to those of the man who was elected. His were beyond any normal political candidate - yet he won.  A demagogue.  I weep for our country.
Roy! I thought we had a positive relationship and open lines of communication! I feel betrayed by you! I just want to dialogue with my community & you are bullying me with your mansplaining! Of course a straight MALE like you feels like it's OK to tell me, a lesbian woman, to be silent! That right there is cis heteronormative male privilege! Triggered!!!
Well, look he works for. A loser pResident who brags about sexually assaulting women ("grab them by the p***y"), playing childish games when merely shaking hands (toxic masculinity, not actual masculinity), taking to Twitter every time his delicate snowflake-like sensibilities get offended, etc.    It's entirely appropriate that this clown of a pResident surrounds himself with people like that.
I didn't vote for friendship.  I voted for Trump because I felt he was the last chance America had to stay afloat.  Had Hillary been elected we'd be drowning in our own blood spilled by the millions of Muslims she wanted to "immigrate". And we all know there would have been thousands of jihadists at least, who would manage to infiltrate the millions of poor, de-humanized Muslims, worthy to immigrate. That's just for starters.  Second, show me one politician that doesn't lie.  Third, show me any man who has not lied.  I could go on and on Gary, but you have to admit, America IS getting better.  And if the swamp  would get out of the way, we'll achieve  our former greatness sooner.  And those "hundreds of documented lies"? Fake News.
What a selfish, narrow-minded remark! This man has performed thoughtful reviews of all the arts for 50 years. Get over yourself.
Whaaaaaaaat the Duck:  Send ALL ILLEGALS back.  Male, Females, Children, Chihuahuas.    Clear up jail space.  Built the WALL, Keep them OUT.............  If you are here LEGALLY,  Welcome, Obey the Laws, Have a good Life...............
"Sessions talked Tuesday of improving morale in local police departments, which he maintained had been unfairly maligned, and he notably refused to commit to leaving unchanged consent decrees mandating changes at certain departments."   Still the same old "let the police run wild" ( as long as white people arent killed) racist jerk who was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 because he referred to a black colleague as "boy," used the N word freely and "joked" about liking the KKK until he heard they liked marihuana. Same Sessions who blocked black judges from nomination and sitting on the bench when he headed the judiciary committee.  It just gets worse and worse.
How DARE you reduce all people to only two genders (men/women).  Take your racist homophobic bigotry somewhere else.
When Liberals like you get in touch with your "inner child",..it is lauded!....LOL....no one called a man-baby.....hypocrites.
Ramadan Chokr is a hypocrite when he claims concern for the safety of others, given that his own organization officially endorses spousal abuse.    The imam of the Sammamish Mosque, Wassim Fayed, published a video of one of his lectures (http://www.popmodal.com/video/7382/US-Imam-Allah-is-clear-you-can-hit-your-wife) in which he explained to the men of the mosque that they should hit their wives if they refuse to wear the hijab.  This video demonstrates that wearing hijabs isn’t as voluntary as Muslims (and their American aiders and abettors on the “multicultural” left) would like us to believe.  Muslims need to learn that hitting women is unacceptable, illegal, and immoral.  And when you see Muslim women wearing their symbols of oppression and second-class citizenship at the local mall, don’t criticize or harass them.  It is likely that they’re wearing their hijab involuntarily and under threat of violence.
Let's not fool ourselves. Canada quietly rewrote the rules governing the export of arms to other countries. No longer do such exports hinge on whether the recipient nation is a human rights abuser. Instead, the Canadian rules now strive to "balance the economic and commercial interests of Canadian business" with this country's "national interest." What does that tell you? It doesn't matter if its 'legal', it is abundantly immoral, the Royal Saudi Air Force are bombing Yemini hospitals, ports, warehouses, factories, schools, markets and homes.  Not only is SA committing atrocities, but these are capitalist wars, and have nothing to do with the working man/woman, it is disgusting SA is an ally.
And yet, Trump women are so used to being denigrated, that they actually enjoy Mr. Trump and think he's wonderful and apparently wouldn't mind a little crotch grabbing themselves.  "After all, what does it hurt?  Silly women being so sensitive, men will be men."  I wish the lot of them would go away somewhere far far far away and live happily ever after.  And then the Trump men are here, like most abusers, blaming the victims.  Gee.  I guess the definition of 'greatness' has changed a lot in the recent years.
Please allow a black man, a guy who knows what profiling is from the wrong end of a pistol, explain it to you.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwfvRbAK2IM
Being called "Climate Barbie" is quite generous and civil compared to the gutless comment PM Zoolander mumbled under his breath while in Opposition  referring to Peter Kent as a "Piece of sh!*".  At least the tweet was open and honest rather than a gutless and cowardly mumble.  Oh wait.   Peter Kent is a white male Conservative so its perfectly fine to make these cowardly comments while in the House of Commons back then by our now substandard "feminist" PM and three ring circus government.
Father Gil Gustafson's desire to be a convicted pedophile healer reminds me of Cardinal William Levada's desire to place an indicted pedophile priest Father Gregory Ingels  in charge of the clergy sex abuse policies for the United States. Levada was promoted to Vatican's CDF  shorty thereafter, so Father Gustafson has lots of example to call on as precedent. Coverup for pedophiles, work with them, promote them, and you will rise in Vatican importance. Adult men who sexually torture children and still believe they are healers are dangerous indeed, and the men and women who believe these appointments are about "forgiveness" do not understand the evil nature of sexual dominance of kids and the corrupt religious authority which facilitates it. And all in the name of Holy.  AW
Fully agree, as I replied to someone else just a bit ago. The pill is essential because male condom use is hard to control. Guys don't use such things if they can get away with not doing so, but that penis is not going into their body. The person being entered has absolute authority to make that call. Not the man, not the Church. Indeed, it bespeaks the flaws in the Church that there are no ordained women controlling these teachings, but the irony escapes most of those dolts and when it does not, it is all the more evil.
SJW's don't care about middle-aged white males killing themselves because they are: 1) white (e.g. laughing at white male tears) 2) male (e.g. laughing at white male tears) 3) middle aged (most SJW's are very young and see the old as an impediment at best, e.g. "Why don't you just hurry up and die?" So yes being a target of hate and derision might make you more likely to kill yourself.
I am really referring to a biological man going into a women's bathroom for any reason (lathering and sex included), We as a society do not need to be nearly as concerned about women invading women invading men's bathrooms for the purpose of sexual self gratification.
White men are evil. We get it, Liz.
You do realize that The Village People consisted of gay men, don't you. Well, don't you?
Hey military hater, join up, become a REAL MAN, are you a transgender freak? military does not want you; not sorry.  be quiet............................ :)
"...the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do,” I'm not sure that applies to a group in power. Look at government bodies and CEOs. Most of them are white males. Whites don't need an advocacy group.
so you dont use oil? no gasoline? no plastic? man you ignorant losers are pathetic
Trump made fun of women's appearances. He made fun of women's periods.  His infamous line: "grab 'em by the p****"   And despite all of this:  He won 53% of the white female vote  45% of college educated female voters  42% of women's votes overall  And 9 million more women than men vote in the US election.  Women had the opportunity to break the biggest glass ceiling in the world and vote for a female candidate that was also the globe and fail's preferred candidate as they have constantly reminded us after the election, but chose not to. The biggest whiners, Ms. Renzetti, are reserved for those who participated in the women's march the day after he was elected and could not accept the result of a democratic election.
You clearly do not understand what it means to be a man.  A man protects himself and those who depend on him. And there ain't a damned thing "unmanly" about legal gun ownership.
This must be someone who used to go by 3rd gen AK., who also said white men were the Earth's alpha males...LOL...I offer to wit: From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
Lee was in charge, he either knew, or was incompetent. Leaders always try to play ignorant when they are accused of war crimes, happens every time. Lee was defending the preservation and expansion of slavery, and multiple generals under his command captured free black americans and enslaved them. Thousands of free black americans were transported south during the campaign, and I will not buy for a second that Lee was innocent.   I also care little that a handful of confederate soldiers might have released a few. They were a tiny minority in an army fighting for the sole purpose of preserving and expanding slavery. Once slavery because less fashionable the south started an enormous revisionist history campaign to paint themselves as victims or noble men defending their homeland. Total garbage.
Shut the fuck up. This man was my father. You have no clue what the cause of this nor the situation. "Truckers should really slow down in these areas" go fuck yourself. A man died and that's what you have to say. Go fuck yourself
All terrorist bombers have not been "all male" as his"largeness", Mayor Nenshi has suggested  Many have been women , or men dressed as women. When a very public mantra of these Muslims has been to  "KILL the INFIdels" it is very understandable that  one would not want them in our country. The problem becomes - how to tell the good ones from the bad ones.  So one becomes inclined to err on the side of choosing life over possible death. Some religion!- more like a club for thugs and thieves.
Wow.  Giving the middle finger salute is "obscene"?  If so, then how do you describe the behavior of a man who uses his stature/power to justify grabbing a woman's g3nitals?
Who are you to call me a troll?  First off, your report is 14 years old. Hardly pertinent any more.   Second, your OBSOLETE report is talking AVERAGE prices.   If we were talking about an 18 year old male, you may have a point.  But in fact we are talking about a 50 something female. Compare two identical 55 year old females with good driving records in BC vs AB.  I'll bet that the price will be 50% cheaper in AB.   Now, I am still waiting for an apology, or do you not have the self respect to treat other posters with civility?
Ridiculous. No one is personally subjected to a religious ceremony or a protest at a game. Sheeesh. But both do occur. I'm offended by the league not doing something about 50 yard line prayer sessions because I don't believe in a old fables and made up rules and magic men. But if the league is going to allow that, then you're just going to need to chill.
Democrats thought they could win "based on identity without substance"?  What possible substance did Trump bring to the table?  He is arguably the least well-informed, sympathetic, or decent man to ever gain the White House.  He is an opportunist who plays on nativist fears and nostalgia for the fabricated "good old days".  He is amoral (not even immoral) and dangerous.  Every American who voted for him got what he deserves.  Unfortunately, the rest of us are stuck with him too.
Sorry, nobody in a funny hat (that idiot RWA sheriff the right loves so much? Roy Moore? Someone in one of those dumb MAGA! hats?) made him bungle that call so badly.    Also, no one else is responsible for him being incapable of apologizing like a REAL man would have done.    That's all on the Derpenfuhrer.
All children should live in communal villages, 24/365 for as long as they want. The money should come from the banks and government. The communal villages should have the most money in society. All crime, poverty, homelessness, drug addiction etc. will be eliminated. The children will grow without all the jealousy and dysfunctional family crap we have now. They will be truly accepting of other and know how to get along with other. They will succeed in life and give back to the village because of all they have received. They will have real male and female models and equal brother and sisters.  This the only solution moving forward from the nuclear family which is obviously a  95% failure in 2017.
Well feminism has destroyed what it means to be women. Now we have women with no sense of accountability or sense of responsibility to LIMIT themselves as our society shuns upon such actions. What happened anyways? You feminists were running around 3 years blatantly advertising that you don't need men. Have you ever seen a man stupid enough to run around and say that ever? You reap what you sow ladies, now stop being brainwashed and look within yourselves to find out how to be and what makes you happy, you are more women inside and out, then society can ever make you.
No, the problem in this case was the judge's interpretation of mens rea, whether the accused knew that what he was doing was wrong.  Given that the only point y'all have fixated on is "women lie" I do think Victimitis is right about the board being full of bitter divorced men.
Sex is bad, mmmmmkay?  LOL  I don't know what the stink is, anyway.  There are many examples where a woman is wiling to have sex with a man because he has coin.  Sometimes it's even dating and turns into marriage.  How is paying for it in those situations any different?
Are you kidding me?? It's called CIVIL RIGHTS. And guess what? The idea that "marriage is between a man and a woman" is NOT "no big deal - it's bigotry. So at least own your bigoted beliefs. Your ignorance is blowing my mind.
Boots>  It seems to me that you have it reversed, where it is surprising that people would vote for "crooked HRC."  As the latest in the real world, depicts a woman and a colored man sold out their country, for what apparent reason, did they do it for, huh????  The POTUS will be the POTUS, but how can you stand with criminals????  I just don't understand you, Boots, they made all of you look like a bunch of baboozes!!!!  Blind leading the blind, right????
agree...Paul Ryan is a silly man who has too long passed for an important dude with brains.  He is a worm.
The "mechanics of sex"--lol. You actually have to "teach" your male children "not to physically violate" women and girls? HS, that's really weird. And you say all of your evangelical friends do this too?  This is an interesting. I've never had to teach my son anything like this as sexually violating someone would not even occur to him and marriage or a "lifelong commitment" would in no way change his aversion to physically violating someone he loved. Do you think there might be a problem with some of the ideas evangelicals espouse that predisposes their male children to do violent things to women and girls?
What a shock that Saunders tried to spin statistics.  I recall that when he wrote about the Cologne assaults (something that really couldn't be spun), the strongest word he could use to condemn the attacks was "distasteful."  I guess rape is only an outrage when white men are responsible.
But that men who engage in sex with prostitutes are putting their wives/girlfriends at risk of potentially fatal STDs, and that sex trade often involves under age children.
Funny, when I make comments about angry, white males I'm supposed to be ashamed of my "sexist" language.  I have a feeling some broflakes really love their double standards. Women belong in the dentist's office because tee hee, but when a woman makes a statement about men and how they behave because testosterone? Interesting.
How stupid are you. ALL army rangers have the guts stand their ground when they think they're right. Now you're calling this service member a liar. Go back to your hole. You may be gutless but I guarantee you Villanueva is not. You guys make me sick to basically call this man a liar
In 1968, the evening news was showing, in the southern states, naked black men lynched from trees for being seen with a white woman, some being set on fire, alive. In 1968, the evening news was showing US soldiers in Vietnam, mostly white, with necklaces of 'slope' human ears and fingers, and tobacco bags made of 'Charlie' human scrotums.  In 1968, you would see Huntley and Brinkley on the evening news, curls of cigarette smoke to the side or in the background. In this 2nd decade of the 21st European religious century, there is a tendency to white-wash the past, for emo-cringe reasons. In Hawaii, with the overthrow of the Kingdom in 1893 and the following annexation in 1898, the Hawaiian language was entirely banned from schools and government, and discouraged elsewhere. The Native Hawaiian culture was squashed because it was a "terrorist threat" to the Religious Republic of Hawaii. The ban of the Native Hawaiian language and culture in schools and government wasn't lifted until 1978.
I was there. I can assure you that the Premier was unaware of the actions of the two accused, which issue had its genesis solely at the hands of Laura Miller and her dimwitted LCSB accomplices. Miller's mantra, re Ministers and the Premier, is/was, "Treat them like mushrooms: cover them in shit and keep them in the dark". Another example of this is choosing to not address the groping and propositioning of a female EA by her male MPP boss, as, "We don't want to embarrass the Premier". I hope she goes to jail.
Univ'y. Judicial systems have ruined many young lives, and resulted in huge expense---through their extreme bias, Always Assuming Any female who cries "sexual harassment" and even much lesser complaints....is telling the truth. Those university records have prevented male students from getting licenses, getting into law school, etc. The university's pure stupidity and bias should be a crime.
The number of stories surfacing during Women's Month of men beating, murdering, and raping women, suggests that every day, every month, is Men's Day and Men's Month. Men are not being brutally oppressed by women. When women are no longer treated brutally by men then we won't need a Women's Day or Women's Month.
Trump is no more incompetent than the folks that voted for him. They don't have a clue about how the world works either. They are quite proud in their ignorance, like Trump. Most of them are incapable of following the money. They actually believe that the poor and minorities get more free stuff from the government than the 1%. They refuse to take responsibility for their choices, like Trump. They believe their failures are always caused by someone else. They don't believe there is a thing called white male privilege. Yet none of them can tell you when it stopped, while they claim to prefer the original Constitution. Their uncluttered minds can't see the irony in any of this.
I am wearing out knee caps praying to GOD that Kid Rock enters the race. He is a wild man and non-politician citizen. He would blow the Senate up. He is perfect. Get rid of these old Establishment clowns and put real citizens there. See how the country rights itself.
Health insurance is leading my family to the soup line...and that's just the premium and tax ramifications...I send my wife to the doctor, but I cant go...because the freaking deductibles are so high I'll never actually be insured.  Then...the insurance companies bill you $100 for a $5 dollar thing.  This is a criminal racket.  Obama is a smart guy.  When smart people do bad things it is not a mistake...it is evil.  Barry is a evil man.  Hold him and his family accountable!
its  not about white identity.... this is about society, which is teaching, whites are rassist, and not white are victims...   it went so far, you have many cases, when situation went to oposite extreme....  being not white/not male become advantage for elections...    and for elections - Khan won, coz london is currently city of foreigners...   segregation,white run  is speeding up  ...just wait 10 years more, and you will have places without british, just with foreigners holding UK passport...    //sory english is not my native l.
My fear is that Tory will be a complete idiot and still believes  BLM is an honourable group of people who only seek to live in a tolerant just society. He thinks good will is the cure for the racist bigots  of Church Street, the  gay men, the leather men,   jocks and drag queens of Toronto are now classified as. That is after all what this is all about, the inhumane racism of Toronto's gay  white men. We are guilty as charged because Tory would never dare defend   Toronto's gay community from slander by  BLM.
The man is insane
But, dammit, the man can virtue signal!
Wear two condoms then, or have yourself sterilized if you don't want kids, or maybe be more responsible in your sexual choices and in your communication with your partner? If you haven't figured out that sex can sometimes lead to pregnancy then maybe you shouldn't be having it in the first place.  I'll also point out that the concerns you raise are well known "men's rights" arguments. I'd be very curious to know if there are actually any stats backing up those fears or if they are just more hyperbole and fear mongering.
Surely a monkey would be a better choice than Junior Trudeau.  This guy is ruining our country faster than anyone I've ever seen.  Why aren't journalists asking the question "How can we get rid of our Clown Prince?"  So I don't care if it's O'Leary or the Man in the Moon we have to save Canada from the Liberals.
Celibacy?!?! You do realize that the majority of pedophiles are -married- men with seemingly normal families, do you? You do realize that the professional child welfare investigators that root out pedophiles for a living, to them the Roman collar is hardly even a blip on their radar, do you?  Affront to survivors?!?! You DO realize that -this- survivor, along with the vast majority of other survivors, were NOT abused by a Catholic priest, but by someone from probably your very own own demographic, and WE view your myopic tunnel vision towards priests as not only stupid, but even dangerous....do you?
Do you remember that was a MAHU? A man-whore.
Preach it, Brother!  The ONLY people who like it are freeloading bums! You should ask someone who couldn't even get insurance before the ACA how they feel about being bum freeloaders who should be scorned.  Shame on you cancer "victims" for being the reason insurance carriers charge more for their premiums.  Damn you women for having more body parts and making insurance more expensive for us men.  Let's publicly parade children with birth defects who should have just made better life style choices and make them pull themselves up with their bootstraps (when they get big enough to wear boots of course).  Why can't that old crippled bum who purposely got dementia just die quietly at a freeloader shelter without costing the rest of us more?  Sick people just plain suck and are a drain on the lives of the rest of us.  We should make them ALL wear some kind of patch on their shirts so the rest of us can easily identify these bastard humans.  We hate you lazy freeloading "victims"!!!
I was beaten on my way to school, beaten ruthlessly the whole time I was at school (and raped... the teachers, both men and women, beat and raped me.  They passed me around like the little whore I was and just used me, and made fun of me as they beat and raped me), then beaten, punched, kicked and finally, brutally raped AND beaten at the same just as I got home.  Then the real abuse began.  My parents continued to beat and rape me, all while making fun of me as they did so.  This lasted all night, then back to school.  This went on day in and day out all day every day w/out break for 18 years.  And did I complain?  No.  Kids today have no idea how good they have it.
Rep. Seaton is a fair man Dunleavy, unlike the man that looks back at you in the mirror.  Even when the overwhelming percentage of public testimony was to the contrary. You knew you had the votes in committee, so you rushed that bill through the in a whirlwind. Your religious zealotry is pathetic!
The man is repugnant.  The woman had 3x the legal limit of alcohol in her system, she was inebriated and was passed out when found by the police.  If she had shot him in that state, she would not be criminally responsible for his death.
Skinut, this is not about gays, lesbians, bisexuals, trisexuals, X-sexuals, transgenders and others with weird ideas from serving open in the military.  There is no question about many of them having served with honor and distinction, but they did so serving in positions aligned with their sex at birth and wore uniforms consistent with their biological sex, of which there are only two, male and female.  However, Obama’s lifting of the ban on transgenders went much further than simply allowing them to serve.  The Obama administration recognized that transgenders suffer from a mental disorder called “gender dysphoria” and directed the military services to develop and implement plans to provide transgenders psychiatric and other medical care including sex reassignment surgery.  Under Obama’s policy, transgenders will spend much of their time on active duty being treated for a pre-existing condition.  That is transforming DOD into a social service organization.
"Woman does not possess the image of God in herself ..." St Augustine, bishop of Hippo (354-430) . "So men possess the image of Devil in his devilish act of raping children? " YJIN117, (2017) ROFLOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,  The whole world are LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Have you ever thought that maybe he is sick and tired and fed up with the liberal agenda? Maybe he liked bathrooms that had girls and boys on them instead of it's, confused and not sure. Maybe the confederates were part and parcel of this countries history and right or wrong, acknowledged. Perhaps a man and a woman equaled marriage. Owning a gun or guns used to be simple and we got along just fine not even being checked. The national anthem was sung with pride, nobody sat. Immigration was for people who went through the process, studied and worked for it and passed the test. Health insurance was optional not mandated. The list goes on and on, the pooh gets deeper and deeper. And frankly, people snap when the world as they knew is no more. They worked for that world all their lives only to have it pissed away by, fill in the blank to comply with the civil bs here.
Notice how the article only compares blacks to whites and leaves out other major racial/ethnic groups like Hispanics and Asians?   https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/racial-gender-wage-gap-persists-asian-american-men-top-average-n602076 "White men earn a median $21 an hour, making more money than women across all races, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. They also earn more than black and Hispanic men, who make a respective $15 and $14 median hourly wage. The only group that out-earns white men is Asian men, who earn $24, according to the report."  If there are factors such as "discrimination" as the article states, then why do Asian men earn more than white men? Could it be that Asian men work harder, value education and family more than white and black men and that discrimination doesn't have a GD thing to do with it? This article is a great example of how the leftist media tries to misinform the public in order to push its agenda.
man you are a clueless liberal hack of stupidity,,
He's the real pm though, he's taking tater tot on a journey with him. I despise this man.
why the insults and sarcasm ...? you do address issues in a snarky way., but your post is relevant. i found that i got as nasty as were the comments from several , men i think..according to their posts, avatars and screen names. i went ahead and muted and it's nice to not deal with what is just garbage that becomes ridiculously off topic.   why the hostility? i ask curiously and sincerely...
More complete and utter nonsense from Balki.    There is no problem with masculinity, males, powerful males, straight males, etc.  NONE WHATSOEVER.  There are a few PEOPLE committing illegal, unlawful, immoral and unauthorized acts against other people.  End of story.  Stop labeling all men, or all powerful men, or Geeks? Really Geeks??  "Deep down the Geek knows?"  Are you f&cking kidding me Balki?  Now you are labeling, berating, mocking, discrediting, vilifying, STIGMATIZING an entire class of people, young men who work in technology, because a handful of people acted inappropriately?  Out of millions?  Do you read your own crap?  "Empowered after centuries of having sand kicked in their faces, too many tech geeks are asserting their newfound dominance over women repeatedly and repulsively" ????  You are a sick person.  Your stories are garbage.  This entire discussion is sad, pathetic and symptomatic of the spiraling demise of the mainstream media as it will soon be formerly known.
These gun nuts are really pussies at heart.  They always have to reach for their heat because without their "protection" they are afraid of everything.  He shoots an unarmed man in the back over taking down fliers, and this is "self-defense"?  In what universe except the alternate reality in which the gun nuts live?
He is the quintessential muslim male, he rules the roost and she is just the baggage who obeys his every word. I suppose we never will but it would be most interesting to get her side of the story. Finally why is it that the media are fawning over this piece of trash who is obviously very sympathetic to the cause of Islam.
"Charles - Obama is half white so is he a recipient of "white privilege"?"  The one drop rule still applies in the 21st century. Obama does not get any white privilege. The Founding Fathers did not want to free their children born by black slaves. That is the beauty of race based slavery, if you are a white man. That is why they created "the one drop rule" in the first place. Don't take my word for it. Just ask a white cop. Most of them support racial profiling. That alone makes equal protection under the law impossible. Of course, you could ask the white racists that support Trump. That includes the KKK and Nazis. They will tell you the same thing. White men are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Black men are always suspect for just being present.
Well now I think it's about time somebody chimed in with a little reason. First of all not only do any of you have the slightest clue as to what actually transpired that night. It is well known that police reports seldom accurately dictate the incident. So before jumping on your high horse and judging this man as anything; Put a freaking sock in your head hole and stop puking out non evidence based judgment. None of you have a dam clue unless you happened to be there which from the comments ive read nobody that has posted anything on this website actually was. And it's low level intellegence that resides in people like you that make this country the sham it has become.
My mother attended UAF in the 1950's, she was assaulted. I attended in the 1970's and spoke with several women that were assaulted. One of my children was assaulted at the university in the 2010's. None of these were ever resolved, it is considered part of the cost of going to the school. Yes, the son of a bitch was acquitted, and when finally we have administrators willing to try for women's justice they are told they cannot. I guess women should not be out of their kitchens, and why are they not pregnant? Rulings favoring assault are the problem and those who find male privilege proper need that horsewhipping mentioned earlier.
And refilling it with millionaire and billionaire scum who got rich off the little man
Would you like the black privilege to be profiled as an angry black man with a gun? You might survive a month. As a white man you can argue with a cop while having an AR-15 slung over your shoulder and live to tell the story. That is a white privilege. BTW, the angry black man idea would only have to be in the mind of a terrified white cop with a license to kill. The police union will say your killing was justified. The cop that kills you will get time off with pay to recover from killing you. Living in an open carry state will not matter at all. Being ignorant is no way to prosper in the 21st century. Start by taking responsibility for your choices and behavior. It looks like you know more about rap music than I do. I'm more of an old school jazz man. Do you have some hidden desires? Do you have "jungle fever"?
So because she was abused by a man she is an unfit parent to her child? BaHaHaHa! Ok Alaska, this one takes the cake. Victim blame much? I'm mean seriously... That is so typical stereotype stupidity I can't believe nobody has jumped on this already. She said she was 18 at the time, did it make you feel all higher and stronger about yourself to make that statement? Just gross.
Trump, bunt, he is our man, our man with the bright orange tan! He will show you what hes got, trump hair - cause damn it's hot! Islam, Mexican, African, Women, Fire Chiefs, POWs, Media exclusions but big tuffs of hair oh how he wears it! Big mouth, stupid face, O lips, sucking *bleep* 'say what?' Not Putin.. Oh drop the mic right there lol!! Treason, lying, misinterpreted reality, hateful, spiteful, narcissistic personality, ohhh man America, so f*c*ing lost. We are now represented by: "Dunta Dun - Honey Boo Boo Clan!!! The new representation of the United States of America! *insert clapping here* Cry me a what? Oh wait.. Crimea, hu?   Ohhhhh.. "I don't know anything about that" - thought it was a Justin Bieber song - "loosers"
the left: asian cop shoots unarmed black man- "i hate white people! kill all cops! pigs in a blanket, fry em like bacon!! no justice!!! Let's destroy the local convenient store!!!" obvious terror attack by an islamic extremist- "ok guys, lets wait for all of the facts to come out before we start pointing fingers. we dont want to spread hate, ok! besides, this attack is nothing compared to the Christian bombing on planned parenthood in the 90's."
"I’m going to be OK. And if you’re are a white heterosexual male with a decent job, you’ll probably be OK too." Do we need any more proof that 'Luke' is a bigot and who knows what else? Hit tirate is just that - garbage being spewed because his feelings are hurt, the career crook that he supported - that accepts money from countries that Murder GAYS, treats their dogs better than their women and thinks nothing of murdering Christians.... THIS is who HE thinks should be our President... His 'whole belief system lost' I'm crying for him....   NOT  AND Not getting my business any time soon...
Hmm, so what's worse do you think? Someone who has little experience but will (theory only) what I want, or someone with lots of experience and will do the exact opposite of what I want? In other words, does evil and effective trump stupid and ineffective. Man, thats a tough choice.
Notice he types that crap out with his little hands on his little device but he won't say it to anyone's face.  Little man.  Tiny little man.
In any event, the meaning of kneeling has already been expressed; there's no ambiguity about it.  Said Colin Kaepernick:  “America refuses to address the pervasive evil of white cops killing black men, and I will not stand during a national anthem that honors the flag of such a country!”  "Such a country."  "Such a country."  That privileged little snot, like the ones who knelt at St. Ignatius High,  should thank God they are so privileged to even be in this country.  Their irresponsible comment that they're too good for "such a country" is revolting.
I like that you separated Muslims into a specific subset, the ones that believe  the fundamentalist values you mentions.   You know that not all Muslims agree with those specific values.     I know that not All Christians think of murdering their son, beating children with a rod, offering their daughters for sex, believe that a woman worked with a snake to corrupt the origin perfect human - a single male made from dirt, or that women were createed from the rib of a man.    ================== It seems part of our human nature is  to 'rank' ourselves in comparison to others, in our personal life, our work life, even our spiritual lives.   It's impossible for a diverse culture to completely eliminate that conflict of human ego's.     When people must be 'ranked',  you can believe it creates anger and hostility.  LOL, look at this room!
You. Are. An. Idiot. But you may be right, there could have been a Chinese submarine involved. This is something he did REGULARLY, read the article fer gawd's sake. And if you knew the man or his family, you would be ashamed of your imbecilic comment. Jonesy was as fit as a 45 year old, loved life and was good at it. I swear, some of the lunacy you cretins come up with is astounding.
The view from the other side, as a white male:  My mother's father was Ukrainian, her last name is constantly mispronounced, everyone gets it wrong. For me, people think I am Chinese because of my first name, and often use my family name as my given name, Chinese people in particular seem to think I am Chinese. My name is actually an old English name that happens to also be a common family name in Chinese. It's annoying, often I just don't correct people, but I don't worry that everyone is a racist out to get me. Jerks come in all shapes, sizes and colours, and from all kinds of different backgrounds, religions and cultures. It's not because you're black, its because they're a jerk.
If asexual reproduction is needed, history tells us that most likely a white man will discover how to do it.
What percentage of violent crime does that 6% of the population that black males make up commit? Did you factor that in?
Hey man, believe anything you want.  Just don't mutilate my genitals . . .
this whole thing is about the poor women and her husband and the police, dion isn't an arsehole because of this gesture, he's just an arsehole.
What T rump really hates is athletic, handsome, wealthy Black men who dare to speak against injustice. Can't have these uppity black men getting away with that! And then the Pussy Grabber in Chief goes on to criticize changes in the game to try and prevent brain damage. This from a rich boy who got a military deferment for a bone spur on his heel! When you risk your life and health for the team feel free to criticize, Trumpy Dumpy! Otherwise, shut your pie hole!
Your claim is incorrect.  We are not talking about priests that were cloistered away with no access to female victims.  Pederasty involves victims  that offenders are sexually attracted to,  which in this case were post pubescent males. That would suggest the vast majority of offending priests were homosexual in nature.
Leaving people alone? What?? That's like saying mind your own business. Keep your own house clean. Come on, Gary: How can people get aroused if not by vicariously peeping in my bedroom window? Better yet, into a gay man's bedroom? Never mind the suit and tie they wear to work at the bank, or that I prefer funny movies. Don't deny that the images of >>gay sex<< flood your thoughts at the mention of the word "gay". Dwell, dwell, dwell. It's important to keep what you think I do out of the campsite.
Ever since former justice minister Alan Rock feminized the custody laws and now we have a feminist PM.  The product of this are lost men who don't know their way because they know that their future is screwed.  Most recent opioid deaths (actually suicides) are men but hey who cares right?  The only gender issue on the federal radar is the MMIW inquiry.  Besides our parliament is filled with "old white grandpas" as stated by our now racist PM.  So yes the hate is on for men especially if you happen to be white.  So today's men are the product of marriages where the best advice for the man is "if you're right then shut up".  Yes we have to shut up - or else the obvious consequences.  And if things don't work out because the woman is always right - it's still the man's fault for being passive aggressive. Forget about sex, and let's focus on the family law system first.
SMH. "The world wuz better when wimmen couldn't vote or have a job!" Good lord.  I'm sure you're not interested in facts, but many cultures have been comfortable with TG people for millenia.  Transgenderism wasn't created by "feminism" just like feminism didn't create troglodytes who think anyone but a cis white male Christian is inferior to them.  The troglodytes always existed, but now we hear more from them due to their death throes. Bye trogs! We won't miss you.
There are some who will say that the church can never change its position on homosexuality because the church's teaching is part of divine revelation. I say it's as much a part of divine revelation as not eating shellfish or men not cutting their hair - after all, those prohibitions, like not wearing clothes made of mixed fabrics or not eating meat with dairy products, all come from the same book of the Bible: Leviticus. And yes, St. Paul did condemn homosexual acts but he also told women to be quiet in church, and yet no one observes that rule anymore. Cherry-picking the Bible has a long history that will probably never end. But the people who mention revelation never talk about the fact that Jesus himself never said a word about homosexuality. In the end, as a gay Catholic Christian, I take great comfort in that. The church has been wrong about many things in the past. It is wrong about homosexuality, and it is time the church change its position - out of charity, if nothing else.
farmers, fishermen and female entrepreneurs are protected??? WTF!  It is amazing to me how the government can discriminate against men, other small businesses and get away with this.  Where is the CFIB to file a lawsuit against the government for a charter challenge???  These Liberals are closet Marxists. See you next election Trudeau as small business people pour election dollars into the conservatives to throw your sorry butt to the curb along with your gang of Marxist bullies
Last night we saw the true Trump — the Great Divider, Liar and Fake Conspiracy Promoter. He is president of just roughly 30% of us, his boys and girls, no matter what the teleprompter makes him say. The rest of us can go to hell as far as he's concerned. He has soiled the office of the presidency. The man is no leader. At best he's a carnival barker.  His relentless attack on the Media is an attack on truth, honor, and civility. Good god, every day the man runs to Fox and Friends, of all places, for his morning echo-chamber fix! That's his real daily "security" briefing. Linus' blanket. (Sorry, Linus.)  His day of reckoning is surely coming. Despite years of criminal business activity and   managing to evade serious legal consequences, the Federal vise is slowly closing on him. It can't come too soon.
That is exactly what he will do -- let his children run the business. This, of course, doesn't remove him from conflict of interest.  One truism about Trump the world has learned so far: the man is a blatant liar who will say anything to further his agenda.
"As an African-American Muslim man, 'I don't have that freedom,"  You don't say.   Oh, sorry; I forget facts often get in the way of the taqiya victim narrative.  It never ceases to amaze me how pseudoliberals who purport to be champions of women's rights and GLBT rights are so ready to enable an ideology that is FAR more anti-women and anti-GLBT than the Christians that they hate so much. And I'm saying this as an agnostic who frequently criticizes Christians for their anti-rights stance on women's and GLBT issues.
I don't care what gender, race, or class you are.  I don't care if the person you murder is of the same gender, race or class as you are.  If you shove an arrow through a living man's ear into his brain (Eugene case) you deserve to die.  In that case, the black defendant got to live by testifying against the white bad guy, even though the black guy was the one who actually shoved the arrow into the victim's brain.    And all just to steal the victim's car so all three of them could commit more bank robberies.    And the black guy had gotten off on a previous murder charge in another State by testifying against the bad guy in that case, too.
Boy is this guy full of crap!
This pretty well sums up my iron-clad conclusions that white privilege for too long - 200 years at least - has created these animals. And gives credibility to Lisa Bloom's findings of fact hereunder offered. From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
We accommodate Mennonites and Hutterites  in Western Canada. Public school Teachers have to go to the colonies to teach. Mennonite men will not serve in the Canadian military even if drafted due to their religious beliefs. What message does that send to society?  Violent Christians such as Timothy McVeigh bomb government buildings in the US killing children, and Christian activists threaten and occasionally do shoot doctors performing abortions. No apologies from the Christian community for these nut bars... Zionist settler extremists in Israel assassinated Yitzak Rabine for pursuing peace on the West Bank.  Point is Islam is certainly not the only Abrahamic religion with violent and extreme members who twist faith into something awful.   It would seem to an outside observer that the "guise of religious freedom" in Canada  is somehow only to be applied to accommodate Christians and Jews and not others.
Black guy braggin about gettin free stuff ? no way !
cont'd  Now, it may be objected that certain drug statutes -- e.g. crack vs. powder cocaine -- are racist because blacks commit certain kinds of crimes more often that whites.  This is a ridiculous indictement of the system.  The ball is in the individual's hands.  It's ridiculous to cry racism when a black is sent to prison for using crack, when a white man would also be sent to prison for the same offense.  Each of the offenders had the choice whether to commit the crime or not. If blacks who are sent off in droves for PWITD crack don't want to be, they could arrange it so that by this time next year, PWITD crack would be known a "white man's crime."  How?  By simply leaving it to white men to commit that offense.
Why not, "Kids Have Eating Habits? Credit Dad"  You misogynist kurr!   "No child is safe with their father becze men are idiots" is the gist of the story.
More silly stuff from nowhere man.
"Man fires into air", "man fires into mulch", "man loses gun on trail", "Firing off deck"... These are ALL drunk idiots, not actively resisting arrest, and surrendering, your narrative is losing ground.
That's what President Teddy Roosevelt used to call "The White Man's Burden" and evangelical churches continue to do to this day.  To leave Oregon and go over to educate the poor and ignorant of the world so that our values become theirs because they are unable to take care of themselves.
First, no one even pretended that anyone has a monopoly on racism. But, whichever racists are in power will weld it. Show me historically in the US when you should have been worried about anything but white racism towards others. Yes, Jeff Sessions is that bad. If you refuse to accept that then you'll be happy with the policies reversed that attempted to make everyone a little more equal. But hey, I'm a white guy. I'm not at all worried that anything is going to happen to me. I'm worried about what other people will do to each other given the opportunity. It's already started.....read the news.
You don't watch much TV.  The man from Mars would think that most people here are black, in the power positions, and dominant over those around them.  What few white women exist are red heads and children are worshiped.
"Southern Democrats insisted on protecting slavery in all the territories while many Northern Democrats resisted. The party split over the slavery issue in 1860 at its Presidential convention in Charleston, South Carolina. Northern Democrats nominated Stephen Douglas as their candidate, and Southern Democrats adopted a pro-slavery platform and nominated John C. Breckinridge in an election campaign that would be won by Abraham Lincoln and the newly formed Republican Party. After the Civil War, most white Southerners opposed Radical Reconstruction and the Republican Party's support of black civil and political rights. The Democratic Party identified itself as the "white man's party" and demonized the Republican Party as being "Negro dominated," even though whites were in control." (PBS) Placing the 2017 Democratic party into 1850 America is a fool's quest.  Why can't Republicans stick with today? Because there's no arguing it's become hate-filled, racist, and fascist.
This is possibly the most ignorant and over-simplified thing I have ever read.   "Men needed access to sex. Women needed access to resources."  .... how do you even respond to something so idiotic and baseless?
OMG if you were at the top of the tower what would you do?  He's a man they say gross things but I've worked with these guys my whole life! They Are Full Of Crap AND Never Actually Do Anything Suggestive That Pours From THEORY Lips!
It's completely cynical & manipulative for this VP to pretend that this shooting had anything to do with "silencing" anyone's "faith". It is crystal clear the man was a violent abuser who was targeting those he couldn't control. Whatever it is in our society that tells men they need to control everything at all costs, is the root of this problem. Gun culture, rape culture, male superiority. It's all got to end.
Oh, yes!  I've long stopped believing that anything the man does is accidental.  I think that it's all calculated to achieve heaven knows what end.   He is a disgrace.  And those who support him just lap it up.
You come from the 'veins of polygamy'.... is Zuma your father?? Polygamy is wholly primitive, debasing women!  OK, not certain about paternity, but I am certain that Mbabula is a crass racist e=who has enriched himself while, so far, making an idiot of himself as a Minister in his 'father's' Government.  It's very clear whe know where you stand Mbabula, and Law and Order doesn't come into it!
Can you name any woman who wrote a manifesto against men and then targeted them in a killing spree?  No you can't.    But if that were to happen -- or the times when men have written a manifesto against women and then killed a bunch of them -- I'd call it a hate crime.  Just like that white supremacist who shot a bunch of black people in a church was charged with hate crimes.  Yet strangely, there's a lot of resistance to calling it a hate crime when women are the hated group and the target.  Why is that?
You do have some good points.  There is real religious persecution in the world.  Christians are being beheaded in Muslim countries.  And judging is wrong, which is what you are doing to me.  And even though Christianity is under attack, it really is not that bad, but it is part of the progressive agenda.  And Jesus did say we would face persecution.  And the church should welcome gay people into their churches.  But we cannot approve of sex between a man and a man.
As a man, I call BS on the whole article. Some men are actually looking for companionship, too - we're not just a bunch of sex-starved dummies. Come on.
Who would write in Negus, at this point?  The man seems to be either a fool or a sleaze  --  or perhaps both.
I got to play Bottom the Weaver in a local production of 'Midsummer Night's Dream', and I'm a woman; indeed, we had so many more women than men audition that all the 'rude mechanicals' save one were played by women. Apart from playing Aunt Abby Brewster in 'Arsenic and Old Lace' last year, playing Bottom was the most fun I've had as an actor (and yes, I did ask people, at the first read-through, to get all the 'bottom' and 'ass' jokes out there early so we could move on).
Sanders, unlike many, is not stupid enough to be entertaining this ridiculous nonsense about Hillary being indicted. Sorry kids, it's just not going to happen. Sanders is an egotistical person with a fading grasp on reality, so he's staying in the race, and that's the only reason.   The reality is that we are electing our first female president. We are really doing it!  The male tears are going to be pretty epic.
Bless his heart, perhaps Mr Bernstein is the doddering old fool?  A man who lived in the shadow of Mr Woodward and still bitter?  I call that psychological negative projection.   I tend to ignore his outburst.
The man is truly a dunce. Conflict of interest much? Celeb wanna-be? It is going to be a very long 4 years.
and in other news..... Texas lawyer, Rob Ranco, want DeVos sexually assaulted or he would be OK with DeVos being sexually assaulted because he thinks his daughters will be less safe on campus - the man should be charged with child abuse for using his kids as a political prop to criticize policy changes at DOE - wonder how he might feel if some people were OK with him getting 'Scalised' as an expression of their politics and disagreement with him on the issue? but on the left violence is OK if u have the 'correct' worldview
Hawaii would be doomed if Kim cuts loose and weaponized missile.  Diplomacy is the only solution but the reckless, ignorant boy president Trump is not capable of a deal.  He is weak and inept.
"Black men and women in Denver are twice as likely to die from gunshots — and five times as likely to be murdered by gunfire — as white men and women"  And why do you think that is?  Perhaps it's that they commit more of the murders and crime than whites proportionally?  Perhaps it is that their communities foster this type of behavior?  Perhaps they need to look inwards and fix the problems with their own communities and people, rather than blaming everything on the white man for once in their lives?
white trash punk big man with gun. ohhhhhh -so big - so tough - so insecure. what an insect. what a pathetic excuse for a human. so brave..... make america great again - let's dump this punk up in the state joint for a day or 2, "lost" in the system.   to be clear - i do not like, nor support mr. bryson.  wouldn't want to be misunderstood.
I would rather work with a Hillary supporter than a Trump supporter any day. Trump is a proven racist and misogynist.  Examples for the weak minded who forget too easily (or just don't care):  Racist = pointing to one of the only black people at his rally and stating something along the lines of "Here is my black guy"; asking the a black reporter if she knows the Black Caucus in DC and if she can set up a meeting between he and them.  Misogynist = bragging about sexually assaulting women and then stating that this was only "locker room banter".  Please defend any of these statements if you can. However, first place yourself in a black person's or woman's shoes and ask yourself how you would feel if either of these examples happened to you. The irrational out there, will likely state that this is not a problem and would be OK or even proud that Trump would show some attention to them. The rest of us understand that the Idiot in Chief is just that and his supporters are much the same.
McCain voted against the ACA.  He then vowed to overturn it.  And now at least three times he has voted against measures to abolish it once and for all.  So what does all this mean?   It means that John McCain is not a good man, he is scum.  He lied to his constituents, he betrayed the trust they put in him.  He is not hero, just another politician who did what all politicians do, lie for votes.  THis man has no principles, he never has.
It''s not O'Leary...it's the media in this country that refuse to engage in real debate and issues as serious leaders present then...the media wants a circus that sells anger...and O'Leary is their boy.  This  is one very stupid and ignorant man....
"It’s a new level of hypocrisy to advertise you are raising funds for the ACLU while simultaneously, very likely, violating public accommodations laws." Thank you Megan for being a voice of reason. While I don't care about "women-only screenings", especially for a film I don't plan on watching in the theater, it is illegal to ban a particular sex from entering a public establishment. What's funny is the same women who defend this "Women only" screening would be outraged if they made plans to get together with their girlfriends and buy tickets to see the next "50 Shades" movie, but were turned away at the door due to an exclusive "Gay Men only" screening.
Gary:  You stated, "and the adult male who sexually molests young boys is not likely to be homosexual".  Whaaaaaaaaat the Duck?   So what do YOU call a Adult Male who has Intestinal Intercourse with a young male or male??????    Can' wait  for this answer.........  Ever Read the Bible.  There is scripture there like, "Men will not lay with Men like they do with a Woman".......There are many many more DENOUNCING Homosexuality, and God's plan against this DISCUS-STING Behavior.
Man are you dumb.
This man ought to be going to work for the woman for the next 5-9 years and pay for her care for the rest of her life. Instead, we pay for him to live in prison and her to live on disability. My heart goes out to the woman who has to live with this idiot's actions.
Now, here is a guy who seems to be a soul mate of Trump!!! Except C. Pell grab boys by their genitals instead Trump grab girls by their genitals!  Is this a sign of human society's progress of 21st century, or is it 'BOYS are BOYS'  thing?  Are Vatican boys doing 'BOYS are BOYS'  thing & insist on this UNCHANGING slavish attachment to sex organs in ordaining priest only if one has boy's sex organs?   I am afraid people will beginning to see boy's sex organ when we see men in clergy outfit!!!     LOL, ROFL, LOLOLOLOLOLOL in tears!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The names of everyone charged with a crime is public.  That doesn't mean that every name is published in the media.  Generally, if it's a case of simple sexual assault where the victim and accused know each other (as opposed to aggravated assault where there is injury) the press don't report it unless there is a conviction.  But I can see the purpose of reporting sometimes.  For example, a case recently in my town where there was a serial rapist who assaulted 3 women at random -- the media reported his name with photo, because if there were other victims or witnesses, that would encourage them to come forward and help make sure the guy was taken off the streets, which he was.
It's almost like Target wants women to get raped.  I don't think many girls or women will want to walk down a dark hallway to a bathroom with no one in it but her and a "man".   All the sexual predators are salivating right now.
I see America sends billions a year to Israel to subsidize its Single Payer National Health Insurance Program that Israel enrolls every Israeli into, from birth to death.. On top of the 38 billion it just sent to Israel. Plus it funds Israelis safety as Israel colonizes lands stolen from the Palestinians and develop natural gas fields stolen from the Israelis. The colonial capitalist society??? What does that mean? The way things go, all the wealth is concentrated to the people who have money and power and the hell with the little guy. We are being dictated to by the wealthy elite who are busy as bees transferring American tax dollars into over seas accounts while the American democracy dies at the hands of Tammany Hall, or Congress. All we can look forward to is more suffering, more neverending wars on terrorism as a result of our colonial policies of theft and murder to enrich the wealthy elite some more. I would say, our corrupt Congress graduated from Corruption 101.
JenW, you're flat out wrong. I'm talking about their own stated beliefs. "We believe that Christ's gifts are equally given to men and women to build up His Body," the church website declares, "but that God has designated men to fulfill the primary role of spiritual leadership." That belief is a big load of stinky, misogynist bullshit.
Yeah, It's only white men shooting people. Nothing going on in Chicago or Mountain View.
Where are your numbers for all other races to give a fair analysis? I look at the mugshot page regularly and most of them are white men. I get you put the link but your post is to inflame White males 9000 ish on felony Probation, WOW
What I've found happening a lot lately is that people feel like feelings and ignorance are better guides to God's will than study and scholarship. The scholar, in fact, is probably wrong precisely because he's a scholar, while the ignorant man, exercising his gut instincts, somehow discerns the truth of God. This is happening in the politics of both our nation and our church. There are texts you could interpret both ways. Paul himself was a scholar, but then there are passages like 1 Corinthians 1:20, that could make you wonder if Paul felt the same way about knowledge, and preferred ignorance.
Oh yes, Kevin is such a silly man, every one knows the Trudeau Liberals created the Not-Winstanding-Clause to abuse Canadian's Human Rights, not protect them. Silly, silly man.
"You are fascinated with sex and don't care about public policy" says the man who tied up our entire government for a year in search of excruciating detail about a blow job.
' Trump is nothing but a con man and a buffoon.
CleanupEugene, what do you think is funny about a harmless student being stabbed through his heart by a mentally ill homeless man for no reason? Is it the same thing you find amusing about threatening another poster with genital mutilation, performed by yourself?
Yes, moron is his last name, dotard is his first name. Con-man bullsh!t liar is how his many many friends know him. What kind of man his age bleaches his hair and swirls it? Channeling his inner hairdresser!  Gay as a goose that dondi.
trump was an UTTER FAILURE in the debate.  He interrupted Hillary 51 times because he is a rude pig and an inconsiderate, poorly educated bully.  This man is NOT Presidential AT ALL.  Hillary DESTROYED him, with ease.  The GOP is totally FINISHED.  Kaput!  This is NOT a joke.  This is the END OF THE GOP.
"These trans people" just want to pee in peace. Funny thing, if you've ever used a public bathroom its quite likely you've shared that experience with a one of "those trans people" without  even realizing it.  On the other hand be careful what you wish for. When the transgender men return to the women's bathroom with their dashing masculine looks complete with facial hair remember ... under this proposal their birth certificates forced them to be there.
Treat women like crap and you should have your life ruined...except they haven't had their lives ruined and, in fact, are playing for schools right now. We need to start creating a society and culture where men don't feel entitled to sex, women's bodies, or women's subservience. We could start with teaching boys and young men that, hey, shocking, women are people and not sexual objects that exist for your pleasure. We could start with teaching mutuality and equality; that gender is a societal construct unrelated to biological sex. The very least we could do is mandate that male athletes go through consent and anti-violence programs before they play.   The other thing we could do is challenge pornography--what they did was right out of misogynistic porn.
It is Illegal to pay people differently for the same work. Which is why your assertion that people of different genders see it from their first job offers is rubbish. http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/downloads/legislation/acts/employment-equity/eegazette2015.pdf  Regardless, if businesses could pay women 17% less for exactly the same work that men do, why aren't all companies staffed entirely by women? The company would cut their wage bill instantly by 17% and increase profitability instantly.   The reason is because the gap is bullshit and you are not comparing apples with apples.
Good job for killing a 70 yr old suicidal man?   Give me a break!   A good job would have been to have prevented him from killing himself, not doing the job for him.    It is absolutely disgusting how aggressive and quick on the trigger finger police officers are today, and how both police departments and District Attorneys have no moral qualms at all about killing suicidal people.  This performance by the Springfield Police Department was a big failure.
The gender confused little man boy was neutered a log time so in all fairness he is just use to being bitched slapped and not knowng it.
Really? An "eye for attractive woman " is your pathetic excuse for trumps Access Hollywood video capturing his bragging about sexual assault? Yeah, very masculine! BTW - tired of LOSING yet?
Utter NONSENSE.  Why isn't Trudeau forced to denounce the FLQ, the guy that murdered all those women engineers, the guy that murdered Muslims in the mosque??? They were WHITE CHRISTIAN MALES...   You are just a racist  with nothing else to show for yourself. SHAME ON YOU spreading such FILTH.
My how fast this disappeared from the media.  Racist Black man shoots up white people in church is ho-hum.  But when the racist white man shot up black people in church it was all the media talked about for weeks.  How the hypocrisy continues.  No agendas here, nope.
The life of Hugh Hefner can be summed up in two sentences: 1) He never grew up. 2) He got rich because he knew American men would pay good money to look at t**s.
And since we're talking about "tranny porn" since you brought it up, you can confirm for yourself.  It doesn't matter if trans-women do not go through male puberty, their hips and other features simply do not match real females, they tend to have less of an hour glass figure, and many times they will use fillers to achieve that hour glass figure.  And this isn't all fat, it is also skeletal geometry.  If men and women were simply so similar that not going through puberty was enough these stark differences wouldn't persist. Even in one of the most impressive transitions using blockers, Andrej Prejec clearly shows a body without curves or wide hips. http://i.imgur.com/b5vtseU.jpg Beyond that the ethics of hrt treatment before people reach adulthood is still questionable. Hrt does not reverse bone changes, and its noted that even male reflexes are faster than that of women.
Getting shit-faced drunk isn't a good idea for man or woman.  But that doesn't excuse rape.
Crossing the border is not a crime, Bill. You believe that because you are an ignorant man who believes whatever appeals to your niggardly, heartless brain.
.  "The Proud Boys""  --  How to describe these guys?  Doofusses? (Doofi?)  Embittered white males tortured by their loss of privilege and lashing out at their perceived enemies?  Refugees from the 1950s?  Obsolete at 25 years of age?  Whatever, they are classic fodder for the far right/white supremacist/alt right/nationalist fringe.  Crushed that simply being male turned out to be not enough to put them at the front of the gravy train, stuck in dead-end, no-hope careers while they watch women(!) and immigrants who were smart enough and hard-working enough to educate themselves for the 21st century cruise past them in the line, they dress themselves in their prejudices and expect to be taken seriously by anyone other than their similarly self-burdened brethren.  Let them march around with their little uniforms, their smaller ideology and their non-existent self-respect.  They are their own punishment for their own failures.  .
It's going to be fun watching the mean white men beat up on the poor little girl. Polis will crush everybody with all of his money!
Sorry, I was not calling you a hypocrite, i am saying the attitude in general is hypocritical.  words, actions or attitude can be hypocritical I agree the discrimination and racism and all that crap got to go. But I have a problem when I see people that say they are victimized against (in various ways), then turn around and do the same exact thing to someone else - and then attempt to justify their actions.  Or on a different angle, when the police are trying to uphold the laws, then the police themselves screw it up royally and break the very laws they are supposed to uphold.  Yes, shootings of unarmed people on the top of that list, and it has happened here in Hawaii numerous times.  I am curious though about your views on "the superior white man situation."  Just because someone complains, does not mean they think themselves superior, Make sure you are not "projecting" on them what you assume they think.  It can simply mean they have a different world perspective of things.
You most certainly are muckraking, I do know all three of the men involved in this suit personally and I stand by my previous statement. If you think that Hattar is more "on the up and up" you are a fool, trust me. I agree with your statement that "none of us has the facts", you certainly do not. Your Madoff comparison is so off base, it would be laughable if it wasn't so irresponsible.
Beegor...........are you serious? Are you really supporting a man known to have ordered the execution of several of his critics?  You will not find much support for your ridiculous assertion that "we could use some of those In Canada. " Meaning politicians like Putin.  Your naivety is breathtaking!
mandatory 20 yrs!! lots of pokie in da oki.  that is gonna wipe that stupid smirk off his face, good luck oki, try stay away from the pokie men of halawa or fed pen or wherever you end up.
If Hillary's twin believes  it is only angry white men who will turn out to vote for Trump, he's totally clueless.
The Human Rights Tribunal/Commission is as out of touch as the UN and doing way more damage than good.  Just another RIDICULOUS ruling.  And the Liberals fall in line just like they do with any UN demands............what a messed up world we live in.   And when it comes to women Judges, most of the again ridiculous rulings seem to be coming from them, no common sense, heart over brains.  And I am a woman.   I feel very sad for young men who do not fit the quotas.    It is reverse discrimination, being carried out by our government.  Whatever happened to Canadians being treated equal?
Clinton molested women, obama traded 5 terrorists for a traitor and Trump sent a few tweets...WTF??? This hack who hasn't done anything meaningful in 40+ years needs to retire and leave politics to the men and women of this country who don't whine every time someone retaliates against the liberals threats and violence.
These were people who were harassing the Muslim Ban protesters outside the Portland airport.  They are led by a man called Grant Chisholm, who is dubbed the "hipster Fred Phelps."  He is a quite ugly and awful man.   Frankly, he and his buddies should be in jail.  Going into a church during Mass and screaming at the congregation is disturbing the peace.
You can keep repeating that feminism is about "fundamental equality of men and women" until you're blue in the face, but the reality is that the very terminology used by this hate-cult movement -- "patriarchy", a male-based term used to describe everything bad and negative in society, and "feminism", a female-based term used to describe everything good and the "savior" of society -- is the core of a dogma that is rooted in sexism and gender-hatred. It's in all of your academic writings, all of your media writings, and everywhere else throughout the movement. People aren't stupid and see right through your dismissals of the truth. The very premise of your hate-cult is patriarchy theory, which ignores much of the inequalities that remain. This is because your theory has no place for this reality, and therefore it fails. Bravo for William Shatner in calling attention to the gender-hate that is rife throughout feminism.
Kaepernick told us why he's kneeling:  “America refuses to address the pervasive evil of white cops killing black men, and I will not stand during a national anthem that honors the flag of such a country!”  The kneeling is based on a lie, as is the Black Lives Matter movement.  "Pervasive evil," my hinee.  Do racist police shootings occur?  Yes, indeed.  And they're prosecuted.  Even some cases that don;t have merit are prosecuted.
There's only one explanation for this...sadism. Couple of country boys raised to respect authority and elders have the misfortune of encountering someone utterly unworthy of respect. ODFW wtf?  Oregon State Troopers wtf?  If a 51 year old male had pulled this sadistic stunt on a couple of young girls? Or boys? WTF?
What are you using as a stereotype? If that was a photo of a white male you would not have said what you said it, admit it.  You looked at the photo and saw that he was black and decided he was associated with a gang. I don't know who you are trying to fool but it's not me. Intolerant Dem? Seriously? Overwhelmingly Democrats are more inclusive in their platform and policies. What, are we not inclusive because we don't tolerate hate speech from conservatives, the alt-right nazis and white privileged men who are completely clueless? Yeah I'll own that then I guess.
Old white men ARE the swamp.
Just imagine that there was a knock at your door at home. You open the door and there is a handful of people who ask permission to enter your home. You ask logically "What reason do you have, that requires entry to my house?" They reply "We want to protest the color of your house, the way you prune your trees, and the way you treat your spouse. We want to hang posters on your windows and march up and down on your lawn".   I'm sure all you women and men would be cheerfully greeted and the door swung wide open.  Are all activists brain dead... is the question of the day?! GK
These thugs have been free to walk the streets of Anchorage for 3 years after killing a young girl ?  Our court system has let them walk for 3 years already?    These men don't deserve to be breathing.  This, and they, are jut disgusting and a quick and efficient judicial process, tougher laws, and a quick and cheap death penalty are the way to go !!!!!!
What hypocrisy!  The Roman Church has been in the relic selling business for centuries.  For a fee, the "faithful" can part of the body of a saint/martyr.  Often, a tiny piece of bone.  Now if that isn't scattering body parts, how does it differ from scattering ashes?  An Irish jounalist, Liam Collins, reduced the church's argument to rubble,  “appears to have teams of under-employed civil servants with nothing better to do than dream up new ways to torment the faithful.”   Male clerics with too much time on their hands & nothing constructive to do.  Again, the curia can  be reformed but need to be removed all together.  Scattered like ashes in the direction of their origins.
You claim there is a lack of media coverage about women raping men while linking to a newspaper article about women raping a man... uh, ok!
Male teachers are as rare as hen's teeth in elementary school because teaching is no longer view as a respectful career. The consequences of years of teacher bashing and universities churning out new teachers (most wanting to teach elementary, English, social Studies, or biology) like it's an assembly line are finally coming home to roost (but enough with the chicken references).
Whether that is true is the point on which our foreign policy turns.  I believe your statement is true, and that the majority of Muslims, because of culture (a terribly backward one) and religion (a terribly intolerant one) are natural enemies of the West, and would like nothing better than to see Satan --- the West --- destroyed. Many Americans on the left are so self-loathing that they actually do hate America, and will not allow themselves to recognize the truth of what I just said. For example, look at the American Left's brand of feminism. If a man so much as looks at a woman in a bikini contest, he's a loathsome pig who "objectives" women.  Fair enough.  But where are the voices of these women against the culture of Islam, where women would be literally stoned for working at Hooters?  Silence.  They didn;t even raise their voices against one of the most sexist pigs ever: Bill Clinton. The American Left is one of the most incoherent political forces ever to grace Western politics.
"...you treasonous left wing nut" That's funny as your man in Washington-er, New York-stacks his Cabinet with Generals and billionaires.
Where did Trump come up with "a sick man, a demented man". Was he trying to describe himself but forgot to mention that. More fake news out of Trump.
good GOD A man owns  a business  and not allowed to run it as he sees fit  - these MUSLIMS tried this in seattle  put down prayer- rugs  at Burlington-Northern rail yard  - BN-stopped this stupid ordeal on the spot .
yeah, rape is hilarious isn't it Wavey? And not just the woman that Bill raped/molested and Hitlary persecuted. How bout how Hitlery laughed at getting that 41 year old guy off with just a year in jail after raping a 12 year old? Fricken sweet eh? Yeah rape is hilarious but raping children mo bettah mo bettah eh wavey?  Your the best man, what a stand up guy!
LOL so a hardcore catholic believer says we banned muslim cemeteries. Not even close to the case BUT if we get rid of divisive religious nonsense then hallelujah. The catholic church received 600 million dollars in last budget for 'immigration services" one 500 million and another 100 million chunk. Look it up. They are greedy pigs helping corporations reduce our quality of life while attempting to force a more violently enforced abrahamic religion on to us. For a peak at immigration reality in Canada: http://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/douglas-todd-why-canadians-need-to-debate-immigration-economics  The man who wrote this column in the G&M is the enemy of all Canadians and North Americans. His words and actions are clear. He is a traitor, loyal to a foreign religious head, not us.
GC:  "I do know of instances where the condemnation of family has destroyed the lives of young homosexual men and women".  Yes Gary, there are MANY, and there should be MILLIONS of  young and old homosexual men and women that realize  that their Sexual Lifestyle is WRONG.  REMEMBER, I Believe in the Bible and God and Jesus.  I know you do NOT as you have stated this numerous times prior.     I personally  do NOT and WILL not have any association with a Homosexual or Lesbian because of  scripture in the Bible.   I think  that's a Huge part of being  a DECENT person governing your day to day behavior as per the Bible.      Thanks for clarifying your sexual status and I am happy for YOU and your WIFE, and Good Luck with your Homosexual Friends.
Sorry Ms Maughan, as much as I respect you as a journalist, I contend that you got this one wrong. While the dire situation regarding economic transformation certainly requires urgent attention, the dire situation regarding some rather trashy journalism also needs addressing. And this was it - trashy journalism. And here I am not referring to the author, because we already know it was meant to be trash, but to Ms Pillay and Mr Hlongwane who performed none of the very basic journalistic requirements before rushing to publish this rubbish. And that alone requires a further question: Why? Was it because it supported their own views? If so, why should they be let off the hook and Joseph Goebbels not? For what was proposed for white males in this rattly little tale was not much different to introductory Nazi narratives on Jews, Gypsies, gays and other "unwanteds". We all know where that ended up. Do not defend the indefensible, rather, use your formidable journalistic skills appropriately.
Jane, but if a transgender has to use the bathroom - born a female, and now a male - that "male" has to use the womans bathroom if Minnery gets his way.  How, uh, uncomfortable do you think that will make your granddaughters?  They will be running out of the bathroom screaming "bad touch bad touch".   Yet, if the transgender who is a male, goes into the male bathroom, and uses a stall, no one will notice.    so.... which do you want?  Or want your pastors to keep molesting kids, because that seems to be happening a lot more than transgenders converting your granddaughters to "the geh".
what kills me is they are demanding....the men are still pigs and did not change.....they have over 10 kids while tax payers think twice about having children as they can't afford to yet these so called refugees can....come on don't kid around, this cohort is unlike any other in that they will milk us dry and not assimilate - I really have no time or patience for them....they will add to ur  our pot but only complain and take take take
Who will marry all of these boys who have no girls.  107 boys per 100 girls and boys die earlier for a multitude of reasons.  The 107/100 ratio is mother nature at work to counter the early death of boys.   Now we will have all of these boys who have no corresponding women and they will have to marry out side of their culture, which is okay by me, but an anathema to their family, and they will vilify the young man for dishonouring the family.  Simple yet valid conclusion,  people are stupid.
Disgusting, clueless lack of any respect for the name that they are supposedly representing , our name Canada, let alone the strong, men and woman of the past and future that have served and be killed, maimed. How could even the in conversation be brought up, let alone implemented for a space of time. What planet is this person from ? Me thinks that someone is trying to justify their job and do not deserve such a position in this company ! Indeed Air Canada, please feel free in the future to drop the name ! Shame on this classless person.
The Feminist Left  The group of pertetual outrage artists who keep the constant dark pressure on to make you think life is horrible and only they can fix it.  we see you and laugh  The defeat of Shillary and the Dems   was your fall off the cliff.  You just cant see it....  lol but we can. life is great!!  Everybody party and leave these fake news man-hating racist grumpies to their sorority butch sessions.  go enjoy life
While most murder victims are killed by people they know, you're still assuming an awful lot. Especially the shooter being female. Men are much more likely to be killers.
Baiting bears is usually allowed in areas where the understory is so thick that you would walk right past a bear and not see it.  Proper hunting?  How about using bait for halibut?  Still a bait station.  Spears or arrows are archaic for hunting, yes.   Both require more real 'hunting' skill than a firearm.  The Hunter has to be closer, more opportunity for the prey to smell or see the hunter.  Other than snares or deadfalls, clubs or spears are some of the basic, traditional hunter tools.  A whole lot more sporting than sitting 200 to 400 yards away and shooting a firearm.  The Bambi lovers are going to hate anything to do with hunting or killing wild animals.  Who cares, I don't but remember, very few people would have even known about this spear guy if he had not been so stupid and posted on the 'unsocial', social media!  I do wonder just how many of the anti hunters approve of abortion though?
Give me a break.   They are afraid of the truth.   The Women and Gender Studies Institute has been peddling hatred and nonsense unopposed for years.  Now someone has the courage to espouse an opposing view, and fight back against the hatred and vitriol that left-wingers throw at someone who does not agree with their views.   And they are afraid.   They cannot fight with the truth of their ideas. So to go to daddy to tell the nasty man to go away.   Pathetic.  And it will be really pathetic if the U of T caves in to this nonsense.
If Justin really wanted to connect with regular Canadians he could have started Canada's 150th Anniversary attending a New Years event and attending an annual event that draws Canadians together, the World Junior Championships. Instead he went to the Bahamas.  The man is a hypocrite.
in all fairness, it should also be noted that the following perceptions:   "The black-man-as-criminal stereotype runs deep. The archetype is so prevalent that the majority of whites and African Americans agreed with the statement “blacks are aggressive or violent”    are perpetuated by what has become a very dominant part of black culture; glamorizing the thug life, gettin' paid- quick and easy, slangin' rocks, all the hoes you can handle, so on and so forth.  with having said that, perhaps the black community should also be focusing on the people who promote and peddle that horseshit.  because it's not helping their cause.
"Did you just Google that?"  A comment that could just as easily have been made to a man and has been.  "You don't have kids and are not even married" I am struggling with this one. If anybody had made a statement like that to an employee in any organisation that I have been involved with there would have been serious consequences.  "stuff it up and sink the office" This is often said of men. The biggest challenge for a newly promoted person is to get their peers who were competition on side. About 25 years ago I heard of a comment around promotion time "No balls no brains" and the guy who made it didn't last very long at all.    The younger person is usually the one who pours the coffee.   "I think of you as my daughter" Never heard that one before.  "Proposals in meetings" Obviously never seen the way that guys sometimes stab each other in the back.  "You should smile more" I have undoubtedly been called a miserable git by my staff. It's tough supporting The Kings.
It makes zero sense that you commit treason of our lands for a foreign government. It makes zero sense to pillage BC of various rainforest with trees over 1,000 years old because a stupid man wants to sell CDO's and BBB's on the stock market.  and believe me, I will rip your balls off for lying.
Aspirational self-identified gender? Griping about how two marginalized populations i.e. Native Hawaiians and transgender individuals tick the boxes sounds like you are an intolerant racist white male. You are a petty man.
The problem is that both men and women are silly and immature in their 20's and 30's.  They should be grown up by then, but, sadly, they are not.  Young women: do not spend your time with men that are not good candidates for marriage and family, if that is what you want.  Here's a clue: men who are ready for a family will say so and they will visibly have their life on track.  Young women often like to go along without saying what is on their mind.  Try this: say to a young man exactly what you want.   You will have less dates but the few you have will be with men with the same goals as you.  This is the advice I give my daughter.  Absolute honesty  with yourself and others will turn some people off.  But it's an essential filter for quality people.
Of course I meant to write "trying to make the point that it's OK to bash men but not women" ..
as usual you are as many here incompentent and stupid at the same time about trump. . the media gave trump a free pass? man what planet of stupid were you on? they were shilling outwardly for hillary!..  and save the usual talking point bs,, his presidency is 2 months old, yet you ignorant sheep are calling it a train wreck? man get some help for the brain washing stupidity you live in
I'm not sure what world that Mark lives on but I must have missed the 'man meeting,' that told me what 'being a fag', was just a phrase of encouragement?    I have no comrades that would use that on me, or me on them.      I will say that I believe men and women are built differently.    Most people have grown to understand that mind and body are inseparable.   If your bodies are not built the same way, our perception of the world around us will be different as well.    And there is good reason to believe that some behaviors are 'encoded' from day one.    There is probably a construct of 'normal' attributes to men and women, but it's bias and ignorance to believe that those attributes are common to all men or all women.     Mark's opinion of what is 'natural' for a male, may not be natural at to every male at all.     And while our biology may influence our behavior, we are not bound by our biology alone.
Absolute power does what?  Refresher: corrupts, absolutely. Piercy and Co. may not truly be corrupt, but that means their incompetence, lack of reasoning, and gullibility are truly gargantuan.  What's amazing is the hubris of the Council. Zelenka, a perfect example: he keeps hammering for his ridiculous green build even though years and years of data show the savings are dependent on energy costs frozen in the studies and that the projected fiscal savings may never arrive because of the cost difference between restoration and new-build. What's truly astounding, though, is a supposedly green "authority" pitching a building that appears largely to be walls of glass. This is like the retired guy building a 5,000 sq ft home for him and his wife, alone, but it is LEED! Another great one is the 99-lb. woman driving a 5000 pound hybrid pickup truck; grocery store, bridge games, golf club--- yup, she needs all that weight and size!
Contrary to liberal lies, kids are learning that being white is one of the worst things you can be, being a white male is a double whammy.  Liberals love to pit one group against another and spread their hate that way Unarmed minorities?   Is that why some of the most violent areas in the country are where minorities congregate?  I know from past posts that you are black and proud. From this post and others that you are pro-hate.   Why should it be any more racist for me to be white and proud? Anti-hate, white, proud, and unapologetic.
One side was Nazi flag-waving, Swastika-carrying, xenophobic thugs intimidating a college campus and city with unabashed hatred toward jews, gays, and anyone who is not white, male, straight, Christian and gun-toting.  The other side was objecting to this vile intrusion. If that's alt-Left, sign me the f*** up.
Mr. Johnson,  Rarely are there witnesses to sexual assault. The perps oftem claim that the SEX was consensual. Sexual Assault perps generally only as much force as necessary to get what they want. Sometimes they don't even get DNA evidence.   I was not there (trial) but it!s my experience in similar cases that there had to be more physical evidence that was brought up into the cases. Jury's take their responsibility very deeply.   I don't know if you know what it is like to go through a sexual assault exam but I can tell you it is NOT pleasant. Nor is the interrogation, where police officers ask all sorts of questions. Then you have friends, family and sometimes your class mates or co-workers who look at you differently or question you and blame you for what happened.  Not something that many women or men want to have happen.  My guess, and that is what it is, something important and was brought to the court to question if the error made is something the communities want to see.
Ernie, whites commit 60% of the violent crimes in the US (DOJ stats 2015). However, a young black male is 20 times more likely to be killed by the police. Why?
If gender were replaced by race in this clueless memo, there would be no discussion over his firing.   Explaining why another race is not "biologically" equipped to work at Google would be outrageous, sadly people on this comment board are defending a memo stating just such a thing about women.  How does this memo make women working at Google feel?  By writing such a stupid memo, this man, ironically, reveals himself not fit to work at Google.
Shaun King's a white boy trying to outblack blacks. That's what this is about. Has naught to do with Kolin Caepernick.
Thanks for your warm cares and wishes everyone!! I really like how you turned my being shot into a fucking nit pick contest have you no compassion anymore ? That's the real problem nowadays!!! Sincerely the guy that was shot on Fairbanks street by a black guy and a white guy i. A black BMW
say what you will about the Donald.  He may be a con man he may be a little out of his depth, but at least he slayed the dreaded Hillebeast.  So cut him a little slack.
I find there's a certain dark comedy in that subset of sorry white males* who hold libertarian and/or 'survival of the fittest' beliefs while simultaneously angrily blaming their lack of success on those nasty females, queers, colored folk.  * not necessarily referring to you, BrfY. I'm much too polite to do that.
Steve:   There are other men living in our community that are stupid enough to fall for a scam like this one.  They need to be warned what can happen to them.   This news story is thus a sort of public service announcement.
You're assuming this man is telling the truth about that and yet, this is not the only animal he has abused or killed.
What are you talking about? The article clearly states she's a liberal who can't stand Trump and makes no bones about it. It talks about her various liberal affiliations. Are you delusional?  As far as her hate for Agent Orange: You're missing that big part of the puzzle that contains the piece explaining exactly WHY she hates Trump.  I hate him too. He's a detestable piece of shite who is tearing this country apart. I feel it's my patriotic duty to call him out and expose what he's really doing. She does too.  Her extreme dislike for Trump is a function of her patriotism.  It's surreal that she could go to prison while the real criminal, con man, cheat and outright fraud continues as President.   You can't make this stuff up. Trump has been obstructing the investigation for months, and people like you say "so what? What's the problem? It's a fake investigation hyped by the fake media, invented by the fake intelligence agencies..." and on and on.   WTF is wrong with you? Are you blind?
Boots, a wise man will change his position on various issues when presented with information he did not previously have.   Anyone who refuses to do so is a fool.  That makes trump a wise man.
More effective may have been the use of  the slang word for the male organ to insult, both in English and Afrikaans starts with a p.  Typical male chauvinist language!  Niehaus is male and a  real opportunistic "P" "R" + 3 , unless he is a ......?
You have failed at your attempt to blame the "white nan" .. when a black officer shoots a white man... No one complains. A white officer shoots a thug... People go nuts.
Disgusting, primitive, grubby thieves the lot of them. #Zumamustrotinjail  Time for the (few) good men and women left in the ANC to form a new party and leave the criminal syndicate they currently find themselves in. "ANC" is just a name. The ANC of Mandela, Sisulu, Tambo, Gordhan, can be recreated in a different guise, guys! Just pack up and leave the syndicate.
Barry said nothing much during the Ferguson riots or when a mob of blacks dragged a white man out of his car to beat him.   Said nothing about the black gang that killed a white couple just because, made the girl drink bleach and gang rapped her as well as lit her on fire.  The press glossed over that one, why? Because they are anti white
Race issues is out of your league, Rhyner.  I agree 100% with Elise's op-ed.  The social issues may have changed to a certain degree, but race ideologue hasn't changed one bit.  Within the past year, the US Dept. of Justice released a scathing report about racial profiling in certain states where black men were being shot to death by police.  And if we as a nation has advanced, race wise, as you claim then why is there still a need for affirmative action laws?  And you have the nerve to blame President Obama because he's black.  You can't separate your irrationality, Rhyner.  If the president is black he must  be to blame for while cops shooting unarmed black men.  Riggggght.
I am appalled that we men have to point out how freaking sexist this article is. Exactly what you are saying ... paint us all with a brush defined by a few bad apples.
I see lots of triggered angry old white men posting in the comments today.
Shoot that straw man full of holes, Yosemite! Blam! Blam! Varmints!
Well, Don, as someone once posted in this thread: "Without credible sources, your piece is just one guilty white man’s opinion."
The rethuglicans have an unnatural fixation on their wives and mother's genitalia. What, you say? WHAT? They are female. We are the females. You are the males. How is it your authority to make laws about our bodies, when we make no laws for your bodies. Pedophilia should be punished by castration. Why are you not calling for that? Cuz you want more children to prey on? Where is your outrage at that, males? You do nothing when your priests, pastors, friends, and donors defile children. NOTHING! They are out walking the streets, teaching, and in our own government! WHY is abortion your only talking point? When will castration be discussed out loud and in your face for those men who rape women and our children? Is it any wonder abortions exist? Who the hell wants to raise a child as a ward of YOUR state? Ask yourselves. You high and mighty men are mice. You get scared to death when you can't get it up. Call me a Fembot, if you'd like, but I can't say on here what I really call you.
There's a little race for governor in Virginia, and human-weasel manimal Ed Gillespie is going full metal racist in his ads.     Dems always think that "the media" is somehow the preventive measure for this stuff, that when Republicans "go there" the wise old white men of the editorial pages will write sternly worded editorials denouncing them and it will backfire.  It doesn't work that way. Those old white men of the editorial pages are often pretty racist themselves, even if they are offended by "the tone." More than that, they just don't have the power and influence they once did.  Working the refs has value, but unlike baseball, there are no rules to this game.  We all have to step up and heap scorn on the racists, our scorn is all they deserve.
Emperor Trumpo the Magnificent is unhappy. The man-baby can't get a win... anywhere.
Would you say that Obama was a "strong man" and a "tough guy" with "balls"? Draw a red line....
Hard to believe that a man of Morneau's background is this stupid.
Yet another disgusting guy making men look bad, been a lot of that lately.
Apparently my visceral reaction to this guano was not considered civil. Whatever. Hard to figure out what that means in respect to a "man" who refers to a woman as a "hole".
Yep! Criticize a black, gay, Jew , male, female, immigrant, certain illegal immigrant and you are racist, sexist, homaphobic, anti Semitic, xenophobic. I apologize if I missed someone.
As a cabbie once put it, "another woman trying to be a man"
Really they should slow down huh. Screw you. This man was my father, you have no idea the situation or cause. People like you are what is wrong with humanity. Why don't you just go ahead and crawl into a hole because I'd sure enjoy to bury you.
I think this bodyguard and other emplyees may be lying like hell purposefully being 'YES MEN" to keep their jobs. the so called incriminating photo of David Mueller, Swift and the third girl is not incriminating. Her dress is not up as she said, The guys hand does not look to be on her butt. Plus third girl in photo says she saw nothing. Swift is smiling in the photo. If this photo is one of sexual assault why the hell is she smiling? The evidence in this case seems damned shabby. I think one spoiled  celebrity lied like hell about this so called assault, stupid jurors believed this idiot because she is a celebrity. The 'little guy" went down and this exaggerating spoiled bitch from hell won. Then she was seen in all the right places like Mariska Hargitays sexual assault fund onstage. Swift makes me sick.She owes Mueller an apology.She goes on to make millions while David Mueller cant get a job. I wish Swift would fall in a damned hole. I am sick of her and her stupid faces.
Mexico is setting itself up as a "whipping boy" for Trump.  That could play to Canada's advantage. Just because Trump's style is abrasive doesn't mean he isn't still the most powerful man in the world. Very foolish for Mexico to act as though they don't have an awful lot to lose.
Burn them, burn them! I'll bet they are man-made climate change deniers too.
more local male violence!
You're using the trad argument that gay people don't exist?    If that works for you, fine, but we both know that gay people do exist, that the John Jay report says 15 to 51 percent of priests are gay, and that Bishop Accountability tells us that 80% of the abuse cases were male priests raping boys.  By the way, "neoconservative" is a political term that applies to international affairs, and not social issues related to gender studies.
Gender inequality in the Canadian economy remains highly visible. Women are paid less than men in 469 out of 500 occupations monitored. -—---------------------------------2-  Complete garbage. In the same position women earn exactly the same amount of money as men. This distorted stat emanates from the fact that men tend to occupy more senior executive positions. Nothing is stopping the female gender from pursuing senior executive positions other than their personal choice to have children and not return to work after their maturity leave.  Many return, others, BY CHOICE, stay at home or find other positions that are more flexible for a young mother.    There is literally nothing more to it.
Jackie:  actually you should read the coverage of the case and the police report on the incident. Your "reading" is really quite mistaken.  You're spinning this to be a racist motivated incident.  You state "white chick gets drunk, has consensual sex with black kids"  Two issues here: a) the young woman involved was not a "white chick".  She was AfricanAmerican. b) ", has consensual sex with black kids".  This, of course, is the central issue of the incident.  The young woman claims the sex was NOT consensual...the young men claim it WAS consensual.  .......a classic "she said, he said" incident.  ADGardner determined the woman would not be a credible witness and, therefore, decided to not prosecute the case.  The coach, the AD department, and then the University administration each instituted disciplinary actions based on, first, athletic code of behavior, and, then, the University disciplinary code.  All the info is readily available.  Read it and educate yourself.  Gary Crum
He is trying for that $10M book deal....at the rate he is going I hope he writes it as he will surely  screw up just like he did the last several months.  He will surely implicate the Clintons, Obama, Loretta Lynch, and the rest of the pack of slimy vermin for indictment.  Let him spew, the more he talks the worse it gets for this fool.  Head of the FBI???? Man, there has never been a bigger girly-man than this guy!  He hides behind the curtains, he is the leaker, ....investigate the heck out of this guy!  How many other leaks has he done!!  He wastes our time, and hurts the country like never seen before!!  Indict him on 18USC-641 asap!  GO TRUMP!!!  #MAGA!!!   Bring out those tapes soon!!
Arguably, based on the Catholic definition of sin, the answer is that voting for a particular politician could be a sin.  II. THE DEFINITION OF SIN 1849 Sin is an offense against reason, truth, and right conscience; it is failure in genuine love for God and neighbor caused by a perverse attachment to certain goods. It wounds the nature of man and injures human solidarity. It has been defined as "an utterance, a deed, or a desire contrary to the eternal law."121  Equally arguably, depending on your own values and beliefs on reason, truth and right conscience,  voting for Mr Trump, Secretary Clinton or Mr Duke, could be a sin.  The decision this year is between a boorish undisciplined man with frat house language, and a lying woman  whose documented actions are far worse than anything anyone has said.  Which vote is actually a mortal sin won't be known by us until we are discussing with St Peter what we did on Earth to justify getting into Heaven.
I guess we'll see that when  we see white males protesting when one of their own rapes a woman or child, shoots up a theatre, church, school, mosque, etc. You know? Those things which happen DAILY?  I mean, it's just right, right?
You are wrong. Hating white men (and women) is a sign of social justice. Please apologize for being a racist denying the right of the non-white to hate you
I agree with you.  Harper was not my cup of tea, but he was not a man to fear.  Trump is truly terrifying.
Champ, in your fantasy, all these folks, unarmed and shot in the back, the cops should be serenaded? Or do you just like propping up straw men in order to knock them down with your gang garbage?
If the genders were reversed the men would have been fired and forced to register as sex offenders.
I'm a Democrat and this may be the most rambling, incoherent, idiotic comment I have ever read on this message board. We protect airports to prevent terrorists from taking planes with hundreds of innocent people down. Remember 9/11? It isn't because of some irrational fear "old white guys" harbor.  So you are blaming  "old white guys" for the fact that a gay nightclub was not protected by TSA employees? Deborah, it must be nice to live in your little black and white bubble world where if it just wasn't for "old white men" the world would be a peaceful, and equitable place.   Get over George Bush. Find a new boogey man to blame your paranoid fantasies on. And sorry you married (or had a relationship) with a controlling man. That was your mistake, so don't paint all men with brush of the jerk you married.
Pence ran for the door.  He believes in re-programming gay people.  Perhaps he felt a little confused after a few hours of being dazzled by Broadway's best. Pence should stick to pig races at the state fair if he doesn't want to be challenged by art.  He's a hateful man who seeks to deny others basic human rights and he does it in the name of god.  Dangerous and sad.  He deserves to be called out.   Art has a glorious gay agenda!
I am still amazed that people actually voted for Trump. I thought better of the right. But what kind of a wanker do you have to be; how delusional; what kind of messed-up self image do you have to have in order to see yourself in Trump? Is being like Trump your aspiration? Ugh. And what kind of nihilistic idiot do you have to be to vote for a man who has put so many unfit people in charge of blindly destroying so many important departments and institutions in our nation? Thanks to Trump, we now have an unbelievably ignorant, old, white male racist elitist who is the top law enforcement officer in the nation: Sessions. He is determined to turn the clock back to a time when male white power was supreme and anyone who wasn't part of that elite group was required to bow to it. I'm proud to say I have absolutely nothing in common with Trump supporters. Nothing, nada, zilch. I really don't know how they can live with themselves.
ABC did show a 2009 photo of Trump with Weinstein at a movie premiere.  However the sad truth, you have powerful Hollywood types like Seth MacFarlane who say he knew Weinstein was a sexual abuser, and all he did was make a joke at the Oscars.  And yet Seth said Hollywood didn't support Trump because they knew he was a con man and Hollywood deals with con men every day.  Unbelievable hypocrisy.
Chances are she won't even know if a former man is in the ladies room. I worked with a man who had been a woman for three months and NEVER had a suspicion until someone told me after he had moved away. Also, a friend of mine was born a man and is now a woman and …………. well, she has boobs. That said, you would probably look pretty silly beating up a woman in a woman's rest room.
This is ridiculous and causes me to question the man's judgment.  He did not come home and witness a crime in progress. Nor was there a huge party at his house.  Instead, he comes home to learn that his kid had friends over and they drank. For that he wastes the state police's time, our tax dollars, and teaches his kid that his dad is a dork.
Women are trying to be the men and the men..well they have to the be women. Feminism is a fad and eventually it will die out but until then these millennials are some sad puppies in socialigical-experiement gone mad.  :  Women are told to reject men, reject being a mother, a wife, a nurturer then even reject sex because you know, men are rapists. And now they must compete with them men at everything. This is no communist love-in, it is pure 3rd reich capitalism - work will set you free! But will it make you happy?  :  The guys, what do they need to do anything for, who are they working to impress, to provide for, to be the man of the what house? Are they suppose to be the protector of women or in competition with them?
Perhaps young black men should avoid gangs, guns and drugs and the police would not need to confront them--unless BLM thinks that culture is appropriate.
When I served in the military (of another country) we, as senior NCOs, were often saddled with new young subalterns. These raw young men often matured into excellent leaders but at the stage of newly qualified "idiots" they would make a mess of things and they would be reprimanded, rather colourfully at times but, as long as SIR was appended it was accepted that no DISRESPECT had been given. I am reminded of that when I see the repeated use of GENTLEMEN in the article for, while the officers in question had been well-trained and later developed well in their role, these GENTLEMEN (and others of their ilk) offer no prospect of ever being officers or gentlemen and certainly in their present roles they display none of those characteristics. Even the lowly hyena is more ethical in its natural habitat.
He has male genitals- he's a boy and should run with the boys, or else simply drop gender designations with races and run everyone together.  Let everyone compete for the same 1st, 2nd, and 3rd as well as state records based on performance straight across rather than dragging kid's sports into social  gerrymandering of  genders.
'Women' who should be at home cooking dinner for their husbands.
I agree - the sooner the sexually focused frustrated confused male can get his hands on his masturbation toy, the females will be able to breathe a sigh of relief.  Unfortunately, most of the males can't think with both their brains simultaneously and thus perpetuate the spreading of STDs, rape and divorce suits.
Peter, they were shocked about what I thought of my experience there. They never thought they were acting like bigots. One of them even told me he was married to a Latina, like that inoculated him from being a bigot. Slave owners made a profit center out raping their black slaves. We know most white men are willing to have sex with just about anybody and anything. I earned every penny of my Tier 1 PERS retirement, working with these people.
Dang, that's good commentary coming from a black man.
How can anyone, republican or democrat, seriously support this JOKE of a "President"? The man is a bafoon and nothing more than a reality show wannabe. I wish Palin would have been President over this idiot. To support this lunatic says something about ones character in my opinion. A complete embarrassment to the U.S. and on an international level. The U.S has become a laughing stock globally.
No, when white men act like terrorists, they're called mentally disabled. But they do seem to have a brand of christianity in common. Your last sentence though is pretty funny and ironic.
For once you are right. Bill Clinton is the only, or at least one of very few, men to cheat on his wife. Unlike Donald Trump, Bill did not have the decency to divorce his wife and marry his younger mistress, then divorce her and marry a yet younger imported model. Donald Trump has his own history of womanizing. Let's examine his behavior.
Arnie has lost my respect. I refuse to see any movies with him in it. Maria worked so hard to support him like a good dedicated wife just like Jane Fonda did trying to raise money for Tom Hayden's elections. Glad to ready Hayden is dead already. Both men are hypocrites and should stay out of the newspapers. Drop dead, Arnie.
And then those who just become a garbage man. How much education did that require?
"...the day of the massive Women's March on Washington — was a heartening day..." YES! YES! pray God it is a sign that women of the world have had enough of male ignorance and over-reach. May women's determination persevere in confronting the insane religion and politics of exploitation and pretense in the face of Mother God! The future of life on Earth depends on deep-root female sanity!!!
Traditional Europe changing to Eurabia has just been accelerated dramatically by an incompetent woman in way over her head as Chancellor of Germany.  She has flooded her country with hundreds of thousands of illiterate Muslim men who are hard core unemployable and will never assimilate,
And once again "our" delegation votes to erase a black man from history in lock step with the republican party .
No I am not in favour of that but unfortunately and tragically numerous women in Canada and the US are gang raped by white Christian men but we are not about to make sweeping generalizations about all white Christian men bases on the terrible behaviour of a few.
Lampert will feast on the carcass of Sears until it is powdered bones. Man is a bloodsucking leech.
no one wants to abolish our health care you lying sack of left wing bs, man you idiots will make up anything based on your hate
Yeah, you represent Muslims well, Minshall. Not. But then again, maybe your caustic, superior demeanor is pretty typical of Muslims. Muslim MEN, anyway. The women have to be more careful lest they trod on some sexist Muslim law regarding what women are allowed to do or say or not do or say.
So how is the murder rate in NYC, are they still pushing over tombstones there, can a black person live in trump towers, are the banks there going to need bailing out again, what have you done to stop global warming and keep the sea from taking over your subway system, is Three Mile island safe, are you involved in the fight for healthcare or do you just obsess about stupid theories on dog care? A major part of creating a TEAM is figuring out how the dogs get along, having fighters or dogs that continually bang the tug line is a no brainer, how often do dogs that come into heat get dropped? How about taking out your energy on purebred dogs with smashed faces that cause sinus problems, STOP breeding in genetic defects that cause a dog pain and suffering all their lives, what happens to racing Greyhounds at your local dog tracks. Maybe you could buy a castilator kit and ambush male dogs in NYC to keep the population down. Are the feral cats there spreading disease to other wild animals,
Compared to the rest of the clown car cabinet, I will concede that he is something of an adult.  Nor does it even matter if he is an oil man.  The planet is doomed anyway.  Putin will doubtlessly give him another medal for helping things along.
Oh, I used the word "damn". Well, hit me with a limp strand of spaghetti.   If you think for one instant that Trump is going to lead a crusade to make men more responsible, you are even more out of touch than I thought you were. Trump is the man who said that his "Vietnam" was avoiding sexually transmitted diseases. He does not seem to have grown in personal responsibility since then.
Mr. Hobson is mocking Burke's hypocrisy with this.  Burke is so upset that Amoris Laetitia allows a few remarried people to receive Communion without an annulment; these people tend to be the most innocent people in the divorce.  The classic case is the abused and abandoned woman who remarries and finds happiness but cannot get an annulment for a myriad of reasons.  Burke wants to deny such a hypothetical woman Communion without examining the particulars of the case, but he is totally okay with aligning himself with a thrice married Catholic who is alleged to have abused at least one ex because he serves Burke's odious political purposes.   And while I am generally against Catholic priests denying politicians Communion for political judgments, I think Bannon's case is one of the rare cases where Canon 915 does apply.  The man is clearly a racist demagogue who is using his position to spread hate.  It is scandalous for him to receive Communion.
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI! - White male conciousness is rising.
and the lib troll is truly showing the ignorance, the swamp is not the cabinet you idiot, it is the entrenched bureaucrat and politician that are in it for thier pockets over service as well as the never ending government intrusiveness into lives, business that holds back the economy, man will one left winger actually learn something before posting such ignorance that gives us all a reason to laugh at every post you make
The author was referring to young men in general, not young Muslim men only.  Nice try at setting up a straw man to easily blow down.  Most of the data the author quoted came from the USA, where Muslim young men make up an insignificant fraction of the overall population of young men.  Huge portions of urban USA have problems of violence, drug use, unemployment, you name it.  None of it is related in any way to Islam; in fact right wing Christianity has more influence in these areas.  Read the article again; the point is that young men in general throughout western society are growing up without the influence of a father figure and they end up easily radicalized as a result.  That means gangs in inner cities and peddling drugs, etc., and of course a small proportion also get involved in radical Islam.  Roughly half of the Canadian young men who joined ISIS, were not raised as Muslims and had absolutely no Muslim influence until finding ISIS on the internet.
How can you seriously support this JOKE of a "President"? The man is a bafoon and nothing more than a reality show wannabe. I wish Palin would have been President over this idiot.

Typical libtard drivel from a man who has his head up is the DNC's backside and is all too willing to comment against the POTUS knowing very well that he doesn't all the facts. His desire to trash our President is just a knee jerk reaction bent on scurrying favor from a soulless group of Hollywood elites who defense pedophilia, sexual abuse and human trafficking. Tom is part of the old Hollywood and sooner or later his bubble is gonna get busted when someone tells the story of his sexual abuses against women in his industry.
I like how when confronted by the MALE passenger about being an asshole, he says bring it on guy should have ripped him a new one!
The hard truth to accept is this is (sadly) the new normal. If you’re shocked now that Trump is lying, or continuing to lie, you’re behind the eight ball. If all of the “not my president” people continue to be shocked that Trump is a liar, cheat, fraud, racist, sexist, con man, etc. etc. etc., come the end of the term all of his supporters will simply re-elect him for the sake of it or “let’s give him a chance” to make America grate again. The other half of America will need to get off their as* and vote him out.
so, as a minority do you blame the White Man your not a millionaire by now? or as a millionaire in this Free World do you believe you'd be better off in another Country? Let's see the Black fb player play fb in Europe and rake in the millions! C if I care, they can take their wares out of the US for all I care. College fb, Baby! The USA ain't the Heavenly Heaven, we all humans with shortcomings. Deal with it if you got the millions! Run for an elected office and Change the Laws but i'll say you'll never change all the peoples minds. We're all humans, racism will always be here as long as humans roam Earth. Even if we had Aliens from Mars attack Earth we humans would still have racism on Earth and YOU can take that to the bank!
NEWSFLASH: Not everyone is a fan of white male supremacy.  Now, don't you have a shelf to put up or gutters to clean?
I have never liked Bill Clinton.  I have stated elsewhere he is too was an opportunist and narcissist, but not to the extent of our current Narcissist in Chief.  Pan, my disdain for Trump is not about his politics per se, it's about the fact the man is more dangerous than any other nut job we have ever had for a president and that includes Nixon.  It only gets political for me when I have to watch GOP members I used to respect go deaf, dumb, and blind.....and when I know from first hand experience what the GOP under Trump will do to the Nation's safety net.  You think our streets are dangerous now?  Just wait.  We have taken exactly zero lessons from the revolts during Arab Spring.  Here's how I see things.  Dems use antiseptic and band aids on cancer and call it good, and then slink to the bank with their kick backs.  The GOP doesn't bother.  They leave the cancer victim to spontaneous remission or death, and then they march to bank with their kickbacks like self righteous heroes.
Trump's voters are a scary bunch.  Not all are this poorly\ educated but many are.  This pathetic white man is really not at all welcomed by the rich.  He is scum under their feet.  Sad that he thought he belonged to the same country that trump belongs to.  The election saw millions duped by a skilled entertainer serving the rich.
agree.  This man has played the judicial system for the fools they are.  He has revealed how weak and incompetent Big Island officials are.  He has no intention of revealing anything.  He has lied for decades.
Transgender identity is a mental illness.  So to be fair and inclusive, there should be three bathrooms: male, female and mentally ill.

The person that gave her permission to make such a ridiculous statement should be fired. Maybe not, perhaps it is the parity minister that needs to be fired. Sad times for Canada with this failing government of women, and the PM who fears and hates men.
That link didn't say a single word about ERMUHGOD GAY ORAL SEX!!!! HOT, HOT MAN ON MAN ORAL SEX!!!111
Conte is a sad man he just can't get over that he supported a loser
congrats, but old story, stop writing the same damn thing.  get out there and report on other stories.  geez, isn't there other players on the team or other teams that are doing just as good as she is? enough!! i love what she has accomplished, but there are others on the team and there are countless other all around the island who also deserve some recognition.  give other their due!! would you be writing so many articles if a male was to join the female volleyball or cheer squad and excel!! i don't think so, why? because there was many males who contributed to a all female cheer squad but we never get to hear their story, but oh wow when there is a female who breaks into male sports we have to endure weeks of the same ole story, come on be fair to others out there, they all work their butts off male and female.
When Gretchen Carlson and Megan Kelly and a dozen others accused Roger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly, and Eric Bolling of sexual harassment, we learned that for decades it was an open secret at Fox News that they were predators.  The sanctimonious right kept quiet.  Even when these whales were harpooned, they stayed silent.   When an anti-abortion Republican congressman was caught demanding his mistress have an abortion, Caldera was dumb as a post.  When Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was accused of sexually abusing 3 underage male students, Caldera was dumb as a post. When Trump was accused by 17 women of sexual harassment during the campaign and bragged that because he was rich, he was entitled to sexual assault any woman he wanted, Caldera was dumb as a post.  Could it be that Caldera and the right have a double standard on acceptance of sexual harassment?
the reality prejudice by the left against facts is as usual the mentality of the dark ages in support of some fantasy, a true religious cult by any definition!,, the close one's eyes to the scam of mans carbon claims of heating the climate takes a truly sick ignorant empty mind..
No one cares about this trailer trash race ....Men and women die everyday for OUR freedom and you Dbags are talking about a bunch of tools on snowmachines ....OMG so gangster
Who cares even if he was smoking and drinking.  That in no way makes it ok for him to be killed.  You are not intelligent just because you use the term cognitive dissonance.  You're scum man.  You have absolutely no sense of decency
White male Anti-Globalists peacefully marching = Bad. Violent masked Globalist crypto-fascists throwing bricks = Good. Shut up slaves, MSM
Putin and his short man's disease syndrome.
"hey look, a white guy committed some horrendous crimes.  man, that guy is so white.  just look at how white that guy is.  sittin' there, bein' all white, thinkin' about how white he is.  stupid white guy."  that work for ya?  go race-bait elsewhere.
Really?   Gay males account for about 3- 6% of the male population.     In 2014, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men accounted for 83% of primary and secondary syphilis cases.  Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men are 17 times more likely to get anal cancer than heterosexual men. Doh.  Gay and bisexual men accounted for 67% (26,376) of all HIV diagnoses in 2015.  From the CDC....  https://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/STD.htm  This is a national health crisis that negatively and unnecessarily impacts every American.... including you Jimbo.  The gay lifechoice is as deadly as smoking cigarettes.
Renzette, Southey, McLaren et. al must have some kind of Cards Against Humanity rip off game called Cards Against the Patriarchy. The constant haranguing against men backed up with unproven stats, discredited theories, cherry picked examples and the barely self contained rage of their own person grievances against anything male, white and not cuckolded to feminism. A group that will not be content until every white male in N. America is emasculated.
It was only a matter of time.  I'm not blaming the women for the husbands' infidelities.  But I am questioning why a woman would allow a man to do that to her.   Fair question that has been asked my many, I'm just dumb enough to ask it for others to read.  And earn you poor judgment award.  It's always the idiot that questions the obvious.
Motley:  We're betting all our lives that neither of these disturbed men will actually act on their ridiculously frightening rhetoric.  You actually seem to believe that some sort of pre-emptive strike, perhaps an assassination of Kim Jong-un is the answer.  IMO, we're already in a MAD relationship with North Korea.  Perhaps NK can't reach the continental US with nukes, but there's little doubt they can reach SK, Japan and, of course, Guam.  I truly believe Kim Jong-un is perfectly willing to give the "launch" order if we institute such a pre-emptive effort.  Are you really willing to sacrifice SK, Japan and Guam for the "pleasure" of nuking NK or attempting to assassinate Kim Jong-un and betting that wouldn't precipitate a reprisal attack?   Mercy, I hope not.   Gary Crum
A soldier boasting about his battles is a common and tolerated thing. Sajjan risked his life many times for you. There are too many low white racists in Canada. This is a brave soldier who gave a somewhat exaggerated account of his role in one battle. Big deal. Ordinarily, it would be shrugged off with a wink and an amused grin. But the man is brown and so all the white skunks have leapt on him.
Your pathetic false equivalence is breathtaking.  Whatever President Trump's faults are they do not include murdering close relatives with VX nerve gas or anti-aircraft guns, running a totalitarian, racist, fascist state with no free elections, completely controlling all speech, press and assembly, drafting all men and women, running slave labor camps, gratuitously murdering three generations of a person he does not like's family, engaging in: counterfeiting, kidnapping, human trafficking, illegal drug and weapons trade, money laundering, insurance fraud, and terrorism.  You belong in Pyongyang.  It would serve you right.
Another day... another Trump embarassment.  This man is just a terrible person at every turn.
What's a first principle argument, sexual preference or human reproduction?   Look, philosophically I could argue that all men should be screwing chickens for the betterment of society, but it doesn't change the fact that we are anatomically constructed to use our bodies with physiological purpose, not perversion.
.  Donald Trump called for the death penalty for Julian Assange in 2010.   http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/04/politics/kfile-trump-wikileaks/   Now he's citing him to back up his ridiculous claim the Russia didn't try to interfere with the US election on his behalf.  Just more Trump BS.   He's Putin's slipper boy.   .
Says the man who voted for and continues to support a pathological liar.  That isn't even irony.  Irony is more subtle. This is stupidity.
The arrogance of this man child..... Justin had the same look he had right before his elbowing rampage....that of an angry self serving child. You do not need to pick apart his policy to see what an arrogant person he is, just look at his body language.
Another Horrible G&M article based on Toronto, Sexism, Feminism and the evil white male . If you added some anti-trump rhetoric you would of had a Globe and Mail daily all in one article.
The man is a bag of dirt.  An absolute scumbag.
Great, now that the ACA will get thrown out our Alaskan legislature can bring back to us those low cost plans with low deductables.  Parnell and the rest of the clowns ensured the ACA never had a chance in Alaska.  But now they have got their man in office I'm sure they can show us how we can get the same coverage as they currently get.  There has not been any serious efforts on getting Alaskans affordable coverage-perhaps one of the legislatures can point out how they have been working to improve this for fellow Alaskans.  This and the depressed oil industry are Alaska's biggest problems but they ignore the health issue.
A typical demented leftist. Good grief. Donald Trump, a businessman from New York City, who has employed thousands - whites, blacks, Hispanics - will win the election because millions of Americans are fed up with people like Ann, an arrogant leftist kook - most likely on PERS - trying to link Trump with Adolph Hitler. What is wrong with you?
So, this article is about a guy who converts to a religion within minutes of being exposed to it. He never read the books, he never went to a mosque, he never spoke to an Imam. This man is not an example of good decision making. This was the best example of a white guy converting to Islam they could find?
If we have 3 corners that can play man/man, then why do we continue to play that stupid zone,huh?
Ms McKenna, perhaps you should apologize for blurting out "that's just stupid" to Erin O'Toole on CTV's Question Period wrt his comments on NAFTA negotiations. I was shocked you would treat a man that way, and it became abundantly clear why your most substantive legal experience was offering pro-bono services.
It is amazing how often populist "businessmen" like Ford feel that only they can run government. Examples like Trump and Ford's brother as well as the Ottawa disaster of Larry O'Brien prove over and over again how incompetent and destructive these pompous characters really are. However, in this regard, Doug Ford seems especially obtuse - a man whose ego blinds him to how little he actually knows,
Nope - if you had actually paid attention I wouldn't be asked this... And I know MANY women that have NO issue with the way things are today, they work hard, achieve their goals and are happy... Hard work DOES pay off... NOT everything is equal yet, may never be - remember HILLARY paid her female staffers less than the men.. NO i am not going to find the link for that... Hillary is blaming everyone BUT HER OWN STUPIDITY for Trump winning..   Trump is the president, we can argue for the next four years makes no difference. Obama proved to be a failure, it's Trumps turn to show what he is really made of..
It makes zero sense that you commit treason of our lands for a foreign government. It makes zero sense to pillage BC of various rainforest with trees over 1,000 years old because a stupid man wants to sell CDO's and BBB's on the stock market.
I was a R voter for over 30 years. No more. You lost me in March and I cannot believe people would pin their hopes on a racist, child molesting con man. I willnever vote for such man. There are good third party candidates if you can't stomach either candidate. But I will never vote R again over this betrayal of values.
Fake News! The GM does not mention that it is mostly men who are overdosing not women. If it was women they would  put it in a huge head line. Men are overdosing become of the  culture of shaming.  :  https://youtu.be/5q2tZa1gp8Q
Ken, it was inevitable that you would re-post your already rejected post of your tired, hoary old homophobic chestnut.   We all know that "[T]he [John Jay] researchers found no statistical evidence that gay priests were more likely than straight priests to abuse minors—a finding that undermines a favorite talking point of many conservative Catholics. The disproportionate number of adolescent male victims was about opportunity, not preference or pathology, the report states." https://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/john-jay-report-not-blaming-homosexual-priests
Jeremy Joseph Christian  is a sick and mentally deranged man. Both a Democrat and Republican were senselessly murdered by a raving, criminal mad man.  I think the victims and bystanders can symbolize us; the public. And the raving lunatic murderer represents our current broken national politics. All leaders, of every political persuasion, need to get their S*%t together and back to the business of governance!
Wait, I thought only white males were serial killers?  Finally, more equality in the mass murder department?
Oh please, stop pretending this is about states rights states have no jurisdiction over federal land,  you Trumpettes sure love to bang that drum, What this is about is hunters who are cowards and afraid to actually hunt an animal, instead you kill them while they sleep and from helicopters.   Coward, that is what I will call anyone who does this, get a bow and go kill a bear, then ill call you a real hunter, not a real man mind you because real men don't need to prove their masculinity by killing defenseless animals, and cubs ffs, and no real sportsman would hunt like a craven little wimp from a helicopter.  15 guys armed with guns and 15-30 dogs is not hunting either.
We will NEVER get used to Nazis, White Supremacists, and their supporters like you. Or, are you man enough to denounce them? Otherwise, you don't deserve to be part of humanity.
Holy frijole trumps people are just blatantly lying now. Fake news heaped on more fake news. From a Corey Lewandowski interview:  "And then, Donald Trump won the election campaign by the largest majority since Ronald Reagan in 1984."  Huh. The largest majority since 1984? Really? Let's take a look:    There have been eight presidential elections since 1984. In popular vote margin, Trump is 8th out of 8. In the Electoral College vote, he's 6th out of 8. This obviously wasn't just a careless mistake on Lewandowski's part."   when the man or his people aren't insulting every demographic in America other than white men they are spewing gross lies to assuage the massive ego of the trumpster. This can't really be happening to my beautiful country can it? Have we devolved into a nation incapable of separating the wheat from the chaff? Are we really so poisoned by diets of fast food and junk information that we no longer have a moral core to act from? Trump is a sexual predator. He is unfit.
As a life-long Democrat who voted Republican for the first time in 2010 (Yes, I voted for Obama's first term!), let me tell you my perspective of what I've learned since Trump's election:  - Democrats are the biggest  dividers of this country, using race, sex, sexuality, religion, immigration, and political correctness as tools to lure voters.  Donald Trump's most racist, misogynist act was that he was a White male who won the Presidency following a Black President, and he beat a woman.  Democrats are sore because they believed that they could win elections based on identity (race, sex) without substance. - Establishment Republicans (now on the way out) like Flake, are no better than Democrats, legislators becoming fat and rich by taking taxpayer money, selling out the country, and throwing crumbs to their voters.  That's just a start of what I've recognized.
Trump is a “businessman”, but a lousy one. If he hadn’t been born to money, he wouldn’t have any. Sure: Trump has employed a lot of people, including a lot of women.  He probably even employed some women whom he didn’t grope; he says that some women are not attractive enough to merit a grope by “The Donald.” But for Trump, people are merely a means to an end -- disposable when they no longer advance the end for which he is using them: the personal aggrandizement of Donald J. Trump. Thousands of people lost their jobs and livelihoods in his several bankruptcies, while he stiffed the small businesses, contractors and their workers who worked for him in the naive expectation that he would pay them what he owed them; Trump never missed a meal or an hour’s sleep.  The Republicans could have nominated a decent human being with at least minimal qualifications for public office; they didn’t. They nominated instead an openly racist, defiantly fascist know-nothing boor.
The guy filming is disgusting. That said, the police officer punched the man he was trying to detain over a half dozen times. The officer then used his taser on him repeatedly. All for clenching his arm and not allowing the police to handcuff him. In my book, that's not OK. You can't use pain to motivate people to cooperate. That's what I call torture.
The Church uses "dehumanizing" language to refer not to the human beings with same-sex attraction but to the acts in which they engage.    What distinguishes two men in a lifelong friendship who love one another and two "homosexual" men?  No one ever wants to talk about that because it's "none of my business" what someone does in the bedroom;" but if you want to talk about the Church's position you have to talk about it.  No act is more obviously human than the sexual act that leads to creation; nothing is as dehumanizing as rejecting that act and participating in an imitative, purely self-gratifying act with the same sex.  Ignoring sin makes everyone more comfortable, but that doesn't make the sin go away.  Indeed, we are all called not only to help the adulteress from being stoned to death but also to let ask her to repent for her sin.
If you read more carefully and without a partisan glint you will notice that she indicts the entire culture, meaning primarily males, for forcing her to adopt feminine ways and short skirts.  There is more here than your knee jerk impression.  But I cannot have this discussion because it will be lead to and be ended by appellation of the m-word as a substitute for meaningful discussion.
I once complained to VRC corporate because Victoria Secret had a sandwich board with teenage looking, half-dressed girls with porno looks on their faces. I had my daughter with me.  This is the US, a trashy, misogynistic nation by most standards, and now the objectification of young girls is mainstream. It's an important facet of the hatred of women program the Republicans have going. Look at the Republican candidate Trump. He's on record admitting to being turned on to a twelve-year-old Paris Hilton. He's been formally accused of raping an underage girl.  Trump and the Republican party represent this trash culture well. They subscribe to a sort of Madonna/whore version of femininity where women and girls' humanity is suppressed or obliterated and most importantly, women are objects for men's pleasure and ultimate disposal. Make no mistake, the Republican party kills women.
Spicer proved time and again that he was a proficient liar too. And if he were a man worthy of admiration (he isn't) he wouldn't have taken the job working for an inveterate liar in the first place.  Birds of a feather IMHO.
What a patronizing idiotic column! As the sister of a gay man who came out of the closet in the 80s I've been defending him for the past 30-something years. I'm so tired of people never being able to differentiate my brothers other than by their sexual preference. They have names, jobs, live in different parts of the country. If you think the families of gay people haven't been walking the walk, think again. Does Denise have any gay relatives? I also have a gay nephew who I now support. But one thing I won't supporting this year is the Pride parade. I'm no fan of the cops but I don't support BLM hijacking the parade. I hope Toronto gays insist that Cuba and Jamaica are left out of Caribana. Look how they've victimized homosexuals over the years.
Trump should be impeached immediately by the Congress of the United States to demonstrate that the American Constitution, for which men and women have fought and died, can withstand a heinous moron from the world of reality television. How did this creature ever finagle his way into the presidency?  And this is happening in several countries - populism. BS!!!
His handlers obviously pulled his ears and made him call out the klan and white supremacists "and other hate groups". The man is an inept moron.
I think it was terribly selfish & cruel to bring children into the environment you & your wife were living  in,let alone take your pregnant wife to a war zone.  Under the circumstances you could not keep it in your pants. You are an unfit father & I think you wife should get the h*** as far from you and her children..This was abuse on your part also!
Don't act like a dick and you won't get fired. Seems so DIFFICULT for some men to figure out.
If the research had shown that most kids get their neuroses and their fat asses from their fat assed mothers - big yoga mangirl with the hair would have been on Mansbridge looking for jail terms for misogynists.  Instead   We get this BS. I'm telling you people keep it up. At some point men will organize and turn this crap hole country back into the stone age in retaliation. You ar enot helping even out our society by printing this crap.  Handmaids Tale for Lesbians will the first version.  Put those lesbian research groups and every other man hating freak NGO writing this crap back into the holes they came from  This thinly disguised hate writing should be investigated for what it is HATE Some men's group should sue because mangirl won't do a thing for men.
Mitch McConnell's hypocrisy and sexism is blatant.  Telling a women basically to 'Sit down and shut up!' when he subsequently allowed 4 males to read the exact same document is shameful. Shameful but - sadly - typical of the GOP.  First they stole a seat on the Supreme Court and now their misogyny shows them to be the grand old chauvinist party they've always been.  Disgusting!
That one night stand you had 25 years ago, in fact you have forgotten about? She is about to become your worst nightmare. "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned." She is going to name you, ruin your career, brake up your marriage, bankrupt you, make public enemy number one, your face will addorn newspaper front pages, sympathy seekers will suddenly recall other things "connected" to uou dastardly deed. My advice to any man going on a date, take your lawyer with. Cosby and Hewitt was found guilty after detailed evidence by an unbiased court of law in accordance with millenium old legal principles. Furguson must also take her case to court. We cannot allow conviction by public opinion. Can you remember where you were 19 September 1993? If you cannot you in deep shit.
What a shame. As a proud American liberal, I mourn the loss of principled conservatives and the ascendance of the rude carnival-barking hate-filled new Republican Party. The GOP has become the HOP (hate Other people).  My pricincipled life-long Republican father is rolling in his grave at the "leadership" antics of this pu$$y-grabbing low class clown. I fear for our republic when one party can so easily succumb to the hostile takeover over such a little man and his cheering hate-filled minions.  Is fascism the pre-ordained fate of all democratic nations? Athens, Rome and France all fell to the siren call of powerful leaders who pitted "us" against a "them".  History repeats itself. First a tragedy, then a farce.
So your point is that this time period now , this era , the construct of masculinity is sexually assaulting women ? Garbage
Considering Trump lies 60% of the time, the news must be real until proven otherwise.  The man is a serial liar and a con artist.  He preys on the weak minded.
They're going to need more money in the fund with Philpott loosening regulations regarding gay men to donate blood. Some clown will call this comment uncivil and me a homophobe but it's just simple statistics that HIV is more prominent in gay people than it is in straight people.
"Donald Trump and Kevin O’Leary are the embodiment of white entitlement – men who have never lived a life in service to others yet believe themselves entitled to power ... There is an entire generation of organizers like myself who will commit their skills every day for the rest of their lives to ensuring Canadians have leaders who serve their citizens and not their egos, and build every day for a more just society."  Thank you for encapsulating the scourge of our times, which is, all of us know that whomever doesn't agree with us is out for themselves, and "we" are absolutely sure that "we" are better than "you."  Whether Chretien, Trudeau, Harper, McGuinty, Harris ... do you really, really, believe they ALL got up every morning thinking of nothing but ripping off the Canadian public, maximize government money for themselves, and suppress minorities because of white privilege racist male hatred?  I can hear your objective viewpoint right now: "Of course not!  Only two of the above!"
I am upset that the two Women pictured, both with positive identities and relevant platforms, were overshadowed by two old white men, who neither followed  the rules of the panel, nor had positive messages to contribute to the event..  Yes the headline was direct in stating the two men were "Two Cantankerous Old White Men" but did that need to be the headline in the first place?
"On Sept. 1st, 1853 I left my farm on the Umpqua and started for Jacksonville to hold U.S. District Court there. At the Umpqua Canyon I overtook Lieut. L.F Grover with an advance company of Col. Niesmith's company.  At Grave Creek I stopped to feed my horse and get something to eat. There was a house there called Bates House after the man who kept it. There I found Cpt. J.K. Limerick in command of a company of volunteers. It seems he had been sent there by General Lane... Bates and the others had induced a small party of peaceable Indians who belonged in that vincinity to enter into an engagement... They invited them to partake of a feast in an unoccupied log house just across the road from Bates House. While the unarmed Indians were partaking of the proffered hospitality, the door was suddenly fastened and they were shot down by their treacherous white hosts. Nearby I was shown a large hole which the bodies of the murdered had been unceremoniously tumbled."  - Judge Matthew P. Deady
The lack of credibility is evident with the ridiculous claim that women in the workplace get paid less than men for the same work. This is illegal in Canada as well as the U.S.A. There are myriad logical reasons why women on average earn less than men which eludes Mr. McGinn. After this pandering to the radical feminist groups who continue to spout this nonsense he goes on to spew anecdotal garbage based upon personal experience which any first year Sociology student (used to be taught) should never be used in research as it is biased.   Personally I feel men get shafted because Fathers Day is essentially another mothers day. Men I know get suckered into things they neither want to do or be dragged places they do not want to go. Perhaps if D. McGinn phrased the article as his feelings rather than some sort of fact as I have done above he would not come off as such an uneducated milque toast.
You hide behind the law argument and not the moral argument why?  I think it's wrong of the baker to refuse the service but shouldn't be illegal.  Meanwhile the law you hide behind and cite endlessly without providing any other justification or deeper thought is a very recent man made invention.  You say Constitution...how many times is homosexuality referenced in the Constitution I wonder?  How many of the framers of the document would come down on the side of the baker and how many would come down on the side of the couple do you think?  If this groundswell of idiots that elected Trump was able to really go full blown stupid and get being gay outlawed would you then change your tune to "Oh well! It's the law and we respect the rule of law here!"?
Yet she was not an advocate for the woman (and there were alot of them) who found the courage to come forward against her husband. Quite the opposite, she made it look like Bill was the victim. She had the now infamous "sluts and nuts" campaign against them.
He'll distract them by blaming some stigmatized group and the racist whites will rally around their Savior--the guy who's f*cking them.  https://thewpsa.wordpress.com/2016/03/27/racial-resentment-and-the-rise-of-donald-trump/
Trump is the preferred candidate for "poorly educated" white people. No more and no less. Putin loves "poorly educated" white Americans too. Unfortunately, Trump voters don't care why Putin loves them. At least Putin is a white man. That is enough for Trump voters. Too bad he thinks he is a Russian first.
This guy is worse than the crazy north Korean.
We are on the cusp of a Fourth Nazi Reich. Heil Trump! Seig Heil!!  With folks like 3rd gen Ak saying white men are Earth's alpha males at will on these pages, hell yes, we're headed to Hitlerism. Won't be long before Fuhrer Trump will start talking concentration camps and gassing brown and black people. And starving them to death at his personal labor camps. Seig Heil!
Quit wetting your knickers over this man. He so predictably opposes every progressive measure that comes his way. In other words, he's dogmatic.
They basically smeared a good man so Kurt caldwelt would be your mayor. This is a complete travesty and very upsetting. But as usual no one will speak out about it bunch of donkeys.
This article is the most ridiculous piece of "jounalism" I have had the displeasure of reading.  Each criminal who was shot committed FELONY level crimes. They put the lives of the public at risk, and THEY took actions that resulted in their own deaths.  Further, the two that were shot involving K9's  were FELONS that had been previously CONVICTED of violent FELONY crimes and had been released on probation or had warrants for their arrest relating to FELONY level crimes.  Im quite certain the "jounalist" and the "professor" referenced in this article would have a different slant on the facts if these pursuits came to an end outside their door. I doubt they would encourage the Troopers to not utilize K9s or deadly force to eliminate the threat if it was facing THEIR family or it was running toward THEIR door.  These brave men deserve our gratitude for repeatedly running toward danger, and holding the line between good and evil...
As a father I spent countless hours with my son, raising him with my wife in the most loving and supportive way we could. We had different roles, but those roles were equally important. Our son turned out to be a fine young man with good morales and ethics. Contrast that to my upbringing by a neurotic single mother who wed three times to drunks and charlatans, screwed around with a few other men, and who was physically, emotionally and psychologically abusive to her children. This male bashing is enough to make me puke particularly when it's done by an insecure male. What drivel.
I feel compassion for this young man's parents.  It's a shame that a such a young age our youth do such stupid things.
Republicans are following Trump's sick racist and xenophobic lead. At the first Virginia gubernatorial debate, Ed Gillespie admitted Virginia doesn’t have “sanctuary cities. But that didn’t stop Gillespie, the Republican gubernatorial nominee from grabbing the white supremacist baton from failed Confederate candidate Corey Stewart to release one of the most racist ads in recent political memory. “Ed Gillespie clearly believes that his route to victory rests in demonizing young Latino men and the immigrant community as a whole,” said Luis Aguilar, a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient and CASA in Action member. “He may believe it is an effective campaign tactic, but the people I speak with are furious with the abject racism of Ed Gillespie’s campaign and plan to deliver that message on election day.” Resist Trump and his agenda.
This is why people call your side arrogant and condescending when you pull crap like that.    No, pointing out that counter-protestors that ALSO show up looking for a fight are bad too is NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM arguing in favor of the opposing thugs there.    It's just a weaselly straw man, and it's amazing that so many people continue to spew it.
Show me any Imam that says homosexuals, women, and Atheists are equal to Muslim men...and I'll show you an Imam with a Fatwa on him...
wow you live in a delusional world bud, there are NO OIL SUBSIDIES!  man why are you left wingers so stupid. that myth was proven false long ago as the left wing idiots who came up with it were claiming oil was just not taxed enough as they think it should thus such were subsidies when clearly that thinking is a fantasy,, LIKE YOURS
Well, to be fair, any supposed "merits" of Trump are yet to be seen, so there is a reason these people keep up with the conspiracy theories and other deflection tactics that involve people that are not Trump, like Hillary.    Next up in the rotation? Maybe the birther stuff? Ayers? Alinsky? Wright? Obama is secretly gay and/or Muslim? Or that Michelle is really a man?   There is no end of nonsense conspiracy theories that the right spends hours and hours agonizing over, all while ignoring the rot at the center of their party, as well as the intrinsic immorality of their ideology.
The US murdered 3 million poor Vietnamese men, women and children,( thousands of them by dousing them with jellified gasoline and lighting them on fire, or left to a life of terrible suffering from their burns (google "napalm girl)). They have "Black OPS " secret torture centres in a dozen countries and yet the corporate media and their Presidents refer to the US as "the world's policeman".   Russia takes back a small territory (at the request of the local ethnic Russian population) that is vital to their national security, having their only all season Naval Base , without killing a single person and the (coup plotting)  US and their western sycophants  start screaming that Russia is about to over run Europe.      What a sad, willfully blind double standard.
WOW you are amazingly ignorant. I have volunteered at First Place Family Center and worked as a teacher for the homeless preschoolers whose families receive services there. I have met the child in this picture and worked with him first hand. Families are suffering everywhere, all the time. More then often due to the recession, being laid off, going broke due to the high cost of medical bills, or from an untreated mental/ physical disability, NOT due to drug addiction, or "laziness" as many people think. The majority of these good people are hard working parents, some even with college degrees. You would NEVER even know that they are experiencing homelessness because they look like average citizens. These parents- women AND men are of all ages, diversities,backgrounds, and upbringings. I would love to know where this "number" you speak of came from. Because I can guarantee it is not factual, or accurate. Get out of the smal bubble you live in and take a look at how the real world works.
There is no Pride anymore, only Shame. She is a hate filled racist and homophobe. She hates the gay white men who created Pride in the first place and is determine to steal it for her own political ends. If the thousands of gay men of Toronto stop supporting Pride she will hate them even more. All she will do is destroy Pride  which she will blame on anybody but herself and BLM.
You have LOST YOUR MINDS if you are advocating more import and defend a man that beat the crap out of a woman. You sick people.
I'm not sure what your point is. That he doesn't want to subject her to seeing a male penis? If that's the point you're trying to make, him taking her into the men's room and a transgendered person using the women's restroom are two totally different scenarios. A male who identifies as female isn't going to have his penis on display in the female bathroom, because the stalls are all behind closed doors, so only a pervert who's peeking under or over stalls is going to know that the female in the next stall was actually born a male. If it's not, an unintended consequence of the ordinance would be that it would be difficult for him to take her out alone because it will prohibit her from entering the men's room because she doesn't identify as male.
...(cont'd from above)...   John O’Donnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump’s criticism of a black accountant in his 1989 book: "Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day…I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.”   Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama — the country’s first black president — was not born in the US. He even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama's birth certificate.  Trump has repeatedly referred to Mexican immigrants as “criminals” and “rapists”, plans to build a border wall & force Mexico to pay for it, repeatedly referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas” due to her Cherokee ancestry, called for a complete ban on all Muslims entering the US  (cont'd below)....
What should be gleaned from this is- if you are an obnoxious aggressive snowflake pretend journalist and stick a microphone in a real mans face and act aggressively- you will get your sissy ass pummeled for mot being polite and civil
The comment "He supports sexism and the belief that women are inferior to men. (The magisterium used to be honest enough to admit that was the reason for not ordaining women." is unmitigated rubbish.  Your attributions of reasons why the Church teaches as its does, like your "translations" of other people's comments, are simply long ways of stating you have an opinion gussied up as "facts".
Your use of the word "female" rather than "woman", especially contrasted with your use of "man" rather than "male", tells us all we need to know about you. Women are not people to you, and you blame everything wrong with yourself and your life on women, distancing yourself from any psychological connection to women by using clinical terms. You are a troll.
Regarding fake news, you said: "A sense exists across the spectrum of political inclinations that the recent presidential campaign was, above all, an unremitting and damaging assault on valued traditions and decorum. Perhaps no departure from the norm was so dangerous as the ugly attacks on standard journalism and the concomitant and utter disregard for facts that, sadly, won the day." Please, this fake news began with Ronald Reagan and his buddy Pope John Paul II. Today's GOP and Religious Right lies and endless viciousness and endless fake news (outright lying) really began with Teflon man Reagan. Their desire to get Reagan elected was borne of lies, racism, inuenndo, etc,etc. Let us recall the character assassination and innuendo of SE. Joe McCarthy ( R-Wis, Catholic, alcoholic) and the anti-communism witch trials.
It's about time men's personal conduct came back to bite them in their professional lives. Too many of these scumbags are out there.  You'd have to be crazy to hire a person that scared someone that badly.
Reed, oh goodness, I will disinter your righteous remains for a moment. I regret that those men did not ask themselves: 1) Is this really my battle? 2) if this is, or I make this, my battle, Do i have a Plan, Do I have the Training, Do I have the Weapon??? 3) is my enemy concealing his capacity? These questions can be answered very quickly.  Lastly, thanks ever so for your touching concern over my health. My health is blessedly sound  and guarded by privately purchased private health insurance. No one named Reed is involved with its purchase or maintenance. Also, I dislike Trump,  his prussian pretense,  and racist supremacy as much as I dislike your sanctimonious insolence.
Many Muslims claim their religion does not advocate violence and praises diversity! Isn't it about time that we saw a large group of Muslims start a "reformed" Muslim religion that eliminates the passages of the Quoran that relate to violence against the "infidels" and advocates the equality of men and women.A religion that enshrines 13th century dogma that is questionable today, is not suitable for the 21st century!
The point is: Imago Dei has doctrines that are repugnant to me and other Portlanders.  We hear the all-male "Elders" arguing for 1. female submission 2. unmarried households are living in sin 3. gay sex is sin.  This is not a flawed doctrine- it is a homophobic misogynist doctrine that your evangelical church wants to spread.  You are no different from a Santorum supporter except that the Santorum supporter is more honest and will not deny their church's doctrine.
"Winning an argument with a smart man is tough, winning an argument with a stupid man is impossible." Coherent?
he's an ISIS terrorists! He fought for ISIS a caliphate. Now, who's the group the Nevada guy fought for but of himself? Do you know his affiliation with any terrorist group than theDonald could go after? The Nevada guy terrorist group died with him, lol. Oh wait! It's the WHITE man! But the Black mass of murders in Chicago is 10 times the amount the White man killed! Where's your distaste of the Black Man killings going on in Chicago?
Typical female chauvinist response.  Women have to take responsibility for their actions too.  Yes, Weinstein was obviously a lech, but everyone apparently knew that, so why did these women continually put themselves into situations where something could happen?  Why did & do they continue to dress 1/2 or 3/4 naked all the time? Women spend a crazy amount of time and money trying to attract male attention, then cry foul when it's the wrong male who is attracted.   Not saying that some men don't need to learn to control themselves, but the time has come to accept that many times, women are the authors of their own misfortune.  Until we address women's responsibility this problem will never go away.  Sadly it seems that the more men are lectured on avoiding anything sexual with a women and resist their natural instincts, the more women dress and act like whores.  No woman needs to wear an almost see-thru dress with no bra, no underwear and thick war paint, not to mention their actions
Gaslight AND troll, now lulz.  Man, you've got it all covered.
Huh, I must have missed your earlier comment that this article about "white males" is racist and sexist.
If we want to stop the sexual abuse, we must not allow gay men into the seminaries. 87% of the offenders are homosexuals, therefore allowing priests to marry would not eliminate the threat. These same offenses  are committed by Protestant ministers and teachers, all of whom can marry.
You hucksters are used to having a President you can push around, put words in his mouth and you've met your match in President Trump.  He has exposed you all as con men, liars and fake reporters.  Go Trump!
scary, hairy, pot-bellied men!
Children are being abused by priests right now.  These children see how these priests are revered by their parents and the community. These children have been taught that a priest is Gods representative on earth and they have special powers because priests are ordained.  The spiritual power of the priests creates issues and fears that prevent children from coming forward,  for many it takes a long time. I doubt that you are capable of understanding this. I am making this comment for others to read. Please do not respond to me as I am going to mute you after I post this comment.  I am muting you because... It gives me great pleasure. I do not have to read your skewed views followed by your accusations to people that disagree with you as" hate poisoning their mind" Your Catholicism seems to be based on the man made institution and seems to disregard the teachings of Christ. Muting you was a perfect end to this day.  Tomorrow I may un-mute you for 6 seconds, just so I can mute you again!
Amy - Then it's probably best that you NEVER have a gun because if someone is coming at you with nothing, they'll be dead and you'll be in jail for employing unrational stupidity!   Like the men at the holiday station on Abbott.
Dan singer, the man being sued is my cousin. Believe me when I say he is a horrible human being in so many different ways (he is racist, homophobic, abusive to his wife and children and apparently animals as well). I sincerely hope this girl wins her lawsuit! He was negligent. What kind of scum leaves their dogs in a hot car?!
There are too many low white racists in Canada. This is a brave soldier who gave a somewhat exaggerated account of his role in one battle. Big deal. Ordinarily, it would be shrugged off with a wink and a tolerant grin. But the man is brown and so all the white skunks have leapt on him.
Trump is so deranged and crazy he'll soon start a bounty on Mexican scalps. How much would it take for you trigger happy AR15 owners to partake? $20 bucks per? $50 per? $100 bucks? Thousands here would be on a waiting list for that to happen. But like I've said before and I'll say it again: White folks, he's your man. You own it.
"If the guy is as drunk as the woman and they have consensual sex at the party, you can't later blame him. He was drunk too and not responsible for his behavior, like her. Right?" Wrong. Oh Yes, you can blame him! He is "Mr Man"..."Dirty Bird"...a sexual predator. She, on the other hand was just looking for some harmless(?) "fun"....and is a poor Victim of his Lust!
I'd love to see equality in Canada--not for women, but for men.  A white male in this country has been reduced to crap you find on the bottom of your shoe.   In the USA, you hear nothing but talk about creating jobs, not for women, not for minorities, but for AMERICANS.     Maybe one day, everyone in Canada will be equal, but not before this joke of a Prime Minister has been tossed out along with his white, male bigotry.
The separation of recreational sex from procreation may save humanity from a crisis of overpopulation. And if men enjoy masturbating to porn more than actual sex, so much the better when it comes to sexually transmitted diseases.
TomZ calls a sexist sleazebag "a traditional image of masculinity, patriotism, and eye for attractive women." Aww, Tom, don't you wish you could just grab 'em by the p*ssy?
' Incoming National Security Adviser and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn got caught again deleting a tweet that he made up about Hillary Clinton, money laundering and sex crimes involving children.  The man's a sick and demented menace. .
You might have a point there, what we do know is the Pope is OK with grown men in his religion touching little boys and with his visit with Trump, it appears he's also OK with grown men sexually assaulting women, regardless of age...#MAGA
Your perception of what I care about is greatly skewed.  Rest assured you are not among that which I care about.  More hubris.  But OK.  In fact you and I have arrived at that inevitable juncture in our conversation in which I must remember sage advice of al-Imam 'Ali ibn Abu-Talib (alayhimus-Salaam):  "When I debate a reasonable man, I win.  When I debate a fool, I lose."  I hereby concede I have lost this debate.  Enjoy your "victory" such as it is.  That's all your getting from me because it's all you deserve.  Come correct next time if you wanna try again.  "
Really? So the video I watched of a weaponless young man walking along the White Supremacist/Nazi/KKK mob asking them to stop and leave who was viciously attacked by four members of the mob while a fifth mob member aimed a gun at him was made up? Of course it was. Just because a mob - excuse me, hate "group" well known for acts of violence, including murder - comes to exercise their right to free speech armed to the teeth with guns, metal staffs and other evidence of peaceful intent, why would anyone there to protest the hate group come prepared to defend themselves? Silly me.
Right. Having an "exorcism" because the state allowed CIVIL same-sex marriage is not homophobic. Nor is cancelling the contract that Catholic Social Services of Springfield had with the State of Illinois because the state said they couldn't automatically reject gay couples as adoptive parents. Nor is excommunicating gays. He did not say explicitly that gays should be "hated, feared, shunned, and rejected". However, it should be blindingly obvious, even to you (but only if you had even a scintilla of honesty in your makeup), that is his message.  No, Paprocki is a thorough-going homophobe, and you support him in his homophobia, just as you supported Burke in his homophobia.  Yes, I have little love for Paprocki, because I oppose bigotry, and the man is a bigot. And my love for you is scant, also because you support bigotry (as well as your general dishonesty and knee-jerk support for conservatives who should not be supported).
I've also heard of the Church's position on masturbation.  However, I have never seen the Church financially and politically involved in stopping divorce, pre marital sex, masturbation or illicit sexual acts between heterosexual couples.  I have seen the church get politically active against abortion and birth control which effect women, and gay marriage.  Not much concern there for those poor adulterous heterosexual males.
it sure is our job to judge. we do it all the time. i will not tolerate perversions being forced in my face, or my grandchildren's. i will fight back. enough is enough. men: stay out of the ladies' room. we know that most of you angle for females. you are wicked.
Just how do you see what girl is on her cycle?  I have been trying for years, but my wife's sneaks up on me every time until I hear about it loud and clear.         Sure it is stupid and backwards that girls prey at the back, it is stupid only men can become priests, it is stupid some Evangelicals call for the death of homosexuals.....   It is not stupid however to try and understand and get along.  Kind of irony here Chuck but I am assuming you are defending liberal Muslims :)  ...If they are shunned by their conservative Muslim's then we have their backs don't we?
This man is the worst type of person. He is the origin of the word monster. His wife Mrs.monster drugged those girls so her husband could rape them.  How is she free. Well at least we know her name.  I hope she has enough common sense to leave the state.
You seem like you are obsessed with hurting people Pete.  Sorry little man, it must be a sad life.
Woman have had dildos, what's the difference? Men don't care about that.  It seems woman are getting paranoid that men may not need them anymore? Hmmmmm.
Disgusting predatory pig! I truly hope that this is the beginning of more equality in this industry for women and for any men that too have been abused.  He has been behaving as disgusting as the POTUS. All the very best to my southern neighbours. I feel for you and I wish this President would stop attacking his own people and start to behave with even a little bit of modesty and compassion. Best wishes to you all. The women that reported on TWC need to be given all the support and encouragement for their bravery. I'm with you!
Big man, Pig man...ha ha charade you are...
What!?  Hodad I am so triggered by your comment.  Everyone knows that Europe is full of WHITE MALES.  I have to go to my safe space right now and call the feminist crisis hotline.
You say:  "But for all the men who are in the trenches every day subtly or overtly supporting women’s equality, I’d like to say, for the record, that Alamo Drafthouse is wrong to exclude supportive husbands, brothers, fathers, sons, friends and colleagues from this women’s empowerment event."  I'm pretty sure that the "supportive" guys who "are in the trenches... supporting women's equality" are more than fine with having a ladies-only showing of a movie. It's the idiot guys who like to play the victim and kick up a fuss where no fuss is called for who are ruining this for everyone.
Then why did the Declarations of Secession of Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas all declare that the white race was superior to the black race and the black race being enslaved was the only way they could exist in America?  "Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. " - Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, March 21, 1861   I realize you're a Trump supporter so you probably don't appreciate things like "facts," but you could stand to crack a book sometime before you go online and make an ass out of yourself with your ignorance.
Pan, there were very few innocent priests in my experience and I had a very close friend of mine accused of sexual abuse, then down graded to 'verbal sexual abuse'. It didn't matter because the bishop at the time crucified my friend for his own bishop's resume. He was forbidden to exercise his public authority as a priest and then booted from the college he had taught at for 25 years for admitting he was gay.   That ended my official participation in my cathedral parish. I was actually a witness when the 'verbal abuse' took place. What actually happened is we saved a young man from committing suicide.  In my mind it doesn't get more unfair than that.  Although I volunteered to testify, I wasn't allowed to testify.  However, my friend knew of a number of abused children involving other priests he did not bring to anyone's attention...because priest.  When he told me that during his own tribulations, I said to him 'paybacks are a beotch'. There are very few truly innocent priests.
Gannon was the male prostitute in the WhiteHouse during the Bush administration .......
Pigs at the publicc trough. Anyone who believed that millionaire elitest Trump - of all people - was going to "drain the swamp" (whatever that means) by putting elitest, self-serving men and women who've spent their lives ripping off America is just plain stupid with a capital "S."
Should women be prohibited  from having sex if they have a blood alcohol level of  perhaps .08.? She poses a danger to any man who has sex with her, and he needs to be warned she is off limits. Is there an app to tell drunk women to go home? Certainly no man who refuses to have sex with a drunk woman is considered a hero, not even by the same feminists who  call him a rapist if he does.
Obama's actions this week, as he slinks out the door, exposes the hidden  angry black man that he kept from view. His hatred for Netanyahu and Putin is only exceeded by his hatred for Trump.
My donors? Pants on fire sparky! How about the $41 million for viagra for service men? Staunch, overweight, alt right conservatives stuck in reverse love it. Does that make you feel better to know that our tax dollars are buying erectile dysfunction drugs for pleasure? CBP provides a service you don't use, so big deal. Your idols, lord limburger and the deplorable rethuglican hate mongers, will never succeed in eliminating CPB. Never.
Interesting comment. Years ago I listened to a speech by a man who stopped being gay. He wanted to be hetero. Some of his advice and suggestions about his life change came from Focus on the Family. It was his decision in the end. What got my attention most is he said he had good, honest, genuine, gay friends while he was gay. After he told those friends he was no longer gay, many of those gay friends shunned him and he was disappointed. He didn't think the sexual orientation would be the only reason he had those friends. So what conclusion should I have came to when his speech was over? Gays only care about themselves and have no viable compassion/interest for any other category of person? If you think Focus is bad for what you think they are doing, can I think gays are bad too since they are only looking out for themselves and don't care what happens to anybody else - purely based on this man's experiences? I really don't want to.
Here is an idea.  Don't want a baby?  Don't get pregnant.  It is completely within the power of the female human to make that initial choice, and once said choice is made, either for or against conception, they own said choice.  We men are pigs, to be sure, though not as many as one may think, but it is the female that ultimately decides whether she shall be impregnated or not.  Women are indeed within control of not only their bodies, but their biological ability to give birth, and if they do not want to become a mother, than they should take whatever steps they need to so as to prevent said action.  THAT is the female power.  THEY decide whether they shall bear a child or not.  Abortion is for those that do not own their personal decisions, or are simply too obtuse, or lazy, to own said decisions.  And do not even get me started about Planned Parenthood and its eugenics based beginning.
HRC made another stupid assumption.  Apparently, women who are not married to men are immune from all male  mind control.  So I guess that means Bill is controlling her.  LOL!!
You can't know how much I appreciate your comment, thanks.  After my mother accepted that I as a gay man--indeed human--and her loving son, she cringed and even shook every time DP spewed more of his radical Christian hate rhetoric. He is a radical, no doubt. Sooner or later her will go after divorced folks, blacks and on and on. His is ayatollah behavior. Be safe you and your brother.
Walter, you are wrong. Lynching is part of American history and lynching was entertainment for white folks. Can you handle the truth? If not, please don't kill your loved ones in a murder suicide when you realize white folks, as a group, are not innocent. You all benefit from white privilege. If you don't know how to benefit from that privilege it is not the fault of black folks. Do you know that you benefit from such violence? They did lynching for white folks like you. Today, cops can get away with murdering black children. I guess that is a demotion for white folks. In the good old days, any white man could get away with murdering black folks with out needing a badge. That includes murdering black folks praying in church. It is clear that some white folks miss those privileges.
Absolutely, Trump is not insane, stupid or an idiot. Just because the politically correct , marshmallow, leftist liberal elitists, media and celebrities go on an on because their little egos are bruised by an embarrassing loss, does not mean that this man is a loose cannon. Look at how grounded and level headed his kids are and how much they admire him. Give the guy a chance to swing the pendulum away from the extreme left and judge him over time. If he screws up, boot him out in 4 years. The country is too big to let one man ruin it.
I'm not. Ive paid up for a 2 week holiday in Maui for me, my wife and 2 kids....and I dont plan to delay or cancel any other US trips either as I have friends in Bellingham, Seattle, DC and NYC. The USA is a lot more than just the presidency. Meanwhile the question is, is it ok for the US to ban Muslims temporarily because millions of them - while not Jihadists (although thousands are) - are Islamists and/or support Islamist goals of establishing Sharia Law everywhere...including throwing gays off building tops, establishing that a woman's testimony in court is worth only 1/2 a man's, codifying blasphemy as a criminal act....need I continue?
The reason? Because the majority of legal voters saw that this woman was just as corrupt as any man out there, maybe even more than Bill.  And with The Oversite Committee launching a formal investigation into the lies Hilliary told the American people; Benghazi, her secret depleted uranium deal with the Kremlin, Saudi pay for play, ... we have seen Hillary stick to the Left-wing play book, accuse others of what she is most guilty of herself.
I have four daughters, all of which played volleyball and wore the uniform.  I've known the man who is having his character assassinated in these comments for 30 years.  Most of you are entirely ridiculous in your assumptions.  I forgive you for your ignorance...  however that is what is on display here.  Complete and total ignorance in a public comment thread on a newspapers website.  I don't normally comment on such an article, maybe some of  you should take a cue from that example and shut your ignorant mouths, you know nothing!
So, lets analyze this a bit. In the top statement, you are observing, and we assume complaining that anyone being told "go back to (where ever)"  is BAD, when it is coming from an old white man.  But here in this statement, you have a method to justify when it is now appropriate to tell someone they should go back to the mainland. Again, it only appears to apply to "white men"  So, it is bad when said by one group, but it is perfectly fine when said by another group. There is a word for that : Hypocrite.  And considering that you failed to address when Micronesians are told "go back to your country" by Hawaiians, then that must be ok too ?
I've never heard anyone put it quite that way before. Now I can feel so grateful that so many people are so much more concerned about the gay soul of little ole me while ignoring the legions of poor straight men whose souls will be utterly forgotten, and all because I'm just so special. Who knew? Thanks for making my day!
This orange man is a bigly national security risk.
White guy kills, tougher gun laws not the answer.  Muslim guy kills, tougher immigration laws are the answer.  And the right wing wonders why they are labeled racist?
My beliefs are based on empiracle evidence. That's not "silly" - that's logical. And you saying my beliefs (assuming you mean being atheist) are silly means yours are too, since you disbelieve just as I do in the hundreds of man made gods. I just believe in one less than you.   People who are Hindu have experienced too. Does that make their belief in holy cows not silly? No. It's silly. Just like your experiences don't make zombie Jesus belief any less silly.
A gun recovered at the scene of the fatal shooting of a black man by police in Charlotte, North Carolina, was loaded and fingerprints, DNA and blood from the weapon matched those of the victim, CNN reported on Friday
Repulsive ideas? you mean like sticking a needle in your arm or snorting a white powder up your nose or having 40 year old men who want to dress up like 12 year girls.
MEN OF CALGARY: GO GAY! It is the only thing that will save your skin. But in today's heated feminist empire, being gay may not be a defence from an accusation of sexual impropriety.
You have to be utterly blind to have missed out on his previous attacks on women. You think it's okay for a man to walk up to a strange woman and grab her by the genitals? Or to fire a woman  because he doesn't find her sexually attractive?
I see the globe printed a piece on the refugee matter. They just did not show a commen section. WHY?  They don't give a damm about Canadians feel.     So to you globe and pothead. Send these cowards back and don't allow anymore in. They have not the guts to fight for thier own freedom, yet they expect us to look after them  and send our men and women to die. They are cowards and when we stop giving them welfare will be killing Canadians from our Gov. stupidity.     We need Donald Trump.
NEVER EVER HIRE A NEGROE FOR EMEGENCY CALLS,,,THEY THE NEGROES ARE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO MAN PHONES EVEN THO A MONKIE CAN DO IT,,,NEGROES ARE NOTHING MORE THAN FARM IMPLEMENTS IE COTTON PICKERS
As a white male who's Great Grandfather fought in the 2nd World War, against the Germans, how do i reconcile this statement?  "We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is racial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by whites, we can mold them to the program of the Communist Party. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the Negro minority against the whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the Negro will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause."  -1912 Israel Cohen  And there are plenty more from prominent rabbi's.  How many young white men have died for lie after lie? 9/11? Muslim terrorists in a cave ?
Bill Cosby, Bill O'Reilly, Bill Clinton.  According to a study I performed on 3 anecdotal cases of high profile sexual assault, men named Bill are 100% more likely to be sexual predators.
This will be fascinating to watch. The Liberals seem to be in awe of themselves these days with our 0.1% PM, finance minister and foreign minister leading the arm waving on behalf of the middle class they know so well. Dealing with the US lead negotiator Lighthizer however, a man less interested in the limelight than he is in results, will be no picnic. It would be helpful to read more about what the US is thinking rather than the plethora of strategies and demands and red lines the Liberals keep declaring. Canada will surely need to hand Trump a few victories to bolster his fragile ego and allow him the placate his rust belt base who, like everyone else, must be starting to wonder what he is smoking. If we can do that we may walk away from this with a good result. Personally, one victory I would like to see the US win is access for their cellular companies to the Canadian market, which would help put an end to the usurious billing structure that keeps incumbents here fat and lazy.
So women and minorities can do whatever white men allow them to? SMH.
You know, I'm getting tired of getting beat up because I'm a straight, white male. Who can I file a lawsuit aganist....
No he was bright enough to outwit uneducated white males and benefit from the HATE the republicans have for anything that is democrat.
They ought to just castrate men who do such things.  They'll never do it again!  Why jail them?  Then we have to pay for their housing.
I've had a very successful life with out one minute of white privilege to help me. You on the other hand don't know what you have earned and what you were given for just showing up white and male. You don't seem to know much about American  history. Your ignorance about your own history is another white privilege. You get to pretend to be only an individual, as if you don't live in a  society shaped by history.
The law does not violate any person's beleifs. The baker was not forced to sign the business license application which states that he must abide by state laws rules and regulations. He chose to do so and then break state law.  The court said the baker “does not convey a message supporting same-sex marriages merely by abiding by the law.”  Making a vpcake for a gay wedding does not make the baker more of a sinner, ask Jesus.  A gay baker must make a cake for a heterosexual male if he offers that service to the public as a business.  Yes, it works both ways.  Why not go order a gay wedding cake from Muslim bakery? They have to make it too.
The penis (alleged) touching allegedly happened almost 50 years ago, only to "go public" just before an election of the man allegedly charged with such action. Interesting timing.
i acknowledge the fact that this stereotype has been around for centuries, and persists today. no argument there. i was merely suggesting that there are many very influential (unfortunately) people in the black community who are themselves fueling the fire- taking the stereotype that white devils created, and not only living up to the stereotype, but are promoting it.  "man, this is how it is on the streets; this is all i know, so this is what i talk about in my 'music'." well, ya selfish asshole, how about taking some of the money you make- the profits made, by the way, through your choice to destroy your own people's culture via the message you're sending- and put it to good use. gee, i don't know, maybe try a positive message..?unfortunately "stay in school" and "do something positive with your life" go against the gangsta grain.  you can point the finger all you want to. maybe you'll gain some ground with that tactic. but when a large part of the problem is within, that's on you.
This is beyond stupid. This is disgusting. Where are the American People? Are they all standing up and cheering at the fact that their hero is literally dismanteling this democracy? They want to stick it to their imagined enemies (liberals, what do they even mean by that) so bad that they do not see that they themselves are being, um, done. Played. Is it possible that they are that stupid? From reading many of the comments on these articles, I conclude that the fat, white, male demographic love their Furher. "Hurt me next, Herr Donald, I love you." It is beyond belief. America houses the most angry, uncivil, resentful, moronic population on Earth. And I am talking to you, 50+ White Men. You should be ashamed. They will come for you next, and you will cheer to the very end.
As puns are to humor, criticism is to thought. There is no equivilence between 'little d' and Hillary Clinton. She has a resume intelligence and experience, and is the most investigated female in the world. He is an idiot. So where do you stand? Oh I know, you are angry, someone took away your ball, throwing it at the wall might be the reason. You see jobs going elsewhere, gays get to marry, there's a African Amercian President...so the world is going to hell in a handbasket and you're angry. You listen to am radio, rant Fidos, gets your blood boiling, and your dander up. So who's your guy? Not Ted, or Jeb, or Marco, or John...it's "the Donald." Of course he's your guy, he's a guy. Of course you support him 'cause he's angry too...why? Good question. I'd be angry if I were him too.
The article fails to mention that there is a massive dose of present-day political indoctrination contained in the recommended replacements for the classical literary works in question.  The novel titled "Indian Horse" centres on a Canadian First Nations boy who survives the Indian residential school system without getting murdered there by the white man who ruined everything for native folks.  The book titled "Stone Thrower" centres on a black man spending time in 1970s Canada and the USA trying to succeed in a career but who is kept down by the white man, and his black daughter growing up in 1990s Ontario and the racism she faces in the high school cafeteria and reflections thereof, comparing racism in modern America to racism in modern Canada, the white man ruining things for visible minorities.    Visible minorities good. White man bad. The social justice warriors must be ecstatic with these choices. Next up in literature class: Pin the tail on the racist white man.
How about if we make it illegal for a man not to have a vasectomy,  masturbate or have nocturnal emissions? Think of the billions of potential lives men are killing!
What is it about the Christian priesthood or religion that turns men into such evil beasts? Keep your children away from them. The problem is likely much worse in developing countries where sex is a taboo topic and these sickos are molesting children there also.
Knock off your cherry picking, oldvalleyguy.  Many of the black men and teenagers that were gunned down by white police officers were unarmed and not resisting arrest.  Almost all of the cases had bystanders or witnesses video taping the murders.  Videos don't lie, over adrenaline police officers lie and manage to beat their murder wrap.  I can easily understand why protesters take to the streets rallying for justice.  And by the way, the liberals aren't the ones passing open carry or concealed gun laws.  You can't have it both ways hypocrite.  You must've left your morals in the military locker room.
"Only the light of Christ can quench the torches of hatred and violence. Let us pray for peace," said Bishop DiLorenzo in his statement. "I pray that those men and women on both sides can talk and seek solutions to their differences respectfully."  DiLorenzo goes the Trump route and blames everyone.  What a profile in cowardice!
a) You don't get the metaphor/analogy; b) if you did you just confirmed the idiocy of a male only clergy.
Trudeau is a puppet. he is the front man. he is "retail" politics. He's not making any decisions. They are being made behind the scenes by Butts, Telford and the Laurentian elite cabal.
I would also add that dating during this time hasn't been a fun experience. Most of the women on the dating sites are unrealistically choosy. They won't date shorter men (I'm 5'7" and even though I'm fit, love culture, own my house and have a great job, it doesn't seem to matter) My personal observations indicate if you're short, women want nothing to do with you regardless of other qualities. They seem to idealize tall, rugged dudes who drive bikes or trucks and are manly men ( in Alberta anyway) So find it hard to sympathize with "why can't women find good men" when my personal experience shows women chasing after the shitty men and ignoring the good men.
Anyone who likes this, or think it is funny, needs go back to the bar where they drown their sorrows of being a loser.  I am a male.  30 years marriage and three kids (2 of 3 who have graduated university and have good jobs.  One year to go for #3).  Life has trade-offs. Accept them or be a loser.  Sorry for the loser posters who can't accept life.
So Top Level... just what do you think the odds are that three men, all about the same age, same background, same religion and same belief system are all mentally ill to the degree that they run a van into people and then go on a stabbing spree? NOT VERY LIKELY. This case had nothing to do with mental illness and everything to do with militant Islam, unrestrained immigration and botched intelligence.
As we all know, Michael's whole persona of "single straight man" is a lie, so the projection is inevitable.
why is this even being discussed? because the lying liberal media hates Trump, republicans, conservatives and caucasian males.
Your son will grow to be a man.  I hope he is proud of that and does good things in the world.  I fear he will be ashamed of what he is because of positions like yours.  My experience is that an equal number of women do selfish, stupid things.  A woman is as likely as a man to judge other women harshly.  I do not call that femininity because that would be insulting to half the population.  I prefer to treat people as individuals and judge them by their actions, rather than assign a gender stereotype to half the population.
Timothy McVeigh was one man. Should his acts have been ignored? As you say " A few hundred? A couple thousand? Hardly worth wasting time on these idiots."
"Young black men are treated like enemy combatants by police and vigilantes rather than as someone in their custodial care"  On this very site three years ago, I counseled a young man that if he were ever arrested, to be respectful and non-confrontational.  My advice was met with extreme hostility, the young man insisting that he would push back if he thought the arrest was invalid.  That's the mentality among many street-thugs, and it explains a lot of police shootings.  This is not to deny that some police actually do commit murder, so don;t misconstrue what I'm saying.  Damn; I wish I could stop using the ; key instead of the '.  Pardon me.
Chin is right.  The terrorists are already here and are citizens of all races.  Angry white men have been terrorists more than Muslims.  We need to get real for a change.
You're a cowardly, lonely little man, aren't you, whoever you are, hiding behind your fake name, "cheechako." Pathetic.
What's ridiculous to most people about it is the impression created -- that entitled white men have nothing better to worry about than being excluded from a few screenings of a Wonder Woman movie.  Seriously, do you really think this is a hill to die on?  I mean put this in perspective:  Black men in the US are protesting being routinely killed by police, indigenous men all over NA are protesting treaty rights and land claims, and entitled white men are protesting not being allowed in a few screenings of a movie.  And then they wonder why people are mocking them.
The author of this article is an idiot! He knows absolutely NOTHING about the kill box and equines, nor does he seem to know anything about the captive-bolt when used on horses! How could a reputable newspaper publish this man's unsupported claims without doing any homework of their own?!?
How do you explain the racist insults hurled by men in Edmonton against a black journalist?  Or do you simply excuse such behaviour.
The next US 'civil war' (primarily fought through the media on social networks) is going to be centered around the question of whether the US consumer should be subsiding US manufacturing jobs through higher prices of goods. You can already see it starting in the comments sections of US publications like The Atlantic. Mainstream America is serious pissed at the cranky old white men that pushed Trump over the top.
To clear this up for everyone:  What the hierarchy is demanding is that men pretend not to be gay like they used to do in the 1950's, if you want to be ordained.  It really isn't very hard to read between the lines folks.  If you aren't straight and you want to be a priest - fake it!
Ridiculous.  Of course it's sexism.  The man oozes contempt for women.  You're as bad excusing it and pretending that it doesn't exist in this case or anywhere, for that matter.  It's sexist to dismiss or ignore sexism's existence.
I am non-Muslim Canadian man and I would vastly prefer a Muslim woman in a headscarf than a proud feminist who is triggered by things.  Not that I would end up with one when there's always the option to get with another woman and thoroughly enjoy Ontario's new non gender specific parent reference
That one CEO had no legal power to suppress the wages of women in his emloye. I don't care what he did or how he ran his company, all women and men got the same wages doing the same job.  He may have been a sexist pig, but there are many women out there to match him.
Why ? Probably no self respecting successful professional business man/woman would put up with the mostly spoiled brat voters and political three ring circus ! Thus we get to elect the wanna-bes ....
keepcalm Feb 9 And yet a man who "grabs her by the *****" is elected president..  is that the best you can come up with?
I have known both Hopkins and Guttenberg since the 60's and they are both extremely honorable men - about as far from Joe Miller or the Corrupt Bastards Club as one can get - sincerely.
I AGREE 100% with your statement NOW !!! It ain't the substance, it's the intoxication and negative results. Also, some people CAN handle pot, MOST people CANNOT handle alcohol. I've always contended alcohol makes you stupid !! Makes a small guy like me think I can beat a large Polynesian up & wonder why I'm in a hospital bed the next day. Makes women sleep with guys they wouldn't give he time of day to. I guarantee you, no fights result from pot !!! And women still have their brains when stoned .....
The fears of a man, with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, is laughable
We can all be very thankful that Franklin Delano Roosevelt was president during World War II.  Of all the men who have ever been president, there has never been anyone who could see the big picture more clearly or who had a better eye for talented subordinates.  I shudder to think what it would have been like if an ignoramus like Trump had been president and had filled important positions with his political hack cronies.
Actually it's a gender-neutral practice.   Same reason that men go for nasty women.
LOL. The "game" is called "nominating a director of the FBI".  How about this for your "heroes"?  Try governing the country - what you were elected to do - and until such time ANY of the liberal speculation becomes reality then act accordingly. Until that time these clowns are no better than the party (man) they're trying to bring down.
This is what Justin has to deal with: a mad, incompetent and dangerous man. That being said, Mad Tom Mulcair is not a bad person.
Liar and mentally challenged. Dead beat who can't borrow money from USA banks so he paid for his golf courses with Russian loans.  Deadbeat. Funny how redneck party has forgotten how they hated ungodly men for election. Now they have the most ungodly man in history as their "Evangelical" leader. Rednecks.  What hypocrites.
The "seal of Confession" is/was supposed to be a protection for the penitent, not a wall of silence to shelter criminal predator priests with impunity.  Priests who weaponize the confessional as an opportunity to rape and sodomize children and vulnerable adults should not be able to use "the seal" to dodge and conceal their criminal assaults - ever.  Part of any reform and renewal of the priesthood Catholics should restrict the faculties for confessors to those men and women who have received special training in psychology and certification of their probity.   Priests have been abusing the confessional since the early centuries of the church.  The sacrament of Reconciliation is suppose to be a source of mercy and peace - not an occasion of rape for sexual perverts:  Time for reform!
75% of the NFL is black males, 6% U.S. population is black males, 21% of crime is done by black males, 51% of murders is done by black males. Maybe white fans should take a knee to protest the real problem because it isn't the country or the flag or the police that's causing the problem.
Yeah, we elected a narcissistic, lying, bigoted plutocrat as president, a man whom utilitas supports whole-heartedly.
In my view, we only have two choices. Hillary Clinton - A life long lying, thieving, race baiting, pro abortion, pro partial-birth abortion, gun grabbing political hack. Who sold her political influence, to the highest million $ bidders. And blatantly  abandoned our men, and left them to die in Benghazi.   Or Donald Trump - A non politician who is sometimes a bit rude and crude and offensive. That has built businesses, and employed 10's of thousand of employees. Who wants to bring back & rebuild American jobs and our economy. Who wants to keep our nation safe, by vetting the thousands of "refugees" coming into our country. Who is determined to destroy ISIS and Islamic terror, before it comes to America. We don’t need a “nice guy” or a “gentleman” politician right now.  We need a ground shaking, ball busting, General George S. Patton type. Who has no political agenda. except for digging America out of her grave. We NEED a President named Donald J. Trump!    Take care, be safe God Bless
Side note: Regarding the comment about Trump "allowing" his daughter marry a Jew. I'm not sure what century this person is living in? Does a man need to give permission to his grown daughter to marry whoever the hell she wants?  I suggest the author of this editorial put that bit in quotations, to clarify that these words are those of the Nazi scum, and not the author of the editorial.
This commercial has been brought to you by rich folks who also gave us SB21. Ask yourself why these two people should care about you and yours? They don't. They are pathetic and greedy and unethical men. This is Pure D bilgewater!
What a horrible man bashing article ! Many men and woman work together in the household while men, let's face it, in many cases work long hours at work and bring in the money for the household. That's reality, especially if the woman, are indeed, looking after the household. Let's put some balance into these never ending gender stereotyping comments of men being lazy around the house and woman being the superior parent. It's getting tiresome.
It's disgusting and should be banned from all public places.  I don't care if it's a homeless person or a billionaire white guy.
Tillerson is lying for his new co-conspirator, Trump.   In 2007, he personally acknowledged that climate change was happening and that human activity was a contributing factor.   Now that it's beneficial to his co-conspirator's buffoonery, he's back to hedging. Mustn't upset the buffoon in chief.   Tillerson has no morals and with these latest lies, he has demonstrated he has no character whatsoever. He's as crooked a con man as Trump.   Traitorous con men like Trump and Tillerson should be removed from office. They are both unfit to serve.
I just hope my man Trump wins and cooked Hillary will go to jail.
but she does have a special hatred for Barry Sommers as evidenced here:  "Barry, you preach hatred toward every single one of the 1.6 billion Muslims on our planet, 99.999% of whom desire to live in peace just as any human of any other religion. The reason is simple - we are all humans who desire peace. The lies you preach are destructive of peace. Your hatred is destructive of peace. You are a small, frightened, ignorant, hateful man. You are the enemy of peace and good will among men. You are a fool, and anyone who listens to you is a fool. You are poisonous. Go away, and never come back, devil spawn. I think you are a truly mentally deranged person, with enough intelligence to make trouble for a lot of innocent people."  and this one:  jjp58  Barry Sommer  a year ago By now Ali is aware that you are the forum religious fruitcake. If you approached and confronted me with your leading questions, I would call a cop. You are completely insane.
GET OVER IT!!!!!! IT WAS AN EFFING JOKE!!!! Quit being so damn hyper sensitive.   YES, it was funny... It was funny because MOST nurses are indeed FEMALE! FACT. When I hear the word "NURSE" I, and statistically 100% of other human beings picture the woman with the white dress and hat. THATS HOW IT IS. DEAL WITH IT!  2) Statistically 100% of straight men WOULD NOT want gay men OOGLING their genitals and "admiring" them. FACT. That is NOT "Anti-Gay"... Its just FACT. I certainly would not want some gay guy checking out my private parts...   And you Leftists wonder why we cant stand you guys... You are NITPICKERS!!! You take apart EVERY DAMN sentence and analyze EVERY word... You take the fun out of EVERYTHING.   MAGA 2020.
You're not a smart man, are you?
There would seem to be an easy solution. A heterosexual could say he's buying this gay wedding cake for his friend or relative who is gay or say he's buying it as a joke to play on a friend. You would think that this baker would have no problem selling anything to a straight person. Heck, the baker would probably sell a cake to a straight guy who said he was buying it for his friend or relative who was a serial murderer or child molester, as long as he was also a straight guy. Of course, one of the gay guys could always profess to be the straight guy who's buying a cake for his friend or relative. Why fight the system?  Best,  RTD
Why does "the support of family and friends" have anything to do with the sentencing of a convicted murderer.  "Yes, we support our murdering husband, father, uncle and brother".  "In the back" are the operative words here - what a murdering coward this man is.
This man should've been put to death, not released. The system continually fails to protect the public. And since there's no place for him in Island County, put him in jail. Tacoma doesn't want him!
Guess what- he's born with a penis/testicles, he's a boy.    Look- schools might as well drop 'boys' and 'girls' events in track and just have everyone together compete for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and state records if track authorities are going to no longer have one's physical equipment delineate who is  competing against whom. Makes the meets a lot shorter and this 'showboating' of specialness moot.  Just run all events together and take your awards as individual 'students' who have placed- and leave this silly, statement laden gender gerrymandering behind.
Mike Stainbank what in the world has your pathetic ambitions to do with the SARS  story as above? You worked for Bop TV? Is this an attempt to wash away your strong sense of culpability because of your involvement with an Apartheid child as a White man?
Funny, you don't seem like a rogue Catholic to me.  The church is filled with men who hate feminists and minorities and love BLOTUS.
round up all the muslims young men from canada,germany,france,britain,and the states  arm them and send them to syria.boots on the ground is needed.
Ronnie had Maggie.  Dubya had Blair.  Donnie has May.  Man, the Brits have sure become a buncha weak, suck up losers.  Churchill must be rolling in his grave.
Listening to a hypocritical cretin like Yiannopolous is the price we pay for living in a tolerant democracy.  I am glad that he seems to be getting his just desserts, since while I firmly believe even wingnuts deserve a voice, I also believe that we have the right to treat said wingnuts in the only way they truly deserve -- with contempt.  This doesn't mean violence or personal slurs that aren't rooted in fact.  But if a man like this decides to hang himself with statements that approve pederasty, or claims that birth control renders women unattractive, we are free to call him out for the odious little troll that he is.  It's early yet, but I am very interested to see the comments of those who approve of men like Bannon and sites like Breitbart here.  My guess is that we will enjoy a refreshing silence.
It's easy for a white person to claim another ethnicity commits all the crime, just as easy as it is for a black person to cop-out and say the white man is holding them down, and ADN's consistent omission of ethnicity details is borne of the stupidity of others. If a person commits a crime, ADN has the moral obligation to tell the public whether they are white, samoan, black, or Cree Indian. ADN Pay attention: not including these details make you look like a bunch of idiotic college-level SJW's that are committing the intrapersonal crime of cultural appropriation, being offended on another culture's behalf-and being overly sensitive. Grow up and do the work, enough is enough.
Well Richard,  His skin color has everything to do with it. When he was elected for his first term ,all of the racist came storming out of the closet and haven't turned back. If you can't see that, then you are one of them. Obama didn't fail at anything, it was all hate from day one. He kept his cool, so he'd not be labeled the angry black man, and the I told you so crowd, couldn't say 'see what I mean'. Like AKJammer first instinct was to blame Obama for something he had nothing to do with. If it wasn't for all the hate, Obama would be labeled the G.O.A.T. POTUS!
Hhhmm let me guess...white, male, uneducated, angry, world owes you a living...am I getting close?
On another point, there is a serious current increase in the manufacturing of Crystal Meth in NY.  Most offenders happen to be rural white residents.  This has resulted in numerous arrests and convictions of whites.  Can I infer some  racial issues  since those incarcerated for this specific drug offense happen to be white males?
I'm sorry Ms. Claycomb felt harassed by dissenters to government forced fluoridation of the water supply.  But she should understand that her favored policy is not an innocuous issue.  I inquired with water officials in 2000 who assured me that fluoridation was not a possibility.  I bought a house on that basis, then ended up fighting fluoridation for a prolonged period to no avail.  I'm sorry I didn't sell the  house immediately.  There is likely no possibility of convincing an advocate of man made climate change of the extreme foolishness of fluoridation, but perhaps she could at least develop a modicum of compassion for others oppressed by a supremely  ignorant policy.
You have it backward: You right wingers freaked out about Clinton's email server. Now Trump--who led the charge--has appointed two men who knowingly and directly gave out substantive classified information.  The word "hypocrite" doesn't even begin to define you.
Ranger - "Too stupid to read, breed a British Whore."  That pretty much sums up your view of women doesn't it? I didn't flag your comment and approved it, btw but this comment regarding stupid women is right in line with the typical abuser of women. Women don't matter, their man has to keep them in line?  Out of all the DV cases you know about, you are focused on the one that the abuser says he was innocent. BTW, how do you KNOW this guy did not abuse the victim? Because your good buddy said he didn't? Hmmmmm.
How stupid could you be??? The man is 91 years old and suffers from dementia. What good could it possibly do to put him in prison??? This is a tragic accident that has scared and devastated this entire family. Sorry you have no heart and are such a dick!!
BLM=bullies.  Where are BLM when blacks kill blacks? Where was BLM when the black female police officer was shot and killed by a black man in Florida?
Holding Mr. Trump to higher standards in how he speaks of women is good.  According to economics historian Thomas Sowell, when corrected for experience level women earn more than men. Trying to get even higher pay seems unfair.  If by reproductive rights women mean the "right" to abort their child, please consider that the most basic right of all rights is for a human to live their entire life cycle without another human killing them. Without this right, no other right matters. Both science and God (in the Bible) tell us that the human life cycle begins at conception, even though our Supreme Court has to date not recognized it. You and I have been given that right and we were protected and nurtured during that most vulnerable time by our own mothers. To deny that same right to your own child is therefore hypocritical and immoral. Please use your choice earlier to prevent conception, or after conception to protect and nurture life,  with the help of the man who helped you conceive.
As Europeans have discovered, such muck-in integration is very difficult to do because of their faith. There are restrictions on what women can do and the men refuse often to work as equals with women. This makes integration into workplaces very difficult. There is a program on the TV in the UK where Muslims are placed in a house together. The disputes over sex roles are illuminating and show how difficult it is to reconcile this belief system with modern life. Some even express very violent views and wish to launch attacks. None of this is helpful for integration.
You cannot compare miscegenation with same-sex unions. Marriage between couples of different races, man and woman, cannot possibly be compared to the parody of marriage which takes place between people of the same sex. The civil law may have forbidden interracial marriages between a man and a woman, God, however, does not. To equate African-Americans with active homosexuals is disgraceful, it is actually worse than racial discrimination as it implies that they are in a similar spiritual state. I'm not an African-American, I am English but were I an orthodox, African-American, Catholic, I would be appalled that the liberal intelligentsia considered me to be even remotely similar to an active homosexual. African-Americans unfortunately may well suffer discrimination because of their race or colour but not because their being African-American was intrinsically immoral.
Gee, nice straw man.  I don't "dehumanize" Bailey- I say he is a bad choice for Mayor. He hangs with- drum roll please- homophobes.  That makes me someone who doesn't like bigots.  His friends aren't acceptable because they have really, really dumb ideas that they evangelize.
what bs loser, the oil and gas industry does NOT get subsidies, they create the taxes you loser lefties use for subsidies... but you lunatics on the left think that because they pay a certain tax rate that is lower than YOU think it should be such is a subsidy, man you guys need to take a business course
I was wrong in stating he takes hormones--there is no confirmation that he does. You are correct in pointing out that surgery is not always used to transition.   There is a highly controversial diagnosis known as autogynephilia, which doesn't totally address Wolscht's disorder but seems to partially--men who are aroused by the idea of being women. In his case, the arousal appears to depend on being an underage female/child. This also explains his shacking up with a couple of polyamorous swingers, having sex with "daddy" at a sex club, and so forth.  This notable deviance is the reason why that diagnostic label is no longer in use when talking about transgenderism broadly--it simply doesn't typify the vast majority of people who are transgender.  See my note on the clovergender hoax appended to one of my comments below.
[Donald Trump by saying the U.S. leader is "not my bride, and I am not his groom."] Would it be more accurate to say Trump is "my bitch and I'm his extortionist?"  Not that Putin ever would but this looks so much like him attacking a straw man rather than the point...
Not clear what your point is.  Seems to me that if you're dead, who did it doesn't make much difference.  You're just as dead.  I'm trying to have a rational conversation here without taking sides.  There are cultural issues in play here that aren't being talked about, and the Democratic party engineered them, I believe, to keep blacks poor and dependent on Democrats.  It's called the poverty trap.  After WWII, the unemployment rate for black men fell steadily up to 1965.  When the welfare programs started, the black unemployment number leveled off and the number in poverty began to increase because it paid better.  The blacks were set up to fail by the Democrats.  They created a situation that made crime the logical thing to do.
"Except for the racial element" --- my friend, you just answered why your point is incorrect about my thoughts pertaining to the 1%. And, being a Right-winger, you can't claim anything related to anti-Semitism, considering that Donnie Moscow has inspired the white knights to claim that Jews and other religions—along with many ethnicities—do not belong in white America.  Your points about Bezos and crew are off-base. You name a few of the "good guys", when the vast reality is that many of them are nothing but hedge-funders like Robert Mercer—men with undiagnosed gambling disorders—or they are techbros. Techbros are white guys who pride themselves on being an asshole like Steve Jobs, only techbros don't possess Job's God-given talent. These are fellas who open-source meaningless apps, then hold an IPO to get cash before the public realizes how useless it is. And tech is legendary for hating women and being racist. The people you seem to idolize do nothing for America.
they also need to lighten up.  Having sex is no obstacle to holiness.  That is what this is really about, including the belief that women tempt men into sex that they do not want - a belief that celibates are incapable of seeing as ridiculous.
Could it be a bit of misogynism, particularly among the white men over 50?
You sound like a man whose brain is filled with rock!!!  LOLOL  "rimrock' what a perfect name for you! your parent must be filled with rock to name their son 'rimrock', pathetic!!!
You do realize that all those revolutionary radicals and romanticized rebels, once they get a taste of real MONEY, basically become "Old, straight, white males" right???  Fidel, Carlos Slim, Robert Mugabe, Jacob Zuma, Hugo Chavez, etc etc etc...
You can thank the boy in the big house in DC for the 18 percenters and "pro-White" rally seekers hiding behind elitism and racism as though free speech is their defense.  Best possible case is find the rocks y'all crawled out from under and get to diggin!
There is no part of the law that says a man in the woman's room has to act or dress like a woman. Get a fuckin clue you dumb broad.
what an unrealistic pile of male bovine excrement
Your comment only displays your own ignorance.  Of course you have to make fun of Mr. Cole's view: it doesn't pander to your guy.  Poor Melania, married to a spoiled child.
You sound like the Pre-Vatican II Church was against "normal psychological  development," and put rules ahead of souls, fears ahead of joys, and sick repressions ahead of healthy expressions.    You'd have us think grown men were calling the rectory to ask if a 1 a.m. aspirin broke the fast for the next day's 11 a.m. mass and that a grown woman was literally worried sick because her priest saw her enter the theater to see Peyton Place with her husband on their 15th anniversary.   You talk like many innocent films, books, TV shows, art works,  music, and dances were condemned by name from the altar and going to the Episcopal church with Grandma or participating in your Presbyterian uncle's funeral were called grave sins.  Who'd believe you?   Who'd believe the Good Old Days were condemned as Evil Modernity as they were being lived by good, holy, and kind Catholics?  "C'mon Baby, Let's Do the Twist"--Who'd believe you if you said Fr. O'Brien called that an invitation to Hell?   Anyone?
Some lesbians, but mostly by men.  Gays don't recruit.  Pederasts recruit - many in the priesthood and they become, gasp, priests.
You see, some men are learning something from feminists: how to nag & whine 😭. Such progress.
Oh. As long as the smartest people are white men, correct?
I just assume that all criminals are male and they were born here.
There are so many things wrong with this article that I don't even know where to begin, this is truly a CNN level of fake news.   The rapes at the Swedish music festival were committed by immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, which is the reason police are investigating the immigrant connection. Muslim men have been committing huge numbers of rapes since Sweden made the mistake of admitting so many members of a 'rape culture' into their country.  As far as violence being committed against women and minorities every day by white men, the group most responsible for murdering black men in the US, by a wide margin, is other black men.   The wage gap is a myth. More men are raped every year than women. Far more men die every year in war, industrial accidents, murders and suicides than women. The 'testosterone empire' you're whining about really isn't a great advantage for men.  Yes, female-only screenings are sexist. Try having a male-only screening of Batman, and see how that goes.
Many Catholic priests are gay. In the 2000 book "The Changing Face of the Priesthood," Rev. Donald B. Cozzens suggested that the priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession. Cozzens estimated that as much as 58 percent of priests were gay, and that percentages were even higher for younger priests. His numbers matched previous estimates by sociologists who put the numbers of gay priests between 10 and 60 percent.  One must go to the source to address the problem of priests abusing young boys.  The source isn't the bishops, its the men under the bishops charge.  But let's pretend it's all about the bishops, for the sake of political correctness.
The man is so lazy,and fails to look in the mirror each morning for he would have to face it...an unclean face and that silly hat!!
One more insane religous nut yearning for Armageddon so he and his ilk can go out in a blaze of glory to meet a false, invisible entity and take all other humanity with them.  Trump and Pence, the two most dangerous men in the nation and the world in charge of a massive military force  without a brain between the two of them.  Two of the weakest men in the world blathering in macho oral utterance devoid of any sanity at all.
In fact "Black Americans are twice as likely as white Americans to be unarmed when police kill them"  "Overall, police shot and killed 978 people in the yearlong period that immediately followed Kaepernick’s first protest, according to the Post. Black Americans made up roughly 21 percent of the victims"  Since Blacks are just 13% of the population, clearly they are being killed at a disproportionate rate. And let me remind you of the skin color of the Las Vegas shooter, Dylan Roof, Timothy McVeigh, the Sandy Hook shooter, the Columbine shooters..............  Yes, police are targeting black men and they are being killed at a disproportionate rate no matter how you want to spin it.  Get real.
Easy lady . No one is condoning choking a person's wife even if she burn's the husbands dinner or runs over his dog . Even if she votes liberal doesn't make it right to choke or abuse her.   Taking away her car keys , not letting her watch the View , and taking away her weekly allowance money is all fair game. Men make 20 percent more than women doing the same job for a reason. And don't get me wrong---I'm all for women's lib---as long as she's home in time to cook my dinner and rub my feet.
It isn't Donald Trump's business experience that is keeping his campaign afloat, it's blatant sexism, racism, nativism, homophobia, and a whole host of other "isms."  If he'd ever release his tax returns we'd find out once and for all just how good (or not) his business acumen really is. The fact that he refuses to release those returns, both for his personal income and his foundation, lets me know he has much to hide.  I suspect that the one and only reason Trump ran for president is because he is so much in debt (more than likely to Russian oligarchs) that this was his only way out financially.   MSW says, "Anyone who questions the man, questions the company. It is an invitation to narcissism." In Trump's case, if he were to win it would be an invitation to a Putin-esque authoritarian regime the likes of which we have never seen in this republic. With Putin's help, I'm sure Trump would be able to convert our democracy into something of which Putin himself would be proud. God help us.
You are not allowed to have something just for men anymore.  Only women can have events on their own these days.  Any attempt for a men's rally or parade would be met with cries of intolerance to women. Our society has officially become ridiculous.  The government doesn't help.  They just apologize to every special interest group and marginalize the average working Canadian.  The majority of the complainers are not valuable contributors to society.  Then the hard working Canadians who pay the tax don't have time to go out and protest and whine, they are paying the bills.  Just sad how we are treated.
This choice is going to be a brilliant recruiting tool for ISIS and Islamic terrorism. Donald Trump has promised to defeat both those things yet has just made them stronger. Clearly this is a man who does not understand cause and effect.
I didn't vote for Obama either time, but when you attempt to compare an honest, intelligent and hard working man such as him to Trump you're really showing just how racist/myopic/stupid you are.
ericnorstog: "Did you read the letter? It talks about rape, not consensual sex." Ahhh...but "therein lies the rub"- The evening's festivities may start with consensual sex, but AT ANYTIME , during, or even days or weeks Later, the woman may decide to reclassify the entire incident as "RAPE"!  To be a young man Entrapped in such a situation is something I would not wish on an enemy! But we instill in the youngest females that "It's Ok, honey, you are not responsible for anything!" EX: A very young (10) girl crawls out a window to meet a 21 year old man, She is completely blameless? and her Parents?
She supports abortion, reason enough to reject her. Trump gave up control of his assets and isn't accepting a salary as president so exactly how does that make him greedy? And gee, when did you become anointed of God to proclaim a man an atheist  and judge him as a cheating liar when he himself proclaims to be Christian. Leviticus 19:16 "You shall not go around as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not stand up against the life of your neighbor: I am the Lord". I'll pray for you even if you aren't a Christian yourself, which I suspect otherwise you wouldn't have put up such an idiotic post.
Sexual predators are toxic.  Masculinity isn't.  Conflating the two - especially in a headline of Canada's 'national' newspaper -  is ridiculous.
Men are just as greedy and nasty as women.   I'm female and I was the bread-winner.  While I was out of town on business my then-husband emptied the house and bank accounts and moved in with his old flame ... and then sued me for spousal support (because he could not work - he was "disabled" because he was an alcoholic).  It cost me a huge amount, financial and self-esteem.  But it was the best thing that could of happened to me - I will never let a man walk all over me again.  Any my ex?  He spiraled down and out of control, and then died.   The way I see it - I dodged a bullet.  A very painful lesson, but after decades of being a door mat I will never let that happen again.  It's now etched in my brain forever.  To ALL young people today - earn your OWN money and get a good prenup.  Take care of yourself.
So Larry, if a person has a full beard do they automatically have a penis? If a person has short hair and somewhat masculine facial features must they automatically have to use the men's bathroom? Do you check what everybody in the restroom you are using has between their legs? If you do you are actually violating public nuisance laws that have been around a lot longer than AO-96. We need protection from you!!!
Anyone who intentionally uses the wrong bathroom has issues . Just saying " trust me , I won't hurt anyone "   or  " no one has harmed anyone yet " isn't good enough .  It's sad we have to make laws to address what should come as common sense and decency to everyone.  What do you say to your young daughter who says some guy is walking around with nothing on in the women's shower ?  That guy deserves to be behind bars or an old school lesson decency .   What the heck is so terribly wrong with society that anyone would defend this insanity and be will to put young women at risk ?  Bruce Jenner went from an American hero to American disgrace , and some people applaud him ?  We have become sick that we think his behavior is to be celebrated .
Plus, like the Church today, the APA was incredibly over focused on gay men which made the APA appear to discriminate when it came to homosexuality.    The APA finally bent to three facts.  The first and foremost being their treatment paradigms didn't have any effect on the mental illness they were stating they could cure.  The treatments had no credibility.  Second, many of their own came out of the closet and lo and behold they weren't neurotic. Third was the political pressure, but that was given more credence because of numbers one and two.
Given that men back a form of media that dehumanises us, shows us enjoying violent attacks on our genitals cloaked as 'sex' and promotes gang attacks, rape and paedophilia, i think women are right to point out how being objectified, ie stripped of our humanity, effects us and our ability to live our lives. White men are used to keeping women, children and poc down by the judicious use of threats and violence, often covered up as humour. Without looking at the wider picture of male violence against women and children you are deliberately taking this comment out of context in order to strip it of its nature, ridiculing a human by comparing her to a sexualised doll.
What a sad, vicious little man --- he needs help.
Clearly they are sexist and biased against men. This man was fired because he used logic and deductive reasoning to understand a pattern occurring in his work place. Not only did this poor man not say anything negative about women or men he just expressed facts. It's so sad that a company like google can use their power to suppress the opinions and positive strides towards understanding a simple concept such as patterns in workplace environments. You can't voice your opinions men or the feminazi's will get you!
Young treats his constituents like garbage -- you got that right.  So why do a majority of his constituents who voted vote for Alaska's premier trash-collector?  For the same reason they voted for Donald Trump --they like, really really like, mean, old, ignorant white men.
Yes, beware of Donald the spineless loser who runs and hides in twitter for all his big talk.  The world needs real men again, not this latest trend to spoiled brats like Trump and Trudeau.
Why would single women in their 20s want to settle down?? That's dumb. Boys apparently don't become "men" until possibly their early 70s.
Then you spit on the men and women who died for your country Shame on you
Cosby gives Blacks a bad name, no? After reading so many techniques he used with his star celebrity status, he is the BEST rapist I have ever heard of. Wonder if someone will write a crime story about him when more facts come out in the trial. It's going to be a challenger to the OJ Simpson trial. Please do hurry up and start it. I don't want him or I to die of old age too soon. It's going to be a fascinating trial. What I'm curious about are these questions. Were these women given monetary gifts afterwards? Were they looking forward to an adventure of being "raped" by a black man, especially a Hollywood celebrity? But were angry that they fell asleep and missed the fun? Why did they continue to stay if they realized they entered a room full of only well-dressed black men? Were these victims angry because they gave sex thinking they were going to get glamour or well-paying jobs? Prepare yourselves. He may just get ACQUITTED.
What a bunch of crap ever since we had a Black Muslim President from Kenya for 8 yrs. These jerks trying to follow the Jive Man ways. { Oh it is o'kay a male can go into a woman rest-room, It is okay to use drugs, all the bull crap he spread thru our nation some people are still trying follow  his ways. Enough is Enough People back our old respectful ways of America.
Woman that are bent on condemning the male gender are usually bitter disgruntled vile trollips who are bent on vitriol and guile. Case in point..... Payrollgirl
Fat, drunk, men, spraying chemicals on their lawns and loving diesel fuel........wonder why sperm counts are down ????
You have to be shitting me.  The man locked himself in a car and the police office shot him?  Is there more to this story because if there isn't we need to have one less police officer in Juneau.
They ( liberals ) are trying to destroy our freedom by divide and conquer. They are implementing racism on all sides where there is none. Did anyone notice its white liberals doing this? They are stoking the fires of racism to gain votes for the democratic party. The democrats, antifa, are pimping the black man to do their bidding. They are using you. They are using us all. They are practicing the same technique they have used to topple governments all over the world DIVIDE, AND CONQUER. Unity is their worst enemy, and the media is their machine gun.
In spite of rules new and old, many a gay (practicing)  male has made it into and through the seminary, and into the priesthood and the hierarchy.  How do they do it?  Ancient Wisdom says simply -- DON'T GET CAUGHT!  Still works, even with the latest word from the Vatican!
Hey grey beard. Bet that if we check your shit you got some funk too. Everyone's a real badass with their keyboard now a days. For you information in the state of Oregon sex offenders don't go to prison every time nor most of the time. Instead they plea down to a simple illegal penetration or some bull.shut and get set free. I've been in court and locked up, and watched them sentence a guy to 90 days in jail for molesting his little brother..... 3rd conviction for it in a year. So keep talking your shit grey beard. At least be a man and use your real name. Keyboard coward.
The ultimate irony with the Hebdo cover is that literally thousands of Texans fought and died in WWII, many on French soil including during D-Day to help liberate France from the real Nazis, Hitler's Nazis, not some imaginary fake Texas Nazis who don't even really exist. Many of the dead flood victims were poor, African-American and Hispanic Texans who didn't have the means to escape, including that woman whose poor kid was clinging to her floating body before being rescued. That kid is black. Oh, but she "deserved" to see her mother die, it was "karma" because the state she happened to live in leans Republican and Trump got all their electoral votes. That's the sick, twisted logic of ignorant liberal-progressives.
To say Netanyahu is being disingenuous is, in itself, disingenuous, or at best, euphemistic.   To be blunt, the man is a world-class liar and dissembler.
Um, how is that straw man of yours?    This isn't about me, it's about this awful pResident.    The point is that Donnie Two Scoops professes to be a Christian, at least to get the rubes to vote for him, but really worships Mammon.
Sex is often used by a low status woman to gain access to resources that she otherwise cannot gain. Women use sex not only for financial gains but to advance her careers, to develop her intellect, to enrich her experience. That is often why title IX in university campus makes sense (although some denounce it as a kangaroo court) because we do not want to make a university campus a cesspool dripping with genital fluid where nubile students are blowing their professors during office hours for fucking reference letters for graduate school. This is an insult to cleaning staffs. However, historically female students have been dating their professors and gained a helping hand in career promotion. This pattern of trade between female sex and male resource is common in other industries (especially in arts) where nurturing is required by people high in dominance hierarchy.   The bad part is much of deal making is left in the dark and stuff of rumours, cryptic messages in the bathroom.
The little girl with the sign also believes that homosexuals must be killed, Israel and Jews  must be  eradicated, Christians can have their heads cut off, and women including herself are the property of men who may  beat them.  Ain't she sweet?
A man named Steve Kokonis , President of Ocean Marine Brokerage Service of Louisiana. USA calls the conditions "probably deplorable".   Twenty people on such a small ship with possibly only 10 bunks and not toilets.  If there was a toilet it would not be available to the trafficked individuals.  They hang over the side to do their businesses  Do we really understand that the fire on the vessel was to conceal unlawful conduct. Do we understand that no call for help was an attempt to avoid detection and to escape into he night.  Criminals...the lot of them are not worthy of respect and should be driven from the community of decent people.   Prison terms are in order...  Thanks to AP, Civil Beat, the radio and television media.  Here is the big question-did any them die during the transit.  Something that we will never know  Shame on the government, industry, traffickers, enforcement officials and every single human that allows this to happen.
Over 800 black males have been shot or killed by other black males in CHicago this year so far.   On a national level, black males are about 3000% more dangerous to each other than are cops. But the Globe, Clinton, Obama, BLM, and all other left wing political critics of Trump steadfastly never talk about it.
Why do you have nothing to say about what gay men have done to thousands of boys and the reputation of the church?  No wonder you're always seeking justice elsewhere.   Always outraged at the straight world.
Gee, women have no sense of humor and are calling all men that don't kowtow to them PIGS.
More inane drivel from lefty fascists, who can only denigrate Donald Trump and his supports. "His supporters believe this dishonest man . . . will torture for them." Huh? Yet the RG editors allow this sort of rot. Hillary Clinton is your compulsive liar, who has broken numerous federal statutes. Removing classified material is a felony, and that's for starters. Mrs. Clinton has said "She doesn't remember," and gets to skate because of a corrupt federal government. Hillary Clinton also lied to the families of those who were killed in Benghazi, including a US Ambassador. Clinton and the administration knew it was an organized Al-Qaeda attack (on September 11, 2012! Imagine that!) but claimed to America and the families some obscure YouTube video triggered angry Muslims. The Middle East is aflame today because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, threatening the security of the US and our allies.  Yet all crybaby leftists can do is blubber what a big meanie Donald Trump is.
Thank God you are here Syringa.  These cis heterofascist white males are always making grammar errors and that TRIGGERS me!
If you knew his real story you wouldn't spout the "silver spoon" crap. After Nick disappeared, his Widow picked quite the second husband. I used to work for him. Many years later, there he was on America's Most Wanted for gyping rich ladies out of their money. I almost lost my cookies. You think that was a picnic for Markie? If you knew what we called him in school, you'd shut your trap, Cheechako! He's a Good Man who tried to his best for him home: Alaska!
Munchins looks like a munchins. The man who dont want to show his taxes, will tell you everything about YOUR taxes. The orange baboon is a hypocrite.
“for every ethnic group without exception, incarceration rates among young men are lowest for immigrants.”  How many times will this statistical ploy have to be discredited before activists and special interests stop reciting this nonsense?   Lawful immigrants are carefully screened for criminal backgrounds and potential to become contributing members of society and consequently have a lower crime rate than natives. Those who have crossed the border unlawfully are indeed disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system.   We could include enough nuns in a pool of hookers to construct a statistical model showing that these are virtuous ladies.
True story: In Oregon 30 years ago a man shot a large brown hairy animal; skinned it, quartered it, put his elk harvest tag on it and hauled it to the butcher in town. The butcher called Fish and Game to report a violation because it had no antlers or indication of sex. Fish and Game did not arrest the man (who was like a dentist or something, recently moved out from Chicago) because it turns out it was a HORSE. He did have to pay the rancher for the horse though. We have a name for people like that, which cannot be repeated here. And the people who shot this whale are no different.
This is absurd and that teacher should be fired immediately. Who would ever trust that crazy stupid woman? Teach the girls to use Lego's too! Not just the boys... She said Gender equality... She's being being racist against the boys and that is called sexism. No way to sugar coat this... Indeed She does have an axe being sharpened for 5 YEAR OLD BOYS! She is making CHILDREN VICTIMS OF SEXISM. She's even teaching the girls to be superior to men by limiting the boys in their choices, That's not the education I would want my child to have- that is Embarrassing!!! Because of her own personal feelings, she will sacrifice those children's education?!   I'm supportive of equality... But how dare she take what all women have fought YEARS to obtain and urinate on it? How could she be sexist against those innocent boys?! Is she going to start separating them by color next?!
Let's see - this man first came before a court at the age of 13. We don't know what he did, but we can be sure it wasn't for cheating on a test. At the age of 17 he was sent to state prison for aggravated assault, breaking a bottle across another man's face. That is violent indeed. After getting out, this man returned to prison for stabbing another man. While in prison the two times, he assaulted ten men. These are factors most definitely "related" to his "actual crime" This man does not have a steep learning curve.  He was first convicted of meth delivery in 2007; he would have been 22. Now he has been caught delivering meth, and possessing a five-pound stash. He says he's not in a gang, but getting your hands on that amount of meth likely requires organized criminal connections and swearing a blood oath.  This is not a nice person, he's a violent sociopath. His prognosis for becoming a decent citizen is poor. Any court would be foolish to extend any degree of leniency to this liar.
Richard my only request is people that make comments have to use their real name. You have something to say, then be man or woman enough to stand by your statement with your real name not this crap you see now.
O.M.G. nine temporary jobs picking ornamental shrubs have been snatched (from brown skinned people) and opened up for all those (mostly white) men cluttering up Eugene's downtown area, freeing them from harassing the envied employed class who dread encountering them.  Way to go P***Y Grabber in Chief, ICE is awesome.
Mental midgets think that the chain saw is the only answer to forest health.  But forests were doing extremely well until white men and chain saws came along.  Stephen J. Remington
The shame of it is that they are male nurses...
So are you. It is called freedom. Love it or leave it is old and never made any sense anyway. Just a stooooopid quip to put down people who don't agree with a life of pre-meditated war. We need less citizens who feel privileged and less men who want to play with big, dangerous, lethal TOYS. And we would be better off with a woman president............. thank God Hillary wasn't the first FEMALE.....ruthless. Bye Bye!
It “turns men into louts”?  No, sexual liberation, pushed and promoted by women and women alone, turns women into sluts (I mean that in a sex-positive, SlutMarch kind of way).  Well done, er,....ladies.  Well done.
It's hardly without irony that the biggest opponent of legalized cannabis in Alaska is also the one man in the whole state that could benefit the most from smoking a doob. That, and judging from his perpetually pissy attitude he's long, long overdue for a blow job, and quite possibly has never received one. Although, when you take into account his homophobia, it's quite likely that he's given at least one at some point, and it's stirred up a lot of self loathing.
I'm a staunch, hardcore dirty stinking anarchist feminist weirdo (also a straight, white cismale, for the record). I hate AVFM and the entire disgusting MRA/PUA/MGTOW misogynist circlejerk. Their efforts to downplay and minimize the harm society still does to women is utterly heinous.  But I have a bit of an issue with the tone of some of this article because I feel that it supports behaving in a similarly crappy way to how a lot of anti-feminists behave. If a group wants to start men-only shelters, who cares? If they're not obstructing women's shelters or other useful projects, I don't see an issue. Yes, their rhetoric is misleading. And yes, their stats are incorrect compared to more recent sampling. So we can criticize that.  It's just rather noxious to me when a group that is purporting to do good (misguided, perhaps, but hey, there might actually be a need for a male shelter) gets obstructed. Let's let them create a shelter. Let's support positive acts, k?
ah yes, the inevitable mixing of pedophiles and homosexuals in an effort to say they're all the same.  It's every bit as insulting as claiming all heterosexual men are girl fondlers.  But hey, whatever it takes to do the Christian thing and smear others, right?
It's unfortunate an unsavory group such as the KKK has been associated with those against the removal of a statue depicting a brilliant Confederate general and Virginia native son. But their meager ranks,  estimated between 5,000 and 8,000 nation wide and extreme racists are not representative of the true reason to let Lee's statue remain. Vietnam is often described by African-Americans as a "white man's war", having made up of 12.6 percent of the soldiers in country. I guess the next effort will be to eliminate all monuments dedicated to that conflict. Absolutely ridiculous.
Are the Muslim women protesting Islam and Muhammad for relegating them to lower status than men?
That's is just too bad.  Any man who thinks that women are collateral damage and should not be administered remedies to terminate a pregnancy because of life threatening conditions is, in fact, a sadist.  I, personally, do not take men's opinions on pregnancy and birth control seriously, because they are totally ignorant.  I always encourage women to ignore men and their dictates.  We have a conscience, and our first priority is to save our own lives, and not obey men who only care about females when they are in the womb.  I've been around a long time and I've spoken to hundreds of men like you.  You want to control women with pregnancy. You want to deny them a satisfying sex life by denying them birth control.  That's why we don't listen to you anymore.  We know that God is not a sadist.
isn't  a  feminist   either  a  rich   white  woman married  or  divorced  from a  rich  white  man or  a  hairy  legged, manless  lesbian?  Certainly  looks  that  way  to  me.
Dear Mr. Biden,  I know your puppet in Canada won't be brave enough to tell you, but somebody should, so I will.  The "Canadian" government has been running some serious deficits lately.  The combined federal and provincial net debt has increased to around $1.3 trillion. This debt is about $35,827 for every man, woman, and child living in Canada.   In short, we're already hurting and we don't want to dig our hole of debt any deeper. So please, Mr. Biden, please meet with whoever you are going to photo-op with when you come to "Canada" via Skype.  It's perfectly secure and the already-maxed-out "Canadian" government won't have to shell out any more millions of future "Canadian" taxpayers' money on something as shamefully wasteful and useless as your visit.    Thanks very much for your understanding, Mr. Biden.  Sincerely, Karl Marx Jr.
I agree that Lee was doing his duty and was an honourable man. However, the guys trying to stop the removal of his statue aren't interested in that, they are interested in a form of white control of the South and having the black people put back in their places.
I think it was grievous. Lewinsky was an intern and he was the President. Just as a teacher shouldn't be in a relationship with a student because that would be a misuse of the authority and trust that comes with the position, Bill should have made sure there was nothing going on with an intern. He was also cheating on Hillary. So not much good going on there.   I'm not making excuses for Donald, though. Walking in on naked teenagers,  groping women, allegations of rape, sexual harassment suits all paint a picture of a nasty man.
Woman. What a bunch of gossiping dirty birds.....they're all alike... Any curious group of men would be excoriated for this conduct.   I dont think this enters the "neckro" relm though. I also dont think these dirty birds need to lose jobs over it. Maybe a wrist slap.  There I said it!
“where people can feel comfortable to speak freely.”  That's code for white males to keep quiet.
If progressives and feminists and the Globe want to allow columns like this one that attacks masculinity they need to allow comments like this one and not delete them.  "Clinton lauds women's courage in wake of Weinstein allegations"  What???? This is the same Clinton who accepted Weinstein as a friend? His behaviour was far from a secret. Where was she? Why wasn't she attacking him years ago? Was she too busy cashing his fund raising cheques?  You know what's toxic? Feminists like Clinton who use feminism to push their own agenda but when it hurts them in the wallet they back off.
Instead of saying "I'm sad and will kill myself," these entitled, misguided men say, "She made me sad. I'll kill her and myself. You don't see women lying in wait or going to a workplace to kill their exes.
Yeah, 500 wounded, 59 dead and this is not the time to wonder when it is my turn , my families and friends turn to be out in and killed by one man from a hotel window on the upper floor story. Now if it was a Muslim terrorist who killed 59 Americans and shot up another 500 while praying to Allah and seeking all those virgins after he committed suicide you would be with the rest of the wingers and Trump saying "I told you so"  and using this event for the biggest Ant-Muslim campaign since 9/11 and turn it on from all news media outlets and twitter before the bodies of the victims were even removed. In fact some right wing news media started on the Muslim terrorists attack when the event was still going on. They were hoping... it was not some old rich white since dude that does not play into their narrative.
Why ? I'm sure Muslim men would be just as butthurt as you white brodudes.
The mind boggles. First, the Liberals plan on taxing a provincial utility.  Didn't Justin learn anything from his father's illegal taxing of oil royalties.  Second, it is a carbon tax to reduce emissions but will be returned to....?   Clearly not the people facing the tax or it is meaningless.  It may be revenue neutral, but not to the people paying the tax. Third, only a small share of the carbon emissions on really large polluters will be taxed to maintain competitiveness.  So the small guy, who doesn't have any political power, gets hit with the full burden of the tax while the biggest polluters are exempt from most of the tax? Translation: This is a really stupid tax that will ruin federal provincial relations again and will take thousands of man-hours in both the private and public sectors to process for no discernible decline in carbon emissions but will make us look as if we are really doing something.   Man!  That is so Liberal.
Chrisin, that was a truly a idiotic rambling of nothing. You are correct this is not a left leaning country, Hillary is. What are you upset about??? I bet you are just ranting against the white man...
Yup, she is a girl and it is disgusting that the ADN is allowing these hateful abusive comments to stay up. Would they let comments calling black men "boy" and use of the "N" word to stay up. They would not, but because this story is about a transgender person and whoever monitors these comments doesn't have the proper amount of knowledge to discern abuse in this instance.
Over react? Ever serve as an Infantry man author man? I have...knowing what I know now...I wouldn' t follow that douchebag anywhere. Seriously who would now knowing where is heart lies unless of course you think just like him.
Makes me wonder if anyone has tried to create a safe space for Congressional staffers to report the behavior of members. If these guys are stupid enough to act inappropriately with their female colleagues, what do you think they're doing to the young women (and men) who work there?
Sure, the product of the true sexual union between a man and a woman in marriage could very well be  another unique person with an immortal soul.  The ONLY product of the sexual union betwen two homosexuals is spilled seed or eggs and some fecal matter.    Pick 'em!
You can warn them all you want but there are so many men and women in society that are just plain IGNORANT and STUPID.  Its like the warning on cigarette packages, This product causes CANCER, and people still smoke it.     Read the Sign:  IGNORANT & STUPID..............
New York City Trump and his billionaire friends would not let the average Trump voter mow his Mar-a-Lago lawn. Trump voters hate for a black man in office is so strong that they turn a blind eye to lying, perverted talk, and security risk for our country by standing with trump. As a plus though..we now can openly be racist thanks Don and his followers. By the way..I work in the oil industry of North Alaska..I make a good living..have good insurance....and I see right through Donald Trump.
The history of this state began about 15,000 years ago, according to current evidence.  All but the last millimeter or two of that long timeline belongs to Native peoples--who didn't subscribe to your Boys' Life myth about "rugged individualists hacking a life out of the wilderness."  Traditional Native communities believed (and to some extent still believe today) that survival is a shared enterprise.  A man was proud to share his good fortune with the group; equally, a man stayed with his group during hard times.  He didn't run off and take care of his own ass while they suffered.  You whites may do it differently, but I can't see that you've got much to brag about.  Your budget deficit, after all, was made by your own stupid and greedy every-man-for-himself white politics, not according to Native values.
He is not my president. Like I've said just because a cat lives in a dog house he's still a cat. The closest thing we have to a president is General John Kelly. Remember him the guy who had to bury his head in his hands when the idiot gave his United Nations speech. People wouldn't call him a moron if he was a true president. It's like being a father. You can be a child's biological father but until that child truly loves and respects you. You're just another man to them.
Richard, you are ridiculous, wait for the facts before you step on any soap box. Maybe the man was sleeping with the perp's lady friend. ???????
Well here's some lyrics from one of his most recent hits "Rap God":  I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table Over the back of a couple of faggots, and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact  You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'? Little gay-looking boy So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy You're witnessing a massacre Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy "Oy vey, that boy's gay!", that's all they say, looking boy  Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad Singin' to a man while they played piano  But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons, make lemonade then! But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?  One for good measure: Don't be a retard – be a king? Think not
This repulsive man is largely responsible for the decline in the sport of hockey.
"Behind closed doors" "Holy Mother Church" maintains, funds and [we have to assume] condones an all-male, mostly gay, hegemony over the rest of the church.  Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmeri, an official at the Inquisition and host in his Roman salon of naked male sex orgies, apparently hasn't gotten "the memo" about just which sexual practices to encourage.  Hey Brooks, is this another example of your "behind closed doors" regime?
McCain is going to die. Today would not be too soon for me. He is an evil man. Teddy Kennedy is waiting for him.
Have you listened to Tim Farron? The man is an imbecile.
Whats disrespectful is Bill's behavior.  He was a married man.  That makes him a cheater..  While acting POTUS, disgusting.  No way in HELL can a blow job in the Oral Office be neutered.  However show biz people are known for multi sex. opposite sec, homo sex, cheating sex and divorcing and getting married again.  NO ONE in show biz is expected to behave civily.  They are professional LIARS for their lifeschoice work.  How honorable is that?  And why shouldn't  Bill stay married to Hillary?  He knows he can cheat all he wants.  And Trumps marriage will remain in tact. Guaranteed.  You give me a time and a number, I'll take your bet.  And I don't gamble.
Mr Mbalula. You are the Minister of Police. When can we expect your corrupt colleagues to be prosecuted? I believe charges have been filed. So stop pretending to care and take action. Your words are meaningless hypocritical drivel until you do. Oh, and please refrain from commenting on economic concepts. When did you ever run a business? When did you ever contribute a single cent to our GDP? You clearly think only of taking from the people who do to give their hard earned income to your buddies and voters...and then you call it redistribution. Is this form of organised theft to buy you votes really the only policy you can offer? Maybe you think your black colleagues are simply too useless to compete in an open capitalist economy ? If I was one of the many highly competent black businessmen and women in this country I would be quite offended by you.
racism. Gotta undo what the black man built!
yup, I agree.   I have been in a social circle with someone who was released from his vows as a Benedictine brother for alleged abuse.  the monastery settled without a court case, so not sure if the man is guilty or not.   the man is elderly now, a very pleasant gentleman and friendly.  I am wondering just how far I can be  friends to him.   it is a difficult situation to find myself in.   I would hate to exclude a lonely person from friendship, but if he truly did abuse these early teens, it would be so difficult for me because of my history of being abused.   what do you do?    and yes, there are many very talented persons who were/are sexual predators:   Roman Polanski that so many of the glitterati love to give a free pass, the English artist Eric Gill who sexually abused his children, Woody Allen and his daughter, etc, etc.
Trump ridiculous and unimaginative, as always." Let scrap this, let scrap that": what a man!
Oh Allan, Oh Allan if this were a "sexual equality issue" then they should kill as many boy fetuses as they kill girl fetuses . you did say " "sexual equality issue", didn't you? . check mate your move
Irrelevant Rightonleft.....I matters not if all people are nicey nice....what matters is that cultural values are different and that will always drive a wedge between even normal people.  When woman in Europe are accosted by muslim men for merely walking ahead of their spouse, things are bad.  I don't believe those muslim men would behead anyone, but the fact that they take it upon themselves to 'police' others around them to their stoneage standards should scare everyone.  We are not immune here.....
This MOTHER of 2 young men, who he has chosen to blatantly and shamelessly discriminate against would not and most certainly will not ever vote for this joke of a PM EVER.  If you think women are fawning over him because of his ridiculous targets, you are seriously mistaken.
Oooh found the white guy who hates chicks and brown guys.
I don't CARE WHAT RACE this dingbat is. Anyone who heard her ridiculous rant of "Reclaiming my time!" will be convinced she has egg salad in her brain. I just could NOT believe when I heard the audio of this on the Hannity radio show. I thought the show was playing some kind of joke by playing the recording over and over, but then I realized SHE was speaking "Reclaiming my time!" over and over. I looked this up: 14 times in two minutes. Is this how "strong" smart women are supposed to argue back with a man? That's 42 words she wasted. She sounded like a total idiot. I kept thinking, "SAY SOMETHING MEANINGFUL ALREADY!" A three-year-old could have argued back better. You don't show your strength or intelligence by yelling "Reclaiming my time!" over and over. Someone should have put a sock in her mouth after the third repeat. Go ahead, google it. Maxine Waters needs to step down. She's lost her marbles.
I don't particularly care if Margaret Sanger was a racist, spoke a KKK rallies, and ate black babies. I do think abortion should be an option to women in almost every circumstance. I also think women AND men should be responsible for preventing unwanted pregnancies. In this day and age, unwanted pregnancies can pretty much be avoided. Fund Planned Parenthood!
Will you people stop! It's a goddamned job - get over it. This circle jerk of cuddle this , and fondle that because a women did it - is for wimps.  Business is about eating what you kill. I sold 40 million in services one year. So what? You start the next year at zippo.... You do a great job - you go for a beer, have a laugh - move on Leave the circle jerk for teenage boys
The photo for the medical show has a female health care professional earnestly guiding a female medical student wearing head cover.  It looks like the show is boldly going where no politically correct show has gone since...  ... Little Mosque on the Prairie.  But am I correct to assume that they cast a white man as the moron who tore all his fingers off while drunkenly snowmobiling or something?
These East European males who persecute gays are morally odious and that includes Putin. The way that guy struts around playing macho man is nauseating.  Anyway, it's great of Canada to make this gesture towards people who are horribly oppressed.
You're a funny guy, Debbiedowner.  When did a person with a third grade education at best become qualified to criticize an accomplished woman of letters?   Answer: never, until the Trumpnuts found their idiotic "voice."
Blankman, like it or not- He has MALE genitals!  This is sports- it is a track meet not a social statement.  If you want, have    everyone    run     together.
you are hating on Amy like she is a feral cat owner. what she said was what was already being said in the media, so bfd. so many lame cowards who lost to trump and can't attack him so they go for soft target like Amy.  you live and breed hate for all Caucasians  christians and especially white males.
In light of the election of Thatcher, we can safely conclude that English men are not as biased or chauvinistic as the american male, who is rightfully subject to generalization and ridicule.  If only white males in "murika" were not all cap wearing truck driving stereotypes.
I can't help but wonder your opinion on the sort of art that Carroll Dunham, Lena's father, paints. Just butts and vag from behind, big boobies, no faces. Is this male gaze acceptable because he yelled "feminism!" before painting a woman with a gun stuck up her anus and vulva exposed?   I guess I'm just wondering why battle history when the present contains the same.   https://www.google.com/search?q=lena+dunham%27s+dads+art&biw=1252&bih=602&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjvtsPbnqLSAhULxmMKHVlCCVsQsAQIHA#imgrc=U8vpK6XebwdxOM:
You are calling the widow of a man killed in action defending America a liar? Why should I believe you?   You support Trump who is a draft dodging coward, so you must not k ow what you are talking about, right?
Being a homosexual is not a behavior, agreed.  I do not feel that particular affliction is a choice.  Alcoholism is not a choice.  Drinking alcohol IS a choice.  Engaging in homosexual behavior IS a choice.  The homosexual act IS a behavior.  The heterosexual act IS a behavior; a natural one, and within the confines of a marriage, which is a union between one man and one woman, perfectly valid.  Outside of a marriage the sex act is sinful.  The homosexual act is not just an adulterous sin, it is a sin against nature.  To support “gay marriage” is to support those sins.
And by fighting for the rights of gay men to join and stay in the RCC priesthood, under a cover of public secrecy about their orientation, you too are encouraging this child abuse to continue.  That too is a form of shielding.   The Church is wrong to encourage it, the priests are wrong to participate in it, and both progressive and trad laity should be against it.   It's a policy that serves no one but the abusive priest.
Your racist bigotry against all religions except christian and all government except pure conservative Republican no matter the topic spews forth again.  Obama is to blame for everything being a black man daring to hold the highest office in the land.  If only more Bush, Trump, Cruz, ad nauseum were in charge, the nation would be just hunky dory.  Stupid.
Remember when that sad palooka of a young cop was crucified mercilessly in the progressive press for innocently telling young women at York U that they could avoid sexual assault by not dressing "like sluts"? What followed was the usual strident outrage from fem commandos programmed to "stick it to the man" by clamoring that women can self-objectify all they like, and men had just better suck up and mind their P's & Q's.  Ms Wente's sobering piece here suggests that when one woman sells out the sistas by dishing out cheap sex as per tenets of s&m [social media] "culture," it's the entire pool that gets tainted by another degree of commodification.  You won't read politically incorrect talk like this at The Atlantic, WP, Times, the CBC, Bit*h Mag or among LGBT hardliners at the Globe. It's double-down time there as Atwood groupies mouth platitudes about the "liberating solitude" of the golden years. As for men, our victories of the flesh are Pyrrhic ones. What a messed up time.
Art do you only speak in projections and straw men?  My god you're a cranky old nut bag.
SHUT DOWN THIS USELESS GOVERNMENT... THAT INCLUDES THAT PANTY-WASTE WALKER AND HIS PIVOT MAN!
I am so tired of this drivel comparing O'Leary to Trump. No fan of O'Leary's and he would be half the PM that we currently have, but he's also no Trump. He is not misogynist, he is not racist, he will provide no platform for the alt-right. These comparisons are flat out unfair to the man.
Needless to say (but I'm saying it anyway), it's rank hypocrisy and bigotry to affect to deny gay men admittance to the priesthood.  Come on.
you are ignorant of women's issues.  I hope your dog doesn't think too highly of you, he'd be disappointed/"May I be as good a person as my dog thinks I am"  Get over myself over what exactly?  Having an opinion.   Reading and understanding a fricking sentence differently than thou?  AND?  I AM as cute as grasshoppers.  You're NOT  l2g.  It's men like you......................................................................................................................................................
trump is scary stupid, scary ignorant, scary uneducated and scary crude.  he must really be a very insecure man... like hitler.  churchhill had his eye on hitler and the natzi party for a long time. he knew that the natzi's plan to take down england would be a goal of germany.  he really worked FDR to join and send relief.  england was broke.  the american people weren't so aware of hitler, but FDR was....an anti german move would be hard to sell as there were so many GERMAN IMMIGRANTS (how dare them emigrate here!) in the states.  how many of you all have german blood in your ethnicity?  i have some. i'm the descendant of a dirty german  immigrant! and a scottish one, and an irish one, and an english one and a danish one and some indian blood from a canadian tribe.  wonder what the donald's lineage is?
Not breasts, moobs or man boobs. They get them during manopause.
' Trump is a belligerent buffoon and a con man.  It's those characteristics which are most attractive to many of his followers. .
Toronto's  media and  politicians have no idea, nor do they care how angry the men of the Gay Community of Toronto  really are. I can't even call it LGBT  anymore.  The men have been thrown under  the political bus yet again  and Tory thinks  we still have much to celebrate.  We have every reason to say FUQUE U
"In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest, most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied." Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  It has been proven by research, studies, and law enforcement stats that white men are at the top of the list for child rape and child sex killings. White men also commit the most heinous crimes of any group in the country, serial killings being at the top, studies show.  Need more kool-aid?
Dennis, One of the most blatant hurts accorded to many men and women was when Benedict opened the door for married clergy of the Anglican Communion to come into the Catholic Church as priests. God only knows how hurtful that was to many men and women. To sit there in church while an Anglican said Mass with his wife and kids in the pews while, in many cases, a catholic priest sat in the same church and wasn't even allowed to take communion.  Someone is on here demanding to know when Benny or JPII ever changed Church teaching. Well there's a big, fat, juicy one right there. He changed it at a whim, opening the door for every homophobic, misogynistic, reactionary right wing cleric who felt that their own church wasn't hating homosexuals and women enough.  On the upside, Benny showed that you can change anything and 2000 years of tradition can be dropped like hot cakes, and I hope that Francis makes full use of the precedent set by him.
Laughing. You think you are destroying me with reality.  Your video required someone else to do the thinking for you and then you attempted to label me a racist(or just as dumb as one) all the while attempting to make the not-nazis look bad when they were being beaten by nazis.  Again, keep those goalposts on wheels you are going to need them as much as you are wheeling them around.  You can call me a racist or stupid as one, but I am the one that is calling names? You assume I am a white male and yet I am the one calling names and judging.  Man, you need to stay away from mirrors.  Tell us more about how mean those people were to the nazis. Tell us how mean they were to people who's stated goal is the death of large swaths of the American public.  Oh wait, you won't. You will just ignore all this, pick one thing then attempt to vilify me on it. The only thing worse than right wing hate, is right wing haters and the completely predictable patterns they do when posting.
Men commenting unhelpfully, rather than being inspired to search our hearts at what we can do differently. We as men need to question why we are so comfortable implicitly supporting patriarchy. Time to take another lesson from a (male) leader: Megatron: "A truce is called. All I ever wanted was to be in charge again...besides, who would you be without me, Prime?" Optimus Prime [closes mouthplate]: "Time to find out!" and proceeds to rip his head and spine out...  When will we men rip the head and spine of patriarchy out, when we are the only ones who can kill the beast we created and sustain?
Who elected this Bill and Hillary Clinton style crook?  Why can't we find a leader like Donald Trump here in Canada but instead have to put up with this little Tru.dope child.  We need a REAL leader, someone other than the three assholes leaders of our regular parties. We need s campaign to DRAIN  THE  RIDEAU-TRUDEAU SWAMP.  If Canadians can''t understand how Trudeau can be so screwed up in the head they need look not further than his mentor and good friend the Globalist George Soros, the most evil man on Earth
"That still does not mean than today someone from a country or culture who believes that a woman's testimony is only worth half that of a man, or that believes that female genital castration is just part of Sharia Law or that Allah demands the death of all Infidels should not be looked at most carefully prior to being allowed entry into the US. Religious bigots need to be ID'd and excluded." Motley  This is what I was meaning to reply to Motley.    Civil sometimes organizes the conversation in very strange ways.   (That's my story and I'm sticking with it!   lol)
I was a Denver Bronco fan since the first day they stepped on the field for the first time. I was born an raised in Colorado, but even after moving to Michigan after 47 years I had remained a Broncos fan. I am so disappointed in the Broncos, Hickenloopers and other fools hypocritical comments claiming it is wrong for Trump to mix sports and politics... what the heck do you think these moronic players and the NFL are doing. What is wrong is for these over-paid self centered idiots to show disrespect to a flag and country many fellow servicemen and women have fought and died for, in protest of a completely unrelated issue. I will not watch another NFL game. From now on it is college football only, Wolverines, Buffs, Rams, and Spartans. I will not show respect nor loyalty to an organization that fails to show respect to the country I spent 20 years in the Army defending.
LOL  Never heard of male masturbatory toys, hmmm? May be why you're so uptight.
It is feminism that has campaigned for laws that hold men financially responsible for children they never created. And to try and say our society, where the deck is so heavily stacked against men, is misogynist is frankly ridiculous.
Every Muslim headscarf you see states "I am not one with you. I reject your culture and your people. I expect you to accept me, but I do not accept you."  Why do only the Muslim women wear these clothing that show separation? Why not the Muslim men?  This is the same story in every country that has Muslims. They do not integrate. The women are inferior, their clothing keeps them in place. They multiple at an extreme rate, most marry their first cousins, resulting in real problems with their children.  May Geert Wilders succeed.
What a stupid column. Lots of people , men or women would want to be Trump Sec of State to have  power prestige and influence on the world stage.  Really?? It escapes you why?
Women also want cheap frequent free sex.  Until they get serious about settling down, that is.  Then, good luck to them.  Because there are always other women who will continue to want cheap frequent free sex.  Lots of women also like porn too.  And sext. And make homemade porn.  Don't fool yourself.   Women are just as guilty as men in this modern world of ours.
yet you use the very "construct" you decry to justify your position. unless of course you admit that your argument is irrational. as for "hurtful", better check your feelings at your front door. you or i dont have any right to have your feelings protected. if we did, i would call you out for your offensive comment.  as for the "heterosexual males" , thats just sexist and ignorant.
Isn't it amazing that for a man and wife team with so many ideas about what the party ought to be doing, they don't want to get their hands dirty trying to do it. They expect other to do the heavy lifting and take the fall on their behalf. But they would certainly take the credit if it works.  They are parasites.
It didn't mention anything about the ageing of the men in the country and the loss of so many young to wars and other stupidity. Maybe it's the new low cut jeans so Levi manufacturers can save material and charge more for Relaxed Fit and so having to wear them around the waist tightens the crotch and beer bellies don't help. Maybe it's why there are getting to be so many trans genders, who knows but the birth rate causing more women to be born then men will show up in the evolution of politics in the country and in the military.
You set up your straw men. You knock down your straw men. What a bunch of ideological hogwash. Nobody is impressed.
Do we question why white judges in the South for years threw black men in  jail with no evidence or sense of equitable punishment?  I do AGREE that we all carry bias and that includes judges.   And if bias is inescapable, and it is, then maybe we just have to work from the assumption that bias is going to show up in human behavior regardless.   I also see positive bias (which matches mine of course  lol).  A bias to love children is not common to all.  A bias for financial safety is a reaction to our more primitive instinct for self preservation* *cavemen didn't build up IRA's.     In a diverse society that requires cooperation, is a bias to one's own tribe going to damage the social structure and potential strength of the community?    If religious bias leads to charity, empathy, compassion, I'm OK.  If religious bias is toward killing non believers, I have a problem  Maybe the best we can do is recognize our bias consciously and deal with it.
Yeah: hire a trash man who can't write.
This hag is out today saying that she lost because men told their wives to vote for Trump.  You just can't make up this amount of craziness.
BOOKS White People Commit the Most Heinous Crimes, So Why Is America Terrified of Black Men?  The new book "Suspicion Nation" addresses the Trayvon Martin injustice and why we keep repeating it. Lisa Bloom, 2014  Bigots read this book if you dare.
Ms. Landry, I PRAY that you read this comment.    If YOU have  ANY Brains at all,  YOU  should  RUN away, not walk away from this IDIOT Mr. Gannon.   Your addiction or connection to him is probably that he was your first guy to have Intercourse with, or, he has you addicted to drugs.  Either way, RUN Away, STAY Away,  from this Horrible relationship.........YOU have reached the BOTTOM of the Hole.
As inept as the current government has been on the file, you can be sure the gentleman from Wallonia is doing very well politically in his own little back yard. Being the big man standing up to everyone else on over this issue (that the entire rest of the EU is fine with).  Very cheap but effective local politics to create an external enemy that you can rally all your folks against.   Can't say I think much of any of our ministers near tears over some negotiations. If she wants to be in the big game it might be time to put on the adult pants.
Yeah, those Discovery shows are so much crap. What a waste, but what isn't nowadays on TV. Hollywood is doing its best to socially re-engineer and indoctrinate the stupid sheep to better control them and lead them around by the nose. I've never seen so many women put in commanding positions and trying to turn men into irrelevant in-subordinates. Way beyond reality. I'm not trying to put women down but just pointing out what's on Hollywood's and the media's agenda. You gotta admit---It's true!
Straw man is what folks who have no argument claim.If you read all posts you will see that Mike Casola quoted a poll by Rasmussen. Trumpsters should not quote polls since they've told us over and over that polls are phony. So my straw man just became the tin man, funny huh. As far as religions that don't honor our flag, that is not a straw man since we are talking about folks not honoring our flag. Do you think a religious conviction is a better excuse than a moral conviction. Again no straw man. So our white society over all thinks if your a white church goer you can sit but if your a black athlete you have no right to voice a moral concern by doing the same
what reality do you live in lefty? , there is NO SUCH thing as free health care, man you lunatics have not even the basic understandings to begin to lecture anyone! ..
Man,  he should've just killed 12 people at a movie theater... looks like he would've had better luck
Because Trudeau is a traitor himself! So of course he would side with this man....just look where he comes from...
The sad thing is only muslims are terrorists.  A white guy who walks into a Walmart and kills 3 people isn't a terrorist just another blue light special.  Except for the terrorized people we have today as a result of shootings in schools, movie theaters, malls, at work, at a night club, concerts.  Selfish white boys with their selfish toys.  The 2nd amendment is deadly.  Since 911 more us men murdered their exes than soldiers have died in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I want the White House and Congress and State Houses and courts across the nation all open carry.  Stop hiding NRA supporters behind metal detectors or do only politicians lives matter?
you sound like a pussy cat, afraid, be a man or a woman.  you like to criticize others but you are afraid the those people wlll come after you.  you if are a scared cat, then don't attack other people personally.  where is the cajones.  lol.
You don't want them in your base? You wouldn't be in power without their support. Maybe you people should have thought this through before you decided and committed to collude with deplorable oligarchs, criminals, psychopaths, fascists and neo-Nazis, and mil-spec PsyOps operators like Mercer's Cambridge Analytica in a conspiracy to brainwash and mislead like pied pipers so many child-like men in this brazen attack upon and subversion of our liberal democracy. You're part of this, Gardner. Every Republican and every Neo-Liberal operator is a part of this corruption. (note: I -will- continue reposting this ALL DAY LONG and expand my efforts if someone wrongfully censors this a second time. Go ahead, make my day.)
Unless there is a specific dress code, the woman is allowed to dress in an attractive way without being accused of being a slut.   I didn't think you were religious Out?   Yet your personal values align with the 'moral' of Adam and Eve  that often comes out with EVE being the temptress.  Women are the cause of the fall of 'man' into sinfulness.  Oh my.   It's cultural/human mythology that reflects the cultural values of times, not historical fact.       How about the woman tempting men outside of her home?   How about Lot offering his daughter to the angry crowd so they wouldn't rape his male guest?   (it gets worse) Women fair very poorly in the old testament which has everything to do with assignment of power only to men.    Religious law was created to serve human hierarchies, not a direct line to a universal God.  It is interesting how religious mythology, (and what I used to think were common sense sayings), become part of our social conscious even for those who are non-religious.
I have not seen any hard number comparison between boys expelled versus girls raped.   I'd expect that they skew away from the boys.  And how difficult is it to enroll in a new school compared to living a life post rape after the guy gets away with no charges?
The sad thing is only muslims are terrorists. A white guy who walks into a Walmart and kills 3 people isn't a terrorist just another blue light special.

To bad the trumptards aren't bright enough to understand what this bankruptcy lawyer scum that Trump picked straight from the swamp will mean for the US.  Be prepared for an escalation of the unending violence in the Middle East and more propaganda about our military men and women bravely fighting for, and dying for our freedom. It's been many, many years since any US military personnel died fighting for our freedom. Make sure your children, and grandchildren understand when they're sent off to fight and die in foreign lands they're not fighting and dying for our freedom; they're fighting and dying for your stupidity.  Trumptards, I wish you were bright enough to understand just how badly you've been trump'd, and that your collective stupidity will see us all trump'd.
Mr. Earth, So if your-ex girlfriend -wife or date didn't like the way your relationship turned out, that you (the male) should be penalized or terminated in your job? Do you know how crazy that sounds? Do you know that Carl is in fact a scumbag? Do you believe, if a woman posts negative comments on social media regarding a previous intimate relationship (where the guy wanted weird stuff), that the man she dated should lose his job? What about women's conduct?
Uh... so? Is that the victims' fault? Are you blaming white male victims for sharing the race of this who usually assault them?
Arab- & Mislim-killer POTUS's  Bush & Obama were cool with you..wow man!
His friend beat the Delaware criminal justice system.... murder charges dropped and he was set free. Now he's trying to help his friend using same concept, poor black man. He is stupid..... made comment to media that when Smith was arrested for assault, made him cut his hair after that incident, BUT on the night of the shooting he had his dreads intact, that was one of the IDing charateristics. If cut his hair after, shooting makes his friend a co-conspriter.
Yeah, that's right.  Black, classy President Barack Obama turned the nation against each other because he was  born a black man and managed to pull himself up  by his left wing boot straps and caused the wrong-wingers to stand and spin on their head.  There's no changing President Barack Obama's skin color, his eight year presidential legacy, or the FACTS that he's a well educated constitutional lawyer who just so happened to win the Nobel Peace Prize.  What've any of you naysayer wrong-wingers ever done in your pathetic lives?
Where this notion of White Privilege goes off the rails and moves into dangerous terrain is when it is used as an excuse to introduce the fix for the new lament of the socialist for "equity". This smacks of a return to failed communist attempts to artificially level some playing field according to a do-gooder's whim. This usually causes more problems for both the recipient who is maligned and those who are made the new discriminated class.  The very notion of the phrase white privilege stifles all debate and to challenge the notion makes one a defacto bigot. The newest members of the white privilege club now include Asians so take that for what it is worth. Pretty much anyone who excels in school better look out. The fact that white males are doing comparatively poorly compared to other groups academically will not be examined at all. The fact that adult white males make up the highest group to die by suicide? White Privilege
Perhaps those black men should get off "the streets" and into school, or work or church.  Hanging out in gangs on corners late at night doesn't do anyone any good.
"Not color, not gender identity-but" white maleness "only." TIFTFY
tell that to all the men who served and died in wars to give you the right to spout your nonsense
Maybe America should issue a travel ban on white men given their proclivity for mass shootings?
This woman is losing it.  She embodies the hysterical female stereotype.  If you wanted proof that men and women aren't the same, I present to you exhibit A -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.
"I am concerned that, whether they are conscious of it or not, the white men who would vote for Trump have never fully accepted women and people of color as equals..."  Not only these, but also LGBT folks and Jews, two other groups many of these white supremacist types hate.
As a right leaning independent who generally supports Trump's policies of tough borders, and less regulation I still find it fascinating that anyone can support this orange shit stain currently occupying the White House embarrassing our country everyday acting like a child. Pence and the cabinet need to explore invoking the 25th amendment and removing this man, who is clearly mentally ill, from the job and getting Pence in there to implement right leaning policies and get us away from everything Obama. Other than simply being extremely unfit for the job, my biggest issue with Trump is that he has no legislative accomplishments because he keeps getting in his own way at a time when the country and the government is perfectly primed to turn right. I think Pence would have a relative free ride as the vast majority of the nation would just be so happy to be rid of this moron Trump they wouldn't care what Pence was doing.
Yes it is. Just like he today is pandering to those same people by blatantly lying about saving the Ford factory in Kentucky. I think the man is fed crap sandwiches and that is what he excretes back for consumption by his devoted followers. Good god the man is not even in office yet and he is just in your face lying because he knows that is all his followers will ever hear in their right wing/fake news information news bubbles. Scary stuff that the president elect either doesn't know the truth or that he knows but spews out the lies about that know truth for political gain anyway. Strange new world we've entered here Mr. Brew.
NOTHING to do with being a nurse... More to do with being a female perv. Despite the fact that men are usually the one's maligned as 'perverts', women can be just as bad and oftentimes far worse.
Lol ***** grabber really fires you up hey. I assume you've never spent time in an auto body shop, construction site, oil rig, poker game, night out with the boys lol. If I was getting recorded that line would be the least of my worries hahaha. Next what racism. The only remote form of racism I've heard was wanting to kick out illegal immigrants that happen to be mostly Mexican. I don't see any issue with that as they are in fact illegal, end of story.  Next what ignorance to scientific fact. Man made climate change is no scientific fact. Climate change most certainly is. I'm certain that long before man our earths climate changed  like it does today. Would you have claimed people were ignorant that were opposed to the barbaric medical practices of the past? Questioning everything is how we continue to learn. It's ignorant to think that we know everything and that scientific "facts" can't change as we become more intelligent. I'd say prude and a bonehead.
Well, in that case white men are an invasive species in this country and nearly destroyed the native population.
motley:  There is NO question HE is an OLD FOOL, and OLD Druggie.    In his mind, HE is supplying a 25 year old woman with METH, and getting that young woman Bang Job, just what ALL of us OLD guys fantasize about, right????   Both these people need Drug Intervention and Mental Illness Intervention.
The only place I can speak to first hand is Paris. I go relatively often, and there isn't one part of it that is unsafe to walk in by male or female, day or evening. My last trip, some time after that Fox News apology, I stayed in a hotel on the edge of one of the supposed 'no-go zones.' No problem whatsoever. Those articles are alarmist crap, written by a professional anti-muslim propagandist, in one case.
that's your opinion. I'm perfectly content with developing morals with the rest of the world. (That's ACTUALLY how morals come into being, not by reading  a book written by superstitious men). It is us that has to live by them so we should have a say in what they are. Until you can prove this "final arbiter" EVEN EXISTS, stop talking such ridiculous nonsense. Your god of the bible is the LAST thing one would go to, to find morals. Firstly, morals cannot be DICTATED. If they are, they aren't morals, they are commands. Much like when you tell your dog to get off the couch. You're the dog, god the "master". Sorry, I'll gladly tell that god to go screw himself because all his murdering, genocidal, abusing bully ways in no way indicate any MORALITY I want to be a part of
The all white male photo is priceless. Guess we know who knows best now don't we.
White male Anti-Globalists peacefully marching = Bad. Violent masked Globalist crypto-fascists throwing bricks = Good. Shut up slaves, MSM
Really? Is DM the new Huffington Post? First white men don't deserve to vote, now all men are trash. Even Guptaleaks is more interesting reading material.
I agree with the writer's assessment of the sad state of current affairs.  Politics is a bloodsport.  Alaska Governor Bill Walker won with the support of the general population. He promoted a fiscal plan that fairly spread the pain of the fiscal crisis.  He wrote it in pencil. He solicited input.  He marched it around the state.  He got broad public support.  The cornerstone of his plan is fairness.  I know this first hand; I spoke to him about it myself.  Then, the Body, which created the fiscal mess, comes back with SB128- putting the fiscal burden on every man, woman, and CHILD in the state. PFD reform is not a good stand alone answer. The public will not abide a PFD raid; perceived or real!  To make matters worse, the Governor applauds the enemy when he needs to go right back for support to his strongest constituency, the general public and demand a better fiscal plan.  This constitutes a sad political strategy to shift the blame from the GOP, to the governor.  Paybacks are a bitch
It's 2017.  So how can people still come up with names like AlaskaMAN Extreme Triathlon?  How sexist, and clueless towards sexism.  Dumb.  Why not Alaska Extreme Triathlon?  Drop the"man" and drop the offense to women.
The headline for this piece could as easily read "Misogyny linked to definition of masculinity" Traditional masculinity derides most feminine attributes. "Runs like a girl" "Cries like a girl" "he's so effeminate" "she must be on her period" "that's women's work" "a woman's place is _____".  Was it some time in the 70's that we saw the emergence of the new, sensitive man - the man who helped with house work and allowed his sons to cry, or not play football, or pursue ballet?  I think that gay boys and gay men have a much harder time than gay women because of their perceived feminine behaviours. No one cares so much about me wearing jeans and being able to use a skill saw as they do about the meticulously groomed young man with soft hands and an elegant walk who adores ballet....
You must be female?  Real men don't "giggle."
https://youtu.be/aiD_lGRkSmU  I surmised that Charles was a black man (actually, he mentions it from time to time), but the rest I was unaware of.  Guess you know him better than I do.   You sure answered my question regarding civil discourse, though.  Boy, howdy!  I couldn't get ttthe link to go, either, but never mind.  The Polite Chipmunks you ain't!
Can we assume you are wholeheartedly for lesbian relationships since "sodomy" is non-existent in their lovemaking?  Also, are you even aware many gay men are not interested in "sodomy"?  Drawing conclusions are what is or is not morally acceptable sexual behaviour based on "plumbing" materials is nuts.
On the other hand, about 40% (the universal proportion) of those boys will be gay or bisexual, therefore mostly interested in each other.
Seems to me that the largest cause of abuse -- sexual, drugs, etc. -- are heterosexual males. Of the many thousands of rapes and sexual assaults, how many are female perps? Ditto drugs, war crimes, etc. So it makes sense to me that we should immediately ban all straight men.
There is a special club of hypocrites whose members include J. Edgar Hoover, and Ted Haggard (to name a couple out of many). Milo Yiannopoulos is part. Can you spot the link?  All are, or were, active homosexuals who spoke out against homosexuality. J. Edgar Hoover had Clyde Tolson. Married Rev. Ted Haggard had sex with men. Milo Yiannopoulos thinks same-sex marriage is wrong, and wishes that homosexuals would go back in the closet (while loudly proclaiming he's not a white supremacist for reasons I'll let you inquisitive readers discover).  Remember the racist skinhead, Nicky Crane? Nicky Crane performed in gay pornographic videos and died of AIDS. There's Ambrose St John and John Henry Newman (a poignant finish to their secret life together was revealed when the Vatican tried to separate their remains--buried together in the same grave--for Newman's beatification. The coffins had decomposed, and their bodies had finally mingled).  Milo's hypocritical, tawdry dragface is irredeemable.
Ducksoup:  I agree with you about Japan but you are forgetting that Japan does not have the populations of black men and women, white men and women  or any men or woman  that have PTSD, mexican men, latino men, Huge numbers  of Mentally Ill etc.  ALL High Crime folks...
Get a grip boys, this isn't therapy, suck it up. I also was wounded by a hmmm-like myth re 20 words for snow - a "man," paid for his life/him to grad school, he had affairs (now don't assume; daily/good at home), child support infrequent, he's still $$$$ in arrears, no $ to OUR child at university - the point is some people are just con artists/assholes, always. We move on and hope...
How sad that we have a president who tops that category of sick men.
The man is an embarrassing danger to the nation. The world faces four years of rudderless stupidity from Washington.
Enough of your pot stirring Kiszla.  I am taking a knee when it comes to your articles from now until the day I die.  Have you ever met Kaepernick outside of football?  I have.  The man is an imbecile and treats people outside his little circle like dirt.  I've witnessed it first hand on several occasions.  You call it "blackballed".  I call it "the talent doesn't justify the circus."
Why do Muslim men not have to cover their heads? Why are there no female priests in Catholicism? Why can women not pray at the wailing wall in Jerusalem?  Most religions are not unisex.
At least those who remain vigilant and value their home won't get their heads chopped off and put on display :) I'm good with that. How about you? You go ahead and invite into your home some radical Islam men and see how well that goes for you. Let me know. I'm doing an article on it. Wait, you won't be able to since after being raped and beaten, by Sharia law, they can then kill you. Have fun with that.
This is a form of child abuse, no matter which way you slice it.  This continued assault against men, particularly straight men, in our society is further proof of the socialist liberal globalist agenda.   Kathleen Wynne is in full-court press lesbian stage of eradicating men (fathers).  First by teaching trans and multi-gender lunacy to young children in our schools and then by threatening to remove your children if you don't allow them to be the transgender that they've been indoctrinated into believing they are under Bill 89 which all three parties in Ontario support 100%.  If we don't act soon to take back control of our lives from liberal lunatics, there will be no turning back.
"These "white men" you speak of seem to have very limited experience of anyone other than themselves."  I agree! Not to mention that they seem to fear the "decision-making" that may "be different based on their experiences with women and Jewish people".  What the heck would be wrong with that? We need input from all our citizens, yes, including straight white males, but not only straight white males as if they were the only ones whose "decision-making" was valid or of worth!  This is a very narrow-minded way of looking at the vast diversity of the people of the United States, a country that is great because of it's diversity, not in spite of it!
Rodney King jeopardized others when he was driving drunk but in fact the only person harmed was King himself when Officers Powell and Koon beat him before witnesses. I assume Find Truth did not use "like a wealthy black man/woman" since even wealthy black Americans are frequently treated like social inferiors by racists whites who are unfamiliar with their celebrity status. All the prominent African-Americans you mention have spoken and written about their experiences of racism in the U.S. Your claim that the experiences of white celebrities are the same as the experiences of Black celebrities, therefore, is entirely specious.
Please stop the euphemisms. The man is delusional and probably sick!
Nor do they mention the b j in chief BILLY..nor mention the criminal foundation they run...ask the people of Haiti how much they adore them... The criminals that they are. Hillary stands by her men...bill and Harvey till... And Obama. Send me your sick send me your poor...send me your daughter...LOL.  And they did!  Sick, stick with the sickos
Well Skeexix, in case you didn't know, CD is a black man that hates white people, white privilege, white power, white government and white leaders.  If you're white, he probably hates you too.  I, personally, hate racists of all breeds, especially white supremacists.  But seriously dude, have you ever heard CD EVER say ANYTHING positive about white folk?  Not gonna happen, he's prejudiced.  (also I'm a dinosaur and can't read http/youtu.be/etc., what does that mean?)
Trump himself has acknowledged what he did.  If Obama discussing flexibility (a stupid thing to say but not a spillage of the most highly classified intel). is all you've got, then you've just confirmed that you cannot defend this man on his merits.  I stand by what I said.  This is a political personality cult.
They will protest Trump but allow a Muslim man to kill his wife, daughters, sisters because they are women whiteout batting a eyelash.  Beating and killing women and children is not our way or is it compatible with our culture, our laws, nor our morals.  Subjugating women to wearing coverings, silence, and making them walk 15 feet behind the man is OK??  Yet you walk with a PU$$Y Hat?  Then a Muslim terrorist kills a bunch of people in a shopping mall and we are racists.  The Female and Male Left are really sick and weird people. You lost yet you refuse to obey democracy. Obama and Clinton killed millions and you do nothing.  Explain how you can stand back and do nothing about that?  Good luck explaining your hypocrisy
I see on the Twitter summaries, Ms. Rampell has discovered H. L Mencken.  Here is one of his other quotes:  "I admit freely enough that, by careful breeding, supervision of environment and education, extending over many generations, it might be possible to make an appreciable improvement in the stock of the American negro, for example, but I must maintain that this enterprise would be a ridiculous waste of energy, for there is a high-caste white stock ready at hand, and it is inconceivable that the negro stock, however carefully it might be nurtured, could ever even remotely approach it. The educated negro of today is a failure, not because he meets insuperable difficulties in life, but because he is a negro. He is, in brief, a low-caste man, to the manner born, and he will remain inert and inefficient until fifty generations of him have lived in civilization. And even then, the superior white race will be fifty generations ahead of him."
For most of us white males we are normal and other cultures are identity politics. This is of course knowledge. White male is such a powerful identity it assumes it is normal. It is hard to find a better example of identity politics than the Proud Boys, or this comment.
If you have male genitalia then use the boys / men's room.   If you have female genitalia then use the girls / ladies room. Quite simple.  Its been that way for hundreds of years but now a few want to change so that a few can be in touch with their feelings.  Very typical of today's society change our ways for the few minority over the objections of the vast majority.  When my little girl goes into a woman's washroom I do not want a man with a hair on his face going in the door right behind her.
Would the transgendered adult male who now identifies as a prepubescent girl suffer from a psychological disorder in your opinion?
a 45-year-old male student, who dresses as a woman and goes by the name Colleen Francis, undressed and exposed his genitals on several occasions inside the woman’s locker room at Evergreen State College.  Students from nearby Olympia High School as well as children at a local swimming club share locker rooms with the college.  According to a police report, the mother of a 17-year-old girl complained after her daughter saw the transgender individual walking naked in the locker room. A female swim coach confronted the man sprawled out in a sauna exposing himself. She ordered him to leave and called police.  The coach later apologized when she discovered the man was transgendered but explained there were girls using the facility as young as six years old who weren’t used to seeing male genitals.
""""national strategy to prevent gender-based violence"""  Apparatchiks saying that through government strategy they can stop a women from raping a man or vice versa  The end of the Marxist era is coming. This never ending Marxist dogma that government can control how a man or women interacts with their opposite sex is idiotic at best and really really creepy and dangerous at worst.  Government is endlessly trying to control every thing in this country. You can't legislate how a person acts.  Your never ending attempt to take over our souls is shameful
Soulless man.. May you and your soulless  wife burn in hell for what you did to a defenseless child.
Indeed! When my son was young and my husband had a punishing work schedule he was told by the occasional man they would never work as hard as he did because they wanted to spend time with their family. Stupid comments are not only directed at working mothers.  Rude, insecure people toss them at anyone they feel threatened by and do not a social phenomenon make.
"After the Last BIG MISTAKE, I hope we are done for a while." says a black man.
I find it difficult to give the benefit of the doubt to a man who makes bigoted, sexist and ignorant remarks during his campaign.
The Klan thinks Donald Trump is a racist?  Who cares what the Klan thinks, other than bigoted Trump haters?    Hillary Clinton won't use the term "radical Islam" because it "sounds like we are declaring war against a religion."  Hillary Clinton could permanently resettle close to one million Muslim migrants during the first term of her presidency alone, according to the latest available data from the Department of Homeland Security.  With no screening.   Islam teaches that a woman is worth less than a man and that homosexuals deserve the death penalty.  Apparently, that isn't a problem for Jeff and Hillary.  The Klan is Junior Varsity.  ISIL is a major league enemy.
The majority of white folks don't realize that our race relation issues were created by white people for white people. We minorities have had very little say about our public policies in this country. Heck, our 1st black president was followed by the guy that said he wasn't born in America. White folks did build our racist heritage. We have been working on becoming "a more perfect union" ever since the founding of the nation. The 2nd Amendment was necessary to commit ethnic cleansing and building the macro economics of the nation on race based slavery. Murder and rape were part of the business model for the nation. Clearly, Christianity doesn't prevent white racism, rape, or murder. This country is proof. The beauty of white racism is that it allows the average white person to go through life thinking they are innocent while collecting their white privilege. For example, white folks aren't racially profiled. This despite the fact that most mass shooters are loner white men.
Stop dressing and acting provocatively within your male milieu or accept the consequences. Avoid the nightly cocktail parties in which booze and drives are enhanced. This is not a one way street. Sex is the primal drive of primates of both sexes. Civilization is just a veneer over that unsupressable drive.  Tantalize a trout with a fat worm often enough and that trout will become predatory.  Have common sense.
You offered me your support of bigotry. The second great commandment Christ gave us was to love our neighbor. When Christ was asked who his neighbor was, he gave as an example a member of a despised minority. Try reading the parable of the Good Samaritan, substituting "married gay man" for "Samaritan". The hatred that Paprocki has for gays is the opposite of Christ's commandment, so don't tell me "he's following Church teaching". He is perverting Church teaching.  You support him in this perversion, which is why I don't believe you when you say you aren't homophobic. If you actually weren't, you would reject Paprocki and all his works and all his empty promises.  If you respond, I shall ignore you. I have said my piece, and all the whingeing you do won't change the fact that you support bigots in their bigotry.
Donald Trump:  Fake businessman. Fake billionaire. Fake university. Fake husband. Fake father. Fake Christian. Fake American. Fake candidate. And now he wants to be a fake President.
"There’s a phone message we play during workshops that never fails to evoke reaction. It’s the recording of a woman who called our office last fall to express her deep suspicion of Syrian refugees, Muslims and women in head scarves." ~ `` ~ . . . what's with this Overgeneralization of 'Bigotry' based on "a woman who called our office last fall"??  What a pitiful excuse to stir up more s***t -- be sure to drag in others to suck up full sympathy.  Enough Of This Bull..   Would you like to know how many Indignities have been experienced by Women who DO NOT wear head scarves & do not belong to the above groups named -- All Women Experience Indignities, Madam -- ALL..!!  For your edification -- Muslim men can be Exceptionally Ignorant & Rude to 'White, Non-Muslim Women' & that Friend, is drawn from Familial Experience. Obviously a Norm For Muslim Men.  So, Do You Hear White Non-Muslim Women Whining???? Nope!.  Say, how about giving this over-wrought cry-baby whining a Big Fat Rest.. !?  / .
White people like you voted for Trump because you refuse to take responsibility for your actions. You love the white privilege you claim does not exist. Please tell me when white racism stopped effecting public policy in this country? It must have been after 1965. I missed it. It is still good to be a white man in America. You are not racially profiled, even though most cops are killed by white men.
Ha, yes, I see what you did there!  Interesting how when it's a white guy we focus on the individual's circumstances, but let it be a black person or muslim or pacific islander, and it's instantly "all those people . . . "
Those stories about gay sex orgies aren't welcome at NCR.  NCR delights in blaming the Church for what gay priests do, and when referencing stories of abuse, adheres to a policy of gender agnosticism re the victims of these priests.   That is, if these victims are male.
Okay icon, if he really said these things, they reflect badly on him.  Given the intensity of dislike for the man, however, can we trust these recollections?  I just googled the laziness quote and found:   "Laziness is a trait in blacks."  "That line, however, is not directly from Trump. It is found in a 1991 tell-all by a former Trump employee, who alleges in his book that he heard Trump say those words to a black accountant at a Trump-owned establishment, according a 2011 article in the Huffington Post."  When a person does not like another, vindictiveness comes easy.     Thank you for your civil comments and please have a good day.
He's fishing for attention by trying to self deprecate...  Unfortunately, he feels it is his right to deprecate our whole gender, because, because Dave has decided, and Dave knows.  What an arrogant little man.
Oh, come on.  She's got a popular voice and style.  She would have been a hit if she was an orphan.  You're being catty.  She certainly didn't become famous because of her boobs.  "A misogynist is a man who hates women as much as they hate each other." - H.L. Mencken
' …nothing about Trump demonstrates that he might be deserving of any civility.  The man is a belligerent, childish, and ego-maniacal buffoon.  Civility?  Not Trump, …the man is not deserving of any civility.  .
Again, the Catholic Church - and the religious orders therein - are called out for protecting predators... but when will the language be changed to include all forms of abuse by priests and bishops? Confining the problem to sexual abuse leaves the door wide open for a host of other abuses by these men, which often happen to the victims after the reporting is done, or in "stand alone" situations which have nothing to do with sex, but which are equally traumatic for the victims. (Victims of Emotional Abuse by Priests, on Facebook)
The man has serious mental health issues.  There's no 'practicing' that out of him.
No, white males committing mass shooting are almost always connected with some organized violent group including white supremacists, so called men's rights activists who harass women reporting rape, anti-choice on the abortion issue extremists and other hate groups.  The vast majority of them also have a history of domestic violence.
User profile image Timothy Mcmillan4 minutes ago So is Eric senior still eligible for “Father of the Year” if his son’s dead body was found bloated full of weed, xanax, coke and fentanyl? If so, that would be quite an accomplishment for a man who just lost his job because he’s a deviant sexual predator. Way to go Eric Sr.! Hang in there!
Women should never drink because they might get raped. Whereas if a man gets drunk and rapes, well, he's just drunk. Being drunk means you can't consent. She never said yes.
Minister McKenna got called a barbie in a tweet by an outgoing inconsequential MP and she feels that she was "forced" to respond...rather than talk about what she wanted to talk about...what she believes to be an existential threat to the earth.  Margaret Thatcher once said, " power is like being a lady, if you have to tell people you are, you aren't"...she also said.".if you want something said, ask a man, if you want something done, ask a woman"...she also said..." if you want to cut your own throat, don't come to me for a bandage" ..s  Minister McKenna was handed a gift to show she was an influential and powerful woman...and she wasted it by appearing wounded by a fool...does anyone have the slightest thought that Margaret Thatcher would have altered her intended itinerary for the day to be " forced" to respond to being called a " climate barbie"
If we are going to go that far, why not apply a hermeneutic of suspicion to the whole of Scripture? Seems baseless to say "well this stuff was truly in there, but this stuff was changed because, you know, men suck." On what basis do you doubt somethings, but say others are as reported in the narrative. Unless there is a reason, it just seems like speculation in order to make the narrative in line with a contemporary egalitarian point of view.
`There's a little race for governor in Virginia, and human-weasel manimal Ed Gillespie is going full metal racist in his ads. Dems always think that "the media" is somehow the preventive measure for this stuff, that when Republicans "go there" the wise old white men of the editorial pages will write sternly worded editorials denouncing them and it will backfire. It doesn't work that way. Those old white men of the editorial pages are often pretty racist themselves, even if they are offended by "the tone." More than that, they just don't have the power and influence they once did. Working the refs has value, but unlike baseball, there are no rules to this game. We all have to step up and heap scorn on the racists, our scorn is all they deserve.
Doyle puts Trump’s tweets and Brzezinski’s in the same category, although hers were clearly worse. Trump tweet about Brzezinski’s facelift was in poor taste, but he was making the point that she enjoys a lifestyle most Americans could never afford. It was legitimate for him to note the hypocrisy of a woman who would accept the hospitality of a man she claims is a threat to democracy. Brzezinski mocks Trump, not for anything he did himself, but for having small hands. How is this any different from making fun of someone for being black or having Spanish as their mother tongue?
You REALLY need to spend some time doing some research, instead of spitting the kind of vitriol such as you have dispensed here. If you were being raped by a man who was overpowering you, would you prefer the cops use a taser or a gun?
This is about mass murder.  It's not about what a lawyer said on T.V.  You could care less how many people died or were injured. This is your time to shine. It's the liberals fault, right?  I wonder if instead of a old white male mass murderer, have it be a black dude or any color really. I bet you'll stay on subject then because that's your M.O. On display everyday, all day. So much so that you have to be getting paid. That or one extremely motivated useful idiot for the Russians.  When nobody responds to you. You spam the thread. Especially Sid's column. You spam that shamelessly. Well over 40% of 160 comments, probably closer to 50%.  Troll
Chalk one up for the little man.  About time Eugene admitted guilt that their cops are crooked .  Dumb ass.  Now when you ask me how I want my burger cooked I want you to say sir with that, you got that Sharlow?
MEN OF CALGARY: GO GAY! It may be the only thing that will save you life. But in today's heated feminist empire, being gay may not be a defence from an accusation of sexual impropriety.
this guy is an idiot. I'll disclose I'm male. but my wife had continual, high levels of "morning sickness", as did her sisters. You don't have diclectin, they're sick and miserable.  You swallow it and wait the few minutes to digest, and they're normally functioning pregnant moms. The relationship is as straight forward as having a shot of tequila and feeling the buzz in your head 5 odd minutes later. Not sure what this fellow has missed.
I am not so sure Jesus' life was as out of step... as today's hierarchy.  After all, He did not burst on the public scene till age 30.  I thought prior to that, he was a carpenter or handyman.  Since there is no mention that I know of as as to whether he was married, or not, my jury is out on that.  Where he was "out of step" was in his criticism of some of the elders of his own faith.  I don't see that in the Catholic priesthood.  Of course, he was also different in his incredible ability to heal.  One can not expect that of everyone.  As to your third sentence, "I think it boils down to a diluted understanding of what love..."  That expresses what a lot of married laity think is what is lacking in single priests.  I am pleased that you have "the sixties" in quotes as sociological research then, and now, shows that the "sex revolution" occurred in the seventies.  The change for a lot of men was that they began having sex with "the girl next door" instead of prostitutes.
True but some clarification here: this has nothing to do with race or a white person shooting a black man...it was a black cop. So go protest blacks i guess. Or in tulsa, go protest white woman since it was a white woman. The caricature of the yosemite sam white cop attack blacks is just as stupid as the caricature of blacks as  crackheads and thugs...
What revisionist nonsense is this?! Stonewall was mostly a white gay male riot. What is wrong with these people?!
Uma can sure pick um ! Just like she picked Hillary. At one time this pervert was a favorite golden boy to the Clinton"s Weiner is a real scary guy.
All of the power and none of the responsibility. The man is a coward.
So that that very same Liberal government could import loads of Muslim males to keep muslim women barefoot and pregnant and in the kitchen.
Pride has just become a big sex fest and everyone knows it.  Where else can men walk around the street naked? Some family event....
The Leftist-media puts Trump in their typical lose-lose position: Trump must condemn those who they want him to condemn, before the actual assailant's motives have even been commented upon by the local authorities.   The anatomy of that awful day in Charlottesville will likely not be told. There were two distinct evils battling each other: White-racists and Leftists.   All rational people will condemn the man who rammed his car into the crowd, it was a heinous, horrible act. But no less heinous and horrible than the man who shot the Republican Congress people in the park or the man who murdered five Dallas law enforcement officers at a BLM rally.   Look at pop-culture. White people are portrayed as the Big Evil, as inherently racist, privileged, bigoted and hateful of, apparently, all but other white people and even then, only those who are not of the oh-so perfect Left.   Racism is racism and evil regardless of the race of the racist.
grow up and stop fearing the boogy man under your bed racist piss ant
Internet porn and the feminization of men are the problems in my humble opinion.
Trump has never apologized for anything. His is a weak man.
You just explained why white white men needed the 2nd Amendment. They knew they had to kill the people they were stealing the land from.
The Mexicans pointed out the fatal flaw in Trump's s0-called negotiating strategy. While in the corporate world he may have tried, successfully at times, to bully and intimidate others in one on one negotiations, in government there is a "public" that is an important part of the equation that Trump misses completely. More evidence that putting arrogant "businessmen" in charge is a sure-fire loser.
Agreed.... another silly commission.  Just start ordaining married men, ordain women deacons, and then get on with it and ordain women (there is no good reason to not do so).
What about Gupta monopoly capital? and corrupted African leadership (nicely illustrated through the insurmountable failures of Zuma's administration) Is that our solution? Yes Mbalula is spot on and factually correct historically. What then? We follow the dumb ass corrupt, malleable, unprincipled, immoral iteration that's become ANC now with active participants like your Fikile's and Malusi's?   Let's cut the white man out of it for a while and deal with real facts for ourselves. (We'll never change the white man's incredibly stupid, unjustifiable, actually laughable small minded thinking). They'll probably still rack their little brains as to what's been said by Fikile about history and still not be able to comprehend it.   What about us. Is a guy like Fikile, or Gigaba or Malema really the types of people we want representing us? Would YOU accept taking up a finance ministry knowing you know nothing about finance, and think you are adding value to society? Think about it.
ericnorstog, IF, and I say IF, I was God, and when you come before me for final judgement, I would cut off your male sex organ, and if you are a woman, I would stitch up your pusey.
Then man up boy. In fact you are a cry baby 🤧.
Damn those dislikes... is it just me or is ADN being patrolled by never-trumper shills constantly? You speak the truth man, keep preaching!
There is no male equivalent  There are many situations where being a white male is a risk.  but you will n  reject all  examples no matter how many are offered to you.  You are the sort of racist we have to fear because you refuse to even admit your  own guilt.
But I guess it was ok For Obama to pardon a military male who transformed to a female who basically committed treason.  That's ok, but not this, talk about hypocrites
Women can defend themselves, they don't need you, a man (presumably), defending them.  Thanks for being a blatant hypocrite.
100% you will take no responsibility for anything that goes wrong with Pride , the parade or events.   You need scapegoats and the only question is who. Certainly white man like Tory,  Toronto's white gay male population , and white police officers are the easy targets.
Regardless of the few bozos and idiots, people that don't have their head up their can still support the men in blue. Thank you for your service, brother.
Publishing facts about the man is not the same thing as "slagging, ridiculing, mocking" him.  And, if we can't criticise the man who will be the 'Leader of the Free World', then whom CAN we criticise???  You Lugenposters ARE "the problem".
Right?!?! I grew up in a pretty red necked area of northern Michigan but we were taught to respect others and bullies were shunned. Now this "reality" tv star is bringing out the worst impulses of his followers. The lowest, meanest most bigoted and racist actions are justified for trump in spite of what I just know they were taught to not do in their formative years. Political blindness is like being okay with the quarterback of your chosen team even though he does drugs and abuses men and women off the field. Strange behavior. Sad.
In Europe, nobody would care. We are too law-crazy making too many things we like illegal. This schmuck really has a tool we all envy. He want to share his happiness through a photo selfie. No meeting took place. Fahgeddabouddit! He was just joking around. I remember a story about Sukarno who visited Russia. they knew he loved beautiful women so they procured a statuesque young blonde who fit the national pride of women. They banged into happiness and his dream of loving such a white beauty kept them awake all night. The next day the dirty Russkies tried to blackmail the President with colorful photos of his sexual escapade. He laughed and asked for a hundred copies of each photo. In Asian as well as Europe it is a man's right to pork any woman who so desires him. As long as he returns home to his wife, everything will be fine. Who or what brainwashed us into believing such a wonderful sport is so evil? Fork the government and its childish laws.
Silly, short-sighted story.  Were these shooters the same ones who dumped the trash there?  Steve Meyer never establishes that, but what he does establish is the danger of misguided subjectivity in him deciding who and who does not "deserve" a firearm.  Instead of going after the illegal dumping- the real problem- he goes after a couple guys out shooting at the trash.  To be clear, while Steve Meyer is free to write about guns and hunting all he wants, the subject of firearms doesn't seem to be the issue here. . People dumped their trash at that spot, instead of bringing it to the proper place. Since Meyer isn't some authority, why doesn't he work to incentivize others to not illegally dump their trash in the first place?  Does it cost to dump those appliances? I'm very skeptical that the exchange in conversation between the men and Meyer happened at all that way; I'm not sure what the correct course of action to take on illegal dumping, but that was clearly not it.
The Gay sex going on in the Men's room is even worse than the drug use and the homeless using them as a place to wash up.
The whole anti-white-male underpinnings of contemporary liberalism is just one of many  irrational, pseudo-intellectual pathologies that has been adopted by the Democratic Party. This pathology is a subset of the overall assault on the masculine and manhood that we find in the culture.  Any culture that has such an approach to men or the masculine is sick, sick, sick. It is this sickness that the above article advances.   We have seen what this anti-male, anti-masculine  spirit has done to the Black community and what it is now doing to American culture in general.  We see that this anti-white male view is actually a form of racism against the white race in general. This theme has infected all of Liberalism and the above article with the animosity it engenders not only lacks charity but is thoroughly anti-Christian.
This really is a world-class farce. Comey was universally vilified over his handling of Hillary Clinton -- for investigating her by one side, for not bringing charges by the other. However, he became an instant hero and everybody's dream son-in-law the moment Trump tossed him out.   Now we learn that he personally leaked information to the press, that he refused Trump's request to inform the public that he (Trump) was not under investigation, and that he taped his meeting with Trump without permission -- and he still gets to be the boy scout, and Trump the villain?   Give me a break. Trump won because rank amateurs like Comey let the Dems get away with nominating a revoltingly corrupted candidate. Comey and his fellow sore losers should just stop hyperventilating and learn from their mistakes.
The charge for hitting someone in the head with a hammer should be attempted murder with special circumstances. Anything less is a travesty of justice. It also doesn't matter that they were teens. Throw the book at the thugs.They destroyed a man's life.
And you know everything about India because you ate butter chicken a few times?  Rape is underreported everywhere. But the implied idea (from the media) that non white men rape more is not backed by data.
My apologies rimrock! "This is all about racial injustice and white resentment that minorities no longer know their place in society. "  I didn't know it was said by DT, originally.  what an all around embarrassing trash of men,  DT is! Is DT makes all Americans the trash people since we elected trash for the president of this country? Great I Am a double trash, since I am Catholic beside! What the hell is wrong with 'men'! I hate to admit it, however, I never met a man who I can respect in my entire life in 70years. Why on earth, men can't rise above their Penis? I think the requirment for being a priest should not be a single but cas·trated!  well that is a sure way to solve clergy rape of children scandals!
Gee thanks, Dan, for explaining it to us from a man's point of view.  Now, I'll go back and listen to women, who are the only people qualified to determine whether or not they have been discriminated against simply because they are women.  When you refer to dignity and symmetry of roles, I hear sexism and misogyny.  Keep up the good work of  justifying  that women are unequal to men by your continued use of euphemisms.  It astounds me that you and men who believe as you think that women are that stupid.
I met Prince Phillip and was told before meeting him that he was as honest a man as you will meet and had a quick sense of humour* (qualities Globe staff might keep less carefully under lock and key). Phillip did not disappoint and made fun of the formalities and nonsense that surrounds royals.  Can you judge a man today over the last 90 years? You have no more idea of what life was like then, than you do of how harshly your smug leftist truth will be viewed in the future dear writer.  He will rest easy. He has helped and inspired more veterans, sick and challenged people in an average afternoon than we (you) will in a lifetime.  That should be celebrated... with humility. I guess the writer's snide political correctness is the new version of royalty - arrogant, entitled and unready for the truth... karma's going to be a bitch.  *BTW Canadian national paper flags the spelling of "honourable" and "humour" (with a "u") as a spelling mistake. Microsoft nationalism?
dennism, you absolutely do not have one ounce of substantive thought in your head or you are woefully incapable of translating it into words. Your "poking fun" at persons for liking their own posts is quite annoying and very uncharitable. I've found that to be true of most liberals. When they can't intelligently respond to views they disagree with, they always reach for the straw man, which in your case, is very uncharitable and un-Christ like.
"I have no like or dislike of Barack Obama." BULLSHIRT! You clearly loathe the man.
It is a grave sin for girls to watch Elvis Presley, and an occasion of sin to engage in French kissing or "go steady."  It is the responsibility of girls to keep men from Hell by not dragging them there with sex when girls do not have sex drives.  They have sex to get prom dates or jewelry.
This is my story!! And I want to say I don't want to go back to the boy, you don't know everything about me so just zip it this is why I talk with doctors about to change my gender or cut my dick!! And what u said?? The boy faster than the girls hahha funny if it real y I got 3rd in 200m.?? If I'm strong I should to get 1st not 3rd!!!
What is the basis for FGM? Extreme misogyny, jealousy of women's ability to grow life, hatred of women's sexuality. I cannot fathom the reasons for this kind of torture and mutilation! Perhaps if the head of a man's penis also had to be removed at the same time a woman's clitoris was removed this butchery would come to a quick end!
Exactly Rand.  Many are confusing the writer, Dave, with a man...he falls very short of one, in my opinion...  He is selling out his whole gender for some cheap writer points, in a career that is dead already...  How do you describe a loser - Dave/Globe article.
Why is the RCC unique?  No other religious group worldwide has incessant, incestuous infighting. All about celibate males jousting for power, control, not service. What a nightmare Jesus has conceived! Every group has infighting but the RCC has perfected it. As long as there is no accountability except to one man, there will be no balance of power and "power corrupts and absolutely power corrupts absolutely." The pope is a dictator; more subtly, an absolute monarch.  Despite VII's anemic attempt for collegiality, it has been effectively squashed, by the likes of subsequent dictator popes.  And worse, patriarchy restored with a vengeance.  Women need not apply. In the current power scandal, the only voice speaking truth to power is Marie Collins. See what happens when a woman has a voice?  Great evangelization, gang!  Keep it up! The RCC is not reformable.
Bullshit. You just like to kill. There is a high cost paid  for every "free" animal you kill so you can a "macho mountain man." A true Alaskan and human being is a caretaker not just of the land but every living thing on it.
Had they been male, they would have been immediately fired, licenses suspended arrested and after they were through with a lengthy prison term, on a sexual predator list for life.
A person is a hypocrite if he tells someone not to do something but he does it himself. I didn't do this if you look at everything I said. Blacks protest things like discrimination and being killed by cops unfairly. When a old white man tells Blacks to go back to Africa, he is saying stop complaining, you are lucky to be in the U.S. If a white man from the mainland complains about how inferior Hawaii is, then the response from a local will be, if this place isn't good enough for you, go back to the place you are happy with. I wouldn't agree with anyone telling Micronesians to go back. If you complained that Hawaiians discriminated against whites, and they told you to go back to the mainland, I would be against it also. You did not give any example and I am only talking about the superior white man situation.
Oh....I've never met you  KONRAD YAKABUSKI  and what you write and your opinion pieces tell me you are not a very nice man.  You're elitists, arrogant.  I'm tired of elitists G&M writers and so tired of PC world you and your peers are trying to shove down the throat.  I like President Trump give him a chance.
2nd dumbest man in politics and 2nd dumbest VP in our history ...can you guess who #1 is ? Yes it's Joe Biden
It was GOD who commanded that His priests be male back in the time of Aaron. To demand that females be ordained is an affront to God. That is not sexist or misogyniust unless God Himself is sexist and misogynist.
Speak up, what is your problem with old white men with young Oriental women? The two murderers are men who sleep with other men.
Oh, then was his comment just an academic exercise, or does he think that all Catholics should adopt his opinions?  I really don't see the point of having all Catholics become Episcopalians just because he thinks they should.  Much easier for him to go where he already agrees with the teaching; don't you thinks so?  The fact is, Elgabalus has adopted the homosexual identity which, by definition, means that he thinks all of his problems as a "gay" man are the result of a Catholic Church that teaches his attraction to other men is disordered and that sodomy is a sin.
A dangerous lunatic man-child
GET OVER IT!!!!!! IT WAS AN EFFING JOKE!!!! Quit being so damn hyper sensitive.   YES, it was funny... It was funny because MOST nurses are indeed FEMALE! FACT. When I hear the word "NURSE" I, and statistically 100% of other human beings picture the woman with the white dress and hat. THATS HOW IT IS. DEAL WITH IT!  2) Statistically 100% of straight men WOULD NOT want gay men OOGLING their genitals and "admiring" them. FACT. That is NOT "Anti-Gay"... Its just FACT. I certainly would not want some gay guy checking out my private parts...   And you Leftists wonder why we cant stand you guys... You are NITPICKERS!!! You take apart EVERY DAMN sentence and analyze EVERY word... You take the fun out of EVERYTHING.   MAGA 2020.
I have warned about the man's sanity since he announced he was running for president.  Unfortunately he is not a temperamental child.  He is an extremely manipulative socio-pathic narcissist.
White supremacy still running rampant. I don't see too many conservatives upset about a black man, being beaten by white supremacists (those champions of free speech, remember, and just really Very Concerned (TM) about conserving "history" - as if people use statues to learn about history.) and then getting served a WARRANT for fighting back against those evil racist thugs.   Seriously, what is the message we are supposed to take from this? If you are black, don't fight back against white thugs who are beating you because they are blatantly, openly racist, because you are not considered their equals?   https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-brutal-beating-of-black-man-by-white-supremacists-still-roils-charlottesville/2017/10/10/e5994132-a515-11e7-8cfe-d5b912fabc99_story.html?utm_term=.07c9e9f11d6e
continued: “This man in the Oval Office is a soulless coward who thinks that he can only become large by belittling others. This has of course been a common practice of his, but to do it in this manner—and to lie about how previous presidents responded to the deaths of soldiers—is as low as it gets. We have a pathological liar in the White House, unfit intellectually, emotionally, and psychologically to hold this office, and the whole world knows it, especially those around him every day. The people who work with this president should be ashamed, because they know better than anyone just how unfit he is, and yet they choose to do nothing about it. This is their shame most of all.” Greg Popovich.
Poor poor baby, you still haven't figured it out have you? People other than libtards and moochers don't like your kind. Man up cowboy and quit your pathetic whining, your criminal lost.
I'm not a "entitled white male" lol  You of course haven't a clue about what you speak of. You should be embarrassed of your ignorance.
whitesplaining, mansplaining: Both legitimate words. Both suggestive of white mens' arrogance.
The only place where right is wrong, wrong is right, and boy is girl is in liberal America and other like sub-cultures.  Muslims adhering to the strict text of Islam can behead people for converting from Islam to Christianity,  but we dare not condemn.  If Catholics repeatedly, year after year, blew up buildings, restaurants, and metros in the name of Pope Francis, there'd be an outcry against Catholics.   That would be rational.   But when it's done by Muslims, any mention that these acts are done in the name of Islam is suppressed as religious discrimination.  That's irrational.
Some of you white men truly love to talk about killing minorities. It is part of your white privilege and white heritage. All lives have never mattered to you.
This is abuse, and it's disgusting to see you bragging about it. If you do this to your son now he will rebel when he's older, AND resent you for the rest of his life. I'll tell you what you can do -- about the most of what you can do. He's already into dance -- consider signing him up for more "masculine" dance classes, like swing or hip hop dancing. That way he keeps a connection to more "feminine" pursuits without harming his pride. More to the point, fucking ASK HIM FIRST. And respect his wishes. Your son is not your plaything, to mold as you see fit.
The unmitigated arrogance and hubris of these 'no-kill' imbeciles never ceases to amuse me.  So convinced are they of their own "righteousness" they can't imagine that more than one person would EVER disagree with them.  No, I'm not Rain25.  She's female and I'm male.  We don't even live in the same country.  One thing we have in common is that neither of us are idiots.  Don't you wish you could say the same.
To be fair he/she would be welcome in team sports. The girls with the he/she will have an advantage. But in individual sports it is unfair. Notice there are no females dressing as males competing as males. They would also not be welcome on a guys team. So since this transgender issue will likely favor only guys being girls it will come out unequal. And until you menstruate and have cramps you are not a real woman. I would like to hear from girls dressing as boys and see if they feel equal amongst the boys.  I personally feel robbed as a female letting males impersonate females.
"Homosexual" and "heterosexual" are adjectives, not nouns. "Gay" is also an adjective, not a noun. When I say I am a "gay man", the emphasis is on "man". It's a descriptor.   I have been gay for my entire life, and I've never met anyone who identified themselves as a "person who experiences same-sex attraction".
"Last week, the Proud Boys – a male-only group devoted to promoting the superiority of Western culture – disrupted a Mi’kmaq protest in Halifax, while wearing adorably matching polo-neck shirts. The founder of the Proud Boys is Gavin McInnes, who is a bit like the Don Rickles of anti-feminism, complete with jokes retrieved from a time capsule packed in 1962. Feminists are ugly, did you know? Their ovaries are all dry and shrivelled up! Behold the beer glass filled with male tears." ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ The question here remains... Is This Paragraph Classified As Civil..??  /..
Seriously dude? You are an Old-White-Male headlining a piece "reeks of entitlement".  Um, could you possibly be more tone deaf?
You are the one making the false claim , back it up. The fact is you can't. White people get shot by the police too, more black people are shot by police, but it may be due to the fact 6% of the population(black men) commit 50 % of the violent crimes. They have more interaction with police. We don't have a police problem we have a black crime problem. That stat comes from FBI crime data and is well known. Unlike the lie you keep repeating.
Cultural competence says Jesus would have told them to 'go and sin no more'. Homosexuality was never accepted in Jewish or Christian teaching.  It still isn't. Neither was men or women wearing the other sexes' clothing. The Church is warned about 'wolves that come dressed as sheep', a falling away in the Last Day, and people with 'itching ears'. I am sure that once again I will be 'stoned' for my thoughts. But the liberals love to kill the messenger, because they hate the Message.
Well said on all counts!  Regarding the niqab, the president of Egypt recently had a law passed banning the niqab and other full face coverings in all contacts between the public and public officials.  Egypt is over 90% Muslim and the president of Egypt el Sisi is Muslim.  But going by the logic of these left wing morons in the Liberal and NDP parties, the Egyptian president must be even more anti-Muslim than Harper allegedly is.    In reality, the Egyptian president is a wise man and understands how reactionary and discriminatory and demeaning and antediluvian and sexist such a policy actually is.  But Trudeau and the Liberals will do and say and pretend to believe anything in their grovelling for votes so this was not an opportunity to take a stand for Canadian values but rather another cheap stunt to attract the growing Muslim vote in Canada.  Besides, given The Clown Prince's recent edict that Canada is the world's first post-national state there are no Canadian values.  Disgusting
And for further justification for this predatory behavior, review  NAMBLA.  "The North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) is a pedophile and pederasty advocacy organization in the United States. It works to abolish age-of-consent laws criminalizing adult sexual involvement with minors and campaigns for the release of men who have been jailed for sexual contacts with minors that did not involve coercion."  What is 'coercion' or 'consent' for a five year old boy or girl?
When BLM accused the white gay men of Toronto , who started Pride in 1981, a bunch of racists and oppressor class white supremacist, NOBODY came to their defense.  Being gay is one thing, but being white negates that.
"So if a man leaves he's a loser and if she leaves him...he's a loser."  Well, sure, it's in keeping with the baseline supposition:   If a man despises women, he's an a-hole; if a woman despises men, it's because men are a-holes.  Feminists do have a kind of consistency going there, it's just not what you'd call rational.
I'm tired of the feminist rant.  As a middle aged white male, everyone is looking to blame their problems on me - problems from the past that I didn't have a hand in.  Suck it up princess - you've got far more choices than I do.
Omar Khadris a murderer and the left thinking as usual are trying to make him out as a great guy.He bloddy well killed a guy and you let him walk around like some saint.Justin now brings in Syrian murderers like its nothing and they are mainly yong men who wouldnt fight for thier country and get more money than hard working Canadians.What the hell is wrong with Ottawa.I dont care he was 13 years old,He knew beter than to kill just like the inderage woman who killed Rena Virk and she is still in jail.
I agree ...this goes back to my comments about the differences between men and women. A woman neglects to practice safe sex when she decides to engage in reproductively provocative behavior ... squanders her opportunities to choose via the morning after pill ...finds out she is pregnant and she (and the law) decide if she elects to keep the child then the man is on the hook for the next 18 years and if she elects to kill her baby the man has absolutely zero say in the matter at all. Is there anyone who really thinks that we don't run things?
Sounds like producer intended a form of Semitic hyperbole to make a point? Didn't see it.  Wonder if his point was the institutional church was anti-sex? A trove of works underscore how bad sex was.  No "Joy of Sex" manuals in RCC circles! Pleasure and sex were not condoned until Aquinas thought a little pleasure was acceptable, only in context of conception.  Hence the RCC joke, "Not a sin if you didn't take pleasure in it".  And masturbation remains a mortal sin! Taking pleasure when not conceiving. The stranglehold on sexuality in the hands of men supposedly celibate!? Like 9 Republican senators deciding on health care for women. Not that films may be bizarre but the theater of the absurd we're forced to play roles in is.
Outsider:  I truly feel a woman would have to be drugged unconscious, tied down with barbed-wire and forcibly raped by three different men in front of at least ten wittnesses and videotaped before you would consider it to be inappropriate sexual behavior or sexual harassment. Gary Crum
Another completely off course tirade against the male gender Weinstein is one person who allegedly sexually harassed and allegedly raped a group of people. His behaviour does not represent the male gender, male Hollywood producers, male CEOs, or any group of males.    Stop slandering an entire gender to suit your daily quota of man bashing.   This is just disgusting. Try REPORTING the news once in a while instead of making every story into a 1970’s era feminist college case study.  It’s pathetic.   The real victims in this study are the ugly women and men of Hollywood who never get the opportunity to be sexually harassed in exchange for highly sought after roles.  They are the ones we should be reallly sympathizing with, not the hotties with huge paychecks, awards and armies of fans.
If Jenny is pregnant, on her income,- another liberal hippie mistake. Hope her man has $
At this point I am not convinced anything could stick on him.  The man could get caught having sex with a goat and blow it off and no one would care.  Except the goat....
Cardinal Law was guilty of shuffling the deck of offenders.   That's plain.  But had there been no offenders, Cardinal Law wouldn't be the villain and scapegoat of the sex abuse crisis.  So what is the real source of the scandal?   The offenders.  That is, Priests who were sexually attracted to other males.  Anyone who denies that real source is denying the actual cause of the Church's scandal.
There is no such thing as moderate Islam. The opinion of whoever preaches moderation, the opinion of the Grandest Mufti, is irrelevant from the get go.  Islam mandates that all Muslims are bound to follow the moral teachings of only one man, who died centuries ago, and whose morality made him a serial rapist murderer.  Qur’an 3:32—Say: Obey Allah and the Apostle; but if they turn back, then surely Allah does not love the unbelievers.  Qur’an 9:73—O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.   Qur’an 9:5—Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.   In other worlds, all Muslims must follow their divine leaders teachings that say: join them or die!
If I'm a man wanting a vagina no problem. But if I want to see or have teeth I need to pay. Wtf really tired of our governess and the politics to get votes.
Some men are taught to view some women as worthless.  Sexual harassment is caused by women too not just men.  Some men are just opportunists.  Women at work compete usually so it is hard to get other women at work to defend each other. I tell young females that if you think females are horrible while your young then just wait until you get older.  They only get worse.   Women compete for status and attention, not necessarily for money.. I have hardly ever seen women support each other at work and school unless they are friends.
If you want to shorten the sentence of s thief or a pot smoker for good behavior, be my guest.  But murderers and rapists?  Pedophiles?    Sometimes the punishment must fit the crime.  If those parents can't get their children back, why should this man ever get his freedom back?
Trump made fun of women's appearances. He made fun of women's periods.  His infamous line: "grab 'em by the p****"   And despite all of this:  He won 53% of the white female vote  45% of college educated female voters  42% of women's votes overall  And 9 million more women than men vote in the US election.  Women had the opportunity to break the biggest glass ceiling in the world and vote for a female candidate that was also the globe and fail's preferred candidate as they have constantly reminded us after the election, but chose not to. The biggest whiners, Ms. Renzetti, are reserved for those who participated in the women's march the day after he was elected and could not accept the result of a democratic election.
Sing it, Mr. Krustofski.  The only thing close to a violent incident I have experienced in Anchorage is when a white male threatened his girlfriend at my gym, my husband approached and told him to knock it off, the perp was about to hit my husband, and a recent arrival from Sudan backed up my husband, yelling loudly, so the white male creep backed off. Yes women have to be careful - that's what we've been told all our lives, it's nothing new.  The only male who was violent with ME (when I was a girl) was white, too.  I have learned to not pre-judge all white males as ignorant creepy perverts - it's ignorant to judge people by the color of their skin. So knock it off! Oh wait, I forgot the alcoholic who pointed his shotgun at me, way out on a trial north of Talkeetna - yeah, you guessed it, white male too.
Well, in one instance mentioned, MEN as well as women, presumably, have every right to be "aggrieved."  I'm referring to the four-day Swedish music festival now cancelled next year because of "reported" rapes and sexual assaults. Talk about over-reaction. And I mean it.  All these incidents are alleged and unproven, at this writing. If charges are laid, some will likely be tossed because of lack of evidence; others may never go to court because some of the complainants (perhaps as addled by alcohol or drugs as their "attackers") will recant.   CBC says the festival "draws about 40,000..."    Ok, lets say of the 27 nasty sexual incidents reported, 20 turn out legitimate: that's .05% of the total who attended the festival.  Heck, next year, just ban liquor and drugs stronger than pot!    See? Cancellation is over-reaction.  See that knee-jerk all the time, much like this column about a small group of stupids and misfits in polo shirts who represent nobody but their pitiful selves.
The problem with the Catholic faith, other religions, government, the military, law enforcement, and criminal justice is this; they are all dominated by men, and mostly by white authoritarian men! Sorry guys, but most men aren't known for their empathy for others or planning for the long term versus short term pleasure. In Trump we see these negative qualities magnified a thousand times. Frankly, I'm sick of it! All the institutions that make countries a good place where their citizens can thrive would be much improved if at least half the people wielding power and making decisions were women! More than half would be even BETTER! Now we see what the world is coming to. Short term greed takes precedence over the environment. Short term greed is more important than people and communities. Make no mistake, we are killing ourselves. But the authoritarian white men causing this genocide will be long dead before their grandchildren start paying the price.
I can't stand the orange man; can't see why any of you idiots (who also voted for bush/cheney) voted for him;  but I'm thankful he started his speech tonight condemning the violence against Jews across the nation.
Speaking of which, the experience of those priests is highly pertinent to understanding why the sex abuse scandal came to be.  These were gay men.  Ergo, they were attracted to young boys.  The counter argument to this, I guess, is that the abusing priests were actually hetero men, and for reasons no one can explain, they inexplicably found young boys an irresistible attraction.  Talk about your denial and groupthink.
When Faye Steward used the word "we" above he was referring to the white majority not to any of his non-white fellow citizens, people who every bit as American as he is. The kind of "help" Steward espouses in the above quote is the patronizingly racist variety. He thinks he can "help" by availing himself of his god-given right as a white man to decide which "others" can participate in the "inclusiveness" he and those in  his privileged position might be willing to offer (usually very limited).  This particular part of his disgustingly condescending homily was particularly instructive, "then hopefully get them back to where they can live stably in their country." I say that Faye Stewart should be sent back to whatever country his likely ignorant, racist European ancestors came from since he's having a negative impact on the lives and safety of American citizens, not to mention that he makes me want to retch.
Yo ho, can you explain to me why white men commit 99% of child sex crimes, and usually kill their prey?
NK is a proxy for China. They can shut the crazy man down in a hart beat.
Who expected Hillary to be such a sore loser? Man oh man, She just won't stop parading her "poor little me" charade.    She is  proving why she is  unfit for the Oval Office.
Like Obama: "Corpse-man"
Not likely if he was a 69 year old black man living alone. Quit it with the race card already.
what complete rubbish, here in canada woman have all the same equal rights if not MORE rights than men period
I couldn't disagree more.  Saddam, Qaadafi and Assad no good men.  This is disgusting historically ignorant trolling.
All that may be true, Andrew, including "associated being gay with being a sexual predator."  Quite likely--because we're dealing with human beings here--some gays ARE sexual predators. No groups--and very few individuals--are left untainted.  What's missing here--because (1) it's subtle, attitudinal and often more private (2) It has been condoned by society and (3) makes men look weak and foolish, is sexual harassment and even assault perpetrated by women.   Many women--past, present and, possibly, in the future--will continue to offer sexual favours (to husbands, mainly) as a bargaining chip, "gimme what I want, then maybe I'll give you what you want..." often it's implicit in years-long relationships. The ultimate "gimme" would be the engagement/wedding ring trade off.  Without it...no sex at all.  This behaviour can be seen to be encouraged--or aided and abetted--by a society that traditionally gave women no other real power except what they took for themselves in bedrooms.
I want the totem poles removed from Stanley Park because I am offended by the behaviour of the Miqmaq in Halifax,threatening to tear down the statue of Cornwallis.Real civil behaviour.Why don't we all go back 268 years and file some grievances?We all have some.Even the evil white man.
Awwwwww....did someone hurt widdle Putrumpski's feewings by tweeting the truth?   What a joke of a man. Pathetic.
How do we become racists? By watching the news. The high crime rate of young "black men" is astonishing and scary.
"When BLM accused the white gay men of Toronto , who started Pride in 1981, a bunch of racists and oppressor class white supremacist, NOBODY came to their defense. Being gay is one thing, but being white negates that."  BLM was certainly lambasted on these comment boards for its self-defeating and ignorant stunt.
You are a gross individual. You're probably friends or family of this mental man. That cat did not deserve to die.
Honestly, Sher, you are so intelligent, and your comments are mostly well thought out and logical, to me anyway, but sometimes...  Segregation in some sports is necessary.  Few women possess the physical strength men have, hence women's tennis, golf, football, etc.  This is done to level the playing field, forgive the pun.  Sex segregated schools have little, if anything to do with marginalization of women.  There are many reasons why sex segregated schools are actually better, but we can argue that another time.   We can argue who did what hundreds of years ago, but apart from being a history lesson, who wins the "we were more advanced first" war does little to help in this case, although you don't mention the Incan civilization, or Mayan...  Westerners are complacent, some arrogant, but I'd say more ignorant in our belief that " It can't happen here",however I see that changing.  Western civilization is under threat, we would be wise to become a bit more vigilant.
More complete and utter nonsense from Balki. There is no problem with masculinity, males, powerful males, straight males, etc. NONE WHATSOEVER. There are a few PEOPLE committing illegal, unlawful, immoral and unauthorized acts against other people. End of story. Stop labeling all men, or all powerful men, or Geeks? Really Geeks?? "Deep down the Geek knows?" Are you f&cking kidding me Balki? Now you are labeling, berating, mocking, discrediting, vilifying, STIGMATIZING an entire class of people, young men who work in technology, because a handful of people acted inappropriately? Out of millions? Do you read your own crap? "Empowered after centuries of having sand kicked in their faces, too many tech geeks are asserting their newfound dominance over women repeatedly and repulsively" ???? You are a sick person. Your stories are garbage. This entire discussion is sad, pathetic and symptomatic of the spiraling demise of the mainstream media as it will soon be formerly known.
Minority borrowers are still more likely to get turned down for conventional mortgage loans than white people with similar credit scores. An Urban Insititute data analysis found that mortgage denial rates from government-sponsored servicers are higher for black applicants with bad credit than for white applicants with bad credit:  A study published this year in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that participants estimated black boys to be older and less innocent than white boys of the same age. When participants were told that the boys, both black and white, were suspected of crimes, the disparity in perceptions of age and innocence became more stark:  White Americans use drugs more than black Americans, but black people are arrested for drug possession more than three times as often as whites. Black men receive prison sentences 19.5 percent longer than those of white men who committed similar crimes, a 2013 report by the U.S. Sentencing Commission found.
Way off. 13% refers to men, women, and kids. White men 31% of the population.  Black men 3.5%. Black men are FORTY times more likely to commit a violent crime. I love it you think wikipedia is reliable. Go to the Us Census and the DOJ. That's where I get my "lies" OK Ericsnot?
Trump is a weak man's idea of a strong man, a poor man's idea of a rich man, and a stupid man's idea of a smart man.
I look at everybody who stands near me in the eyes. Has always been a habit of mine. Make it a habit to be suspicious for everybody and everything. Like James Bond. Maintain full alertness  and what kind of dangers could happen from any direction. Feels good to be alert. BTW that video is useless unless you plan to suspect every gay male with a red purse. Turn on the forkin' lights. Lights help keep cockroaches away.
For those who think they are white as snow and without blemish I must repeat this truth: From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.  People, this is not gossip and hearsay.
Don't underestimate these mysoginist Albertans. They are neither insane or stupid. They are no different than their likes in USA. They are likely well educated, middle class men and women who prefer to be racist, segregationist and sexist. You may not like the tone of this message but you can't deny the inherent reality within.
The American 'sisterhood' had its chance to save NAFTA and many other beneficial institutions such as the EPA and the State Department but instead voted against one of it's own to install in the White House a mentally ill, illiterate fascist. There is no case here to imply the girls are any smarter than the boys.
So many lies, where to start: 1. Cite your sources that prove the Dems know about the most famous tape when flip-flopper political opportunist Trump  - whom you so admire -  when he was a Democrat. 2. Provide proof that the Democratic Party ever considered Trump their “darling” 3. I guess you don’t know about the suits Trump has settled over sexual harassment; 4. I guess you don’t know about the women - and men - who have come forward to discuss the sexual assaults he has committed and his disgusting bragging about his exploits. 5. And this a big one: please provide cites to your literally unbelievable statement that “ all the women he has met with in person agree that he’s been a perfect gentleman....” I mean, I’ve seen women talk about Trump shoving them up against walls and feeling them up.
Trump was never a respected businessman.  He is a bully and sleazy operator.  Mainly, he has been exposed as weak and incompetent.  He is done.  He is a lame duck now.  Ignore him.
Ugly feminism. Saying that girls are in conflict with the male rulers, the patriarchy. It is brainwashing children with alt-right propaganda.
Kim's mouth is just as big as his fathers was 40 years ago.  I was stationed at Osan AB Korea in the late 70's and he was always threatening the US and S. Korea.  All we have to do is just ignore that little man in N. Korea...just ignore him.  Just like we ignored his crazy dad.
that kind of hyperbole is so typical of you Cydney (Andi your ammoheads showed up);   the reality is that this man died and he died more than likely because two rotten disgusting people saw value in his weapons, and his safe.  Having the guns was a target, but they could have easily been targeting his safe even without the guns.    Having the guns didn't make him any safer, because he trusted those people.  Not having the guns doesn't make him any less/more of a target.  Because in reality when someone comes for you, your weapon in hand (whether valuable or not valuable) is rather irrelevant - life is always going to be a game of chance.  How fast you're able to react and whether you're lucky enough to be able to survive the encounters that are thrown at you, often times unaware.  We can only be as prepared as possible for the many different possibilities that exist.    Sadly this mans attackers lucked out; now they will pay for their crime as caged animals.
I fail to see how your post-->  "like raping male dicks" made it past civil or the DP.  Disgusting. You promote rape while being very offensive. Appalling.
Fuck this ain't no female this is a crazy ass tranny that threatens and harasses the homeless threatens people on a regular picks fights with men all the time I think it's bs that she he is playing the poor women card when she has no problem picking fights with men and has harassed Jeeves the one who pushed her many times don't talk shit don't get thrown through a window pretty simple
cholo isn't pro-lgbt or anti-lgbt. cholo just believes in a little common sense. you should go to the bathroom depending on what you currently got. have a penis? go to the mens. a vagina? then go to the womens. simple. transgender? well if you cut off your wang and now have a hole then go to the womens. and if you had a hole and plugged it up with a pole then go to the mens. feeling mahu? sorry, if you still have a penis you go to the mens. likewise, if you feeling butch but still have a vagina the womens restroom is where you go.
You, are a fuc*** dead man McGee.
It was a culture of drunken violence and neglect the white man was trying to save the kids from. Still do.
exactly hence cholo's common sense solution. have a penis? you go to the restroom for penises and likewise for vaginas. no debate and no need to identify being a man or woman. simply go to the restroom with what you've got. got it? what's to argue about? well cholo is pretty sure someone will come up with something but only to stir up more trouble.
A bunch of beta males being lead around by thier "dear leader" who is using this to manipulate these morons into thinking this is some grave disrespect to the country and vets...all I can say is good...the lines to the restroom will be shorter
It is now costing more for power, food, taxes, everything we use to keep er running, so what ever these guys are measuring as inflation nobody uses, because the taxes alone are taking 10% more out of our pockets than before JT and Graham. I have not even fired up on the 40% reduction in our dollar that these guys talk down every day.  I say fire them all, peg the loonie at par with the US and get rid of these people that hang on. We even had a lady from our central bank this week trying to talk the loonie up, the boys must have got a little concerned that Canadians are on to them. It worked, just like the Arab playbook on Oil. Stupid really, Canadian Interest Rates should be 6-8% which is where the long term trend should be, so just make it happen. Borrowing money for anything is bad, it is just what we were taught and people need a little sharpening from time to time. A house OK, a car never, and anything else never. Childcare and rugs should be covered under our national plans.
He knew the hearts of men/women.  MSW and WALFORD don't.  It's these "don't judge judgers" that drive the rest of the world nuts.  They don't see their own hypocrisy!!!!
Trudeau praised and complimented the women. But attendee Lianna Rice attacked Trudeau by saying with contempt that "white men" represented Canada. What a racist and misandrist.
Stop pointing at the Chicago police as if they are the sole problem in that city.  Chicago has a massive Black-on-Black murder problem.  Young, Black males are overwhelmingly committing most of the murders.  'Just because you can have a baby, it doesn't mean you should,' Lemon said. 'Especially without planning for one or getting married first. More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers. And the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison and the cycle continues.'"  http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/chicago-75-murdered-are-black-71-murderers-are-black
He makes lots of money - he can take it - stop your whining bennett and be a man - stop being a panzy assed sissy and grow up
And fat men? Gawd, it's unbelievable.. Studied statistics lately? Bet not!!! You think you get a free pass? You aren't apart of the problem? LoL!! My point is the dude is a pedaphile - not sure you noticed but article was about little girls you tweaked scum.
How do you know who is actually a Christian based off of statistics like this ? Jesus said 1 in 4 who show signs of belief actually are, so so can divide your percentages by 3, the visible church is filled with apostates - the Bible is clear about that, so your statistics are meaninglessness, contrived, unbiblical and irrelevant.    I go to a Church with about 200 people and know one person who has been divorced and that was 30 years ago, you need to dispense with your blatant bigotry. As far as education goes, Bill Gates doesn't have degree either and he is the worlds richest man. I do not have a degree (have some college), work from home for a fortune 200 (11 years now) company, make 6 figures+, own my home outright and will be able to retire in 10 years at 60 should the world not collapse before then. Why do I need to plunk down 100k for a degree ? A person can do fine without one, and does not need to subject themselves to the brainwashing you, no doubt, went through. Sorry Icon.
I won't base my life on a book written 2000 years ago. The Bible is full of stories and written by people who participated in heinous crimes ranging from murder, genocide, mass murder, horrific child abuse, rape, incest, stonings, crucifixation, plagues etc. People bitch and moan about sex education in school but find it perfectly acceptable to teach their children about an innocent man crucified on a cross. The Children's edition has color pictures many churches especially Catholic Churches have life size replicas of naked bloody Jesus hammered to a cross.  God did not forgive or forget. He killed men, woman & children. He killed anyone who crossed him. He killed to make a point. I was raised in a Christain home, grew up in church. Now I refuse to go to church. I despise organized religion. God is a God of love, forgiveness and compassion yet the biggest hateful hypocritical bigots I have ever met claim they are Christian & people of God. Hate preached from a pulpit is still hate.
No matter how you slice it, 80% of the gain in obesity is women, according to CDC. Women have become such disgusting fat-bodies Oprah, Rosy and the rest demand that men learn to love the fatties. Young men of today have few options without going overseas for a wife. Before the 90s, women were slim, well dressed and mostly pretty. Nowadays, most are obese, tatted up, blue and orange hair, pierced, the gamut. Aside from simple obesity, it's all the other stuff. Disgusting.
Good luck lady.  Where do I start?  Here's the deal, you are doing fine until you think that rejection of pink this or girlish that is synonymous with losing decency and politeness.  You even threw out the obligatory 'M' word.  Ballet is fine.  Dance is great.  In fact men ballet dancers are unbelievable atheletes.  But know this, you sign him up for something he doesn't want to be a part of and you will do far more damage than good.  And if you think that ballet lessons while somehow "girlishize" him and make him more polite and decent you're out of your bloody mind.  He learns decency politeness manners and yes even misogyny (or it's opposites) from guess where?  HIS DAD!!!!  Not the ballet teacher.  Again, Good luck lady
Oh for God's sake. Really? This is what pre-occupies Trump at this moment? The man (?) has the emotional intelligence of a 10 year old.
Disagree.    Hulu has shown through the years how she can be persuaded to vote with the majority.  Rowena got more balls then all the men on the board.  She stands her ground.  Rowena is not DIVISIVE, the ousted majority is being trying real hard to make she causing the divisiveness when in reality it is them being divisive and unwilling to work with the. Ow majority.  Don't buy Into the crap, remember when they made us t be angry divisive activists because we would not play their game?
I would argue that he has many similarities with Hitler and Kim Jong Un. Without the checks and balances we have in place, many of which he is constantly attacking, he seems to be aspiring to run our country as they would. He is, in my opinion. one of the worst people on the planet. Based on his own words and actions he is at the very least a racist, a xenophobe, a lying sociopath, a misogynist, and an extreme narcissist. He has zero empathy and compassion for others and an overblown sense of self that I've never seen before. Other than all of that, sure, he's "a good man."
Dick...Trump didn`t know that Russia was occupying two sovereign nations in Europe.  He called Putin, a murdering ex KGB agent, a "strong good leader he admired"....    now what was that you said again about him being "good for America"????   The man is not smarter than a fifth grader in most subjects except ,maybe how to be an ignorant and pompous self-important bully.  On that ground alone he should not be elected.. but there is so much more..
Betcha teenage males being their stupid selves...
Well just how bloody crazy can things get?   So, if you're equipped to make a stand-up job of urination - you get to use the men's toilet, otherwise, go sit in the ladies room.  It's really simple, but the liberals want to befog even this!
I've said it before, but I'll say it again - the death throes of the racist, misogynist white male are really something to see. They are apoplectic that their time is almost over. It's a beautiful sight.
I'm not alone in feeling uneasy about a public schoolteacher in Canada talking to 12-year-olds about how "the lesson of the day is white privilege... that white people enjoy unearned advantages due to their race."  And that feeling of unease isn't helped by the article's account of a teacher's response to a student, a kid who said in class that the "white privilege" mantra amounted to racism against white people. Shockingly, reading above, I see the teacher replied to the kid: "Coming from a white male...".  That is stomach churning. I wonder, is the teacher was bright enough to realize that, ironically, the kid's suspicion was verified by the teacher's reply?  The kid's correct: Stereotyping ALL white people, which is what preaching "white privilege" inescapably does, is racist. White people are diverse and sorry, but no, I DO NOT trust the public schoolteacher to walk students through the complexities of this, given that bullying, shut-down line of "Coming from a white male"...
I don't get parts of this "Pride Week". As a heterosexual male I don't get a parade and I surely don't get a week where people celebrate based solely upon my sexuality. No one outside of my family celebrates the fact that I have been with the same woman since we were both teenagers (12-13) and now we are both in our 50's!   Why is being gay all of a sudden so special that they get an entire week of festivities? I get Fathers day and my wife gets Mothers day! Why isn't the fact that we are a family celebrated for a week? I just don't understand why we need a gay pride week instead of Lesbian/Bi-sexual/Gay/Transgender/Queer day.   Why do we celebrate people based solely on their sexuality?
Its a damn shame that people resort to bashing a man who is genuinely trying to do the right thing for our country and her citizens because they can't handle or control him. It just pisses them off that Trump won't play the puppet and is strong and relentless in getting things done his way. I'm sure they also realize that President Trumps fantastic work ethic and determination makes theirs look inadequate and incompetent. Keep doing what you're doing Mr. President. Eventually, those weak, scared, simpleminded, self-serving, unethical, and greedy haters will eventually asphyxiate on their own bullshit.
In the immortal words of St. Tonto:  "What do you mean our church, white man?"
Stop posting freaky lies then goof!  Filthy posts you have on here should be taken down.  How about the ones where you say how filthy the Trump family is.  I'm sure you were saying same about Palins.  You are a man too!  Not a Sara!  Sex of a person does not matter. Right?  You need help. goof! NUTICA!!!
Say, Bill, what sex was Jesus' dad, God? Was God a male? If so, and Jesus and man are in his likeness, what did God do for sex? Was Jesus a bastard, i.e. Joseph his dad wasn't his dad? That would make Mary a cheater and Joseph a cuckold, right?
Piper probably doesn't know the first thing about calculus had not white men taught her. This is ridiculous. She should be fired.
There is nothing in the article to indicate this is a romance. Nothing. You are simply making things up. You think a teenager would never grope another student unless he was romantically involved? Do you also think boys or men would never try to have sex with someone they aren't romantically involved with? You think teenagers always treat each other with utmost decorum? How ridiculous.   If groping was reported, it's because someone believed they were a victim of inappropriate and unwanted touching. Such a report should be taken seriously & investigated appropriately. The fact the victim prefers not to press charges may very well mean she is embarrassed or feels threatened. Or maybe you think domestic violence reports are fake if the victim declines to press charges?   You know nothing about this situation other than a news report, yet you have decided it's a lovers spat. I would hope that any child reporting assault would be taken seriously & a proper investigation is done.
"One in three women has been a victim of sexual assault in her lifetime. One in five adult women has been raped; so, too, have one in 20 girls. One-third of adolescent girls report their first sexual experience as being forced, or coerced. "   These statistics are shocking because of the unnecessary pain and suffering caused to victims, but also because they imply similarly high proportions of men are either rapists, have forcefully coerced women into sex or are otherwise sexually violent. Do we have any statistics on the percentage of men who are rapists in our society? This seems to an important bit of information in looking for solutions. Thanks.
What? "Sex has not been a difficult issue for the Church... or for people"   ??  What planet are you on?    Temptation is more than "somewhat challenging." In the early days of the church, so many men were castrating themselves (to be holy "eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven" that  Emperor Hadrian instituted the death penalty for anyone who castrated without official permission, as well as for any doctor who performed the deed.    In Islam, sex was such a strong temptation that men forced its women to wear burkas.  Even today Mike  Pence won't allow himself to have dinner with any women other than his wife.  LOL !  Seems to me this has always been a BIG issue.
We get it G&M, Russia = BAD HOMBRES!  Now, how about some reporting of our own incompetent leadership instead of buying this garbage from unnamed sources when Trump is well within his legal rights.
No, because it discriminates against men when women are always complains that men discriminate women. We don't need this junk meaning the feminist attack on men.  What does that accomplish particularly when there has been so much progress!
This is what you look to for wisdom and truth? Some weinie who is full of himself? Everybody bashes the exes. O'Rielly started out decent and fame and money made him twisted. His love of himself and money cost him his family. He is a smarmy lying little man with nothing to represent his character but slime.
It goes to show how far down society has sunk that we need to have a vote on this issue . The second one is born , the doctor makes no judgement of the babies future personality and the type people that person will want to hang with. You are declared a boy are girl .Right then it's decided what bathroom you use. They don't leave the birth certificate blank on sex , waiting for a person to decide what fits their fancy down the road . It doesn't get any simpler than that. If your born a boy or girl , use that bathroom. Anyone who feels they were really born in the wrong body has issues .People with issues do odd things--like wanting to use the wrong bathroom. Letting people decide on a whim , what sex they are on that day--to use whatever bathroom they want is insane .We can't have men going in women's bathrooms with young girls and children in there. Just saying to trust people , who by they're very action have issues , is insane and dangerous . It's pathetic that some defend insanity .
And I'm sure Obama's chain of succession was filled with only people of love, and never did anything wrong. I'm sure I could make a list just like yours showing your hypocrisy, but it's lunchtime.  It's also creepy to read about a woman getting dressed. So what has she done prior and since? Walked around outside in the cold? I did that while shoveling all the global warming from my driveway. I think I accomplished more. And to all the men I saw wearing those stupid hats..pathetic beta-types.
Bravo ! Old white males just need to.learn to "STFD" (Sit Tha Fuck Down).  this type of unjust inequality which pervades all throughout western society is in reality the contemporary version of the white supremacist ideology which has fueled white christian genocide, slavery, domination, oppression and imperialism throughout the world for centuries.  the world is changing and diversity and equality are rising up everywhere so old white men just need to "STFD" !
I never thought I would see the day that we would have s RACIST president in the white house that would bring this out in people to the point that we don't watch football because his absence minded self says it's about the military and disrepcting the flag. THIS SHIT IS FUNNY. I still watch football on Sundays Monday night and Thursday but it's planning on what good team is on. GOD is just shacking his head and crossing his children off his list to get into his HOUSE. All of this with the president is someting that the more and more he changes the focus off of him to something or someone else it's better for him and people just do what the KING says if your a REAL FAN of football your going to watch the games regardless, if your not watching your not a TRUE fan at all. But since it's about BLACK MEN WHITE don't want to hear it or talk about it like they say it's no rascism in America. BLACK players making all this money what r they complaining for. SAD all of u
No, he's not.  And you just dropped a steaming pile of denial: "no comrades to support a whiff of scandal in DC, on either side."  Let's see, he's been in office for what, 5 months and has had to fire multiple members of his campaign and administration and us now being investigated for obstruction of justice.   Yeah, he's the worst president this country has ever had, hands down.   Clinton is competent and did this country great service over her 30 years in office. Like all spoiled children who hate and fear mommy, the right wing just can't handle that. Just as they couldn't handle an intelligent, charming, accomplished black man as President.   Go back to your cave, knuckle dragger.
That is tragic and attributable to  immoral priests who used their positions to take sexual advantage of underage males and occasionally females too. Such people should not be admitted to seminaries, let alone ordained. As long as they are, innocent Catholics get stuck with the bills, be it through their donations or in this case out of just compensation to employees carrying out the work of the Church. Many of the affected employees probably took on their work as a religious calling.  What a rotten way to treat them. Shame on all who bear responsibility.
Shocker. And somehow the GOP keeps pretending they are the party of the little guy and that they really do care about flyover country and getting so many to vote against their own economic interests.    Guess they couldn't stomach seeing a competent woman run things. And had so much unexplained rage about the black guy.
Why shouldn't men expect something in return from women for providing sex to them? I find this article completely ridiculous.
"..men ordained priests to 'embody Christ's presence' on Earth?  However, it is obvious that Pope. F. and the entire Catholic clergies are not interested in serving God and/or embody Christ on Earth, the way these Pope F. and the entire Catholic clergies processing clergy rape of children.  We can embody Christ on earth by our presence and a simple smile.  Is there one person think what Pope F. and these Catholic clergies are doing with raping children embody Christ?   To me, what these bishops and clergies are doing embody more of devil on earth! So what is the point of the Catholic religion if we are not interested in serving God and embody Christ??? Is Catholic religion exist to serve these sick devilish clergies and nothing to do with God? If it is nothing to do with God, why bother? These clergies represent more of 'Devil' and evil spirits, these clergies are a man of devil to me, I do not care to do a thing with these evil clergies or an evil Religion they portray!!!
Sounds like the idiot is trying to deflect blame away from his self for his "remarks about Muslims, and gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans."  The man has no one to blame for his errors in judgment and lack of basic humanity towards others different than himself and he wants to "portray himself" as a selfless public servant of the people?  Sorry there  Charlie, time to cut the act and be held accountable for your own  biased and egregious words; if you can't do that, then you do not deserve the honor to be a "public servant of the People!"  Don't let your own bias and fears hit your fat backside on the way out!
Yes, just another rat jumping ship.  Morioka at first bloom when he became known at the State DOT on Maui seemed to be a competent fellow but I changed my view of him as time went on after he was promoted to the State DOT on Oahu.  His thing seemed to be to go along to get along so I guess he was a good fit for HART.  He is leaving now while the going is good and probably hoping that the public will soon  forget  the role he played in selling this disaster of a rail project. Next off the train will be interim director Murthy unless HART extends his one year contract which I am sure he will agree to considering the  large sum he is being paid.  Why not, easy money, take it and leave before the manure hits the fan.
Republicans generally believe that it is ok if you are republican.  So if you are republican, its ok if you grab a women or have sex with a member of the same sex.  (Remember all those cases of males being busted for having sex with other males?)  Just love Republican consistency.  They are so consistent in doing the opposite of what they preach.
"If I thought that gun laws would stop the deluge of mass killings I would support them"  that has got to be the stupidest comment I've read today.  Like you know for sure for sure, yeah?  LOL  You've said dumb things before ....and I've said dumber things before, but seriously?  Are you high?  HE'S DEAD!  HOW IN THE HECK IS HE DOING THIS FOR PUBLICITY?  oh my, wiping eyes.  I can't read anymore.  My side hurts: laughing and crying.    Stupid white men.  You and Jimmy Out.  You and Jimmy.  Go to the corner.  Do not stop.  Just sit there.
Potential economic impact? That's funny. As for your birth cert, my guess is that if you wear a dress and have a 5 o'clock shadow you might want to keep it close if you plan on changing cloths at a public pool.  I don't understand why the fight over this. Naked men with naked little girls = bad plan. If you want to be different that's on you. if you suffer a mental disorder, my heart goes out to you, but what you want as a remedy does not work for the rest of us.
Playing the race card is silly.  Also inappropriate.   Even mild reflection will show that this is not about the race of the man, but rather that he is a friend of Butts and is being paid extravagantly well above the normal rate for the position.  I would have exactly the same concerns if he was white.   Or any other colour for that matter.
Considering the volume of information, protests, riots, marches etc., re: persons of color and law authorities this makes little sense. Why would a black man, enter someone's home, refuse to leave, carry a weapon in his backpack AND when police arrive refuse to cooperate. This a recipe for disaster. Suicide by cop? Dumb burglar? Makes no sense ergo, there must be or had been something seriously wrong with this individual. Thank goodness it had the outcome it did.
' if by successful business people you mean traitors and con men.
If He actually stands for all the things the Church has claimed He stands for during its history, He is not only fallible, He's a moron and deranged.  Take your pick, but I suspect the errors lie with the men who run the church.
Of course you don't consider yourself a bigot, racist or homophobe. Most people like to think of themselves as good people. But your man actively and consistently appealed to white resentment, arousing the enthusiasm of bigots, racists and homophobes; racist dog whistling was a main driver of Trump's campaign. Nothing could make the essence of Trumpism more explicit than the appointment of Steve Bannon as chief White House strategist and senior counselor. Steve Bannon is a white supremacist, misogynist agitator who turned Breitbart into a neo-Nazi swamp.  https://thinkprogress.org/steve-bannons-disturbing-views-on-genetic-superiority-are-shared-by-trump-243d73866e2d#.7ah2i9nyn  You Trump supporters have the audacity to deny Bannon and neo-Confederates like Jeff Sessions are racists and jump into high dudgeon over being associated with the virulent wing of the Trump constituency. Well, that's too bad. You jumped into bed with neo-fascists, deal with the blowback.
And he is now added to the statistics of another "black male only prosecuted because of his race" I keep reading about.
“A big part of your job is telling your boss what he needs to hear – not what he wants to hear.” -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Sound advice but with thin-skinned individuals like Trump, those who don’t play “yes man” are gone faster than you can say “You’re fired!” I imagine Spicer wants to be around at least long enough to collect his first paycheque. And so he’ll swallow what little integrity he has and continue to repeat Trump’s incredible lies.
And this is a problem for those of us who are monogamous heterosexual males or females because???  I am reminded of a couple of the early Christian sects who believed that Jesus would return in their lifetimes--you know by 70-100 A.D. at the latest.  Accordingly, they declined to participate in sex because everyone would be in the Kingdom of Heaven so kids were just a distraction.    That Christian sect disappeared.     And here we are a couple thousand years later still waiting for the return.    If the homosexuals are killing themselves with their lifestyle, they won't reproduce and so 'the problem' will just go away!
He's a bitter little man.
hipsters, white people with dreadlocks, credit card hippies, and self-entitled self-righteous over privileged idealistic white millenials.   if i were a minority, a woman or gay, these would be the absolute last people i would want taking up my cause, or attempting to represent my interests and/or frustrations.  but alas, i am in fact the problem- a thirty-something white male- the sole cause of every injustice ever perpetrated on anyone or anything since the damn of humankind.  and i've never been so ashamed.
Imbelli is sycophantically echoing his publisher's bias. The so-called therapeutic culture is hardly the major obstacle to "the obedience of faith."   It's probably fairly rare for anybody to say, "Gosh, thinking of myself as a black guy is preventing me from being transformed by the gospel into believing it's kind of OK for the police to beat me up." But it's a lot rarer for anybody to say, "Wow, enjoying being a jerk to people is preventing me from being transformed by the gospel into realizing that I have better things to do than fill NCR comment boxes with priggish faux-piety all day long."  And rarest of all is anybody saying, "Oh, look, constantly congratulating myself on my ontological superiority is preventing me from being transformed by the gospel into realizing I'm really just a lazy, drunken, obese grifter."
Wonder how many from this "sizable minority" also fear all the white guys here given that pedophilia and other perverted sex crimes are usually committed by white guys.
There we go...it's about "choice" right?  So, HOW does the woman get intoxicated?  I'm assuming by "choice".  And please, give in to a "demanding" partner?  You know what? Live alone!  And if you're relying on Contraceptives,good luck (I had a sister-in-law who had 5 kids...every ONE of them while on or using a BC!)   You would think that if your main concern is carrying a child to term, which seems to be your only response to getting pregnant, perhaps you should remain celibate.  As far as I know, that's the ONLY way to remain not having to worry about pregnancy.   MY point is, women make an entire STRING of choices before getting pregnant.  And killing another human being because you don't want to go through the bother of dealing with your actions is outrageous.  It is scary that there are so many to whom an innocent human life is absolutely meaningless.   It's not MY job to stop men from having intercourse, don't want to pay, don't play!
Your comment is ridiculous.  Should I protest at a hospital because I want less military spending?  Disrespecting a symbol of why you are free to protest/have dumb thoughts on a subject/are safe does not make sense.  The Flag and Anthem are not symbols you disrespect just as I would never burn a cross, Star of David or Koran.  Those are symbols and things held dear to people.  If its fine to dis the flag, what if they decided to burn a cross? The whole BLM movement is a racist farce in America.  Stats show there IS NOT any genocide of black men or anyone by cops in America.  There are very, very few black men shot by cops in questionable circumstances in America.  Ferguson is one example.  The cop was almost killed and Mike Brown deserved what he got.  The false narrative was that he was knelt down and shot in the back of the head by a racist cop.  Sorry, didn't happen.What does happen is thousands and thousands of young black men murder one another and BLM ignores that horrifying stat
I cannot process this.  Our country voted for a fascist.  Why have so few white men evolved?  I hope that all of the evolved, intelligent white men do not take offense because I do not include you, in fact I love you; but I despise white men.
But my grandson would never do such a thing, I was a good grandmother, I didn't know why he was out that late or where he got that gun, he went to school, he must have been framed. Why is it that the boys are more stupid than the girls? Maybe the girls know who and what is going on but again are afraid enough not to say anything. Where do the guys that have nice clothes and even a car and no job get guns and cell phones, they get it the old fashioned way, they earn them, right?
Hunt those men down and string em up.
Someone wrote that the same people arguing that these girls should have to more effectively cover their midsections are the same people arguing that it is ok for young girls to have to put on a hijab.  I dunno.   In the first place, the hijab argument does not fit with the ten year old girl. Pre-pubescent girls are not required to cover their hair in most Muslim traditions.  But in the second place, is there really no difference between, on the one hand, seeing a seventeen year old with hair reaching from her forehead to her shoulders, and, on the other hand, seeing a seventeen year old's backside who is wearing thong undies under thin sheer leggings?  I have a sneaking suspicion that, if you did a poll of all Canadian mothers, more would be comfortable with seated middle-aged men admiring their teen daughter's hair than with seated middle-aged men admiring their teen daughter's thong-and-legging veneered backsides.  Does that mean all those moms are just sexist and narrow-minded?
Love it!  Alas, though, there are no fun non-derogatory nouns for the male equivalent of tomboy.  My son's choices will be relegated to "sissy"/"mama's boy" or "variant"/"nonconforming".   Yes, he's a "boy" and "human" -- but as you noted, the power of self-identification as something cool and different can be magical.
"Trudeau was portrayed by the Harper Conservatives as too young. The Conservatives ran relentless television ads saying he was “just not ready."  They turned out to be right on the money. A young man who won for his last name only. Not ready then, not ready now. Where's is he anyway, last time I knew he was traveling all over Europe, handing out huge amounts of canadian money, to  dubious feminist, gay and muslim causes. Where's he now?
On top of that, Bannon is the "Breibart man", an "alter-right", white supremacist and racist" entertainer, while Priebus is a part of the "Washington establishment", so much hated by the President Elect. There will be cock fights at the White House and/or, perhaps, a casino or two?
True.  Anyone  that thinks that a boy is simply going to claim that he’s a girl to make the team hasn't thought this thru. This is school where everyone knows everyone. That means that the kid is going to have to live as a girl 24/7. Makeup. Hair. Clothing. No hanging with his male friends. No male sports. Not to mention that he’s just removed himself from the hetero dating pool, pretty much permanently. And that’s not even considering what his former male buds will call him. Gay and fag are among the kinder words. And then we get to the physical bullying - 10% of trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted.
Oh that poor "little (white) guy," when he realized he's really not that different from the poor brown and black people he decided to do what his 1% masters tell him. "Vote for the far-Right," they said. And he's so well-trained he did. He will be rewarded some puppy bites and won't be able to figure out why he's still hungry but he'll wait patiently because master says he'll have his special place in the racial hierarchy. He's so obedient and loyal, the 1% man's best friend.
White privilege is absolute nonsense.  I was raised in a lower middle class family with four brothers.  I worked from the age of 9 as a paperboy up until I could get working papers at 14 and continued working through College.  I paid my own way thru College because my parents did not have any money. I was hired as a Police Officer in 1987 and have worked there since.   I was not given any special treatment, in fact the opposite at the time due to minority hiring practices that required women and minorities to be hired in front of white males, even though the entrance scores on the civil service test could be 30 points less.  I did not have an issue with this, but to claim I had white privilege because I am a white male is ridiculous.   white lash is another made up term by the progressive left.    Can you show me some of the "advantages" that I received as a white male?
The man was murdered you simple minded twit.
The problem is that despite of their relatively small % of the population, statistically young black males commit most violent crimes, leading to under the table profiling, unconstitutional or not. There are no winners in this case, one person is dead an others lives are destroyed. We have to find a workable fix to break this deadly cycle.
Get hold of Marty and get an explanation of the one man riot at O'Brien Creek, booze, screaming, knife, duct tape and AST. The well behaved bears got shot, crazy man gets........?
She just helped our cause for Oleary tremendously. Thanks for reminding us what makes a Marxist Liberal tick You self righteous Liberal people are obnoxious. Signed racist, bigoted, evil, white middle class, no-aligned but soon to be aligned male deplorable
Pro tip, men: If your sexual partner is or becomes unconscious, and you continue having sexual activity with her, YOU ARE A RAPIST.
White evangelical Christians worship the Pussy Grabber In Chief. Gee, I wonder why so many people are checking the None box these days? We just had eight years of a President who was a loyal husband and wonderful father to two daughters. And he never called either one of his daughters and I quote, "A piece of a**" while talking live on the air with Howard Stern. Unlike Trump who has consistently lied, cheated, and disrespected his daughters and three wives FOREVER! Guess Barack Obama's skin was the wrong color to get any respect from evangelicals. If the lying, adulterous, vulgar, tax cheating, racist, misogynist, bigoted, narcissistic, ignorant, draft dodging, boy-man Trump is the new Christian hero, just what kind of Christianity is being practiced in the US nowadays?
Sure, whatever Mr Sanders says. Us conservatives back his longings all the way: naiveté, willful ignorance and blatant stupidity.  You the man, Bernie!
AT:  The "sticks and stones" argument is a weak attempt to excuse verbal attacks on others.  It's much like GBA's favorite "grow some skin".  It's saying it's OK to insult others, to make ad hominem attacks, to make crass, crude remarks.....the recipient should just "tolerate" it. After all,  "sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me".    So, African Americans should tolerate being called N#@%^, women should tolerate being called "C$%%^s", Latinos should tolerate being called "S@#^" or "B$%#", and calling liberals "libtards" is just fine.  Yes, indeed folks, we should all just "man up" and let others insult us all they want.  You don't really mean that, do you?  I'd be interested in your view. thanks, Gary
"Conservatives felt strongly that hanging four men out to die in Benghazi was despicable and we have been severely ridiculed for taking a principled stand."  No, you're ridiculed for your nonstop efforts to use the blood of those men for political gain, when even Republican witch-hunt investigations could find no proof that anything would have changed the outcome that day, and yet you hypocritically say not a peep about all the attacks and deaths on US diplomatic facilities and personnel that happened under Republican administrations. There is nothing principled about your position.
No, but that's not what we're talking about here is it?  Why?  Because someone can't decide to identify as a different race (yet).  Rachel Dolezal gave that a good try though.    Think about this, colleges granting full ride scholarships to the best "female" athletes.  You would have "transgender boys/men" taking sport scholarships from real girls/women because they're better at them is certain sports.    That'd be no different then a Elizabeth Warren being granted teaching jobs at Ivy League schools by falsely claiming she's Native American when she's not.  You liberals better think these ridiculous new "rules and laws" through before blindly going along with them like the sheep you are.
I would bet ten thousand dollars you are a straight white male.
The hospital records in all Hawaii hospitals have been thoroughly searched and they can find no record of Obama's mother ever being admitted to give birth when every one else seems to have a record listed....now to a person with an IQ in the double digits this shows that his record is nothing but a damn fake like he is!  His wife is also a man and no records of their kids birth have ever been found either!
Cute slogan.  After you try hugging the hate out them, maybe the muslim terrorists will let you choose from nail bomb or van assault for your demise.  They have used both means very recently to kill innocent men, women, and children.
These 2 men are a disgrace, they are regional representatives at best, they are not in any capacity fit to govern the WHOLE province. Watch BC tank under these idealistic, unrealistic fools..
Simply because your well-endowed girlfriends (uh, huh) loved to show off their assets when healthy, doesn't mean that a dying (article said "incapacitated") man gets the same thrill.  What a strange argument for viewing a man's private parts at the point of death. Even weirder that you don't know the difference between your friends and people gushing about a corpse.    John didn't say anything about derogatory or nasty.  The comments made are irrelevant.  The invasion of privacy and disrespect for the dignity of someone dying and someone dead is the point.  It's inappropriate, unprofessional, demeaning, and just gross.  There's a name for people who get a thrill from looking at dead people, and it's not a compliment.
AB:  Man, you are one sore loser!
That's hogwash, Hottubjoe! If Christ was against being a critic, his character wouldn't have been so outspoken against corruption in the temples or hearts of men.
Would never vote for ANYONE who supports Trump.  He and Weinstein are two of a kind predators....... Straight out of Trump's Mouth, QUOTING the man who is NOW YOUR PRESIDENT! remember? “I DID try and fuck her.  She was married.  I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there.  And she was married.  Then all of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything.  She’s totally changed her look.  I’ve gotta use some TicTacs, just in case I start kissing her.  You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful—  I just start kissing them.  It’s like a magnet.  Just kiss.  I don’t even wait.  And when you’re a star they let you do it.  You can do anything…  Grab them by the pussy.  You can do anything.”  — The President of the United States of America
I am surprised that only 54% of women reported receiving unwanted sexual advances.  Why?  Because flirtation of various sorts back and forth between women and men happens all the time and is entirely normal and key to our society.  On the other hand, sometimes someone flirts with us or gives us attention we do not want.  Presto, an unwanted sexual advance.  A statistic like this is really nonsense.  If the survey were specific like how many have had their butt grabbed, breasts grabbed, etc., etc., as separate questions then we might learn something meaningful.  If the unwanted sexual advance is simply being asked out on a date, then the situation is utterly hopeless because women and men will always be asking others for dates and sometimes the askee will not be happy about it.  What is different is that feminism has created a generation identity confused.  Sexuality is normal (to a point).  Feminism has taught some women that all male attention to sex is bad.  A losing proposition.
Xenophobic populism and racist fear-mongering  very similar to Hitler in the 30's as he was rising to power. Even more similar to the Copperheads of the Civil War era. That is not an exaggeration. A man who lies every 3 minutes (while campaigning) and who condones sexual assault. Any professor who supports this candidate has somehow missed his own history lessons and definitely does not deserve tenure. This is not about conservative vs. Liberal, This is about demagoguery vs. the US political system.
Good for you, Baltimore and Maryland.  Take all 700 of them down all over the country.  No reason to honor the losing side in a civil war, especially when the confederacy stood for preserving the institution of slavery.  This is history that we'd like to forget.....  and for all those objecting to the removal of history, take a look at Lincoln statutes.  He is white, he won the civil war, he ended slavery, and no one is taking his statutes down. Abraham Lincoln is a white guy, too, but he deserves to be honored, not these confederate losers who represent odious ideas of enslavement and racism.
I was born here.  DD214 with "honorable discharge" on it says I'm an American and don't have to give one runny crap whether you like my religion or not.  Speaking of not understanding things, you should perhaps consider reviewing and ongoing conversation before displaying said lack of understanding, next time.  Not a "strawman" when addressed to Slayer SE, who is an unapologetic white supremacist.  To put it simply, "This is an AB conversation.  C your way out."
Hey Jack Phillips, show me where in the Bible Jesus ever said anything about gay people.  Too many Christians don't seem to have ever actually read the Bible.  It takes a lot of convoluted logic that has been debated as to actual meaning over and over again for the past, at least, 40 years to find any support for the current USA Christian anti-gay bigotry.   The Bible is ambiguous on gay people.  It is not ambiguous about Jesus who it describes as the most saintly person to ever live and seems to have loved everyone purely and defended those downtrodden against hate mongers.  Likewise, there is little ambiguity in the Bible about other rules that homophobic Christians don't seem to care about one hoot:  does Mr. Phillips make cakes for people who violate the sabbath, eat pork, use the Lord's name in vain?  Please stop trying to hide behind religion doctrine that is made up.  Let's call a homophobe a homophobe not a Christian.
Simple and easy plan... it's worked since the dawn of time. Born a women ... use a woman's bathroom. Born a man... use s men's bathroom.   If you can't figure that out... you're about as dumb as they come.  Peace out!!!
I just talked about this on Twitter. Young liberals are going to like his "freestyle", but his actual fans, people that have been supporting him and paying for his music for 18+ years are 28+ year old white males. Mainly the demographic that voted Trump into office. He's going to lose half his fan base with this alienation. He's criticized Trump before, that's fine. But to say you have to choose and if you're hesitant then fuck you? What an idiotic move.  Eminem made me feel like it was okay to be different when I was in 7th grade and now he's making me feel betrayed.  I'm with you bro, F you too Em.
Nobody gives a carp if you find the first ladies attractive. They are not there for your viewing pleasure.  At least not until misogynist MAD MAN tRump came along.
Agree with Rowman.  The baker is ok refusing to make a cake with gay men on the cake, or with swastikas on it, or breasts on it.  It is not ok to refuse to make a cake for a black person, a gay person, an asian, an American Indian ... get it Richard Stacy ?   Tough concept.  I say let him refuse whatever classes of people he wants, and post it in the store prominently ... then ALL reasonable people can avoid him and find a baker that is not a bigot.
You're still going on about this. I wonder if you  follow everyone's posts as thoroughly as you've followed mine. What do want from me?    Okay, I checked up-thread. Yes, it was jettavrsix who first mentioned height, but he did NOT suggest that tall men are "bad boys." What he implied, in actuality, was that they're "shitty men." So, I got the wording wrong. My bad.   Is this what you wanted to hear?
Man the whores...I mean man the oars...
About this story, the only thing that can be said with any degree of certainty is that this man is jaw droppingly stupid.
There is no amount of facts that justify leveraging a terrorist attack into political attacks before the bodies are even wrapped up and carted off of the streets. No real analysis can be done in that short amount of time and no honorable or decent leader would open with an attack before at least addressing the very real human loss that occurred. Mourning and comfort first, BS political attacks after that. If the killer in this case was a 64 year old white man with a gun, you and others would be in this forum countering gun legislation arguments before they're even made under the false premise of not wanting to politicize the attack.   Trump may or may not be right about the law. Given his previous lies and attacks in the wake of one of these massacres, though, I somewhat doubt it. Either way, blaming Schumer solely for a law that was also approved by Dick Armey and signed into law by George H. W. Bush is disingenuous at best, disgustingly opportunistic at worst. An embarrassment.
It is more socially acceptable to be gay than to be white or male. Ultimately being a white male gets me accused of being racist by the BLM Pride Committee (with the tacit agreement of Tory, Wynne Trudeau and Wong Tam)  despite being gay and non malicious.
A yesterday man comes to visit a useless man/ child.
The man has some money to burn, stupidly, he is despised by the Socialists he supports and his crony money river doesn't run by his home anymore.  He is an example how corruption can make a stupid person very rich.
With friends like that who needs enemies? The devilish White man has a propensity for violence and bloodshed. Without violence and genocidal murder there would be no United Snakes of AmeriKKKa.
Sooner or later Feminist writers will need to admit that the men's movement MGTOW is growing every day in every country in the west and women have only themselves to blame. Men are not only turning off marriage but relationships as a whole. 60-70% of men aged between 20-40 in japan do not want a relationship and is cited as the reason why the population will halve by 2050. Unless columns like this mention MGTOW you will have no hope of realising that dream of a white wedding as there are consistent reasons why men list for going MGTOW. Financial rape from family court and DV and child abuse through parent alienation that is endorsed by the community. Hope you idiots have kids to pay for my retirement. Enjoy your cats company ladies, i gone my own way and could not be happier.
I can't believe you would compare your girlfriend's enjoyment in men commenting on her breasts (as if that even applies to anyone else) to nurses in a hospital viewing/gawking at an incapacitated man's genitals. I seriously question your maturity if not critical thinking capacity.
The right-wing misogynists on here have proven the writer correct.  There are still many cowardly men in Canada who fear strong women.  Pathetic.
Perhaps you could substitute the word male (or men) in the article for women or blacks, or Muslim.
If one were to take the opinion of the Globe at face value, we should just listen to the feminists and keep all men locked up in cages from birth and exterminate the ones with poor genes that express masculinity.  Because, hey.  Men only invented: Space travel, computers, smart phones, facebook, the internet, the car, electricity, light bulbs, concrete condo towers, electrical transformers, and defended the freedom of the world.  What good are we, we're just a bunch of peices of crap.   Ugh.  I'm tired of reading this feminist crap.
If your mentally ill presidential imposter were correct, then why did the generals and the military ignore his idiotic tweet?   Trumplethinskin will be shown the door, one way or another. You're in a small minority of Trump KKKoolaid drinkers who were conned and don't see it yet. But Republicans are waking up and realizing a mad man is in the Whitehouse.   Oh.. tRump's tweet you quote has been proved incorrect. Just another lie to distract his poorly educated voters from the reality of a failed (and most likely illegitimate) presidency.
Wow it comes to this shooting a child ... I know Brandon as a young man that my daughter went to school at Clark Middle school I call this young my man son very nice caring young man you shot someone just because he look at you the judge need to put you under the jail  it's not good to take someone life what happen to old days in using your hands I call a person that use a gun are bitches
And the ugly reality of CIA black ops being financed with drug money, the equally ugly "coincidence" of a new heroin epidemic and our ongoing involvement in Afghanistan---All hiding with the chickenhawks like the cowards they are; behind young men and women, many of whom actually want to serve our country...It's a shame in which both parties share the blame.  It's time for change.
"Whether you think the person you elected is racist or sexist doesn't really matter. "  Actually, the line above coming from a supposed progressive non-sexist, non-racist white man is, in my opinion, perhaps the biggest problem.    Yes - It does matter that you think the person you elected is racist or sexist.    Sexism and Racism cause poverty, violence, jealousy, rage, rape, and wealth disparity in our government, businesses and schools, and divide a people who would otherwise grow peacefully together, creating a country with a well founded stable economy, and low unemployment, and even better health physically for all its citizens.    Like in our church, those who see the wrong of sexism and racism must stop petting the haters on their heads, and fight like hell against them instead.  Otherwise we end up with an unjust, and divided country and church for everyone.
I'd say the division is between Sensus Fidelium and the Hierarchy and their rich 'hangers-on.' Millions of ordinary Catholics witnessed what their parents went through, as outlined by justmaybe above. (And you forgot about the names being called out about who put what in the collection the week before. And 'Benny-addiction' on Sundays.)  They saw the damage they inflicted on their parents and grandparents. They feel utterly betrayed by a succession of Popes and spineless Cardinals over the abuse crisis.   The conservatives love to blame the VII clergy for the abuse. (It wasn't.) But the one thing that cannot be denied is that the cover up was perpetrated by JPII / Benedict's men. Every single one of them was appointed by those two.  The thought that the People of God will accept a return to that is risible.  Cardinals and Bishops would do well to wisen up soon.
Several of the comments below are absolutely right on target!  How disingenuous can these men get??  But why are we surprised?   I was unaware of the depth of the Roman Catholic effort on behalf of Donald Trump until several random events brought the sad reality home to me.  First, during an Italian language class, an attendee arrogantly asked our professor, "how can a person call himself a Catholic and vote Democratic?" It became quite apparent in the ensuing discussion that this man had been TAUGHT this position by his parish! Secondly, my 90 year-old, Catholic but socially liberal-minded mother was ready to vote for Trump because she feared committing a sin! The third and final nail in this cross was the report by a recent Vietnamese immigrant, the father of a Catholic priest,  that the only person in his family eligible to vote voted for Trump.  SHAME on this "church!"  The disgraceful, unchristian, reprehensible campaign against Hillary Clinton will cause more pain and suffering!
I pass by this place to and from work every day and noticed the new art this morning! Hopefully, Lars Larson won't get wind of this. He and his Trump-sucking listeners all have a major hard-on for murals of Black men.
The first thing the cops did after they shot him was yell for handcuffs while he lay motionless on the ground. Then they hand-cuffed a black man dying of a gunshot wound.  To give the cop some credit, he only shot him once. That really angers me.   The other day in Tulsa they stood around and watched a black man die.  There's some real cop bad conduct going on here.  Anyone can carry a gun in that state.  It's common for people to conceal a small gun with an ankle holster like.....white people.
"Boy Wonder." You killed it.
(cont)  Goldberg is so excited over an opportunity to attack Ms Clinton and, by extension, all liberals, that he ignores the glaring differences between role expectations and life experiences which result in those statistics showing men are more violent than women in our country.  Consequently, he ends up looking foolish and incompetent.   Gary Crum
Sure, in the uncivilized world, AIDS is widespread among men and women.  So how do you account for the disparity between men who have sex with men and heterosexuals in the civilized western world?
How racist to mention this man is a Muslim.
Freeman was a disgrace to the men who wore the HFD during his period   He's a convicted Felon , car thief , chop shop  and other illegal activity. It was amazing how long the  authorities took to put this guy in prison. He belongs there for life. A piece of  Sh-t.  Once again he was no HFD  fireman , just scum of the earth. A bad Hombre.
The last thing that's needed is a representative of the Catholic Church to debate Martin, as if that person would not be sympathetic as a member of the homosexual brotherhood that is promoting Martin's propaganda.    Voris is precisely the man that needs to be heard on the matter:  He's well-versed and he's a recovering homosexual.
"Only old white men'  Seems like a rather racist statement.
And this article referred to it as "alpha".    This kind of crap is what is pulled by zeta males operating under toxic masculinity who think behavior like 45*'s is the way "real men" behave.
Deport these guys. Oh wait they are upper class white men. Well shame on me because fron reading responses on crime I thought only minorities committed these types of crime. Silly me.
Wow where did GM get this ignoramus of a hack calling athletes louts and saying Rousey is a feminist agent of change to MMA savagery -- she's the most unsportsman-like figure in all of MMA everybody is glad she's gone, she wouln't even shake girls' hand before fights and when women' MMA caught up with the men she got ploughed by everybody.       So you got an ignoramus to write his personal prejudices about a sport a few old people who read GM and have never been interested in anyway.    Look at the sportmanship between MMA fighters you imbecil, hate is rare in MMA unlike boxing, they fight like athletes and then they hug it out and shake hands...but there's no convincing you is there?   YOUR MIND IS ALREADY MADE UP SO YOUR EYES SEE NOTHING.   IDIOT.   unlike many other sports where a couple of wimps play and then act all sore and filled with injured ego when they lose.  Pfff.    Wow.
This is what happens when you treat women as less than human and don't ordain them the same as men.    Nothing says, I hate you, in Christianity, more than watching a parish needlessly close because the women God called to be ordained and lead those parishes are deemed obviously too unworthy and unsacred to be allowed to keep them alive, or even cause them to grow and gain more Christian souls to the fold and to God.    Married priests are not a bad idea, as long as they only come, after women being ordained priests, without any restriction to becoming Bishops, Cardinals and Popes.    Ordaining only married men to priesthood would be an extreme sin against Justice who is God and the Human Dignity of all women, as it would represent outright Gender Segregation in our church, giving all authority and sacred powers to all men over all women.  These suggestions are the problem with our church not the answer.   Sexism is hate in all of its forms and Jesus condemns it in all Gospels.
No,you're totally wrong.Stats prove 20% smoked pot in the last year, that is just smoked-not regular users. About 5-10% of the population are regular smoker,and you wrongfully assume they are all men. Some guys play video games,but its a small percentage compared to the percentages of women that watch TV, spend hours on Facebook/Instagram/etc. So Facebook is better than games? There are more unemployed women than men,and are more unfit and overweight women than men. More women are educated,but they are usually educated in liberal arts crap,or other useless things and are working in stores...whereas guys take practical education.
Let me guess: Your'e an angry feminist with a bone to pick with white men.
This entire assault ordeal reeks of a spoiled, privileged celebrity accusing a man who did not do this at all of misconduct. The photo shown on the internet of Muellers hand behind Swift proves nothing. She is smiling in the photo. I have no respect for Swift embarking on a mission to ruin this man's job and life. I have a relative who is wrongfully being accused of similar and is in the middle of a court case for something of which he is totally innocent.In the meantime due to media he has lost his job just like this poor man.Innocent until proven guilty? Bull.the USA has become a joke in some aspects of law. It is too damned easy nowadays to have someone convicted of a sexual act of which one is innocent. I think Swift is full of it and I believe the DJ and his girlfriend. Swift needs to back the heck off.If she doesn't want this guy around her anymore fine but she needs to stop ruining him. she needs to work meager jobs like most people of the world and come back to earth.
The Observer: That's like me saying why I'm not surprised when a child is killed by a white man who is also a sex perp.
Black males are 80 times more likely to be shot by other black males than by a cop of any colour.  Experience teaches us many things, but you don't want the police to learn anything from what they  experience daily .
This is a very stupid man who calls the inauguration his coronation.  Building a wall?  Lame brained tweeter.  He's setting it up to enrich his son's via their construction business, i.e., himself.
There's no grouping, clueless!!!  Check out the FACTS, which apparently don't fit your liberal views.  70% out of wedlock birth rate among young black females and to many of the males leaving them alone.  Black on black crime rate up double digits in Chicago in 2017 alone!!  And the lists go on and on.  I'm no where near as ignorant and arrogant as you sound!!!  Just so you know I was born into a military family and was going to the same schools, riding the same buses, walking the same streets, scout troops, sports and eating in the same lunch rooms as blacks, Hispanics and Asians.  And this was in the 50's & 60's, long before you ever saw the first minority.  And guess what clueless??  We  got along, because we "all" were held to the same standards expected of military personal/dependents living on base or in the surrounding areas.  Just a little personal knowledge and experience!!
More grand schemes filling the airwaves and pages issuing from the mouth and fingers of a maniacal madman on a par with Hitler, Mao, Stalin, et.al. of the past.  The same mentality of a diseased mind willing to condemn the world to poverty and strife.  Leading a Republican party completely traitorous to the Constitutional Republic and all human right contained therein.  A Republican party devoted to establishing fascist theocracy led by a Kakistocracy leading to a Kleptocracy of corporate dictators reigning supreme over all other humans.  All created within the minds of think tankers paid by the Billionaire Barons to dredge up the past insanities successfully destroying entire nations for the profits of war.  The Republican party has declared itself as completely traitorous to our nation and most of the civilized world.  The nominees for president, to a man, certified their traitorous intent.  Time for a revolution removing all Republican traitors from government.
Jesse Jackson is a politician. Al Sharpton is a minister. Neither one is anywhere near as bigoted as you. And in the Jim Crow South, lynching of black men, often following their genital mutilation, was done thousands of times, with many photographs of whole white families, men women and children, pointing and laughing at the hanging corpse. Real family entertainment, post-Reconstruction and continuing into the 1960's.   (  Allen, James. "Musarium: Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America")   Benjamin Tillman, governor of South Carolina and later a United States Senator:  "We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men, and we never will. We have never believed him to be the equal of the white man, and we will not submit to his gratifying his lust on our wives and daughters without lynching him."    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching
While making his propaganda film, the man did not learn the lessons from Auschwitz. Yes it is good to have a strong army to protect ourselves and defend other who need help. Nazi Germany  was not in response to an invading army. The horror was it's own government and army turned on it's own people and then turned on other countries. They murdered their own people, Jews. Not because of an invasion, but because of fear, prejudice and hate. They demonized the Jews, intellectuals and others (press) and blamed them for their economic  and other societal problems. Then they invaded other countries and imported more people to kill. Substitute Muslim for Jew. His demonization of another faith proves the man learned nothing.  How pathetic. And embarrassing.
As much as I would love to agree with you on that, we should not be so ignorant as to blame one man. Yes he's thrown a monkey wrench in everything but we as a people and a society must be responsible for ourselves. I am sure you have relatives that throw the n word out like it's nothing, but it is that ignorance on our part that we must change by ourselves before it's too late. Again I would love to blame him but the reality is we all have a part to play. Other than that you are 100% correct.
Psychopathic con man. That's the precedent.
Tony, so good to finally hear from my silent stalker.  First off, Bill Clinton was terrible.  Bill Clinton may have been a disgusting man lacking morals, but he actually was draft eligible, unlike your draft dodging coward Trump.  Bill Clinton received deferrments, just like Trump. But in the Fall of 1969, Bill Clinton entered the draft and was eligible. His number was never called.  Get it? No?  Why are trying to say it is okay for Trump to be a draft dodging coward by pointing at the very disgusting Bill Clinton? That is li,e saying since Hillary is a murderer (she is) then it would be omay for Tru p to be a draft dodging cowardly rapist.  Is that what you are doing? Okay, now why do you support a draft dodging coward like Trump?  Maybe it would be better if you go back to being a silent stalker? Unless you want to explain why you support a draft dodging coward like Trump.
Lets discuss the sexual orientation of  feminists who believe this. It would of course outrage them that they would be talked about  same terms they denounce men.
Boy these women are all now piling on.  Where were they before this all became public.  They all knew what a scumbag Weinstein was but elected to say nothing. Now it is easy to speak out when they have nothing to lose. Typical Hollywood hypocrites.
Yes the language is unclear, but the message is very clear - the Vatican hierarchs do not want gay men in the priesthood period.   This is the proverbial nail in the coffin on vocations for an organization that does not ordain women or generally allow married men.    When I walked out the door of the Roman Catholic Church, I have never looked back.    I love many Catholics, but the Roman Catholic Church is a misogynist and homophobic institution that has oppressed different groups for centuries.   It is dying out in the west, and will eventually only exist in developing countries.   Gay Christians  will find a home in the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and the United Church of Christ where they are generally welcomed in the ministry.
No, no, no!    Haven't you been keeping up?  Trump is now confirming that man-made climate change is a fact.  It's being caused by radical Islamic terrorists.
I'm afraid I'd rather take someone I don't care for over a complete, blabbering, racist moron. I know white men don't have very much to lose, but if you have any women or people of color in your small worlds- please reconsider burning ours down, will you? Make America Great Again? You mean back when your granddaddies got to go a-lynchin? Or maybe before your mothers got the vote? Yeah, real great.
Why did these women go willing into a room alone with Cosby? Did they not know black men have big schlongs and practice rough sex with drugs? Were they looking for pay-4-play money action? Quaaludes were very popular during those days and were used as payment for sax just like cocaine, pot, heroin, etc. Why didn't they report their rapes at the time it happened instead of now when everybody is claiming it. Opportunistic lottery ticket? That 15 year old. What was she doing in a Playboy mansion. Wanted to be sexy woman and was willing to take drugs and be a playmate like all the beautiful pin up stars? Is there a thrill about being stoned out paralyzed and being raped by a black man with a humongous flagpole? Something like a sexual fantasy like bondage, whipping, and wearing shiny black vinyl bikinis like in Bangkok? I think Cosby's going to be acquitted.
The man is a total idiot and a buffoon.  I can't believe he doesn't look in the mirror and start laughing.  Of course, he has no sense of humor so he probably doesn't ever laugh.
LMAO...what on god's green earth makes you think i  am speaking of you when  my post to motley said "Main Man" .   remember...i referred to you as a "little man" in response to a post of yours....as i recollect .  lol - frankly CUE..i barely think of you as a man at all...and never unless it's reading one of your  ridiculous posts.
The support for Trump by white evangelicals says more about their Christian faith than it does about Trump. He knows and likes being a con man. He also loves the "poorly educated" white folks that elected him. The Trump voters care much more about being white than being Christians, Americans, or being human beings. This works for them, since they don't believe in facts. They have faith, ideology, fear, hate, and racism to inform them about how the world works. Too bad that the "poorly educated" white folks that elected Trump will suffer the most during his administration. When has he ever cared about any of  them? Trump is a tall, rich, lazy, fat, white man that has not respect for anyone that he doesn't agree with him. That goes double if those folks aren't white males. Too bad Trump cares about his voters less than he cares about the contractors he has stiffed. Trump voters will deserve what happens to them. Maybe some bleeding heart white liberals will care about them in 2020.
go peddle your white man's guilt elsewhere.
Man has brought this upon himself...we can't mindlessly overpopulate the earth and expect there to be no consequences.  As soon as humans die out, everything else in the universe will be better off.  Sad.
The bishops have no credibility where family life let alone family planning are concerned. They resent he pew people flagrantly acting according to their consciences rather than kowtowing to the clerics. No businessman is going to increase his insurance costs by eliminating a benefit which actually reduces insurance payouts. Eliminating contraception increases health insurance risk and that increases premiums. Trump is either too stupid or too cynical to admit to this but his benefactors (financial as well as philosophical) like the idea that men can once again control women's options.
We need legislation that works and  is supported by facts and evidence, not stupid little stunts because "huh-huh, like, 420, man. get it? Huh-huh". And I am very pro-legalization. Disappointing and childish, something that can be said for most of the Trudeau Government so far.
While I condemn violence against women in all its forms, no matter who the perpetrators are, there is a major difference between men who commit violence against women in the west, as compared to violence committed against women in Islam. For one, men who abuse women in the west, do it alone, there is not generally family members involved.  In fact, the evidence shows that a man who is abusive tries to isolate the woman from family & friends in order to hide the abuse & emotional manipulation.  In Islam, as your article has pointed out, family members are complicit in the abuse & murder & have no issues with carrying out the acts, even mothers of the girls.  Women in Islam who report abuse are shunned by their families & communities, are the ones blamed for causing the aggression in the first place. In the west, the taking of a life is murder no matter what the reason & punished accordingly. Islam does not recognize murder of women because it is their fault for "shaming" the family.
Absolutely senseless. That man had to be a sociopath...
Suggest you check with a Muslim scholar.  You're wrong. It's a fashion imposed by insecure, small-minded, misogynic imbeciles, precisely the type males the progressive world, including our Feminist PM, will shun in a heartbeat. They treat women as chattels, ignore their basic human rights, subjugate them and their daughters from morning to night.  They are barbaric in outlook with scant respect for human life.  Their views toward women are abhorrent.
LOL  Really !  Today in Finland a man yelling in Arabic stabbed 8 people killing two of them .  There are only a few white supremacists . There are billions who  are Islamist's
You mean like how they are taught by black thugs, since those black fathers are missing, or how far too many young men and women are indoctrinated in the strict version of Islam and Sharia Law. Any thoughts about those people, or are they off limits because of color or religion.  They are according to dishonest, PC & cowardly liberals!!
So if a man leaves he's a loser and if she leaves him...he's a loser. I wonder how eager all those women would be to leave their men if their husbands got custody 12 times to 1 in a skewed family court system. I wonder how eager they would be to end those relationships if they were saddled with the mortgage on the home they could never set foot in again or were stuck paying support to their "independent" ex. Can't help notice that modern women enjoy pretending to be tall while standing on the state's shoulders.
Republicans need to stop making excuses for this mentally ill man.
I’m mad at Hillary for not follow the rules and getting her private server hack and possibility costing lives and lying about it. Also I’m mad the DMC is just as incompetent. Next post try to keep the macho “be a man crap” out of it Michael, it’s the internet and anybody can act tough behind their computer, it makes you look pathetic.
Man o man we've got two real live ones going at it, an amazing world when two loudmouths can start this much trouble.  I will say this for Trump at least he hasn't tied people to the muzzles of anti-aircraft guns and blown them to bits. And as the story goes the Rocket Man captured a group of young girls and used them as sex slaves. If one refused, they vanished to who knows where and when he tired of one he gave her to his underlings.  So I guest Trump is the blustery man and Jung is the mad despot
This wiccan who is married to a FtM trans man says thank you. You may not support us but you agree that those people are lunatics.
I love all these men in the comments that are telling women how they should feel about working with someone that has bragged about getting away with sexual assault. Trump stated he could grab them by the p***y.   Would you let your daughter go to work for someone that said that? Would you force your wife/mother to do so?   This comment section for the most part is just a bunch of Mansplaining.
Typical behavior from the coward. All talk and no action. He always loses the tough guy attitude when he is face to face with people he criticizes from afar. Useless boy blunder.
This is getting ridiculous to air every minor allegation to ever have occurred. Maybe the media should start a Hollywood list of men who haven’t been accused of sexual harassment.   Or to make it even mildly interesting, document the victim’s retaliation.  Such as: “Movie Set Nobody Slaps Star in the Face for Pinching Buttocks (oh, and it happened thirty years ago)”
"Wise men don't need advice. Fools won't take it." Benjamin Franklin  Imagine the words out of the mouth of DJT as he stands before the Senate Impeachment Trial, pleading without an attorney (probably twitting) lies & gibberish that further diminishes any case he thinks he may have.
Should I remind you and very other bigot here that Dylann Roof, a self-avowed White Nationalist and supporter of the KKK, is not sorry for what he did. He shot and killed 9 good Black Americans who had just bowed their heads and closed their eyes to pray. Then Roof unloaded 77 bullets into them. There's your hate-born and raised white man.
Are you supposed to be a journalist, Lizzy Acker? Does the truth mean anything to you? If you were assaulted by a black man, and the police asked you for a description of your assailant, would you say he was white? Would it be racist to say he was black?  You're so busy slapping labels on other people and their comments try this one, and see if it fits you: fascist.  By the way, I don't believe for a second that you are graciously keeping up these comments you have deemed "racist" just to show you're not a censor. No, dear. You left those comments up because your new comment system hasn't been generating as many comments as you would like.  I know this because I, like other commenters here, have received e-mails from "Civil Comments" inviting me to post more comments.
Clueless. The use of "fag" is intended to be the worst insult one can spew. "Do better than that?" Camaraderie? Is that what the bullies are saying when they pass the nerdy, quiet, feminine boy in the hall and call him "fag"? That he can do better?  You're completely clueless.
This is the stupidest policy I have heard about in the last year - and there have been some real winners!  I wonder what it will be like for tranny women wrestling in men;s wrestling.  Upon a loss will she/he/it cry rape or sexual assault?  This reminds me of the old USSR "women" in the olympics with beards longer than their testicles.  How is it fair for a girls basketball team to play 5 boys who say they are women?
Richard, your silly story word salad of male bathroom users in this nation now all of a sudden invading female bathrooms dressed as females is ridiculous. Transgender people have been around since the dawn of man. In many old cultures they are revered and share the family duties when I comes to child care, housekeeping and cooking. So transgender people have decided that they, according to the God Squad, are a new breed of humans who just recently are invading the restrooms of America seeking sexual pleasure. Who gets attacked more for sex, women by men or women getting attacked by men dressed as women? . A recent study in America that I read this week states that women are more at high risk of getting sexually assaulted, physically assaulted or murdered by their male spouses or boyfriends.  The article came with a photo of a dead woman lying under a white sheet in a parking having been recently shot and killed by her husband. No doubt similar to the ones we see daily.
Maybe fish and wildlife should perch him in a tree and shoot him. The man is a total idiot.
Really Mike?  Maybe they don't do that so they can avoid paying 18 years of child support for a one night fling.  Men need to get beyond the call of their genitals.  It would help things immensely whether they were gay or straight.
you little censor hungry peasants working for minimum wage over there must be on cloud 9 whenever your masters print one of these boring wannabe sensationalist muslim stories. I want to see you continue to do that: keep simple and small, keep running to mommy and daddy to shelter your precious fragile minds. it bemuses beyond your comprehension - how wantonly self destructive you are. go ahead, invite daddy under the covers there with you, i know you can keep the secret - go ahead and have no other sexual experience until you are gifted to the old hairy bozo down at the used car dealership, enjoy that old world misogyny while you trumpet the open society and tolerance. and you know what? when the war DOES happen, i wont return your pettiness and scorn in kind - i, the big, strong, intelligent, successful white man, WILL rescue you, like i always have. im bigger than you, its just that simple. now go ahead and continue playing in your little mind control sand box. i will allow it.
Excuse me, Extremely Stupid and Uneducated Person, not of Ametican Origin, but frm a foreign country who knows nothing of the US Constitution:  US LAW states: a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.  So , all Americans are of the militia.
I don't hunt anything for sport--is contrary to the mandates of my Islamic faith. When I hunted fowl, I did so to eat them.  Same for fish.  When I hunt invasive felines, it's to help preserve the environment.  I realize that talking sense to Peter Springer's zombiefied 'no-kill' extremists is a waste of time, but here's a suggestion:  I'm by no means the only, or even the biggest, omnivore where I live.  Come visit the other non-contiguous US state.  Some of these large omnivores are still out and about--a man jogging with his dog was attacked by one in Seward just yesterday.  I can probably direct you to one within about two blocks of my house.  Go up to said omnivore and lecture it on how 'bad' it is for ripping the roe out of a gasping mama salmon's belly, or pulling down a cute li'l baby moosie to eat.  Be advised said omnivore may vigorously express its disagreement on your person--up to and including killing and eating you.  Silly of them, but that's how they are...
So, we will have overt, systemic discrimination introduced by the federal government against white males, favouritism for females of any colour, and no new money.    All the researchers who blindly welcomed this government in are waking up to the ugly hangover that they were duped.  Mr. Trudeau pledged an innovation budget but provided zero new dollars for the universities that produce innovation.  Now Duncan cherrypicks the most questionable aspects of the Naylor report as her targets.    Canada will far farther and father behind its global competitors.  Mr. Trudeau's election will become a day all scientists will rue.
"...We have shown that man and shown the administration respect for six months, and all we’re getting in return is a lack of respect, derision and bullying.”..." 93% of CNN reports on Trump have been certified negative.  They are just a reflection of the negative press and utterly false media being used against the administration.  This guy can't see the forest for the trees and we are supposed to depend on his "reporting". What a big wuss.
Trump is an idiot, white people are racist, and men are all pigs....there, that should make it through the denver post civil "moderators"
" Muslim men have been committing huge numbers of rapes since Sweden made the mistake of admitting so many members of a 'rape culture' into their country."  --  Got stats to back up that outrageous claim?  Here, learn something:  https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/swedens-rape-crisis-isnt-what-it-seems/article30019623/  http://www.thedailybeast.com/are-migrants-really-raping-swedish-women
Note that neither you nor your Mother Jones article substantiate Moss Dulet's claim that "Muslim men have been committing huge numbers of rapes since Sweden made the mistake of admitting so many members of a 'rape culture' into their country."  The Overall Crime Rates By Area Of Origin cited has crime rates of immigrants from South America in the same range (15% - 20%) as those from South Central Asia, East Africa and the Middle East (old stats).  And the more recent stats on Offences Against Individual Persons essentially unchanged since 2005.  Try again?
At this stage in the Trump presidency, there is nothing more pitiful than someone with the handle "rationalis" attempting to make excuses for the most vile, corrupt man to ever occupy the office! Go get some help!
A shameful disgrace. Walker, who campaigned on a promise not to touch the dividend, unilaterally taxes every man, woman, and child in the state $1000. And what does the Alaska Senate do? Not a damn thing. THESE PEOPLE NEED TO GO. Vote them out when re-election time comes.
It seems like some people want to abolish all the well established procedural safe guatds built into the criminal justice system designed to protect the accused from wrongful conviction soley for the crime of sexual assault. The way the law is headed an angry woman can ruin an innocent man's reputation, destroy him financially, and take away his freedom for a very long time simply by making a a baseless sexual assault allegation. I question if in this day age it is worth the risk for a man to have intimate relations with the opposite sex. If i had a son I would advise him to avoid relationships and  to focus on improving himself intellectually, spiritually, financially and physically. If he had sexual  urges I would advise him to look at porn and get it out of his system and then get back to self improvement.
Not if they are White gay men
Life choices mean nothing to this under represented nonsense. Life doesn't have to be a friggin parity. Men are under represented in college enrollment and graduation these days, yet I hear nothing about that. The double standard of this thought process is apparent.
You are obviously a man - arrogant and clueless, typical SA macho type
He is a sawed off berkely idiot with little man syndrome. Just the facts
Had this same sequence occurred with my cat or dog, this man would be dead. I have a concealed permit, and if he refused to let go of my animal, I would have shot him right then and there.
Immoral, disgusting men is the culture at faux "news." They have been bleating bitter for the past week about how disgusting Weinstein is (which he is), while ignoring the bonfire in their own back yard. Their hypocrisy could gag a maggot.
It's misogynistic because they don't see men and women as equal. Obviously feminists can't be good mothers or wives.
People know that a large percentage of the clergy are gay. These guidelines make the Church look ridiculous and dishonest. And the ones attributed to Benedict are clearly from a man filled with self loathing and in deep denial. He pontificated on all of this while wearing Dorothy's ruby slippers.   But at least the seminaries will be greener places and they'll plant trees. They'll probably plant them in threes.
Bill Clinton, a horrible man, was draft eligible in 1969 after he recieved numerous deferments like Trump.  Trump got a doctor to lie so he could dodge draft eligibility entirely.  Is that the best you can do? Trump is a coward compared to Bill Clinton.  Let that wash all over you, then ask yourself why you support a draft dodging coward.
So after everything that's happened I'm trying to see if I got a grasp on the issue: 1- In Charlottesville, the left said the right is full of Nazi's and white supremacists 2- They made a big deal our of that fact and they continue to call the conservatives Nazi's. 3- They've been protesting the hate coming from the right (as white supremacists) 4- They, the left, attack a man because he's a Trump supporter 5- They attack him because he's wearing a MAGA hat and an Israeli flag...and he's conservative 6- They heckle him and tell him to "get the F**k out"  It would appear the HATE is all on the left not the right. I don't agree with white supremacists or Nazi's or BLM for that matter. This country allows freedom of speech and the way one dresses is a form of speech, so allow it! The right has as much right to voice their opinion as the left does and no one has the right to attack the other just because they disagree with what's being said!
No listen, he said it to a woman. If he had said it to a man I might (likely not unless they were personal friends) agree with editorial, but he went after a 'weaker-than'. He is a blight on all of us. A coward who would not say it to a man but figured he had an opportunity to let fly with a weaker female. He is pathetic and absolutely should not be in authority anywhere. As a man I say this.
Not a peep! Those Antifa were throwing feces and urine at people, Liberal Journalists were attacked.  That is a Bio-Terrorists attack.  Remember when Antifa blocked an ambulance that needed to be re-routed and this delay caused a death.  No word from G&M.  Or the brutal death of a white couple, in Kentucky, raped, hacked, burnt, bleached or the white man who was pulled out of his car and beat by BLM.  These Leftists are the same group who will gladly destroy private property, kill Police officers in a cowardly fashion and pepper spray girls point black.  They are the true bigots and by far the most dangerous.  Lawlessness, Godless and full of hate.  Odd that Obama didn't get this kind of treatment when Lakeisha Holloway drove over people in Las Vegas because she was "frustrated" and killed a young woman in 2015; or when Abdul Razak Ali Artan drove over people and then got out to stab some at Ohio State last November but then again Barry couldn't be bothered to attend NO after the flood
Monte,  These verses precede the Lev 24 text quoted above:  "And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp; And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the LORD, and cursed."  The LORD told Moses to have those that heard him curse lay their hands upon him and then the accusers were to stone him.     Was this influencing your thinking when you opined?  '...aliens should have the same legal rights as citizens.'
Masculinity is now toxic ? Wtf did I just read ? This piece is absolute garbage! So is the message we should all be feminine because somehow feminine qualities are superior? It’s now ok to bash all men in general because of the actions of a few powerful ones ? Sexism as plain as day ! I haven’t read such an arrogant , condescending steaming pile like this fake journalism in a long time . If this were about women and feminine qualities being negative , this waste of space article would never have seen the light of day . So ignorant .
Regarding :" gay culture" - This old phrase, 'particular friendships', might best explain what the old men in the Holy See want to address. - That is, secular clerics, as well as consecrated men and women, must avoid an, albeit natural, human tendency to have friends that are just like themselves.  That is, they do not have an 'open' approach to relationships and thus act in an exclusionary manner. - In houses of consecrated religious, 'particular friendships', raise suspicions, isolated one religious from another and thus are divisive. - More diffused, but just as apparent, secular clerics who have 'particular friends' limit their own ability to be a brother to the brothers and sisters of Christ. - So, this document is best read if 'gay' or 'homosexual' is replaced with human.
We didn't. The idiot president man child did.
The reporters desperately try to paint this as an anti-Muslim hate crime, but in the story we see that it was not.  "Before the stabbing the assailant on the train was ranting on many topics."  “He was talking about a lot of different things, not just specifically anti-­Muslim.”  The people stabbed were not Muslims.  They were apparently just random people trying to quiet down the disturbed person.  "Police don’t know if the man has mental health issues or if he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time."  Nevertheless, the usual gaggle of commenters here are blaming Trump.
Speaking of sexy locker room comments, has this author ever been to a La Leche League get together and hear other young females talking about their new nursing sized boobs? It's a new world moment for these female mommas.  HA-HA. VANITY SECRET.  It ain't hard to get favors or "honey-dos" from "daddy" when he sees "mommy" in her new bra size!  All "mommy" has to do is hang her bra on the shower curtain ... or casually take a slightly longer walk wearing no blouse in the master bedroom.  Ya gotta love women.  They're worth the trouble men have to listen to when women "bitch about men's sexual locker room talk".  ALL should please notice ... that the word "bitch" refers BOTH to (1) an unhappy woman and (2) complaining in a nagging manner!  Men, on the "utter-hand" are boars ... and BORES (or not listened to) when they express themselves!  YA GOTTA LOVE WOMEN BITCHING ABOUT MEN!!!  WOW.  Is real life as human animals ... really so one-sided ... about clumsy sexual locker room talk?  REALLY
Exactly Muslims advocate the killing of non converts infidels if you will. They advocate child abuse buggery and male supremacy.
Women do not do anything better than men except get pregnant and give birth.  They don't raise children better or nurture better, we are not better parents.  This is more nonsense designed to justify sexism in our church.  Men don't represent Jesus Christ better, therefore there is no reason to keep women from ordination as priests, bishops, cardinals or popes period.  To insist upon highlighting every flesh difference one group has verses another in hopes of making others see that group as more different and therefore in need of restrictions is  a form of hatred.  Whites have done this to blacks and so has our church done this to blacks.   People do this to justify ethnic disparity of treatment as well.  Any discrimination done against a group of people based on flesh is an attack against that group's human dignity and all Christians must stand against the individual who purports this hatred no matter who they are and critique that person's behavior for the sake of that person's soul.
I don't blame you for leaving. Canada is no longer a place for people who have a competitive spirit or who are smart. It's also no longer a place where the middle class can work hard to get ahead, especially if you're white or male. We attract the down trodden, or the Chinese with money to invest to make a killing but that's it.
Japan did however have a problem with domestic terrorism with their own citizens releasing poison gas in train stations a while back.  The US had a problem in the 80's and 90's with White Christian Males.  Then there were the IRA bombing in the UK for decades.  Terrorism is nothing knew and now it just happens that if you are a Muslim it is a terrorist act, but anything else it is a mad man, - personally I don't think there is any difference between the man who shoot up his former work place in FL yesterday and these 3 men in London.  Also not widely reported is that while we have these attacks in the West - they have been going on in the rest of the world as well and the vast majority of people killed by ISIS is other Muslims.
money money money  the cost of looking after old is to much for the bottom line Were will it stop  our society #$%@ we cant decide if we are a man or women Social marxism and  crony capitalism has merge to give us atheistic dehumanize approach to health care LONG LIVE  COMRADE  DARWIN  get rid of useless eaters ( LOGAN RUN NEXT ?)
Your comment epitomizes a lack of decency and humanity.  To not only suggest that because Blacks kill each other, what's a few more being lynched by white racists/supremacists and then to implicitly equate/associate the lynching of innocent Black men and boys (as young as 14) with white criminals and rapists by suggesting that latter were also murdered by said white supremacists, is beyond reprehensible.   BTW its 2016, not 1980s.  According to the  Southern Poverty Law Center there are some 190 active KKK groups in the U.S. with between 5- 8,000 Klan members, a rise which came with the election of a Black man to the presidency.  Its also curious how there the constant chant about black on black murders (`90%) but never any mention of white on white murders (`83%).
And made fools of themselves and the Church:  Q. Why censure Hans Kung? A. Because the ordinary catholic is a simple person and it is the role of bishops to protect these simple people (simpletons?) fromthe power of the intellectuals Q. Why did God create women? A. Because Adam (the universal man) experienced a loneliness which the presence of the animals could not satisfy,  so that Adam (the universal man) would not descend into a baneful (?) and sterile "encounter with himself"(?!) Q. Did God really, really speak to Eve?  A. Yes,  Q. Surely, that is metaphor? A. His words were "definitive": (and I quote) "...he shall rule over you") Q. Surely you just mean for catholic women? A. No, arn't you listening to me. The church is "expert in humanity" not just in churchiness,.I applies for all women forever "..in the church and in the world".  Didn't you read the title of my "epistle"? Q. I don't think that a reasonable person can buy all that... A. Then you are a "radical feminist", begone.
...so,  by the way Donna, pussygrabber is the WORST PERSON IN HISTORY TO HOLD THAT POSITION, if you really give a damn about this country, WORK AGAINST HIM, not the DNC...work for the Dems, not against us...if you continue with this crap...do you think any Democrat in this Country is going to support you, your candidates or any other think you want....  ...HELL NO!, WE ARE SICK OF THE INFIGHTING, AND ANY MAN OR WOMAN WHO CONTINUES TO PUSH THIS CRAP IS GOING DOWN....you can meet them all at the bottom!
So in the end  because no native man will ever be interviewed or asked what happened,  we are left to believe the native  women were beaten to a bloody pulp  by nobody, raped by nobody,  and murdered by nobody  unless it was by white men or  RCMP officers.
"It requires listening to people and thinking about what they say."  Yes, it does.  I like to think I have.  Do I "think Brown deserved to die because he was imperfect?"  No.  Do I "think his life was not worthy of a protest over his death?"  No.  Do I think bad things are NOT going to happen if I start fighting with a police officer?  No.  Brown was an 18-year-old black male.  Some white males that age do dumb things.  I do not "think" this - I know this.    I'm going to assert that some 18-year-old black males also do dumb things.  At one level, I'll concede EVERYTHING'S about race.  At another level, however, it's all about people, irrespective of race, doing dumb things.  Brown did something dumb.  Your article might have placed more emphasis on stupidity, less on phenotype.
i can't even begin to discern whether or not the people posting their ridiculous, justice-hating trash in the comments section are serious or not. given how racist white canada is, ive no doubt its sexism is thriving as well.  regardless, you cannot take seriously anyone who refuses to see the clear patterns of history in which toxic masculinity (whatever you call it, there is in fact a clear historical record of male oppression against women [and non-conforming men] in western societies) is responsible for the ongoing degradation of basic human dignity and rights in the name of dominance and power.   i mean capitalism? really? thats the best that the "most awesome civilization" can come up with? lol  youd have to be blind, insane, in active denial, or a deeply criminal individual to not be able to admit what is a basic empirical fact: men, racist and colonialist white men in particular, are toxic to life on this planet, period.
The dummies who think Trump has small hands don't grasp that it's just the opposite - his hands are so wide that the fingers look short. Were his hands thinner with the same fingers, the hands as a whole would look bigger. Men who work construction often have wide, powerful hands.
As sad as it sounds, yes. If a gay/lesbian is "forced" to change/shower in the locker room of their genitals, then people who are uncomfortable showering with the opposite sex will feel comfortable. As long as the trans guy that's gay can control his attraction at least. If he doesn't, it could get ugly!  And Lord help a women that feels like she's a guy showering with a bunch of men.  Rape happens all the time and makes the news frequently.  Are you willing to put people at risk for the feeling of one person in ten?  A little ironic isn't it?  People would feel more comfortable showering with someone attracted to their sex than someone of the opposite sex that isn't interested in them.  But guess what, people feel the way they feel. Respect that as much as you respect those that feel different than you!
User profile image Timothy Mcmillan4 minutes ago So is Eric senior still eligible for “Father of the Year” if his son’s dead body was found bloated full of weed, xanax, coke and fentanyl? If so, that would be quite an accomplishment for a man who just lost his job because he’s a deviant sexual predator. Way to go Eric Sr.! Hang in there!
That's right Jon, lets just further the myth that unhinged liberal feminists like Syringa just want an Alpha male like Hodad to come and rescue them from their dull gender studies programs.  Its so obvious that she is just trying to better his life by helping him with his grammar so that he doesn't commit the heinous act of unintentionally triggering someone with misspelled words.
The guy wants to be run over so next time GIVE IT THE FREAKIN GAS!!!!!!
"Where is all the report the guy people at when it is clear this some young white male who committed these crimes." You pretty much mutilated that one.
Man, you are really reaching here. Did I hit a nerve? Good, maybe you will think twice before you disparage one of your gay "friends" again "all in fun". Please point out where I said anything even close to "straight people can't be friends with gay people."
Woman was merely man's helpmate, a function which pertains to her alone. She is not the image of God but as far as man is concerned, he is by himself the image of God.   --St. Augustine  As regards the individual nature, woman is defective and misbegotten, for the active force in the male seed tends to the production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex; while the production of woman comes from a defect in the active force or from some material indisposition, or even from some external influence.  --St. Aquinas  Another kind [of prophesying] is specific to priests, and is not suitable for women, for it is the role of women to be subservient, not to be dominant. And it is this reason that blessed Paul adduces (in 1 Corinth.14): “Let women be silent in the Church, for they are not permitted to speak, but they must be subject...” .’  --Robert Bellarmine  Go team!
"men dressed as nuns"  When will we see young gay Muslim men participating in the Pride Parade dressed in the feminine religious garb of their own religion?
The khan family should also be upset with Clinton for supporting the Iraq war. Not hearing much on that front. We continue to maintain air strikes in that region for the Iraqi government we support to even have a chance in battle. If my son died in Iraq I would probably hate any politician that supports invading any country that isn't an immediate threat to ours. Trumps question did have some legitimacy. Some Muslim countries are beginning to treat their women better but we still know the majority of Muslim countries don't give their women the respect they deserve. The delivery of his statement wasn't the best, but the political uproar following turning an extremely sad situation of a young man losing his life into a battle to help get Clinton elected might be worse.
The crazy Korean kid would eat the old man alive in a millisecond. The Chump is a pampered punk and panty that never had to fight his own battles.
Can't Murray just claim he's bisexual? He likes men and boys. Bingo, problem solved.
Regarding your numbers, Dennis:  based on the priests that I have known in my lifetime, I would say that the vast majority of those who were unmarried were gay -- 80% (and I am being generous on the side of not overstating), at the very least.  (And for those who are inclined to quarrel with me about married priests, please remember that in my Church (rite), that's permitted.)  I think that is what makes this entire issue so ridiculous to me -- most of those who are insisting that gay men may not become priests are themselves gay.
' Trump is a con man and a buffoon.  Nothing more.
Just painful to read.  Far too many unsubstantiated and seemingly concocted narratives that for me. simply do not ring true in the real world.  What bothers me most is the huge tendency to attribute personal characteristics to a gender.  eg.  Donald Trump is a pig.  Harvey Weinstien is a pig.  Therefore being a pig is a male characteristic.  The implication is that, to varying degrees, it is in all of us.  I'm not buying in.  I am responsible for my own actions.  Harvey is responsible for his.  I am not sharing responsibility for his actions just because I have a penis.
A timely and well-written article.  Fundamentalist Christianity has always been a factor in right wing politics in the US, and while the creep factor is not as high as it is with a man like Bannon, is still something those not blindly aligned with the faith should be concerned about.  It strikes me as somewhat hypocritical that the far right rails against Islam as a force that could destroy the fabric of Western society.  While true that our society is largely founded on Judeo-Christian tradition, the views of Mr Graham are repugnant to many and pose a threat to our way of living.  In many cases, they should also be repugnant to those that embrace our spiritual heritage.  Love of enemies?    Forgiveness? Curiously absent.  When radical Muslims twist the teachings of their faith to justify abhorrent words and deeds, we vilify them.  Graham may not be guilty of abhorrent deeds but his words to the more tolerant among us are anathema.
boy.  this guy is incredibly stupid.
rangerMC, here is just one paragraph from one article in the american thinker.   'Therefore, at the risk of sounding brutal and cruel, here is my message to transgender people, as if I were speaking to my son. I’m sorry to have to be the one to tell you this, but you are not a girl. It pains me to say so, but you are a boy who thinks you are a girl. It’s not your fault, no more so than it is the fault of sufferers of BIID or other uncured disorders. But you have never been /a girl, and will never become one, no matter how extreme is the pretense. Not even surgery will change that fact.' this is one of the 10 main articles. even the blogs are stupid; read blog on 'no such thing as a free lunch'. the writer compares a free lunch program to the mess in venezuela.   articles i read in american thinker seem to be written by evangelical christians,  liberal haters or they are just plain nuts.   http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2017/07
If you become a cop, you get to kill people and get a government pension. The dead don't even have to be guilty of anything. You get a vacation with pay for every murder you commit. Government work is great. You only have to work 20 years before you can retire. The union will defend you as long as you don't kill another cop. You might lose your job if you kill a white man with money. But never fear. You can go to another town and become a cop again. The cops that do this are called "gypsy cops". There is no national data base for bad cops. Many departments don't do good background checks if the hire has any experience. Unlike fire fighters, cops don't have to keep the physical fitness that they had when they are hired. It is okay to be a fat cop. You might even get free donuts. It is good to be a cop in the USA.
This Mr Henderson guy is a clown - typical CEO full of it....journalists should not interview someone wth obvious bias
NO country with black leadership, has ever prospered"  President Obama, a black man, brought us back from the Great Recession. And that's with white conservatives attempting to obstruct him at every turn.  You alt-right guys have no sense of actual history.
Oh please, you know I'm opposed to raping male dicks. Don't be a demagogue. Also, pretending that things that actually metaphorically happen are not happening is not civil. You don't like the metaphor, you're free to author your own, but don't change the subject away from these deplorable figuratively raping nativist xenophobic nazi-esque dirtbags.
Nambia.  Namibia.  Holy cow!  He missed a whole letter!  Have that man drawn and quartered at midnight, he is clearly the devil and his mistake was intentional because he is a white man.    That is seriously what the media has devolved into.  Almost as pathetic as Trump himself.
Rose McGowan's Twitter won't stop sexual predators but... If every attractive young woman would wear a Rose McGowan mask it would stop sexual predators dead in their tracks! That butch haircut and worn out face will make any man young or old go limp in a flash!
This guy is an arrogant douchebag, Clinton or no Clinton.
Racism makes equal protection under the law impossible. Most white people have no clue about how much rape, robbery, and murder they benefit from and they really don't want to know. We have never had justice for all in this country. What exactly has this women taught her students. What ever it was, it didn't produce equal rights for all. Of course, white people are the primary beneficiaries white racism. Racial profiling makes equal rights impossible. Most white people like it that way. This even while most cops are killed by white men. Heck, most white people deny they invented the race card founding this nation in the 1st place. They can't handle the truth. It makes them look bad.
There are many women in the courts sucking all the money from their ex-husbands in the same way...
Put these fine you men in cages and let them rot.
Talk about a specious straw man argument....
You're a miserable little thing, aren't you? Let me guess: white male. Beardy. Prrrrrobably MRA.  How close am I?
And let's hope that the all of the Supreme Court Justices remember that heir roe is to protect the constitution, and not to side reflexively with that awful man in the President's office.
Alrighty.  We have a problem and it's the size of a zillion football fields.  It doesn't care about reason, truth nor facts.  If I was to put a name on this not.walmart.congloberant.........I'd call it F.E.A.R.  An let's not forget opportunities!  Like yahoo, yippee..........you read that many political figures are already claiming that this demented man had pledges to terrorist groups.  !!!  Wow.  See?  We need you fearful servants of this Republic to really nash some teeth over this.  Wring your hands and go hit the social sites and bash Islamists.......purple people.......short/tall..........YOU GET TO CHOSE WHAT YOUR FEAR LOOKS LIKE.  Yes.sir.ree!  Let's get all worked up and start chanting: KILL KILL KILL  The Father of the suspect stated, just hours ago (I've already posted the link) that his son got very upset over men kissing.  I mean he lost it states his Dad.  It was a homophobic attack.    Top comment here implies in a snidely manner:  It's the Islamists.   Trump's ick rules
I am really enjoying the new Martin Luther King Jr stamp - just think about all those white bigots, licking the backside of a black man.  ~ Dick Gregory
And as for the white guys who keep bringing up the unproven and stereotyped statistics of sex abuse in the villages, let me just say this: According to proven studies and statistics, white men far outnumber any other group of men for sex crimes against children and for their killings.
Ah yes, all the cupcake libs are out in force today. Let me clue you folks in a little something. First of all, it's a big bad world out there and you better man up or you will end up in your little safe spaces for your entire existence. There's just so much play dough out there and after awhile it gets dried out and crumbles, kind of like your feelings...god forbid.  Second, the arts wouldn't exist if it weren't for the rich white folks, fact! Your industry is nothing more than entertainment and trust me, it's not a necessity. Frankly, you should be thanking your lucky stars that Pence attended your show, him and his entourage most likely brought $10,000 bucks into your coffers, remember stupid, it's the economy.  That little stunt put on was akin to the dumb @ss at San Fransicso that seems to think his refusing to stand during the anthem is smart. Considering he doesn't vote confirms he isn't.  Think before you open your mouth people, you can and will lose your audience.
"That may have an atom of weight if you could point to anything in this whole affair that suggests racism by Trump."  I am so very glad you asked.  Kaepernik says he is protesting the killing of unarmed black men by white police officers.  Trump says Kaepernik has no right to do that.  This is all about race and freedom of speech.  Trump is wrong on both counts.  He is just throwing red meat to his racist base.
Finally, a real American.  Thank you Mr. Smith. As POTUS, I think it's fair to say that  Trump is the most powerful man in the world.  Before that, he was one of the richest men in the world.  Gosh, how'd that happen?  Listening to the crybaby Democraps one might think Trump the worst man in the world.  He's a hater, a liar, mysogynist, homophobe, Islamaphobe. oligarch, oh, and my favorite, incompetent and it goes on and on.  Gee, I wonder how he got so rich and powerful?  It's called hard work and out smarting the competition.  All of you ignorant, jealous, fooled haters, thats right , you guys are the haters, need to get off your hi horse and come down to earth, you've been fooled by your leaders.  Trump is taking care of business.  It's about time we ran America like a business, not a bankrupt charity.
They're bars. We're not talking blocking the doors of universities to prevent blacks from getting in. Or preventing women from getting a law degree. They can have ladies' nights, men's nights, men with ladies nights, hardhat nights, whatever. I've heard some people complain that the other six nights are already men's nights. Well, waaah. I think men tend to go to bars more than women, so if it's true, there may be a reason for that. It reminds me of when someone filed a discrimination complaint against Hooters because Hooters didn't hire as many male servers as female servers. Um, that's kind of the point of Hooters. Besides, most men in low-cut t-shirts look silly.
What about the guy that RAPED a woman downtown on that crud?????? Or people that kill themselves? As far as I am concerned they could shoot the dealers
If modern males can be defeated by the "rise of feminism", it's a good sign they were on the way to history's garbage heap anyway.
The girl was not a minor.   She was 18.   But you have to be 21 to be able to legally drink alcoholic beverages in Oregon.   That is why students at the University of Oregon get cited all the time.  If she had been under 18, he probably would never have tried to hit on her.  I don't think that he would have been that dumb.   Although many men do throw common sense and morality out the window, when it comes to sex.
I never said that women priests meant there should be no married priests.  The order in which this takes place represents a concern for the human dignity of all women.  If our church ordains married men then WE THE People are claiming that we believe women are less sacred, less important & less human than men & not deserving of equal spiritual rites & sacraments or any voice at all.    Right now we have a small portion of celibate men ruling over all other men and women.  Deacons are a joke who have no authority.  Men were served no injustice - it is not injustice to demand celibacy.    We must ordain women first or at the same time as married people or we create an abuse against the dignity of all women that is so severe as we have never committed its like in our entire church history.    This is a test of what we-laity will allow, as far as, the abuse of women in our church, if Francis puts it thru.  We must demand these men stand up against sexism 1st to show worth for priesthood.
“Real Men Don’t Hate Trump”   Sometimes these titles are even more polarizing (or sillier) than the content.    It's my understanding that the RG editors are at liberty to write them.
To 3rd gen Ak's claim on these pages that white men are Earth's alpha males, I offer these few facts. There are many more like them. From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
I don;t believe it's been established that whites break laws against crack at the same rate as blacks.  In fact, I thought the left's argument was that the crack laws are racist precisely because blacks violate crack laws more often, while powder is the white boys' crime.
So a man can't masturbate on a phone call to a coworker and threaten her career if she complains?  The PC Police have taken over at Fox News
Men shouldn't be allowed to write about women's sexual assault. They almost never have the first idea what they're talking about. As here.
Clinton says she “kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off.” The "Most Difficult Man", being her husband, the rapist.
Any adult can see now how mentally ill Trump is.   The current Twitter rant is a juvenile episode that no 71 year old man would continue with.  He's a psychotic.  You can pretend that isn't true if you want.  I couldn't care less.
TSA does not screen for drunk idiots, if they did you are correct that white males dominate that class.  They screen for weapons and explosives in which case Arabs are at the top of the list.  It's just common sense.
"it's about time Canada has someone who's not a caucasian male." - are you a racist?
This man sounds insane, totally lost it, classic case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. What could he possibly be thinking of to make such outrageous and ridiculous claims about the president? Does he have no clue as to how he looks and sounds when he is saying such patently false things? Does he think the American people are so stupid as to believe anything he is saying? Buy a vowel, a majority of Americans were not impressed and didn't support his efforts against President Nixon. Hounding a legitimately elected president out of office is nothing to be proud of, Carl Bernstein has not improved with age. He is still the same arrogant a-hole he has always been in the past.
Hope Roof gets repeatedly and brutally beat up in prison by some black men. That will be karma.
This is a sad legacy of the feminism of the '70s. American white women have made themselves so unpleasant that  men look elsewhere. Mail order brides, for example. I've got a catalogue of Russian beauties right here. They're beautiful and they're not cranky.
Is your workplace that idiotic it plays the SSB everyday and demands you sing along?  What a f'd up job, man.
Get prepared Canada, we have had enough of your sanctuary attitude toward immigrants and illegals. You print any BS about Trump, but nary a word about an immigrant who stabs two women and sexually assaults a two year old child. Tells us globe you and staff are perverts and would like this crap. we will clean up here and come to clean up Canadian perverts. You have no one to stop us. Your own great military man russel Williams is a pervert. That means it's easy to clean you out and take over.
Really? Having a penis automatically makes you a man? Nope. Just as planting a seed in a woman's womb and producing a baby doesn't automatically you a father, simply having a penis doesn't automatically make you a man: Both designations have to be earned, something you'd know if you were a real man.
Dershowitz is a scumbag who was a vocal supporter torture under the Bush administration.  His ethics are whatever suits his fancy from time to time.  A dangerously self-serving morality is at work in this man.
Personally I think the late Mr. Cohen will appreciate the sardonic irony of staring down on the crowds of over entitled brats mindlessly hollering woo hoo as they pile out of rented limos etc.  Oh the women tear their blouses off and the men they dance on the polka-dots It's CLOSING TIME And it's partner found, it's partner lost and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops It's CLOSING TIME I swear it happened just like this: a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss It's CLOSING TIME The Gates of Love they budged an inch I can't say much has happened since But CLOSING TIME I loved you when our love was blessed I love you now there's nothing left But CLOSING TIME I miss you since the place got wrecked By the winds of change and the weeds of sex.
Let's talk about the experiences cops have with member of the black communities  and not just the other way around. Let's talk about the abuses cops must endure.  If criminal behavior in the Black communities of Canada and The US were in proportion to it's portion of the population, 3% and 8% respectively, the number of police shootings would follow suit.  95% of all shooting deaths in black communities are by other black males.  But you won't change your own behavior so you blame police.
Join with us the week of June 17th to celebrate these hard-working women and men for Global Garbage Man Day! www.garbagemanday.org #GarbageManDay
Yeah, right. Its law enforcements fault. Really? Get a grip, man. Nothing could have prevented this tragedy. BTW... the 'law' acted heroically in Vegas!  So did many country music fans in protecting someone they loved with their own bodies. Let the concerts go on! We will not be bullied by some little coward  with a gun. Whatever his motive, he may have  killed and injured far too many and one would be too many,  we're not going to let some nit-wit kill our spirit too. Not happening!                        "Dirty Harry"
You would say to them "you are perverts, you should be hetero". Clearly, you know nothing about homosexual people. Heck, your comments about men show that you know very little about straight people either.
What you are actually saying is that the myriad of gay guys, the leather men, drag queens and  and jocks of Church St, the people who founded Gay Pride 35 years ago,  are in reality a  hate filled bunch of sick racists.  That is the accusation made by BLM in 2016, against  the gay white men of Toronto and you agree with them.    If Pride dies will you blame BLM ? Certainly not because  you will lame the gay  men of Toronto.    Pride is being crushed under the jack boot of fascist army called BLM. and you are telling me its from my own good?  I was at the very first Gay Pride  in 1981 and have attended every year since. It is sad to see the institution being destroyed by mendacious  and selfish people of BLM with  the fawning approval of  the media and coward politicians.
Now, here's a few problems with what you wrote. You assume men have higher sex drives. They don't nor ever had, otherwise the pill wouldn't have made a difference, if men wanted it more and that's what gave women power over men then they'd still have that power. Somehow they don't. And yet it seems sex wasn't the power they held, weirdly enough we hear a lot about past "shotgun weddings", let me tell you something poor women worked, dad was liable to fund them until they married and yet there was were shotgun weddings concentrated. And yet a lot of wedlock kids happened with kids who still saw their daddies and were directly supported by them but mom wanted nothing with dad. So it seems women were still fucking for the reason they always fucked, fucking itself. Women lined up the docks for the same reasons girls line up the sports block, to see hot men who are there to work not please them sexually.
The man child is lost, man up say your sorry and move on. Your grandstanding is sickening.
Canadians are about to lose their Right to Free Speech as parliament gets set to vote for,  Liberal MP Iqra Khalid’s M-103 bill!  This bill will criminalize all criticism of islam and sharia law and force Canadians to accept sharia law limits on everything!  Criticize islam for killing homosexuals?                  Sorry that is now hate speech! Criticize islam for female genital mutilation?        Sorry that is now hate speech! Criticize islam for allowing men to beat women? Sorry that is now hate speech! Criticize islam for honor killings?                             Sorry that is now hate speech!  Want to maintain your Freedom of Speech Rights, then contact your local MP and tell them they are totally wrong forcing sharia law on Canadians!
Yes, but even on a less traumatic level than Stockholm Syndrome, women typically do not identify with gender as a class, they identify or assimilate with the immediate men in their life.  Behind every angry white man who voted for Trump  there was an angry white woman who also voted for him. They found it easy to dismiss his bragging about sexual predatory behavior as mere "locker room banter" - just like Trump's own wife stated on TV, because it's important for their psychological survival to keep their solidarity with  these key partners in their life. It's interesting to note that when women have lived among other groups of women, and shared their common experiences, and identity (such as our LCWR nuns) they began to identify by gender as women, and this led them to see the root of their oppression more clearly and to question the truth and their loyalties.
I'm curious as to why Melania launched her legal action so much quicker than her husband, who threatened (promised) to sue the women who accused him of sexual assault...  As for the justice's characterization of there being no more worse slander than calling a woman a prostitute, I would suggest that wrongfully calling a woman a vile  racist would be considerably worse. Murderer. Child rapist... all things that are much worse than an activity which, while often illegal, has been around for as long as men having been trading rocks. Or real estate.
This week, our Pope, in a homily stated that gay men are not fit to be priests basically because they are feminine, he made jokes about how an old cleric was making fun of a new priest because he was examining his look in his fancy clerical garb just like a woman would.    Gender segregation is a split by gender.  Most men are married in our church, so they too have no authority.  Optional celibacy will open a flood gate to married men-which is why this priest, in the article, described that thousands of married men will jump right in, the moment the pope gives the ok -thousands in Brazil alone.  So all those women who have been leading parishes as lay ministers are gone & replaced, even if they are made deacons they have no authority.  Celibacy causes no one harm so it is not wrong & no one has to be a priest.  I have no problem with optional celibacy if we are ordaining married women too but it should not be at the cost of women.  Black men have a voice in our church.  Women do not.
The man still has yet to figure out he's supposed to be running the country, which is NOT a part of his business endeavors >>coffcoff<<    Don't expect much from a guy who can't read well.
I am reminded of the group, "Insane Clown Posse" for some reason.  The man is observably unhinged.  "Sad!"
Magical thinking and objectively worthless ad hominem attacks inadvisibly directed at me (after all, clearly, I must be "high") will not allow you to circumvent the laws of physics themselves, nor will they enable you to win points here on the merits.  Did "we" elevate ourselves above the natural world? Perhaps that was always some spiritually-sick psychos with money who have been putting shackles upon sleeping men, poisoning the well, and laying siege to God herself for quite some time now.
That guy did something criminal. Congratulations--you have found a refugee who did something criminal towards women.  Never happens in Canada, ever, right?    I trust you are are very, very active, StillGotIt, in raising money for women's shelters, outreach programs to get abused sex workers off the street, programs to rehabilitate domestic abusers, and pushing for changes to the criminal justice system to see sexual assault charges stick against men more often. Such is your concern for women, right? If you want to save them from the dangers of Syrian refugees? I'll assume you're active on all those fronts.   What did you expect people to do here, read your remark then extrapolate from that criminal incident involving Soleiman and support denying all immigrants and refugees entry? Some of us took Fearmongering 101 and won't fall for it. You'll get far with Leitch supporters though.
It is interesting how the DP is harping on this story, but they quickly buried the story last month about the African-American man in Fresno who shot and killed three people because they were white.
This isn't about Lee, or what kind of man he was. Perhaps he was a honorable fellow, but he was on the wrong side of the war. And after the war, Lee himself wanted to bury the hatchet, and was steadfastly against memorializing the conflict. This is a matter of historical fact. The reality is that the statues were raised many decades after Lee's death and weren't so much memorialize him, which was against his explicit wishes, but to support Jim Crow laws and White racial hegemony. Note that wasn't bespectacled historians in tweed that came to Charlottesville to memorialize these statues or protest their removal, it was ignorant Whites carrying Nazi swastikas shouting racist and hateful slogans.
How badly will Trump have to fail until some people stop apologizing for him? They blame his bad reputation on the Media. Are you serious? Trump has proudly stood in front of the cameras and microphones and made an ass out of himself daily! Every day, he presents the world with another poorly planned executive action or he alienates and insults another ally or issues a threat against another country. How many lives of American soldiers are you willing to see sacrificed? How many thousands of people will have to die before Trump worshippers will wake up to truth? Will he have to drop a nuclear bomb on another country before you realize your deal with the devil on abortion has just killed more people than abortions have or ever will? How many times will you ignore the words of good men and women when they fairly and accurately criticize Trump's words and actions? Every day I gain more understanding of how Hitler took power in Germany by observing the behavior of Trump apologists!
Oh made-up poster, what an asinine comment: which of his days on earth was Devin P. Kelley ever considered "a good guy?"  Perhaps you can ask his ex-wife.
Meanwhile, back on planet Earth. The problem with your BFF is that he say's stupid things on a daily basis, not to mention that he has no real answers on policy. Stupid Things + No Policies + Angry White Man = more coverage by the news media, it's pretty simple. No go on and say it's a liberal conspiracy and let Fox news rush over you like a nice cool wave and everything will be ok in your world.
Complaining about the man doing up his suit jacket is akin to picking pepper out of the fly poop and I can't imagine how women feel about being criticized for how they dress because quite frankly I don't care how they dress. I prefer some not to dress at all.
This really is getting to be a tiresome non-story.  Harvey Weinstein might be a creep, he probably is, although no court has convicted him.  But the creepiness is Weinstein's to own, not mine.  That is the only story here.  To tar and feather all men simply because they have the same kinds of chromosomes as Weinstein is disingenuous at best, malicious at worst.  It is cowardly to hide behind the facade of the word "systemic," to insulate the women's mob from accurate accusations that they are including men who have spent their lives being respectful to all others, (not just women,) in their charge that all men are women-abusing scum.  It simply is not true, and I for one have had enough of this guilt by association.
You are a disgusting racist and sexist man. The Taliban would love to take you in Lance.
The man's history has nothing to do with what happened. You are no better than the guy who blames the woman after raping her.
Trump isn't a liar.  He is a pathological Liar.  I'll take the proven integrity of Mr. Comey over Lying Trump anytime.  The track records of the . two show one man of honor and one man who has cheated people, disrespected people, and manipulated people since military school.
An fb friend puts it well "I just hope the Trump, Bernie, third-party and non-voters are happy now. People you know — maybe even you — will die because of this. That is not an exaggeration. After moving to Texas, I couldn't get insurance as a self-employed freelancer with a depression diagnosis. Not before Obamacare. It didn't matter that I'd never been hospitalized. One wellbutrin prescription is enough to screw you when it comes to conditions they don't like. With a mother who died of ovarian cancer and a father who died of heart disease, I'm the trifecta of screwed. We all are — except for those ***hole white men and delusional women enablers sitting in Congress who don't deserve to be called human." Pre-ACA I too expected to die early because of no insurance. I've had some thru the ACA, but now perhaps I'll lose it. And yes, I again expect to die early because of no insurance.
Ya'll ? I haven't killed a black man, what responsibility do I need to take?  If were placing blame on wide groups of people, does the black community not hold responsible for all the deaths within its own ?  How is the proclivity to pin the blame on every cop for unarmed deaths but not on the black community for black on black violent crime?
Oh noes! It's the gay agenda and their plan of white/xtian/male genocide!!!!
White male Anti-Globalists peacefully marching = Bad. Violent masked crypto-fascists throwing bricks = Good. Shut up slaves.  MSM
Angry white guys with guns don't get this kind of attention from tRump. What big ideas did he have after the Las Vegas shooting? Seems like the new Thornton shooting is another  white guy with a gun. Terrorist attacks by foreigners are horrendous, but I have just as much of a chance of getting killed by a mentally ill or angry white guy with a gun, just by going to a department store or a movie theater. Why doesn't the orange one care about those killers?
Common sense is lacking where gun control's concerned Wanting drs to determine mental fitness?#1 It's already happening #2 Patients wont report depression or other minor probs for fear they'll be denied 2nd amendment rights Depression doesn't equate to psycho killer.#3 It's subjective,i.e. The dr's political beliefs WOULD affect decision Perhaps this man recently joined, or was a sympathizer of one of the newer VIOLENT LEFTIST groups who've pledged to kill white conservatives. They've already harmed many ANTIFA, BAMN (By Any Means Necessary).Google them,read tweets..they've declared civil war&pledged Nov 4 as dday.They've been blocking hwys holding banners w/date.They wear red/black, just as this man.hmmm.Most are white,ALL leftists. Firearms, boulders, knives, u name it They're violent, brainwashed zombies.Regarding CC'ers & Holmes, SIMPLE shot to head. BIG target Sadly misguided mgmt banned LEGAL carriers.Had this latest one taken longer, he would've been stopped--Fact
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye. I get this stuff all the fricken' time from Alaska racists and bigots. This is from someone with the false name of: "An Alaskan..." 2 hours ago "Do you hate all white people or just the white men? It is not surprising to me that you feel so secure typing in your racist remarks under a false name. I am pretty sure face to face your probably a lot easier to get along with. May you have a great Christmas and you get a new outlook for Christmas."  My response: "I don't hate. I despise racists and bigots of which there are many on these poor pages."  And let me add: The only white folks who call me racist are those who get all riled up seeing that I, a Native, would have the gall to say what I say. I have the same privileges as Donald Trump, and the same privilege as any white guy. OK?
A courageous man, in and out of the ring. When few would speak out, he risked his life's work to correctly point out the misguidedness of the Vietnam War. Certainly, he joined a Muslim religion, but this must be looked at in context of the black struggle of its day. I'm amazed at the conservatives who hate him for his belonging to a group seeking rights for its minority members, and doing so in a forceful way, yet these same white folks have no problem in strongly supporting idiots like the Malheur vigilantes whose only goal is to personally profit from land that belongs to all of us.
What wasn't factual or logical about the argument I made? Are you denying that transgendered people have some form of mental illness? If so, then how do you explain what causes a biological male or female to sincerely believe they are a member of the opposite sex? Demonic possession?
3.  Tudor Development. As long as the development is for healthcare, education, and housing, GREAT!  But grocery stores? Shopping? We've got TOO MANY of BOTH in the Bowl. And, we've got people without any money to buy the junk they sell. NO. Either use that Tudor Road AS PLANNED ORIGINALLY or no to the outside interests who want to build megastores and 'boutique' shops.   4.  PROSTITUTES SNITCHING? When pigs fly. How DARE any of you try to make any citizen a spy on their neighbors. Dropping charges but ONLY if someone ELSE is thrown in jail?  If 100 women are arrested, ask how many men are!  NONE. So if this works, a prostitute could simply name her cohort in the crime of selling sex -- the man who paid her for it!  Tadah!  PUT HIM IN JAIL, THEN SHE GOES FREE! How easy to make this backfire, fools!  Nasty men came up with this stupid idea. For shame. Gestapo tactics. Vichy French!  Hypocrites!
To those making light of a man who lost his arm fighting in battle for the USA; yeah, get it straight you knit-wits. Those making gist of a veteran are probably racists white folk from racists parts of America. And you wouldn't last five minutes in public with your racial remarks. The locals would take care of you. Disgusting bunch who don't deserve to be called Americans.
"Many young people are not allergic to the truths of the faith or to the church, but they simply don't know anything or know very little about the faith"   The good old "what we need to do is catechize them properly". Perhaps they do know what the teachings are -- things like "women are inferior to men" or "gays are 'intrinsically disordered" or "contraceptives are evil" and reject them. And, of course, there is the whole clerical sexual abuse mess, especially the cover-up by the bishops.
The floodgates are open now, aren't they? Here's what confuses me;  why would these people have to sexually harass anyone? I know that pop musicians have women lining up to go to bed with them, be they ever so smelly and pimply, and sometimes downright ugly. These Hollywood guys are famous, good-looking men.  In any case this trial-by-press and accusation is repugnant.
"No, America needs resentment management."  Very useful point.  Clearly, the resentment that has been building up among some whites over the last eight years has been very hard on the body politic.  Soon, the black president will be gone and the whites who voted for Trump have elected a man who will Make America White Again. As soon as Trump has Made America White Again, the whites who voted for him will no longer be eaten up by resentment.
I wouldn't expect anything less from pages of the Breitbart tabloid that's on record publishing nutcase pieces saying that birth control makes women fat...don't look right...talk right...choose the wrong mate...makes women sluts and looking unsexy all the time and makes men unmanly.
I am always amazed just how much time and energy the tightie righties spend talking about gay MALE sex.  It is as if they have a obsession over it.   It is all they can think about....hmmmm.... that is kind a suspicious in and of itself.   Especially since:   A.  It is none of their business what other consenting adults do. B.  It does not affect them or their private lives in the least. C.  It does not affect the church in the least. D.   Again, it is none of their freaking business what other consenting adults do.    Personally, I think their obsession has a lot to do with either either think or know they would enjoy it way too much if they ever tried it.   Or, they are just busy bodies who want to impose their particular beliefs on everyone else.   I honestly don't even think it is a religious thing, as much as they wish to make it appear so.   After all, they never seem to worry about many other things Jesus said about interactions with the world.
I am not hateful just because I hate everyone that is not a white american male.  YOU are actually the hateful one because you don't like my hate for everyone that is not a white american male.
When black folks profile white folks as criminal suspects for just being alive, get back to me. Until then you are just another white man happy to be white. I admit your most most valuable asset is your skin.
Besides white males, what other visible minority would it be acceptable to vilify, openly and exuberantly, as Renzetti has done here?
An overlooked tragedy is the fact that young black men in thier early teens are continually coorced to join these gangs and become criminals. That baby faced teenager was told to get in the car, now he's going to prison forever.
Me, the press, hell even Trump himself have been showing you a nonstop barrage of evidence of evil and criminal behavior everyday for years. This is a man whose career started with doing deals with the damn mafia ! You want more evidence ?  There is none so blind as those who do not wish to see.  There is no shortage whatsoever of evidence. There is only a shortness of willingness to admit your faith was misplaced.
I'm Stella's age.  I remember being able to afford a health insurance policy and a country that led the world in scientific discovery.  During the last three decades, private health insurance became outrageously unaffordable, a big chunk of our population lost it's critical thinking skills and now it's an actual "thing" to not believe in science.  I blame the Republican Party.  They cozied up to the crazy evangelicals, and the idiocy became contagious.  I left the Republicans about 25 years ago, and have watched in dismay as they have sunk deeper and deeper into the abyss.  Hatred and division under Obama?  Yes, sadly it turns out that the racism never completely went away, and a lot of white people just could not handle having a black man as their president.  And the people who voted for Trump feeling a bit forgotten?  I wonder how forgotten they'll feel after he continues the Republican assault against the middle class in favor of the ridiculously wealthy.
well put:  The bipartisan consensus on social policy that prevailed for three-quarters of a century has been eviscerated.  This is not about what is best for the American people, this is about revenge against the Democrats and what a Black man did in the White House
Why is everything about a conspiracy and war against men? It's a kind of metal illness. > Maybe men are just genetically smarter and risk takers? < https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9FPe3U8mj8
I can only shake my head.  The notion that masculinity is toxic is ludicrous.  Masculinity covers a wide range of behaviour, some of it quite beneficial, some it quite the opposite.  One could argue that many of the advances in our society are a direct result of the masculine behaviour of taking risks in the pursuit of knowledge or other gain.  There are certainly some men that exhibit extremely anti-social behaviour, such as described in the article.  To then generalize by stating that all masculine behaviours are anti-social is demeaning to all men who behave themselves.
But your comment is NOT hurtful in the white heterosexual male community?.Skip the postmodernism,Mel.Look up the word 'hypocrisy' in the dictionary.
xbt proof read your comments. If that ain't crying I don't know what is. Like I said man up. You remind me of the Chump. Don't know how a man can be on this earth for more than 70 years and tweet at the level of a seven year old and that might be stretching it a bit.
I'd hire this guy by lunchtime The globalist left wants to destroy capitalism at all costs. It deploys agents everywhere. Then deploys this evil quota crap on corporations. Deadbeats must make up 75% of your corporation.....  How the hell this kid got fired for speaking his mind and his ideals is an absolute travesty  Business and greatness is about fire - not corn flakes You want debate You want discussion you want yelling That is how great ideas are born They are not born with cuddles, cookies and hot milk......  This is exactly why women don't succeed in business  Consensus is for communists and evil feminist white male haters Success is bred by killing your enemy - not cuddling him. Women cannot kill it is not in their nature There I said it  You all OK now or do you need a snowflake cuddle room
Maybe she's finally right on something. She brought sex into the campaign. She focused her support on feminists and and sought support from the Katy Perry's of the world and with Madeline Albright who famously lectured all women when she said  there's a special place in Hell for women that don't support women. She went on and on ad nauseam about shattering glass ceilings and her stupid quips about her server and breaching the rules for securing data. Most of her platform was gender based social engineering and slammed men when the polls showed her without sufficient male support by calling them a basket of deplorables. So with a platform that did not reach out to males, she focused on identity politics. Problem was she miscalculated. There were not enough women in her identity politics groups willing to support her in every state. Many women chose to ignore her siren calls. Both candidates were deeply flawed so it boiled down to a choice of the evil of two lessers. That's not misogyny.
I think there's another piece to this issue, too.   We can blame the media ad nauseum....BUT Donald Trump's bullying and appalling behavior APPEALLED to a substantial number of voters who wanted to elect this appalling man, because he was a misogynist, racist, sexist, white supremacist, antisemitist et al...  Think we really need to ask ourselves about this "thin veneer" of civility that we thought was far more common (thicker) in our society?   I frankly had absolutely no idea that there were so many folks who shared Trumps values...  I thought our democracy rested on firmer ground....I don't think so today.  I'd like to see comparisons between media in the 30s in Germany and today's media...here in the US...sadly suspect there are sutantive parallels.
Wow - I just flagged someone for saying STFU, and then I read your post - and that's all I can think of to say, too.  Seriously, Chas - when will you stop blaming every evil in the world on white males?
To say that masculinity is toxic is stupidity manifested in a malicious way. Masculinity encompasses strength, resolve, good manners and compassion and does not (as Ms Balkissoon supposes) denigrate feminism in any way or suggest that women are objects to be exploited. In fact, I suggest that if a man has or cultivates these qualities as well as that rare and almost wholly male quality called objectivity, he may rightfully be regarded as a gentleman. Ms Balkissoon included a better term in her opinion piece from Dr. William Ming Liu -- "dominant masculinity." She should restrict herself to its use and not resort to unjust and bitter diatribe.
this is from a man whose only fame comes from being a sock puppet for an FBI beaurocrat
Yet white males continue to vote for this party. Emasculated, cowardly, and stupid white males.
I can't stand these complaining immigrants.  They think everyone needs to bend to everything of theirs.  Disgusting ungrateful people who should think if they want to return to their home country.  I don't have the easiest name, so I bend sometimes.  What's the big deal.  All the Chinese take anglicized names in school, work etc. while retaining their legal names.  I really hate these ungrateful people like this writer.  This is a personal issue for me, and the writer sounds like a despicable man.
I'm pretty sure no matter what your views on transgender athletes, it's never ok for a grown man to ask to see the genitals of a teenager.
You forgot to mention that Obama is a gay, Muslim who is married to a man and was born in Kenya where the Chinese hoax of global warming was created by members of the Bilderberg Group. Whew.... Oh! And WTC #5 was a controlled explosion! And, Grassy Knoll!!!!
Wow, nice racist rant.  Let me guess.  You're an uneducated white male who either currently lives or did live in a racist red state.   Make sure no one in your family, or you collect social security or medicare.  We wouldn't want you to debase yourself with any handouts.  The crazier Trump gets, the more unhinged the MAGAphants get.  Keep posting.  Insanity can be rather entertaining (in a clinical sort of way).
To no ones surprise Trump immediately dissed Meryl Streep. But that is nothing new. He has attacked anyone who makes fun of him (Baldwin) cant be as good as him (Arnold) or just disagrees with him (too many to recount). He goes after companies (Boeing ,Lockheed) and their stocks plunge. Can't wait till he goes after someone really big and the stock market crashes and gold soars. He is an ego driven psychopath who doesn't know the phrases "turn the other cheek" or "take the high road". His over driven ego only knows one thing - attack and diss. For 8 years Obama has endured all sorts of abuse at the hands of people like Trump. But I never heard him attack and diss back. Obama has some class. This man is just white trash - very rich white trash.
He should think about leaving Canada forever, he is one of the most hated men in the country.
So dumb. Q: What percent of white men hold executive jobs at their companies? A: A tiny fraction of one percent. Q: What percentage of white men are congressmen? A: A tiny, tiny fraction of a percent.   The white man has become the boogey man, when the job situation for 99.9999% of white men, and their chance of being promoted, is no different than that of women and minorities. Oh, and, given the reverse discrimination, in academics minorities and women are being hired and promoted at a much higher rate than white men, but based on their sex and skin color, and NOT on performance.
I ask once more: Trump supporters, is this what you wanted? You expressed your fury at the establishment by voting for a racist, sexist, xenophobic man-child -- and now he's appointed a Goldman Sachs exec to his cabinet. I ask again: is this what you wanted?
For decades, Australia has been struggling with a violet and very unfriendly Muslim immigration population. The “Lebos", Lebanese immigrants, have made themselves very unwelcome by treating Australian women as sex toys they can fondle at will on the beach, in bars, in stores ...anywhere. Ozzie men trying to defend women from sexual assault by the Lebos are instantly labelled racists by the one sided media. The same happened in Cologne if you remember.
Feminist Journo's can't tell the difference and assume anything male and masculine must be toxic.   It is literally sexism given a hall pass to write whatever.   Helps explain why feminism is dying.
I'm a gay man and I am not reeling. I dont even know who this guy is, but there are plenty of heterosexual perverts, so to single him out because he is gay is lame
Watch the trumpet goo gang try to spin this story around to say whites are the victims. An old homeless man and a cafe dishwasher trying to make a living. This is not America. This perp needs the death penalty.
What in the heck is this troll talking about???  Get real man
Dear author, please stop being a bigot. It is every bit as offensive for your to condemn all "White Males" as it is for a neo-fascist to spew his (or her) judgments. The proud boys don't care if there are all women showings of movies. Please end your prejudice.
After Assad's first chemical attack, President Obama went to Congress asking permission for the same limited attack that Trump just approved. Only 12 Republicans said yes. Of course Trump did not ask permission, but look at the resounding approval from the GOP now. Pathetic! They've even politicized the war on terror. Guess the military has to rattle it's sabers before the pitiful smucks sent to DC feel like real men! And considering Trump's constant need for applause and worship many more people will be required to die before he feels like a "Macho Man".
The gay newspapers and blogs are ALL running the story (quelle suprise!)  The secretary of the Cardinal (who the Card. had recently recommended for promo to bishop) was holding the "all male soiree" in his Vatican apartment, but the reason he was arrested was the huge cache of drugs he was also dealing out of the apartment.  Card C. is the Head of the Pontifical Council for Legislative texts; but the apartment is actually owned by the Con­gregation for the Doctrine of the Faith — the department charged with, among other things, tackling clerical sexual abuse.  Can't wait to see how the trads and the retros try to spin this.
I think Mr. Chin is making an attempt at grabbing the spotlight for himself and the Democratic Party but it's a big mistake by upsetting the 'man' and party in control. Either that or his ego exceeds his bounds.  There will be repercussions and Hawaii residents will be the victims of a 'fools folly'.
The man is an idiot and I this we would be doing a disservice to prisoners everywhere to suggest that they would admire this jackass.  He was a felon in community custody driving around with drugs and GUNS. He is also a gutless wonder. If he wanted to die he had plenty of heroin and bullets to take care of it without involving the police. He should be charged with a count of  attempted murder for every bullet he fired after he was traffic stopped.  He doesn't look smug to me, he looks stupid .
This is just a sickening spectacle. Ignorant Christian Extremists who believe that a mentally ill man who in no way represents the teachings of Christ is on their side. I suppose if you're ignorant enough to fall for religions extremism, you're ignorant enough to fall for a con man as a president.
"People don't burn other people alive" You need to acquaint yourself with autos da fe in Middle Ages Europe. Christians did precisely that to women accused of witchcraft, Jews who refused to convert, Christians who were accused of heresy (that is, they held beliefs the authorities didn't approve of), and others. After some Jews rejected Martin Luther's protestant Christianity as not being their cup of tea, Martin Luther suggested locking Jews in synagogues and setting the synagogues on fire. If that's too ancient for you, only 30 years ago, Christians were raping and slaughtering Muslims in the former country of Yugoslavia. Last year, Jews living in the West Bank burned down Arabs' houses and mosques, and in at least one house, the occupants were in it. Terrorists are brutal. A lot of terrorists are Muslim. That does NOT make all Muslims dogs. If a man from Arvada gets angry at his ex-wife and burns down her home with her in it, are all Arvadans to be considered dogs?
Hitler and Manson vs. Chris McCandless?? What spice did you smoke this morning? That's like comparing ~ what! Get some logic in your fricking head man!!! Chris didn't kill anyone, how do you people even survive a day in the concrete jungle? Holy smokes!!! It's must be the water or chem trails or something.
No, you do not need Quebec to form a majority government. It has already been done. Stop worrying, O'Leary and Leitch will never lead the Conservative Party, they are both inherent losers. Mad Max Bernier is the man and he will win.
There is so much miss-information on this issue that I honestly cannot decide if these guys are complete lunatics or the most heroic, patriotic men since the war of independence.
"the majority of the abusive acts were homosexual in nature": is a measurable, testable fact.   "participation in homosexual acts is not the same as sexual identity as a gay man" is a mere opinion.  We need to learn the difference.
"Responsible dissent" to some like Ms Tesa Ann means "being like the Tea Party, not like BLM, OWS, or other 'socialist' groups." Funny how the same people who think that the Tea Partiers (who didn't start protesting till after the black guy got elected) were patriots, but the current crop of anti-Trump protesters are un-American, isn't it?  As for Trump and abortion... well, he was pro-choice until he saw that his political fortunes lay with the other side. If I were a betting woman, I'll bet that very few of his campaign promises will be fulfilled. He's already backing off on gutting the ACA, building "the wall," getting out of NATO, jailing Clinton, ending SSM, etc. Tis what happens when you believe a con man.
As a gay man, I really am sickened by Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon and that other guy, Rachel Madcow...  Anderson is a disgrace to the our community and so many of us find him to be just another liberal sell out hack. If Anderson's head were any further up the behind of that perjuring pusillanimous poltroon, he'd might actually be considered straight - which not one of us would give two rats asses if he were.
If the shoe was on Canada's foot, if we had been attacked and thousands slaughtered on our soil and many more around the world for decades, I expect you and all the other knee jerk Trump haters would be demanding our government limit the risk of further attacks here by heavily scrutinizing anyone coming from countries where the majority of terrorists hail from.  Security 101.  I think the Left have lost all sensibility following the loss of their Queen Hillary.  A woman with a 40 year track record of lies, subterfuge and deceit, and the # 1 cheerleader for a serial adulterer, rapist, money grubbing, butt grabbing husband, King Bill.
Maybe white males are just smarter and more qualified than everybody else. Anybody ever bother to consider that possibility?
More white man shame.   We truly are God's damned creatures aren't we .
Actually I have proven that you are largely ignorant of the law and that he feels it would violate his religious belief to have to make the cake. This feeling is a reasonable belief that he is allowed to have by the law. You still have not proven anything other then your only argument is to contest what I say and you have not built a foundation upon which to lay your argument that has any footing. Your level of ignorance is at the point where I am now just going to quit asking for proof as I have proven that you can not back up what you are saying because you have not done so at this point. Should you come up with actual proof that this man, who you are claiming is violating the law by not making the cake for a gay couple due to religious beliefs and that his religious beliefs are not protected by the constitution, as I have provided proof of, I will entertain your opinion. Other then that, you have proven that you do not know anything about even the basic rights of U.S. Citizens.
So if I understand this rambling commentary, the FBI needs to release the memo describing the Classified documents Hilllary is accused of mishandling, to the public so they can decide the magnitude of her misdeeds. Um..doesn't a Classified designation suggest there are reasons descriptions of the documents should not be released, such as national security? Is this man nuts?
Thank for whitesplaining and fat shaming. God knows  we wouldn't want to elect a man who gropes ugly women.
And he's still ten times the man the draft dodger is.  'Course anyone is....Trump isn't a man.
I'm a CONSERVATIVE woman and let me clue you into one fact, most men ARE jerks. Alt left women are equally loathesome.
MacKay was never a soldier. A soldier boasting about his battles is a common and tolerated thing. Sajjan risked his life many times for you. There are too many low white racists in Canada. This is a brave soldier who gave a somewhat exaggerated account of his role in one battle. Big deal. Ordinarily, it would be shrugged off with a wink and an amused grin. But the man is brown and so all the white skunks have leapt on him.
From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
Not hard at all to find this out, with a little bit of Internet searching.   As Mike McFadden noted, KVAL reported about this.  A little more searching shows that he served time in jail in California for having sex with girls under 16.  He was also arrested in Eugene 3 months ago, for selling marijuana to minors.   And he also failed to register here locally as a sex offender, when he arrived.  It is sad that the Lane County Jail let him out pending his upcoming trial for his arrests in July.   This man is a clear and present danger to the children of our community, and deserves to held in the County Jail pending his trial.  You and others here are defending absolute scum.
Thank you for that judgmental and rather nasty comment about a man you have never met. Unlike the conservative hero, Donald Trump, my son does not discard wives on a whim. He takes marriage seriously -- his first marriage FAILED. Neither he nor his first wife just gave up on it, despite your ignorant opinions.
Buses and BIG trailer tractor trucks are to blame for the horrendous conditions of our streets. Our roads are NOT built to take the weight !! As far as Austin goes, it IS Texas, land of white supremacy. NO THANK YOU if you ain't a WHITE, God Fearing, conservative, & gun toting MAN !!!
I have known many priests who had secret male lovers. Many. Wake up and smell the hypocrisy.
I never said anything about groping, the stalking was true.   Like a puppy dog.  Fortunately she disappeared at the end of the school year.    You are giving me  a taste of the disbelief that MEN face if they claim rape or sexual assault.  Your post is exactly what men face in this situation.  Men are supposed to consider themselves lucky if a woman wants to sexually assault them.  If you think women have a problem with disbelief, for men it is a hundred times worse. http://www.vocativ.com/underworld/crime/hard-truth-girl-guy-rape/
Step one: Demoralization Step two: Destabilization Step three: Crisis (Civil War/Invasion)  Destabilization = Don't trust the cops (authority). Blacks think conservative Whites are all racists. Feminist think all men are oppressors and predators. Gay/Transvestites want to break what is considered a model family unit. Stifle speech by calling it hate speech. Re-write history, etc.  So if you are part of the BLM or ANTIFA, of Femi-nazi's, or any of the other groups, you are just a tool being used to tear this country down so it can be restructured in a more controlled manner (Communism).     If you think that's what you want, understand the final step: Normalization = Kill all the tools that think they will control any part of the country or cause any type of protest. So the new government will not tolerate BLM, ANTIFA, Feminist, or Gays.
I just feel pity for Americans.  They have a serial liar and con man as president.  He is attacking women and the poor, just as expected, but hey "poor people don't want healthcare".  What a sad, sad joke.  The US may never recover.
Terrible article. The columnist and the quoted author could have done with more research examine different angles and viewpoints. The reality is it takes two to tango, have casual sex, and get nowhere close to long term relationships and marriage. There is no purpose to marriage and it introduces massive risk and cost to a wealthy individual. Also what an idiotic stat to use on university graduates. Whose going to make more, the gender studies moron whining about patriarchy or the electrician? What's the entrepreneurial breakdown between men and women? STEM, etc?
Trump is a stupid, uneducated man...  He thinks he is brilliant and everybody should love him or else.  We really are in for a rough four years.
Some men "who took a vow" raped little children.  Then celebrated mass.  And kept on celebrating masses for years.  And raping children.  The pontifical secret means that anyone in the church reporting "men who took a vow" to the civil authorities for this crime, i.e. Police, are to be excommunicated. This still stands today, and Francis could wipe it out with a stroke of his pen today.  But he has not.  Look up 'Pontifical Secret'.  Further, why should a man not take more than one vow?  What is wrong with the married state?  What is wrong with sex in a committed relationship? What is sinful enough to suggest death of the soul?  Forever.  The priestly vow of celibacy is only a church discipline.  Like not eating meat on a Friday.  That discipline has been abolished, so why not the celibacy one?   God/Jesus never suggested  that "mortal sin" exists.  It is a construct by the church, made to instill fear into its subjects so as to have power over them.
And yet gays who want to be women earn better wages than the average Joe. it takes a man to show women how to be a lady. <smirks>
Plain and simple Trump is a fraud and a buffoon and it is really sad that you find anything redeeming about the man at all let alone as a candidate to lead this country that I loved enough to put my life on the line for it Dick. Trump is a loser and anyone who supports him ditto that.
This whole thing of reps against The President is relatively easily to understand. First the president is a business man and is working at whipping the US into just that a business. Why not? how many politicians have you seen get off their lazy ass and go to work, REAL BUSINESS WORK. All politicians are interested in is kissing babies, collecting money to get re elected so that they can continue to play stupid games. If all both sides got out of their smoke filled locked rooms and did a real job like a business should be done there would be no stopping this country. If they like the president is put your foot down and do the same to foreign policy the whole world would change almost over night. It would be get off your lazy ass go to work or no one will give anything to you for free. How do you think America got started? UH DUH a simple 4 letter word. WORK
Simple- men be castrated who are in positions of authority that will make feminists happy. Women who use sex to advance their careers can be tarred and feathered. Fair ?
Yep, I guess i am one of those "old white men" (about to be 50) that will easily challenge if the resulting, even current world has improved at all.  We just had a shooting on Christmas Day. my old white friends did not teach the cowardly man to solve problems by shooting someone in the back of the head and then go run and hide like a coward.  Just a few weeks ago, we had a drunken driver in Waimanalo hit and kill a child in a crosswalk, in a stroller.  None of my old white friends, nor did Trump, teach that young woman to drink and drive, and then run away like a coward when she plowed over someone.   A few months ago a woman deliberately ran over a guy on a motorcycle in order to solve her problem. Killed him and then she went and ran and hid like a coward too.  Turns out she has a lengthy history of driving illegally.  The primary and most consistent thing missing from todays "new and improved" world, is any shred of personal responsibility for ones actions.
Thank you for trying as hard as you could to deal with the recalcitrant GOP super majority Senator Gardner. Must be so frustrating to be dealing with such cowardly, ideologically blinded men and women who put the welfare of the oil industry above that of the state of Alaska. Don't let the bas#$ds get ya down Senator.
"everything is a protected class now a days." Except the beleaguered white, christian male, amirite?
Sad to see no mention of the move by biological males to take over female spaces that Fed law allows sex-segregated.  Men have now pushed ladies out of the ladies' room at Target and Starbucks, off the gold medal podium at the last Olympics, and out of the  running for sportswoman of the year.  Worse, people with penises are now demanding to be referred to as women without ever once having monthly cycles, bloated bellies, or swollen breasts.  As we watch women being regulated  to second-class status in order to make men feel better about themselves, it is shoes that have caught the public' eyes.  Shoes, not women.
You seriously believe that? We don't stone women for being raped, we don't throw gays off buildings for being gay, women do not need permission from their male relatives to go out, and we don't cut off women's clits so they can't experience sexual pleasure. Tis comment is laughable and ridiculous, and WRONG.
To all the people blaming this couple for their death, primarily pretend DB Cooper, I'll put your little theories to rest because this was my uncle. I grew up around this man my whole life, he was never into any gang related shit himself. He knew people like that but didn't know them on a personal level. He had 6 kids. His first one 19 years ago. He knew he didn't have time for that shit. Yeah he sold weed. But he'd re up on an ounce which is $250. Profits only about $100. These guys that killed him, did meth, crack, coke and that type of shit. They heard Chris was a drug dealer and assumed those kind of drugs. He smoked for 22 years before this and he was never robbed, jumped or shot. He didn't choose to get killed
What is disrespectful about consensual sex?  Why should a person in show business be expected to be crude?  Why would any decent, self-respecting conservative vote for a man who claimed that he could - well, I don't think I need to post that here.  He is the same person, you know.  Frankly, I think he's still in show biz.  Do you think he made a claim about an action that he didn't actually perform?    See the problem?  If he did what he said he could do "any time he wanted" he is a man who treats women like property.  If he didn't, he's a liar who said he did something that he didn't do.  Bill Clinton, at worst, cheated on his wife, something that we're all pretty sure Hillary had at least a smidgen of awareness about. He said that he didn't do something that he did do.   They are still married. Their first for each.  I have my doubts about the chances of the Trump marriage remaining solvent post-term.  Anyone know what Vegas has on this?
It was a human male not a female fat sac.
To summarize: Women are like cars. When they have sex, they are actually lending their bodies to men. If men wreck women's bodies, women must pay the costs of repair. Unintended pregnancy is like a car wreck.
How do you associate picking the best, no matter the gender as saying only white men? You've only demonstrated a shameless subjective bias and unapologetic ignorance. Trudeau is championing a policy that puts gender and race before merit, #becauseit's2017. Monsef and Duncan - the best people for the job? Really? Canada deserves each other.
What a crap piece of journalism! So white (particularly male) people have now to be apologetic of their "privileged" position in life? With this type of reporting one should not be surprised that the "white man" feels threatened and that populist movements in Europe and USA will be further  on the rise.   First of all there are numerous non-white role models in our society, like Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, president Obama, or Malala Yousafzai. The fact that 12 year old children don't list these people has more to do with what they watch and read today. Don't forget "Bollywood" which is a bigger film industry then Hollywood and generates (non-white) role models for billions of people.   Canada has provided non-white people opportunities which they would not always have had in their home countries. Canada is a great country because we welcome these people and allow them to pursue their dreams. However, we should not start creating divide between white and non-white people.
Another biased, hypocrite article. Milo went over his free speech, but the author's rant is all about the fact that he is a male, good looking, white, on top gay Conservative. That's mainly, what this opinion is so against his 'free speech'. Take the case of a left wing bozo Bill Maher, "who took credit for the downfall of Milo Yiannopoulos, has also defended adult sex with children", according to the NP headliner. Ms, author, care to mention about leftist Bill Maher, I didn't think so.
This sexual witch hunt has jumped the shark. Here a man’s career and reputation has been damaged solely on the basis of a single, 30 year old unsubstantiated allegation that even the accuser characterizes as a failed, drunken event. No proof seems to be required to reach a guilty verdict in the court of social media. No demand for nuance, context, or examination of evidence. As we all revel in this shame fueled collective condemnation, pray you never find yourself on the receiving end of a similar allegation. With the burden of proof now squarely on those accused of sexual crimes, it could cost you dearly. And can we all please stop pretending to be shocked that humans raised in a hyper sexualized culture sometimes act out in sexually inappropriate ways? We are not a prudish species. 7.6 billion and counting...
And a society that expected chastity from women, and praised male virility.
Taking advantage of 13 year old girls. The guy should get 10 years at least. What a disgusting pig of a man. And to think he had the nerve to look and say "Are you happy now" as they led him off. Well no I'm not, you won't spend nearly enough time in jail.
DRAFT THE 70 PERCENT INTO THE US ARMY FOR GUN FODDER ON THE FRONT LINE.  This will force North Korea to run out of bullets and artillery shells.   When that happens we send in our White Male Hetro-sexual troops to win the WAR.   We get rid of our Social Parasites and win a WAR.   When you need something done right, call on a White Male American.
White folks...How about serial killers? Albert DeSalvo, the Boston Strangler, David Berkowitz, New York City’s “son of Sam.” Ted Bundy, who called himself “the most coldhearted son of a bitch you’ll ever meet,” confessed to thirty murders in the 1970s. Chicago serial killer John Wayne Gacy, murdered thirty-three teenaged boys and young men in the 1970s, burying twenty-seven in the crawl space under his house.  Gary Ridgeway, Washington State’s Green River Killer, was convicted of killing forty-eight girls and young women but admitted to ninety murders during the 1980s and 1990s. Jeffrey Dahmer, the Milwaukee Cannibal, raped, murdered, and dismembered seventeen men and boys over thirteen years, Dennis Rader, known as BTK killed ten in Wichita, Kansas and was on the loose for decades.  Though each of these men was white, no fear of white men emerged. Their murders were considered individual acts for which they alone were responsible.
Mel   ....    I am all for freedom of religion and agree these young Muslims should be able to come together for their expression of faith.    What pisses me off is, you think it's a value to be tolerant, except when it comes to white, heterosexual men.
You aren't that dumb are you,  really.  Gender police?  I'm pretty sure that if you line up 100 people, I can tell if they are male or female.  Go back to smoking your hooch and watching CNN.
Uplifting stories: 1) Residents of Mountain View are proud of their community and working hard to make it a better place, 2) life is still pretty great for white, Christian, heterosexual males, despite their whining to the contrary. Those two are just off the top of my head!
It is unlikely that there will be any change in the culture of the Church until women and men are treated as equals before God and are allowed to study together for the priesthood, whether they are gay or straight, married or single. The hierarchical structure needs to change to a horizontal structure that honors the majority viewpoints. The early Church relied very much on the "sense of the faithful". This means that the lay people were the voice of the Church and it was their common sense that determined the horizontal structures of the Church. The head of the Church was Jesus, not the pope, and that made all the difference. What are we doing honoring a human being as the head of the Church, especially when popes are ignoring the commands of Jesus and worshiping an institution instead? It has been many years since I have heard a bishop talk about living the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. All we hear are bishops interfering in the sexual lives of the lay people. Very sad.
Islam is a hierarchy of submission; The world must submit  to Allah (Islam) All Muslims must submit to  Allah and the Prophet Mohammad  (shahada)  Men must submit to their Imam A wife must submit to her husband Children must submit to their parents.  A female must submit to all males. ( a mother must obey her own son)  Human laws are not to be obeyed unless there is a benefit for Islam to do so.   If a father tells his 16 year old daughter to marry a 55 year old taxi driver with another wife, she is in no position say refuse . That would violate the honour of her family.
Computer programs like this are forced to be made to show some modicum of objectivity because lawmakers don't want to be accused of 'raaaacism' by black racialists and white Liberals on something we all know.  Here's the good news about facts and statistics: they don't care about your feelings.  Blacks- specifically men- commit a grossly disproportionate amount of crime. There. That's a fact.  According to FBI data, 4,906 black people murdered other blacks in 2010 and 2011.  White males are 40 percent of the population and committed 4,582 murders. That same year, black males were just 6.6 percent of the population but committed a staggering 5,531 murders (http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf)  Employment history and family structure are also important: so why do Leftists refuse to accept that almost 75% of blacks are raised by absentee and single parents? (http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/walter-e-williams/true-black-tragedy-illegitimacy-rate-nearly-75)
'Ignorance' Stolberg shows the mentality that is oppressing societies ability to educate close minded, opinioated and heartless, self involved people like I. Stolberg. I'm sure if your loved one had this disease or you gave birth to either one of those gentleman, you possibly would take time to educate yourself before making intentionally rude and ruthless ignorant opinions. At least use some class. Two men ultimately lost their lives and the people who love them shouldn't have to be assaulted with your idiocy!!!
What she is saying "Women and minorities are too incompetent to compete with white men, so the bar needs to be lowered." The irony of the SJW brain is they don't realize how stupid they sound or the fact that just because you believe in something so much, doesn't make it real.
the guy is totally loopy
This man is destructive.  And false.  Do not watch his inauguration.
"The greatest threat to our domestic security is white men..." Statistics and numbers tell a different story. All the gang related murders occurring every day, spread throughout the country, and goes unreported because it's so common.
As a non Christian, I look at the Christians and the evangelicals and wonder what kind of christianity they worship, or, how the Christian politicians who are defunding the health and social programs that help the unfortunate, sick, weak, infirm, diseased, hungry and the dying, and giving the same funding to whatever corporation or individual fatcat banker on wallstreet, bribed them, even call themselves Christians? I may end up in the white mans hell, but I will see many past administrations and congressional delegations there.. There are many bribed to allow invasions and occupations to enrich a few leeches and parasites, that end with the suffering ad slaughter of the Native inhabitants to get them out of the way of civilized theft and murder... And hallelujah... I will see many of the posters to adn.com there also. I see too many pious individuals go out of their way to cut down their fellow man, out of greed, racism,
I have little respect for such a man as you, RD. YOU SICKEN ME!
As a physicist I can say things like:"Let us assume that the universe is one-dimensional" or "Let us assume that a solid has periodic boundary conditions" and then derive in peace the consequences of my wild impossible assumptions.  But now a professor in the social sciences will have to be careful when he/she assumes that the humans or for that matter the chimps, are made of males and females.  A tiny fraction of the 1% of trans/etc... will go nuts and claim discrimination.  Gays won rights by claiming that nature made them the way they are but apparently we choose our gender.....  amazing how completely degenerate our Western societies have become.
Her "taxed" feminism still does not brush away the fact that her and others knew of this behavior by both Weinstein AND President Bill Clinton, but due to either friendships, careers or political convenience (or all of the aforementioned) not only looked the other way but demanded that their audience also pay no attention to their man behind the green curtain who is masturbating away.
“You can’t feel like a boy for wrestling and a girl for basketball.”??  Ah, if I am not mistaken girls wrestle boys now.  Not a very impressive statement from the 'director'.  Any opinion from the DOJ is just that, opinion.  The DOJ is not the Court and personally I believe it is currently run by unconstitutional criminals.  Team participation is a deflection of the real issue here.  The real issue is does a penis = male and a vagina = female or is a mental dysphoria  of sexuality brought on by societal pressures the determining factor.  The second part being,  whose 'feelings' or rights are more important, the less than 3% or the 97%?  Personally I like to drive fast, over the speed limit and have never hurt anyone or crashed.  My guess, way more than 3% of drivers agree.  Therefore I should be 'allowed' to because I 'feel' like it. Does that offend you?  Is it potentially uncomfortable or unsafe to the vast majority?  Can I legally do it?  No!  What is the difference?  Morals!
Why not?    Gay men  want to DANCE DANCE DANCE!!! . Womyn want to FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!!   Gay men make things happen.  The womyn crush what they get control of.
How insane have we become that there is a need to address this issue ?   The second you are born the doc says right then and there you are a boy or girl.  He doesn't say the sex isn't known until the person reaches 16 to decide what they are. The doc doesn't wait for gay supporters to convert people into something they aren't . If your born a boy , use the boy's bathroom . Born a girl , use the girls.  Nothing in life can be more simple . A person shouldn't decide how they feel each week  to decide what bathroom they should use.   It's stunning that those who support the pick what ever bathroom fits your fancy can claim with certainty that an open door policy wouldn't be abused by people with sexual perversion . Anyone who can't stand the sex they were born with has issues from the get go. Unstable people shouldn't have ANY choice in which bathroom to use.  That we have to talk about this issue shows how far down society has slid.  Shame on us for encouraging twisted behavior.
Bwahaha....Michael Savage!....That guy is a nut case...Savage is only slight better than that InfoWars guy Alex Jones...c'mon man!....
Man they try to make us like Jesus or somthin, they lame as heck
Excellent question !  I extend the same to all the women (and men) who hero wordhip Bill Clinton and who "made it ok" for him to be revered worldwide. The "feminists" and pink hats who marched against Trump, but honor Bill as a "senior statesman" and would put him back in the WH? Hillary and her people who blamed the women (victims) who tried to speak out but who were called "trailer park trash" and "looney tunes", how about them ?   Some of you older folks may remember back in the 50's and 60's how females were talked about and treated during high school. If you happened to be from the wrong side of the tracks or wrong color you were a "bad girl, a slut", fair game for jocks in locker rooms. Sluts/tramps  had it "coming to them". Get them drunk and they "pull a train" for the team.  While Trump said or bragged about doing some really nasty things, he was able to be elected because Bill got away with it. We gave Bill Clinton a pass, just as Hollywood has given Roman Polanski awards.
No that is more lazy man hate and nothing more.  Real proof, real facts requires real work.  That rules you out.
I agree : people of good will do need to talk this out. But Tory is an idiot and a coward if he think BLM is going to show any good will towards the gay white men of Toronto.   Like Geise here, he and all other  politicians  at city hall will throw  Toronto's gay men under the jack boot  heels of BLM,  and then they will praise themselves for being tolerant.   We gay men of Toronto are still low priority because clearly NOBODY is coming to our aid.   Ironically, the  gay community and the police are now in this together as allies with common goals and a common enemy.
They feel empowered now that the so called most powerful man in the world is nothing more than a bully and a bigot.
The unarmed black men and women in the news who have been killed by police were not committing violent crimes.  I think one was for a broken tail light, another for selling cigarettes on the street.....  I mean, pul-lease stop being an apologist for a horrible reality that black people are almost twice as likely to be killed by the police and it is wrong.
another ignorant loser lefty see pal, the GOP clearly said they are REPLACING obamacare not just killing it. , man your stupidity never ends from the left...  typical of left wing sheep.,.,god help the usa, they were smart enough to send the left packing in the election
Martin has same-sex attraction and embraces homosexual sodomy as an acceptable form of conduct, there's hardly a question about that.    My question to you is what will priests admitting their same-sex attraction do to stop homosexual predators?  Are you suggesting that the recently raided male-male orgy in the Vatican is a better alternative to predators, because I don't think that the orgies would stop the predators, as the predators have a preference for pubescent boys.
Intimidation, personal image,  sexism, narcissism, arrogance, scapegoating, success at all costs. That's America. The "liberals" do it with much more subtlety. Their hypocrisy and self-delusion are seemingly beyond redemption.   Trump won because never in political history has one man revealed so much about so many. And Americans were very overdue to hear those truths.
OMG, you equate your privileged white male status with the hatred and oppression of others especially people of colour, women, Muslims, Jews, etc.  That someone would dare question or criticize that unearned status or demand equality for people other than white males does not make you a victim in any way.  The fact is your whining only shows ignorance and lack of regard for others.  Pathetic.
The man's is a cretin of the highest order.
Iran's morality police, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan's "blasphemy" laws... the left believes it's "Islamaphobic" to bring up issues staring everyone else in the face like a fat man in a diaper. When Iranian women were beaten by regime thugs and thrown in jail for dancing to Pharrell's "Happy", crickets from the perpetually offended activists. When Iranian men led a peaceful protest against forcing women to wear head coverings by donning their own, crickets from the perpetually offended activists... the same goes for the Christian woman facing the death penalty in Pakistan for "blaspheming" at work, of course her word is irrelevant... As for the Saudis, Saudi Arabia certainly has it's issues but without the ruling Monarchy, it would likely descend into chaos, anarchy, and perpetual war. Robert Lacey's "Inside the Kingdom" is an interesting read...
The author didn't say men are X.  In fact, she pointed out that it's not just men who blame the victim:  "That slut-shaming pablum didn't work out too well for Karan: an international boycott of her brand is underway. Apparently women can be dinosaurs too."  "Fragile flower" is a common term for somebody who is being oversensitive and taking offense where none is intended.  If the shoe fits....
Your description of priesthood is accurate but it in no way speaks to the exclusion of more than half of God's people based solely on their genitalia.  It would still be a dumb argument even if it were being used to exclude men from the priesthood.
Good.  They shouldn't capitulate to that requirement if they don't want to.  It's a stupid, oppressive and mysoginistic requirment in the first place.   But, that's only my opinion.  Culturally, the question should be whether a Saudi, Sharia adhering female would forego head covering in order to not offend a Western culture while visiting.  If not, there can be no expectation of reciprocity.  Alternatively, if a woman in the American contingent CHOSE to wear a head covering, I don't think I'd have any sort of huge problem with that either.  The choice to show respect should likewise be respected.  What would be very, very impressive to me, is if the American men donned traditionally female Saudi head dresses and walked the mile in others' shoes.   That would take guts, and that would make an important point.  But I don't "expect" that.  Otherwise, let people wear what they want.
Yes, let's just put our all attention on the bishops, and ignore the fact that most of the child rapes were done by gay men.
Excuse me? Some of the the richest states in the world live in the region and REFUSE to take in the migrants. THEY ARE THE PROBLEM. Pretty damn obvious. Or if America, Britain and France are causing these issues, they take them all. Not Canada, we will take some sure but WE CANNOT BE THE ESCAPE HATCH FOR DICTATORS around the world. The men must fight and die for their land as my ancestors did with Stalin rose and the women and children went to Canada while male ancestors were obliterated fighting and dying for their land.
If my wife tells me there's a man in the female bathroom I will go in and beat him down.  Anyone who knows me knows this to be true... think about it before you enter the ladies restrooms in Anchorage.  Test me! I could care less what the current law says.
Being rich and privileged and crying about oppression is laughable.  The values that anthem espoused and the  men that have died , still die and sacrificed for it are devalued by a bunch of lazy selfish, spoiled athletes who don't even do their research. News media SEARCHES nationwide for stories of white cops killing blacks and in a nation of 320 million  you can find them. It is a rare occurrence however, Cops killed 1100 people nationwide in 2015. 300 were black. Twice as many black people are murdered in chicago every year by other civilians than are killed by cops nationwide.  There is no "epidemic" of cops killing blacks, more whites die every year by cops, and when you look at the FACT that blacks commit crime at much higher rates than any other group  you'd think the instances of cop shootings to be higher. Black males account for 6% of the population and commit 50% of the homicides . Let that sink in.
I'm betting if the husband of LW1 works out at a gym, he's one of those fools who actually talks on the phone while lifting weights. From time to time I see this. If only these clowns knew how idiotic they looked. I'm not kidding: Men and women lifting up weight as they are talking on the phone! Who is SO important that they can't wait till before or after the workout to speak to? And no, these hardly sound like emergencies (a la "Hey Tom, your dog just got run over by a car," or "Hey Emmie, your house is on fire."). Really, an hour's workout, and they MUST take the call inside that hour WHILE they're literally in the middle of a set? And need I say they always talk loud enough for those around them to hear? Talk about self absorption.
The proverbial straw man.
OregonBorn: Look at what the Catholic Priests have accomplished over the last how many centuries, AND, the Boy Scouts of America. They have been raping boys, FOREVER.  Read the Sign: FOREVER................
"The Nazi's were very much left wing national socialist racists ..."  Left wing?! That's nonsense. The parties on the left in the Weimar Republic were the Communists (KPD) and the Social Democrats (SPD). The National Socialists (Nazis) were right wing.  Your characterization of Jeremy Christian as a leftist is not accurate. He's an angry and volatile man who was all over the political map. His Facebook postings also included support for Trump. This Oregonian June report provides a good description of Christian with many of his posts and statements:  http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2017/05/who_is_jeremy_christian_facebo.html  So the support for your claim "So much hatred comes from the far left" is to hold up a bizarre, angry murderer with no strong party affiliation, plus an incorrect characterization of the Nazis in Germany from 70+ years ago. There probably is some hatred among those of the extreme left, but you haven't shown it.
Roman Leverenz, “This is the price we pay for our freedom”, which liberal talking point did you get that one from in regard to the Second Amendment?  Don't insult the brave men and women who sacrificed their lives for out freedom and paid the ultimate price with you idiot talking points.  You should be aware they did just that so you could spout such trash without fear of retribution from the government you want to run all our lives.
After they're done hooting, hollering, crotch-grabbing, and laughing at the frustrated liberals, the final sad irony will fall hardest on the Trump supporters.  People who are educated, have strong job and career prospects, and make decent money will be insulated (at least to some degree) from the problems Trump causes in the economy.   However, the disasters Trump will bring on this country will fall on the white uneducated, middle class with little to no financial cushion much harder than on anyone else. The uneducated white males who elected him are the vulnerable ones, and they will not like what happens next. Little consolation for me, because I don't wish to see anyone get their house foreclosed or lose a job, but helps to put things in perspective.
I find it very sad that a grown man would disparage others for pursuing what interests them, and suggest they are dumb because of it.
I understand that people have all sorts of perversions that they engage in to elicit feelings of euphoria.  That sort of behavior is childish; recognizing that love does not require sexual euphoria and that sex is an act of anatomical and physiological importance is the sign of one who has matured beyond his childish desire for self gratification.  Two male friends can love one another with deep-seated emotion.  Without the inclination to engage in sodomy with one another, they cannot be a "gay" couple.  Sodomy is the key characteristic that distinguishes them from being just good friends.
These comments are amusing. If a native shoots a whale liberals love it. If a white guy shoots a moose they think he belongs in jail. That is why most people think liberals are mentally ill.
I won't use the word "white" if there were other non-Indians out there. But nearly all the non-Indians happened to be white people. If there were nothing but black people out there, I would write "black sycophants".  If a black man beat up a little old lady, I would called him a "black thug". If that person happens to be white, then its "white thug".  I don't see how a descriptive word could be considered as a racist. If a male attacked a female...would that be a sexist term?  Indian Lovers is a universal term is it not? Why would it be racist? If I am a Motown lover, would that make me a racist?? If you love haiku, would that make you a racist. I think we are throwing that word "racist" too much in this world.
WOW! If YOU aren't the 'pot calling the kettle black'! You'd better take a very serious look in the mirror. Your comment is nothing but TOTAL reverse DISCRIMINATION, hypocritical & offensive!! Don't stand too close to me (not that I'd let you) when lightening strikes! How do you know anybody here is white?! (yes I do happen to be a white male. So I guess that makes me a racist pig, eh?!) Here's an old saying, 'don't judge a person until you've walked a mile in their shoes. As far as I'M concerned, racism of ANY kind (including reverse-discrimination) is UNACCEPTABLE in today's world. Unfortunately I don't see YOU changing your POOR ATTITUDE anytime soon (I hope I'm wrong). People like yourself need to take a cultural sensitivity course. Don't take Hallowe'en so seriously people! It's supposed to be 1 day a year when kids can have some fun! As long as they aren't acting like criminals & dressing-up like, for example, terrorists then who cares?! Let kids have fun while they are young!
You should direct your comments to the folks earlier who claimed that having sex with other men does not make you gay.  It's being attracted to them that makes them gay.  You folks need to really get your message straight.  You aren't sure what or what isn't the definition of gay.  Regardless of if it's having sex with a man or being attracted to men, either way it's a choice.  Unless you can show me evidence of two male cats having sex with each other.
When will people stop blaming the victim? Why don't you ask the question...when will abusive men stop beating women? Disgusting
"Angry white men" Well, this sounds like angry anti-white screed to me. Until we stop with the simplistic thinking of people in terms of categories, fabricated to boost ourselves up and tear other people down, not much progress can be expected.
the 97% bs again? man get some help there is no 97% anything you brain washed ignorant loser.. its idiots like you that deny reality,, here to help you get some of that brain washing removed,, as for your hate and ignorance on fossils,, get some serious professional help there too  http://climatechangedispatch.com/97-articles-refuting-the-97-consensus/
"...pander to Jewish voters..." - Alceste  My, my, look at the racist who usually hides under his thin veneer posing as the resident intellectual poo-bah dispensing truth and wisdom for  us lesser beings. Commentators on the Left not only continuously demonstrate reverse-racism against whites, Jews and older white males in particular - even when they themselves are washed-up old legal beagles - their complete intolerance for any view other than a so-called Progressive one - about as progressive as Communism ever was in its heyday (newsflash - the Dream is over), is sadly ironic. It is also rather comical to watch them bow and scrape to the multi-culti god they have created out of their deep and pervasive ignorance, shame and self doubt regarding our shared Western cultural heritage - the most progressive on the planet when compared to the truly xenophobic Middle Eastern and Asian cultures that either do not allow immigrants or do not grant citizenship.  Wake up Lefty "useful idiots".
Wrong... what is malignant is the media.  What the media is doing is taking sides against half the country who believe what Trump is doing is the right thing and it is bias schmucks like you in the media that are part of the problem not part of the cure.    In fact for decades now you have declared war against the average working man/woman because you think YOU are enlightened and that the citizenry are too stupid to manage their our own lives... that YOU and big brother govt knows best.     So thanks but no thanks asking for our help in destroying Trump... we plan on destroying the scum in the media instead.
I have been looking at topless magazines and pornography since I was a young boy. Boobs are sexual and provacitive. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills reading this shit. These women and supporters are looking for every angle to protest equality. Men and women are created different. Equal and different. I'm a 30 year old male. The way women dress in our society already has me breaking my neck and "objectifying women". Put a nice set of boobs in front of me and I know I'm going look and think sexual thoughts. Without that intention even. The woman in the article stated women should be able to be topless because men can do it. What is being eluded to in the comments about the nature of men and the way we are wired. Is that we see boobs, or tight cloths, and our minds shift to wanting said "object". The sexual urge takes over. My point is this is not about inequality. This is about our physical anatomy being different. Have some morals. Making men wear shirts is more logical than this B.S.
If I call you a liar, then it is because you lied. As I said, I have one and only one criterion for saying that someone is a liar: Has that person lied?  You said that the magisterium never changed a teaching. This is a lie. I gave you the specific example of Pius IX saying that freedom of religion was an insanity, while Vatican II said it was a basic right of all people -- you lied when you said that these statements did not contradict each other.  I called you unchristian when you condemned that official of the Knights of Malta to hell for working to distribute condoms to sex slaves to prevent them getting sexually transmitted diseases. (And you lied when you say that you have not said that anyone was going to hell.) The unloving, unmerciful and unjust God you have created in your own image and likeness might condemn such a man to hell, the God that actual Christians worship would not. I am not "casting aspersions on your character", I and describing your lack of Christian love.
The officer that shot the man was black.... what do you mean "white people"?
Men whose Number One criteria for a woman is 'she's gotta be hot' usually attract gold diggers who view men as ATMs.
Why does this lady keep acting like children are morons or can't think? If the young man accessed the internet, read some stuff thaen ask. What's the big discount for? If you think children are stupid then I beg you to see how internationally children are kicking our natural asses across all spectrums. It's like we expect our children to be brainless.
Throwing common sense to the wind, we continue to search Baptists and Anglicans, Boy Scouts and grandmothers at airports, because to focus on the known perpetrators of terrorism worldwide - Islamists - would be seen to be discriminatory.  And so, in the interests of political correctness, most of our resources are wasted harassing the innocent instead of tracking down militants before they wreak their damage.    Somebody needs to tell government that looking for gold in a silver mine is a fool's errand.
Where your article tries to switch the truth to make the narrative what you want it to be, PROVING that yu are as bad as the rest of the CORRUPT NEWS AGENCIES!! For IF YOU WERE HONEST you would have accounted for the TRUTH ABOUT CRIMES FOR THE FACT REMAINS AND PEOPLE THAT AINT LIBERAL SHEEP WILL SEE THIS!! That even though the blacks only make up 13% of the population THEY COMMIT MORE THEN80% OF ALL CRIME AND YOUR 6% OF BLACK MEN COMMITTED 60% OF ALL MURDERS!!! THUS WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THEM BEING TARGETED NOW??? IF IT WERNT FOR YOUR DISHONEST BEHAVIOR YOU WOULD NOT BE A LIBERAL NEWS AGENCY!!! YOU ALL SUCK AND YOU ARE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY. MAYBE IF YOU HAD SOME INTEGRITY YOU WOULD NOT BE SUCH WORTHLESS SCUM!!
"Icky" is an other one of those word games that the homosexual activists use to make abhorrence to sodomy sound silly.  Meanwhile, thousands and thousands of men who don't think homosexual sodomy is icky are suffering and dying from HIV/AIDS.  Sodomy is a lot more than icky: it's downright deadly.
May argument isn't moot so long as there are voices in America like "lespark"'s and "Pocho"'s above.  As to Trump and his psyche at least, not in my view.  The Diplomats, I think, are intelligent, knowledgeable and able.  T The President is unstable, and seems to blow with the direction of the latest hot air he hears.   Further, I expect that there were similarly intelligent, knowedgeable and able Presidential advsors iimploring him to make an immediate and contemporaneous White Supremacist naming comment.  He did what he did, in the manner he did.  We all saw that.  Unless his staff is White Suprmacist - which is a considerable fear.  Projected onto international dispute/conciliation behavior, it does not bode well.  DESPITE the involvement of cooler headed and intelligent diplomats.  Donald Trump is definitely his own man.  That "man" likes to threaten Armadas and Fire and Fury upon another nation.    Certainly NK is a problem that must be addressed.   BUT, carefully and artfully.
Black men are also more likely to be killed by other black men. That little stat goes right out the window though right. My privelage must be I work extremely hard for everything I have with zero gains from the government or social assistance. Poor benefit but I'm not complaining , or selling drugs, commiting crimes or joining gangs even though they exist here in good old Alberta. I can certainly thank my privelage for that, not my morals lol.
Show me any Rep. Politician in a public venue using Race as part of their qualifications for their elected seat other than a Democrat(s)? Isn't this Racism in itself? People using their Racial make-up as a means to say they understand your Racial plight in itself is playing the Race Card for votes that's creating Racial divide in the US in itself.  Any White man running for public office let alone talking with someone like that be PUMMELED, called a White Racist Bigot!  This racist remarks can only be played by a minority race in ANY Party. A Black person standing up for a White man, be called not Black Enough or Unko Thomas! Insane  I accept groups for what they are, Racists is Racists no matter how big of thing they make or not. Using one's racial background in a good way to attract votes is Racism in my Book! they may not be using their race in a bad way but it's still Playing the Race Card! Democrats m.o.  Playing the Race Card has NO place In America!  Mahalo Barry! and Friends!
Nothing quite like men making decisions about women's bodies and women's health care. And every last one of these GOP hypocrites would claim to be opposed to big, intrusive government.
The men in prison will give this low life an anal awakening  Maybe after they make him their bitch, they'll beat up on him for sexual gratification  Cut him up a little too. while their at it, give him some of his own medicine. NOT A MAN IF HE HITS A WOMEN-
Stop changing the subject. The irrefutable truth is that Obama was a classy man and Trump is an obnoxious, petulant man child.
Many of the "foreign" cars are built in Canada and the USAby men and women who live next door to the CAW/UAW workers and have the same education level.  Of course, "any idiot knows" this.
Could it be that the Muslim, Obama per the Koran, thinks that men are far superior to women and that women are sex objects for men?...Every Muslim follows the commands in the Koran...for good and for evil.   Then, we also know what the Koran says about Homosexuals...and that may be the real reason that Obama is silent.  Weinstein must know too much.
trump is a thin skinned child who is bent on undoing all things Obama without giving it any thought. He is not even 1/10 the man and president Obama was/is.   His brainless followers show how much they were duped every day.
I wonder more about how such a crass and tasteless man got elected to be President of the United States.
No. They would think that it was Hillarious. And the notion that Trump's retweet is promoting violence against women, when everyone with a functioning brain knows that it was aimed at one specific person, is the typical ridiculous overblown claim only a few buys into. Note that when Kathy Griffin held Trump's decapitated head, no one claimed that it promoted violence against men.
"There's definitely some people out there with ugly opinions." Well that is certainly true - look at all the on-line comments that talk about "old white men".
Donald Trump is a nasty man, and Hillary Clinton is a nasty woman. No matter whom you vote for, we'll end up with a nasty president.
"Hillary got a huge percentage of the black non college educated male vote."  Of course.  Why would a black male vote for a white racist?
Quote: "Michelle Obama is taking some heat for recent remarks she made on gender, but I'm struggling to muster outrage given the sheer incoherence of what she actually said."  True, I've rarely found what Michelle says coherent, but I suspect that what she's saying is primarily directed at black communities. She could have gone much further and bluntly stated that blacks coddle far too much the criminality and paternal irresponsibility in black males. (I won't call them men.) That's glaringly obvious and different from mostly white schools where ordinary boyishness is attacked as "toxic masculinity."
Pray tell how does a dead man sign there requested documents ?  He must know when he is going to die...stupid Where he-she worked for the government and they all should be available to the public... period...  bought and payed for  by us..
People forget that Muhammad Ali stated on numerous occasions that, "All white men are devils." Check YouTube videos.  Unfortunately Malcolm X got his hooks into Ali the same way that Rev "GD America" White got into President Obama for 20 years. And all this means nothing?
Prepare to be swarmed by Muslim Immigrants who are already in the  US .    During the summer they will attempt what they did at Calais France, swarm borders and force their way in. THE Liberals will be powerless to stop it once it starts.  Toronto and Montreal and Canada are not ready for the arrival of thousands of young Muslims men just as Cologne London and Paris before them
The dude just blinked.  China was told by Trump to stop him or trade will dry up with us.  China listened.  Trump's pushing back on him is what did it.  He still will have to be taken out.   Trump is brilliant.  He used China to do his dirty work for him, and is getting a good trade deal with China, is shutting up the little pork sandwich man, and just averted war for now.  All because he used his 170 IQ and went around the whiners and complainers.  Way to go Trump!! #MAGA!!!
I'm not talking about political consequences...allowing mentally ill men who like to play dress up in the same shower room as little girls WILL cause problems and have already in some places.
folks    come on now-  this is bill maher- how soon we forget but only when we want too-  the same jewish man (ok half jewish which is full jewish in some books if your liberal enough tough but only when they want to be one for argument sake) who by the way used the word nigga on nitional tv only months ago-  and boy that helped create this mess-    now he is blaming everyone else-    now he's  telling us who the real nazis are- do they use the word niggers like he did (oops as poops he slit or i meany slipped as sipped and had too much to think again)  he still has his job-   not even a whimper from the far left-  hows that for fairness and we are stupposed to listen to them closely on matters of faith and truth-    hey if it works in israel against poor palestinions as onions i guess they figure wrong that they can pull this crap in americle dig
1) So race relations have not budged since the mid-80's? Maybe update your "teaching": materials, more than 30 years have gone by and a lot of change has taken place. This invisible backpack thing is badly out dated.  2) If a teacher can shut up a white male with an insinuation straight out of Kafka's The Trial, then...what power/privilege exactly does this white male have? What systemic/institutional power is the white male using here? He is silenced, and powerless to even state an opinion. Where is all this power he has? Power is contextual, no one has all power all the time.   3) The black population of Canada is less than 3%.  White population is 80%.  Maybe, just maybe, white people have so much representation because they are the overwhelming majority. This is just a fact. There's no malice, no grand conspiracy....unless you are so racist as to think that white people are having and raising children simply to spite and hurt minorities.
He was talking about how he was molested by a priest at 13.  But that is taken out of context by his enemies who would otherwise proclaim him a victim of the Catholic Church. When he mentioned 'boys' having sex, he was talking as gay men talk about gay men, as in "The Boys are hot tonight".
No,  M.r Cool, I am pointing out the hypocrisy.   Read again WHY the orange- glazed Stay Puft man is putting this 4-month ban in place.  He wants to ENSURE that NO TERRORISTS can come into the States.
What a !$@#% kind of man are you? The woman died and you're attempting a crude joke.
You might be right Neko, but I think it was the fact I dared compare innocent Sandy Hook elementary school children gunned down by assault weapons with innocent children in the womb.  The compartmentalization I speak of is predicated on who does the killing.  White men with assault weapons are somehow different from any other class of human engaged in taking life.  White men with assault weapons are mentally ill, every other human class are murderers.    I think the one thing that really threw me about this incident is my first thought when I read about it at 1:30am out of a dead sleep when my phone when off.  "Please God don't tell me the shooter was Muslim or Black." When I realized this I was like 'how is sick is that thinking?'  And then I realized, it wasn't really all that sick.  It was the sign of the times.  I have subsequently found out I was hardly alone with that first initial thought....and that is representative of the sick state of affairs in this country.
This is such BS. I fell for my woman specifically because she didn't use sex as a tool to manipulate me into a relationship, as a "gatekeeper". I don't respect that and wouldn't be with someone that behaved that way. This kind of thinking makes women feel like sluts (in a negative sense) for enjoying sex and sexual freedom, which they should not.  The driver here isn't access to sex, Margaret. You eluded to it in your article; men don't want to settle down until they feel they're financially stable, and the work environment has changed drastically, for better or worse. I wouldn't have been interested in marriage or kids until my career was established, and that now takes a long time. It's not because sex was cheap. This article is so damaging.
So what should be done, round up every gun-toting white guy and execute them?
Nothing wrong with being a conservative woman, but I cannot agree with that 'most' men are jerks.  Those who have committed physical or mental abuse, and refuse to get help, and disregard anyone's needs except their own, definitely are.  Many will if not stopped, become murderers.  Now how can you prove your statement that alt-left women are loathsome? Has one been abusing you?
How many chiefs or band council members will have to step down or face any repercussions for protecting men they knew raped, murdered and beat women on reserves ? None. The IMMIW protects them too.
I'm laughing at all the 'real men' who look down on Pokemon players while sitting on their asses and watching sports all afternoon.
I thought that the orthodox position was that "the Sacrament of Matrimony is an exclusive life commitment between a man and woman". Now you tell me that is heresy.   Climate change deniers are not heretics. Idiocy is not the same as heresy.
"Eight years ago, when Barack Obama was elected, a lot of people weren’t happy but for the most part they moved forward to give the man a chance."  Donna, is this with the fact that hate groups in the U.S grew at an alarming rate after that election, in mind or without? And, is this with the meeting of top GOP'rs at the Caucus House Restaurant in D.C. to plot to obstruct the new (black) President at every turn, on Inauguration Day 2009, in mind or without?   I'm sorry that guy was a jerk to you, but do you not see a disconnect as a Christian in supporting someone who brags about grabbing women by their privates? This is not to mention every other demagogic, xenophobic, and otherwise horrible un-Christian things Trump said during the campaign, and continues to this day. Or are you one who just blames media i.e. kill the messenger and doesn't believe a word of it?    https://www.splcenter.org/   http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/03/The-Conspiracy-to-Commit-Legislative-Constipation
This is such a piece of sexist garbage.  So, the only thing that motivates men to do anything is sex?  That's the only reason that they educate themselves, learn manners, get a good job?  On top of that, women have to stop "giving away the milk" in order to make sure men civilize themselves.  Good god, what millennium are you living in, Ms. Wente?  Believe it or not, there are many, many other things that motivate men, including self-respect and a desire to do good in the world.
The only white guy that I despise is the Chump. He is sick, vile and disgusting. He is dividing our country. My comments are merely pointing out the fact that a white male opened fire on an audience at a country western music concert. In all of the news reports that I have watched. I haven't seen a Black,Muslim, or Asian. Only Whites and Latinos. Thos why do you think the gunman chose that specific event to accomplish his unimaginable massacre.
Pride began fragmenting when the Dyke March allowed the females to have an event that specifically discriminated against  gay men.  It was further weakened by the removal of "Gay" from the name,  to be a generic  "Pride"   which simple worked to eliminate gay men from the identity of it.  TI was further damaged when the gay men of Toronto,were accused of being nothing better than racist KKK  hate monger  by BLM and NOBODY... NOT TORY>NOT THE MEDIA>  NOT KATHLEEN WYNNE > NOT KIRSTEN WONG TAM > NOT JUSTIN TRUDEAU came to our defense.  They all tacitly agreed that the white gay boys of Church St , who  started Gay Pride in 1981,  really  are a despicable bunch of curs because nobody dared refuted   BLM's accusations. .    Again and always the gays get thrown under the bus,  This is a boot stomp to the face of Toronto's gay population.
I am not "accusing all cops of wanting to kill people", and it is another example of your lying about what I say. In this post, you have abandoned the logical fallacy of the Ad Hominem, and taken up the logical fallacy of the Straw Man. As well as the blatant lie.
It is hard to be lectured about humility by arrogant men, just as it is difficult to hear a lecture on morality from men who continue to aid and abet that supremely immoral act of abusing the innocent.  But, of course, we must accept this, as these arrogant and immoral men are the chosen leaders of the One True Church and hold the keys to salvation.  Unless, of course, we reach the conclusion they aren't, and don't, but that would hardly be a conclusion about the Institution that Jesus would accept, is it....
goathair calls you Scott. He is not a smart man.
This is ridiculous. If a citizen were to exit their vehicle and open another drivers door as this off duty police officer did, charges would definitely be pressed. And then to use his position as some sort of threat and excuse as to his actions is unacceptable. Disappointed, not surprised, that this man and his wife were able to lie their way out of the husbands actions. Shame on you "officer".
Obama humiliates Trump by his mere existence. Eloquence and wisdom coming from a Black man...no wonder why Trump and his White Supremacists hate him.
Such a bitter, little, uneducated man you are.  I fear you don't know how to type a memo.
Am I the only person that thinks this man behaved like a giant baby , and is a embarrassment to men?
All his phony leaks was a figament of his imagination any one can imagine hearing  something other than what was really said like I would love to eat a donut the man says and then repeating that he heard the man say he ate 6 donuts. and that's the case here comey should have never had the position as FBI director he is a pansie dude and probably GAY.
Obama is a nice little black man who is a wonderful speaker and only if he was Gay.
This opinion piece is disgusting, out of touch and clueless. Why are these questions being asked of Mr. Singh? Would we ask Andrew Scheer to denounce Mark Lepine, the white male terrorist responsible for the Ecole Polytechnique massacre? No of course not, that's absurd. However the white centric media's push to associate Mr. Singh with terrorist activities is telling and concerning. I'm not surprised. I'v noticed some older white Canadians are losing thier shit because we have a Sikh leading one of the three major political parties. Get used to it. I can't expect a very white, very male media to have some sence about how to cover Mr. Singh. It's going to be racist and stupid. However, decent Canadians, non racist Canadians, Canadians of colour will speak up and resist.  Jagmeet Singh is the new, very handsome face of Canada people. Get used to it. And I'm not going to respond to clueless racist commments about how the brown people are taking over. I said what I said.
Hugh: Ali would have looked down on you, and not respected you, unless you yourself are black, heterosexual, married to a black woman, and a Muslim.   If you don't fall into that category, then you would have been a devil in his eyes.  When asked by a BBC reporter about his beliefs that black people should not associate with whites, he said this:  "There are white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?"  That is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.  The fact that his analogy for white people was that they are rattlesnakes says a lot.  What if a white person said that of blacks??
Most of the old white wise men in the GOP have had damaged brains for years.
Seriously do you even know one person that eats sheep?  They are predated upon by trophy hunters, stupid men and women with something to prove by hanging somethings head with horns on their wall.  I have a dream that I can hang a few stupid people heads on my wall one day...there is a place where you can go that actually lets you hunt humans, and damn, that must be so, so satisfying if you can pony up the quarter million bucks ;-)
I don't care if he's young and stupid, being stupid when it comes to sex with minors is a felony. I know all you guys maybe understand and have some sympathy for this hopped up male but some things can't be excused. New world fellows, where any woman to your liking is not subject to your desires. Deal with it and keep it in your pants, please!
Hey, where's your buddy david duke? You guys going to do some docking and talk about the evil black man?
I am struck by the irony of illegals showing the same contempt for the rule of law that is the cause of their homelands being such a mess. I am amused by the presumption by their advocates that all the "Dreamers" plan to go to college and become scientists, doctors and lawyers. The truth is that the overwhelming majority will end up as unskilled labor. For every young woman who gets a four year degree there are ten who will be on their third pregnancy by the time they are 19. For every young man who earns an engineering degree there are a dozen who join gangs. What we can expect from these youth (ages up to 30) is shown in their demonstrations where they do not plead for a chance at a better life, but DEMAND some imagined right to invade this nation and live off the taxpayers generosity. They and their advocates militant approach is not winning a lot of support. I agree with those who say that letting this generation stay ensures another wave of invaders.
so men are all the same - is that your point?  I knew this woman who was really b*thchy every month ... should I judge all women in the same way?
Thanks you bum Obama.  Get out and let the real men try to clean up your messes.
That doesn't change the fact that the priesthood is full of gay men. The Church created that situation with their hatred of homosexual people. Karma Karma Karma.
I attended every Pride from 1981 on the lawn at Hart House to last year's fiasco. .  I have had great times and seen it grow from a little gathering on a lawn to the extravaganza it now is. But i always feared the destruction of Pride was inevitable when a bunch  of angry dykes threatened to kick my teeth in for  showing little pencil sketch of a female nude at  a display of art at Hart House. The creation of the Dyke March, that segregated gay men out to benefit the lesbians was a slice of the pie  too big.  Even the change of the name from GAY Pride to merely Pride was to dilute the contribution of  the men.  What started as a celebration of gay or LGBT unity has become a power struggle where the gay men of Toronto are now classified as racist hate filled bastards who must be cast out.   Yet, we are still expected to pay for it.
What don't you agree with BLM?  The reason why they are protesting or the manner in which they are?   I've seen horrific videos of black men being shot by police officers and the black man in the video was acting COMPLETELY nice, polite, and was NOT a threat to the cop at any level, yet he gets shot in front of his girlfriend, who's also behaving completely appropriate and she watched her boyfriend die right next to her and all they did was have a broken tail light.   The police officer was completely wrong.  How would you feel if that happened to you?   Yes, there are a couple of bad apples that screw it up for the rest, but they are upset about being racially profiled, and there's been a rash of killings of blacks by cops and that's just not right.  Yes, I've seen cops behave inappropriately toward whites too.  I don't know what the problem is, but there are a lot of cops, not all of them, but a lot that have been just not behaving properly and groups like BLM is the result.
No one is going to defend these guys. They're garbage, and will rightfully rot in prison.   You'll notice when cops shoot a white guy, thousands of white people don't march in his defense?
You're saying your god doesn't believe in abortion? Really? Read the old testament. He orders his minions to kill every man, woman (including pregnant ones) and child (except for the virgin girls!) so many times. He's a psycho. He made homosexuality because to christians he made us all.  In the new testament Jesus does not follow the old rules. Remember an eye for an eye? He changed it to turn the other cheek. Jews stoned people but Jesus didn't. He actually stopped a stoning. Telling them those without sin can continue to stone her.  I'd suggest you read how the bible was put together and when. I did that after Prevo start thumping his bible to keep gay discrimination going. I keep meaning to thank him for helping me become an athiest.
Trump voters and supporters lost the right to comment on the word “decency” when they decided that a self-absorbed, selfish, egocentric, mentally unstable, White Supremacist, narcissistic, pathological liar, con man, thief, cheat, sexual predator, pedophile and traitor represents them and their “values,” with Trump being their idea of a role model.  As to your question, it went when you voted to befoul the country and the White House with the king of sleaze.
It's men's fault that kids are fat.  Got it.  Great article.
RE: Boston Globe commentary: "For some Catholics, endorsements from the pulpit don't work"  The author is right on target.  In fact, prelate pulpit political endorsements imply that the laity are too stupid and spiritually vapid to sort out complex issues for themselves,  and should instead obey the voting dictate of the local bishop... a man whose first and only allegiance is to Rome, not U.S. representative democracy.   I've watched our own local bishop happily go down the rightwing culture war rabbit hole of conspiracy theory more than once while issuing letters on how to vote on issues and candidates.  His tunnel vision and lack of regard for complexity is astonishing.   The olds days of blind obedience to prelates are over...  it's no wonder that certain retro-bishops and their followers long to return to the 1940s and 50s... no one would actually have to learn and think.
And yet a man who "grabs her by the pussy" is elected president..
so funny...yea, I'm a male nurse, took all the jokes about if I were gay, was the last time those individuals joked me about anything. I tell ya, I know a few RN's who are ex SEALS who would love to hear you joke them if they are gay.  People need to grow up.  Nurse are both male and female and both have some gays just like in any other profession.  But hey...just keep right on joking us male nurse...till you meet one of us who will very kindly show you the path to....
Male genitals are weapons of rape!!!!!
Missing from the raw statistics are the denial, deceit and delusion surrounding who shoots whom...and why.  Pretending that suicides and homicides are symptoms of comorbidity in an otherwise disparate geographical area is lumping explicit discernible factors into one single cause - gunfire.  Suicides have virtually nothing to do with homicides.  There are as many reasons for suicide as those commit suicide.  Homicides, on the other hand, are clearly divisible between the three major categories (crime, random violence, & personal conflicts) as well as the occasional murder-suicides.  Blacks make up the majority of homicide deaths and have the highest rate of homicide of any racial or ethnic group.  Young black males are predators at a rate wildly out of proportion to their percentage of the population.  Whether the victims are black, white, hispanic or asian - the trigger is most likely pulled by a black male.
"Big man, pig man Ha, ha, charade you are"  Pink Floyd Pigs (Three Different Ones)
Simple. Because good women are hard to find and bellow average women not only have a bad habit of seeing themselves as above average, they have a bad habit of seeing themselves as above top 10%, and women in general have a bad habit of seeing any male bellow top 20% as bellow average.  One good way to point out the idea. No one would call an out a charismatic of shape rich ugly man with a bullshit job and a few bullshit degrees top notch in the dating market, regardless of how many languages he speaks fluently. But you folks have been calling a, anti-social snob upper middle class woman in her 30s who looks well past middle-age, which a bunch of social studies degree's and sorta speaks three language the cream of the crop even if she can't even lift half her weight and thinks that a baby/child is heavy. Women which just flipping the description ends up with a guy that has to resort to prostitutes which hate him for being so pathetic.
In 2012, white males were 38 percent of the population and committed 4,582 murders. That same year, black males were just 6.6 percent of the population but committed a staggering 5,531 murders.  In other words: black people–at just a fifth of the size–committed almost 1,000 more murders than their white counterparts.
Raised, Val and Shosno,  Post your photos and let's see what you look like. Insulting someone's looks makes you a jerk, and yes, it is being mean to say that. What an asshat comment to make (and like). You got the stones to talk crap about someone's looks but you clearly DON'T have the stones to post your pictures, much less pictures of you doing anything.   Chris, you have a daughter, how would you feel about something derogatory things about how she looks? Because people can dish that same medicine to you. Karma is a b#^%*. When someone talks like that to your daughter and she is upset and her feelings are hurt remember this moment. As a man, you should lead by example how men treat should treat women. Post a picture of your kids and let's see what other bullies have to say about them. But you won't so I'm over this conversation, Karma comes around ...  Keep being jerks. Congratulate yourself on being bullies.
"I am sooooooo tired of the feminization of men in this society "  Your masculine anxiety is showing - just so you know.
And also woman, if you think porn is better than sex you like porn more than most guys. Porn isn't a substitute for sex, men and women have masturbated since ever using their imagination just fine. Women have dildos since before history and puritan women bemoaned it because it "gave the appearance that women want sex just as much as men want" just like nowdays feminists and past day as well bemoan them because it gives the appearance that women like dick just as much as men like pussy. Here's a secret, both are true. Isolated women will turn prison gay way quickier than men. And if you put a man and a woman that hate despise and are disgusted with each other to their guts she'll try to fuck him way before he even considers it. If you put two straight women in that situation they will turn prison gay way quicker than the guy in that scenario to consider fucking the woman he despises. (I'm saying this first hand)  Solution? Accept the current state and revel in it.
Caiside, you absolutely do not have one ounce of substantive thought in your head or you are woefully incapable of translating it into words.  Your "poking fun" at persons for liking their own posts is quite annoying and very uncharitable.  I've found that to be true of most liberals.  When they can't intelligently respond to views they disagree with, they always reach for the straw man, which in your case, is very uncharitable and un-Christ like.
A soldier boasting about his battles is a common and tolerated thing. Sajjan risked his life many times for you. There are too many low white racists in Canada. This is a brave soldier who gave a somewhat exaggerated account of his role in one battle. Big deal. Ordinarily, it would be shrugged off with a wink and an amused grin. But the man is brown and so all the white skunks have leapt on him.
Inferring that I am mentally ill?  THAT'S what you've got?  You are a sad little man.....
Man, time to start packin again.... Getting tired of this crap!
Why not simply refuse a permit to this ridiculous group? What other group has parades to celebrate their sexual preferences? A bunch of low intellect guys and women in g strings is a waste of road space. I have little if any concern about what people do in their bedrooms (or their local parks) but until they have a heterosexual parade or a celibacy parade or a freaky fetish parade this one will be ignored. Wait until these BLM fools who are  now controlling the parade actually need a cop......let them do without.
I'm with the Nasty Woman and the Bad Hombres.
Men are raped, mistreated, assaulted etc. If the GM is about equality why do they never talk about men's issues? - https://youtu.be/qRgORR8vqns
Isn't more like this?  Muslim guy kills, tougher immigration laws are the answer.  White guy kills, tax reform is the answer.
And everyone else we catch sexting, even womem in positions of power in academic institutions, women who use sexts to catch men who they think will advance their careers!
Then why aren’t Muslim men wearing this religious symbol instead of only submissive Muslim women ?
O.J. is not just any black man. He is wealthy and famous. These things buy justice, regardless of color.
Try being gay, white, and a conservative male.  You get bashed because you are while and male.  You get bashed because you are gay and conservative.  Some people just think in terms of identity politics and don't realize that people are people.
This is COLLEGE age women?  Look at that blackboard. It looks more like something in Middle School! Ohhh...the poor lil snowflakes! Their professors and advisors have convinced the college age women and the Minorities that "If you are on a college campus...You are in danger!" This is happening all over the country. How many sexual assaults have been committed on the UO campus lately? Are these serious attacks? or a slap on the butt? Unacceptable, to be sure. but a serious crime? "Whatever we wear, wherever we go, yes means yes, and no means no.” Wow. Is this advice for 13 year old girls?  Translation: "I have the right to dress revealingly and be out @ 2:15 AM and if YOU , "Mr. Man" interpret my actions as a sexual come on...THAT is your problem.  BUT, I reserve the Right to have consensual sex with you ...BUT, if I later regret my choice, I can report it as a rape or sexual assault."  NO wonder more and more young men are going "MGTOW" !
The Inquisition is not the only alternative to tossing gay men off buildings.   There are a lot of other options.
You clearly haven’t thought this one thru. That kid is going to have to live as a girl 24/7. That means hair, makeup, clothes, the whole bit. No hanging with the guys. No male sports. Not to mention that they’ve removed themselves from the hetero dating pool, pretty much permanently. And that’s not considering the abuse they’ll receive from their former male friends. Words like gay, fag and freak come to mind - and those are the milder ones. And then there’s the little matter of abuse - a significant percentage of transgendered individuals are the victims of assault.
I guess the centuries of female transgressions do not exist... for Denise, its ... what are you talking about?   straight white men are the evil ones....  women are without fault in this. When progressives operate, its whatever convenient lies will work. Take the Muslim student council female who made hateful remarks about white people. Now the progressive professors and students are claiming that when Dalhousie intends to hold her accountable that free speech is threatened. What a laugh... if a white person had said those same things about blacks, asians, muslims, native indians, GLBTQ people.... there would be a human rights trial and firing, dismissal, shaming and new stricter rules and laws. LYING HYPOCRITES... all of the progressives. Hateful and racist themselves.
We men? Ive raped nobody. Blaming an entire gender for a few bad apples, how does that help anything? People who will rape will rape. The average guy won't. Stop with your stupid generalizations.  Because I was born a white male I'M apparently a priveledged rapist? Stop drinking the kool-aid, you being brainwashed.
God damn the pusher man!
They call it "ObamaCare" instead of the "ACA" to remind everyone it was Obama's signature bill. They tell lies about it because they cannot stand that an African-American man could possibly have achieved what Bill Clinton and the Bushes could not, to craft a workable health care bill which was so promised before. In the end, Trump and his followers agenda is to undo all the great things President Obama did, quite simple because he was not White. When I see all the hatred in the GOP / Tea Party ranks, pure and simple racism is behind most of it. How sad!
Extremely disgusting ignorant to say about men why don't men have a right to dignity.  You must have an extremely sick mind to be turned on by this.
"Do you men Nazi Germany?"  I don't think Kurgan means that, a eugenics program. In 1933, the Nazi Reich Cabinet passed the "Laws for the Prevention of Hereditary Diseased Offspring," a eugenics program, which forced legalized sterilization. Later the Nazis built on those Laws, among others, to promote the annihilation of Jews and other "offspring undesirables" all over Europe. But "striving for purity" among the Nazis always meant racial purity, eugenics, etc. -- all of which eventually led to the holocaust.
Motley:  this is an interesting topic.  Certainly, pedophiles often seek positions where they can find and groom potential victims.  Yes, scout leaders, teachers, coaches, church youth group leaders, Catholic priests, vounteers to youth assistance programs, et al.  It's also interesting that the Boy Scouts have long prohibited gay men from serving as Scout leaders.  Yet, the organization has a long history of "non-gay" leaders being pedophiles... Folllowing is a quotation from an excellent article addressing this issue.  I've also provided the link so you or anyone else can read the entire article.  regards, Gary Crum
Isabella Fajardo - I don't care who you have sex with - not my business.  But if you have something hanging between your legs, you are a MAN and do not go in the Ladies room.  No ifs, ands, or buts.  Get over it.
Chicks who cried wolf should pay for the rescue. All that man hours, fuel and so on isn’t cheap. “ pay up suckers “!!!!!
I understand that you are one of them categorically. So, if your category  (most of your under educated white man Trump supporters) is going to understand my post, I would probably be doing what I said above, until then I will just have to go along with you idiots, I can't afford to go off grid and shop at co-op markets and buy an elecrtic car. But I do refuse to stick my head so far up my @zz until all I see is $&!t.
NOBODY was the right to tell you what to do with your body! | That is the FUN-damental  right and freedom of all humans. | Not the government, society, your friends, your family, your wife or husband. | Women won the right to abortion years ago, they won the right not a be a mother; A sex object. Men are still fighting for the right not be objects of production. Mostly it is men who use drugs, men who are expected to work. That is the sin. That is why men in Canada live 10 years less then women, they are expected to be human machines and not complain. |
White male racists did it
Carmen Gutierrez is a gold digger and nothing more.  Don't be fooled like my father was, Rod Bradley.  Carmen was having an affair with a married man while my father was dying.  She then proceeded to attempt to cheat my sister and I out of our inheritance.  This woman is trash and I will never forgive Rod for his poor judgement in character time and again.
Would a man scream if I pinched his butt at the grocery store?
Is this the same Japanese PM who continues to honor his country's war criminals from WWII?  Is that man complaining that North Korea might punk Japan the way Japan punked half of Asia?  Maybe Shitzo Abe should shut his cake hole until he's willing to say sorry for WWII.
"An intrinsic part of the sacramental sign of Holy Orders is the manhood of Christ." Fascinating.  So Jesus, even now, having returned to his fully divine existence, still has male genitals.  Who would have thought?
That's james martin's own (now quite old) article!  He's part of the mafia/lobby.  He's not objective.  Of course it's a rational act to look at the numbers from John Jay and draw a conclusion that a male priest seeking another post-pubescent male is a "same sex" act, abuse or otherwise.  A 35 year old male seeking sex with a 17 year old male is more similar to gay sex between a 35 year old male seeking sex with an 18 year old male, than any act between an adult and a 2 year old!.    We must return to rationality, and avoid the "advocate" thinking, such as what james martin pushes.
"men dressed as nuns, simulated sexual acts on floats, etc"  Imagine the outrage if there were men dressed in hijabs or as imams...
It's so "refreshing" to have a man tell me what kind of crap I might have to deal with as a female CEO. Thanks for the mansplanation.
Bernie's managed to get through life without ever having a productive job by getting elected by people like you and amassing a net worth over $3 million.  He has the support of about half of the Democratic Party who are the furthest left, a party that's only a third of the electorate.  I hope you nominate him. He'll lose every state except DC, breaking a record held by Reagan's two opponents.  Integrity, my butt.  The man's an economic moron, assuming he believes what he's running on, which I doubt.  Which makes him a con man preying on the economically illiterate.
How does thew Globe let this lady write for them. She should be on CNN. Listen up Reznetti it was either a mad man or a felon. The USA went with the mad man.
Not bitter.  Just speaking the truth about a very bad and dangerously ignorant man.
A gun grabber who believes in climate change and LGBT rights is the right man for the job? Trump is losing his mind.
The Catholic Church knows first hand what happens when you allow homosexual males to have close contact with young boys.
Kayden, religion has nothing to do with this. Hinduphobia- no it's cult and self seeking power hungry crooks like your man Butler that jump on the religious wagon who have no qualms about lying and cheating their way up the political ladder.  In Tulsi Gabbard's case, her guru has taken advantage of her cult beliefs she was born into and abused the fact that she is beholden to him. As he says when he initiates his disciples, you are now mine and I will instruct you how you can serve ME. Fanaticism not religion.  Cry yourself silly with all your talk on religious bigotry, homophobic backed support, Hillary Clinton money, and whatever else you can lash out with.  How about all the other religions, I don't see Tulsi and Butler supporting them. In fact she down right degrades the Muslims. Butler has always spoken very unkindly of Gays, Blacks, Muslims Christians and Jews.  Beware Hawaii, Tulsi and anyone who adheres to him, has no place in our democratic system.
You are correct. Pitts is a racist. I have seen the trash he writes for over a decade. He has "everything is the white man's fault" mentality. His columns are only good for lining pet cages.
Don't worry, not one cent of your tax dollars will end up in the hands of women or gay men.... unless they are called "President", "Minister" or "General"
Because he's a horrible guy.
Another sicko. When a man chooses to hit a woman he is no longer a man.
Nothing new here.  Sex has always been a form of currency.  Margaret wants a return to the days of hours of begging.  It's not going to happen.  It's a little more complicated than the few variables she presented in the column.  For instance, young men have watched their hard working, faithful fathers get trampled by the patriarchal legal system when their mothers are "not happy" and go off to find themselves.  Women are now the initiators of divorce.  Young men will have none of this destruction.  Porn ?  Absolutely, just wait for the life-like sex dolls.  The Pandora's box is wide open.
Wow! That's quite the Straw Man. Kaepernick did far more than just "kneeling", and everyone knows it. It's about what his kneeling represents. 1. Kaepernick accused white people of today of oppressing black people and people of color, which is an outright racist Lie!  2. He then equated today's police with slave catchers! Another despicable racist Lie!  3. He then said "America has never been great for people of color." all while he is making 17 million dollars per year in a country led by a black President! More anti-white hate and rhetoric. 4. He publicly supported Fidel Castro, while wearing a shirt with him on it. 5. He wore socks to practice depicting the police as Pigs! 6. And to top it off, here's what this genius said about both Presidential candidates Hillary and Trump: - "Both are proven liars and it almost seems like they’re trying to debate who’s less racist."  .  Yes, Kaepernick is an anti-American, anti-white, racist hatemonger. As are those who follow and support him.
I thought the march was in support of women's rights?  Suggest you don't disrespect their goals through mission creep.  Typical white male, trying to take over to suit his own agenda.
As a one more, Where do the souls of McConnells and his ilk's supporters, go when they die? Do they go to their white mans heaven? Or hell? I recall that their white mans jesus was a refugee fleeing a guaranteed death from a propped up Roman Empire despot, who was no different than the double digit despots we prop up worldwide, for the same colonial reasons the Imperial Roman Empire did. I recall that the Jewish priests had the Romans kill the jesus, for messing up their corruption, no different than the Vatican being built off the backs of hundreds of millions slaughtered Natives through the centuries. Yah,I would say that McConnell, his ilk,and their supporters are on a one way ticket to their Christian hell, no different than the Islamic terrorists created by McConnell and his republican and democrat cronies, are on their ways to their Islamic hells, without their 72 virgins, for slaughtering so many thousands of innocents
I don't agree. White people commit crimes just like black, samoan, asian, etc. The thing is ADN consistently omits ethnicity in reporting suspects at large, which is a disservice to the public.  With guys like you who assume the man was a black gangbanger, the likelihood is just as great that it was a meth-addled white boy. A sad commentary on your bias. What I am asking for is ADN to tell the whole story.
Tribal preservation has not been the reason for opposing homosexual conduct for a long, long time.  If it ever was.  The Jews were not stupid; they could see a universe filled with the relationship between a thing and its proper end, and could see that males, especially, were never intended by nature or the creator to be end to end.   When the OT and Paul so fiercely condemned homosexual conduct, they were not moved primarily by tribal preservation.  That much is clear from the words of scripture itself.
The author appears to be married to a white guy based on her last name. Maybe she is a self hater like all those other oriental women who lust after white men.
You sound  like a animal abuser yourself and should be locked up.. Your defending a man who killed a cat you sick freak!!! Your just as guilty for defending a cat killer, and who cares if it killed a couple chickens that can be replace for a couple dollars, which is bs is my opinion, it was the only excuse he had to cover his ass.. I hope he gets tought a lesson.  Maybe you should go get some help to, becuase you sound like you got problems yourself. If you think its okay to take a small animals life then your just as crazy as him, i have a cat and she's like my kid, id shit bricks if someone hurt her in anyway, i am an animal lover. And i just hate ppl who wanna hurt anything defenseless not just animals but humans to..
That's right Lindy.  We need to lift the ban on people bringing kids that were not born here to Alaska.  Obviously if he is a criminal he is Alaskan because we all know that most Alaskan males are criminal misogynists.
Trump may be male, however he isn't a man.  Men have self control, and demonstrate respect for other people.
The man is an idiot... A rich idiot.  He has beaten the little guy so often for so long, and look where it got him.  Strange thing,  the people he beat to a pulp put him there.   Name me one smart American... Just ONE.
If "Mr." Reese has a problem with "celibate old men", why should we listen to this "old", cranky, modernist Jesuit {redundant?} at all? The Church has a "problem" with young people because---wait for it--they are, by and large, more conservative/traditional than this pathetic snowflake Vatican II generation. They see the rampant abuse and distortion of dogmatic teaching and the confection of the Sacraments {particularly the circus-game show atmosphere to which the Novus Ordo Mass so often devolves} and want no part of it. On a humanistic level, can't say that I blame them.
What a ridiculous outdated thing to say.  The police are not a minority or cultural group.  They are a government agency made up of a cross section of Canadians.  Where is your proof of all this undue harassment, this is just fake news.  What cop said what?  In some situations it is possible to get HIV from spit sorry to tell you, it may be remote but it is possible.  Police are often dealing with injured and bleeding people so you cannot speak for every instance.  The police chief is black and many members are gay, countless others are not white or males. Your arguments are archaic and not even true.
Cary Gardner is a jerk just like the man in the White House  He has absolutely no morals or moral fiber whatsoever.
These protests where not about hate. They were about outrage with a man who brags about sexually abusing women - "grabbing their pussies" without any permission being president. It's disgusting to most of us. Not about hate, about truth of who this animal called president is.
Yeah, but no bonus points just for being a sexual predator... plenty of those all around unfortunately. I'm trying to think of an analogous hypocritical situation as the anti-gay politician boinking men on the side, but I'm having trouble... maybe a Green candidate who secretly eats slices of bologna off her lover's backside?
I believe that the man was mentally incapacitated when he wrote his 1986 letter to the catholic bishops on the pastoral care [sic] of homosexual persons.
It's OK a black man call you a white trash,  but if you say they are black, you get arrested for being a racist.  They pretend to brush it aside when ISIS killed innocent people and they are OK to let Muslim women wear Burqa on our streets but you wear a Great America hat, you are fired. They don't respect democratic vote and pretend to embrace in democracy.  Fck all these liberals idiots, they will turn your kids into Muslims one day.
Any argument that prefixes Antonin Scalia with "the great" rather than "that idiotic moron" is pretty much on a downhill slope to "getting everything wrong".  Hell, he wasn't even smart for his own overt bias. The man undermined the conservative movement more efficiently than any liberal jurist ever had... and he did it by accident.  I speak off course of his dissent in a 2008 gay rights case. The plaintiffs had argued that the surviving spouse of a legal same-sex marriage in one state has the right to continue claiming from his husband's state pension fund after moving to a state where that marriage was not legal or recognized. They won the case but Scalia wrote a writhing dissent arguing that it would lead to gay marriage being legalized across the nation - and outlining the exact set of cases that could allow this outcome to happen.  Inadvertently writing the textbook that led to Obergefell. Gay folks did EXACTLY what he advised them to do.
I propose that the real source of the conservative's hate for Sanger (and by extension Planned Parenthood) is that she threatened male supremacy which is just as corrosive as (and closely associated with) white supremacy.
That man has big balls!  Trudeau, not so much.
Can we say that these white men are lazier than most because profs don't do much except repeat the same thing to every class they "teach" year in and year out?  Could we say that people like Herron want her race to get more of the "do nothing prof jobs" because they are also lazy?    Who knows what her objective was to post that on a blog.  All I Or most can see is that she is a racist screaming for more blacks in lazy prof positions.
You must not have any idea what the ADA is. You really should read up on it. And try to be more respectful to our men and women in uniform you ungrateful leech.
Charles have you shot your limit on racist pigs yet?   Instead of celebrating the death of a black man, we now celebrate the death of "whiteys".  After all, we have to get our revenge, do we not?   Have you disowned Nelson Mandela yet because he would not let black South Africans get revenge on "whitey"?
For all of you who haven't been on the Alaskan Highway coming out of Canada and went to Delta, there is already a HUGE HIGHWAY SIGN that honors these men who built the highway. so much for knowledge and picking to piece what he says. David Eastman is the only one in Juneau besides the rest of the minority who works against anything anyone says that is correct honest and truth. Those who can't handle honest are on her complaining. DO YOUR RESEARCH before you run your mouths. Guess none of you are aware of  this procedure preformed on young women. Why wouldn't someone want to stop the practce here in Alaska. Anyone who disagrees with mutitation of women and abortion is wrong. Disfiguring women and killing children is not cool and I stand with Representative Eastman on these things as a women. You men know nothing. And this reporter must be paid by the thieves in the Governors office and the so called lawmakers, and senate. They are all corrupt
He certainly has the look of a SLICK WILLY.     His look is typical of a high percentage of young males  the last 3+ decades that want to  look like a woman,  act feminine, wear makeup, earrings,   etc.  I do NOT understand why these young women are attracted to these types of Wanna be Males?   What ever happened to males being males?     Our daughter was NEVER interested in these types of wanna be males, Thank Goodness.  Males that acted feminine, wore makeup, wore earrings etc.,  would get a response of from her of, EEEEEEWWWWWWWWW.  Had this guy shown up, I would have talked to his parents and him as well.  The message is, STAY AWAY.    Our daughter  preferred smart, down to earth males that behaved and showed male masculinity.  She is engaged to be married to a Oregon State Police Trooper.    Mr. Giughiano definitely has a SKUNK in his WoodPile.....................
Remember when you said "when your run is over just admit when its at its end." That goes for you too..your 45, rap is a young man's game and you haven't had a decent album since recovery and that was like 10 years ago..As a former fan it sucks to see you go downhill...but for real nobody wants to watch a middle aged rapper, just looks stupid..your biggest fans like me grew up..you should too
oh for crying out loud. all the money spent on sex ed and this is what we get? born with a penis=male, vagina=female. in your dna. and don't run the 'mixed genitalia at birth nonsense'. does not apply.
Re: "How long will China’s patience for Trump last?"  My "patience" for him ran out the moment he said the words, "They're rapists. They're murderers."  And he's done nothing since to regain/earn any such "patience".  The man is an unstable megalomaniac with no clue, no qualifications and not much else going for him.
Trump is a pig of a man. Don't try to equate the traits of Donald Trump with the citizens of Alberta.
Rabid atheist? Keep on believing in that magic man in the sky, moron.
Got to love the hypocrisy of progressives!  Imagine the opening of 'Superman', for men only!  The media would go apoplectic.
Anyone who ascribes to the will of Islam and carries out the evil deeds of ISIS is the very definition of *"terrorist.*"  This maniacs ignorant family has no clue what radicalization tactics Muslims use. This animal was killed by good guys with guns, and the sooner they're gone, the better.
8 years ago the country was ready to consider and elect a black man as President...we just collectively made a bad choice and elected the wrong Black man....The country is again ready for change and consideration of electing a woman as president....like the black man 8 years ago the media is squarely behind the woman now....even though serious wrong doing attends the candidates....They seem willing to do anything to help cover up those crimes...Obama has certainly been the greatest disrespecter of the law in our history until Hillary came along...and took this disrespect to a new low with Obama's help..!!!  for all American voters, and especially Alaskan voters the Obama/Clinton crime families must be sent packing in November 2016...Trump is the only choice for all freedom loving Americans....especially Alaskans...
You are a typical racist, blame someone else for your problems. I would fully support the natives of Alaska being cut off from all state and federal money, you want to do as you want. Fine stay in the village, no more subsidies from us evil white men, no more air service no more welfare, no more health care, then when you have slaughtered every animal you can get, you will all starve to death because you really don't know anything about how subsistence works. No more AC stores for you, better learn to live off the land.no more packaged foods will be shipped out to the bush.
instead of publishing photos of the man arrested. sigh. stupid paper sometimes.
The real travesty is why he was ever allowed to be on this program or that it lasted this long.  His massive pay and support of his insane, traitorous utterances just encouraged his persona immorality.  Of course, his bosses were doing the same in the culture created by the old foreign Nazi owner, Rupert Murdoch, one of the billionaire bosses successfully brainwashing the populace into accepting fundamentalist christian patriarchy along with plantation economics and male dictatorship.
It is difficult to believe how many neoliberal journalists on CBC and Globe and Mail are so fully behind the rampant misandry and outrage against all males. Why any males still working in these media any longer is a mystery. Men are so unwelcome and so easily branded as misogynists?  Feminists are becoming toxic, except the mature ones like Margaret Wente. Women are in psychological warfare with men now, and men are the modern doormats (remember that expression from bygone feminist days?). Men are becoming adjuncts to current society, unnecessary in the workforce, and unnecessary at home. More's the pity for our sons. Balkissoon's article is quite silly and insulting.
Those who commit sexual assault (against children or women - or even men) may not receive as much disapproval or punishment in some other nations.  But they are pretty close to pond scum no matter where they commit it.
The men I know want the job done, done correctly, done on time, done on budget. There is zero room for how someone dresses. Granted your not showing up in tattered rags, smelling like you haven't bathed in weeks. Men I think could honestly care less when it comes to business. Personal is a different story. This minister is unsuccessful in all the points of my first sentence as are the rest of politicians. I want someone who can run a country properly and have no use for there clothing. If she and the rest of liberals could balance a budget, pay down some debt and not spend uncontrollably,  they could dress in whatever they want. Politics and business isn't a damn fashion show. It's serious business with fellow taxpayers money at stake.
Yep and honestly don't understand why a highly respected man like General Mattis would want to be associated in any way with the scoundrel president.
The problem with your argument, like those of this professor, is that they assume that all whites hold their positions only because of privilege, and that none of them actually earned or deserved anything that they have. Her comments like "by keeping your job and your other unearned privileges..." and "...you are the problem. Your very presence", are inherently racist and sexist, promoting the idea that white men are inherently undeserving simply by dint of their race and gender, and can never possibly deserve their positions, no matter their individual merit. It's clear from her rants that she favors only people exactly like her (she specifies giving up their positions in favor of minority women, not just minorities or women, because if you're a white woman or a black man, you still need to go to the back of the bus to give her your seat). As a non-white in academia, I simply don't see this as true. It's blatantly bigoted. If she's not getting ahead, she likely hasn't earned it.
crimes???? man you lunatics are pathetic,, judging history via todays standards,, nonsense bud nonsense.. Honour Cornwallis and cover idiots like you up
"Then logically you should be afraid of Christians as well."  Well, except it takes seconds to find recent news reports (past 5 months) of Muslim executioners killing gay folks en masse.  Please show us similar numbers for Christians killing them en masse recently!  Orlando gay nighclub shooting: 49 killed, shooter pledged ISIS allegiance  Chechen Authorities Arresting and Killing Gay Men  Russian newspaper says it has evidence that at least three gay men have been killed in ‘prophylactic sweep’ in Chechnya  The Islamic State Executes Nine Men and a Boy for Being Gay  Egypt has taken a leading role at the United Nations in opposing gay rights. It was one of 13 countries to vote last week against a U.N. resolution condemning the death penalty for having gay sex.  Islamic State group judge read out the sentence against the two men convicted of homosexuality: They would be thrown to their deaths from the roof of the nearby Wael Hotel.  12 Muslim Countries That Kill You for Being Gay
How do you know the guy is black?
Rick Perry is living proof a C/D student in college can have a successful career in politics.  The man's a top-shelf, Grade A moron.
There aren't enough white, racist men in the country for the GOP to win a presidential election.
I'm hoping he meant that men wouldn't mind getting grabbed in the crotch. But even that is naive. If the female equivalent of Trump strode into a lacrosse team locker room, as the teen boys playfully snapped towels at each other, and randomly grabbed a crotch, the dream of easy sexual activity would seem more nightmarish.
What a piece of trash this man is. Maybe he's at fault for not having stopped his son, and maybe he should be sitting in prison for the rest of his life. He needs to learn to take responsibility for his own actions and failures and not blame others. Maybe he should blame the cops for not stopping crime. The list of those he could blame per his theory is virtually infinite.
You and so many others hated Obama so much that if you had taken off your blinders you would have seen.  One man, not even the Wizard Trump can be accredited to the current market.  I suppose you are making a killing in the stock market.  Look beyond your hate of Obama and look beyond your foolishness to follow Trump, but then again, may a fool and his money be parted.
Its this type of trash being published by main stream media that creates divisiveness.   "Femininity is too emotional, Women don't have to be"    When did man hating become acceptable?  Is that how women achieve equality?
Hello Calgary guy and all the people voting in agreement with you:  Nice touch there, saying the young American man was "too stupid to grasp" what he needed to grasp.  Hey, do me a favour? If your daughter or young sister or young niece gets gang raped and strangled nearly to death one day engaged in a risky setting where she ought to have known better than to have been engaged in the first place, do be sure to post here on the board and tell us that your young relative was "too stupid".  Really nice touch.
So Rich Wheeler, a contributor to FOX and Malia Zimmerman a reporter of FOX, got FOXED by FOX? FOX is like trumpf, full of old white men sexually harassing reporters then lying and firing them. FOX is FAKE.
"Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and the internet. To hell with them. They don't want anything done for the public good. Our incapacity is their livelihood."  Why does a guy have to wait until he's terminally ill to have that epiphany?  And will any of the rest of them listen?
They are too busy having sex and giving beat downs on teens and black men.
This statement wouldn't be out of place here:   "Feminists have always enraged me. They want to keep the advantages of women (e.g. cheaper insurance, extended maternity leave preceded by a preventative leave, etc.) while seizing for themselves those of men.  Thus it is an obvious truth that if the Olympic Games removed the Men-Women distinction, there would be Women only in the graceful events. So the feminists are not fighting to remove that barrier. They are so opportunistic they don't neglect to profit from the knowledge accumulated by men through the ages. They always try to misrepresent them every time they can."  ~ [translated]
Oh my boys and girls she has scolded us. It is called free speech you bitch, if that is the way they feel then too bad. You are as equally offensive to 95% of us as they were to you. Get over it, better yet get off this planet we are done with you.
Ask the Korean neighborhood in LA during the 1992 riots... or ask the black men in Ferguson MO protecting their white bosses convenience store during their riots if they would have preferred double barrel shotguns against angry mobs... you shouldn’t be so quick to curb anyone’s liberties. Tomorrow it may be your turn.
It's always risky to tie in with "it's happenin', baby."  Not that advertising did a lot of that "back in the day."  No, at the time (anytime after, say, 1920) Mad Ave., was showing women REALLY knew much more than men in domestic areas, like cooking, cleaning, washing laundry and toilets.  Come to think of it, still are!  Who's protesting THAT?  "Pussy hat" feminists don't think this is somewhat "insidious"?   Hmm, men aren't protesting these demeaning, insulting ads that portray them home-front ignoramuses, either.  Good call.  Why protest THAT kind of gender stereotyping?  Women wanna own housekeeping?  A-OK, I saw (to thunderous masculine applause.)    Simplicity is often best.  Saw a great ad last night for a certain arthritis pill.  Senior, guy ravaged by time (just like the market!)  sez two things:  "Remember the name"  (Repeats name, breaks it down into its parts, over big name logo visuals.  "This is the box."  Big close-up of blue box with name.  That was it. Beauty.
The GOP is getting all it deserves for not accepting the best president America has ever had - Barack Obama. Everyone of them is saying the American presidency is for white men only. Preferably bigoted white men.
A white guy running food cart that sells "latin" chicken? What are latinos not good enough for WWeek to make latin chicken?
H.L. Mencken saw this coming in 1920:  "All the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre — the man who can most adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum.  The Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron."
Thought your hateful racist mentally would slap back, about my family's military service!!  Military brat, not even close!!  My father was a 17 year old medic in the South Pacific during WWII, transferring over to the Air Force for the next 16 years, sport!!  You are a little man with with your hateful, despicable view of the world, regardless of your military background!!  And your pitiful challenge with wanting to kick my a_s, typical of your thug attitude.  You've  called me several rotten a_s names I don't deserve, but a little man's behavior and attitude makes you violent!?   Can dish it out you pathetic, so-called man of many experiences, but man when someone best's you with knowledge & experience then you show just how ignorant and arrogant you are, then it's time to bloody the water.  You've learned well from "some" of those in the hood, killer!!  There now, does that show respect??  Which from those "like" you is never, ever earned but demanded & taken!!
How is it an "attack on women"?  Do MEN not have faces?  Do MEN not ALSO get "face-lifts" as well?  Call it "Plastic-surgery Shaming" or whatever but PLEASE stop with these ridiculously transparent attempts to pit women against Trump.  It's hypocritical but even worse... It's just pathetic.
the Liberals mock Conservatives as old  white men  I give you  Stephane Dion John McCallum  hypocrisy and irony
I know it is quite sickening.    We really need to stop asking for same treatment & ordination, and start demanding it instead.    I am so tired of seeing these dialogues back & forth stating the likes of "Maybe if we women beg & crawl before the hierarchy of the church, they will allow us to join a ministry that gains us no more authority than the laity - maybe they will honor us with the permanent deaconate"!  Yeah!!  It never even occurs to some of these folks that they are actually insulting the humanity of women, in suggesting that this ministry, because it is in no way equal to priesthood or above, is somehow an acceptable goal for women to seek.    We need justice - not another sexist cage for a ministry.  We need to get active.  I have met quite a few men and women who are so angry at this Trump win, and relating it, in part, to our church's influence on our country's politics, they seem to finally want to fight now. Email me: restornow @ mail.com (one word) if your interested.
This man runs unopposed in my district.  He wins.  He is so far left he is unable to turn his neck toward the center.  He is a nasty man, and loved by the ultra liberals in my district.  He represents all of us whose brains are immersed in excrement.  Not his fault, ours.
Please, for the love of god, take away, or shut down Trumps tweet account.  This man is a disaster in the making.
cops are dumbasses anyways and any male from utah is a dumbass just by living in utah....and sure the law....a selection of selfish made up bullshit so bully cops can harrass people..fk the pig..jesus threw the pigs off the cliff..you shtheads should read your good book..god hates your asses too...thats why the awfucl karma in the usa....type a asshole pigs....get a fking job and stick it up your ass
The issues with a maturing free market are the age-old prophetic warnings of Marx and Lenin, and the unsolvable concerns of social theorists like Adam Smith et. al.  That laissez-faire will disenfranchise natives and proliferate survival of the fittest.  Some theorists of old were convinced that these inevitablities  will result in anarchy.   Lenin's Bolshevik revolution inspired a communist party to encourage this inevitability whereby communist led world anarchy would topple capitalism and usher in socialism.  Theoretically then, capitalism sows the seeds of its own destruction.  Other social theorists like us think otherwise and say let's be real, man.  Just rezone to keep up with the times.   Damn the torpedoes.  Full steam ahead!
The sexual assault was hot sause down the butt. they didn't rape the guy. And Clark hit him with a medal rod basically and tide him up. Everything else were the other 2 men. And they were all under the influence of some bad drug because Clark would have more sense and wouldn't have the guts to go that far if it wasn't for the drugs. Children are getting hold of these drugs from other kids and these other kids are getting it from their parents. And so the good kids get so rapped up in it that the parents kick them out on the streets at young ages like 16 to 17 years of age and don't know how to take care of themselves and do drugs. So all the people that are insulting these young men would have probably done the same thing if u guys were on the same drugs.
Thankfully, for the average man on the street, Trump was elected instead of another corrupt, socialist elite.   "There is nothing greedier, or more selfish than a Democrat using the government to take his neighbor's property to enhance his own standard of living, or political power." -Harlin Smith
Nope. White men are pretty scary. Especially Christian ones. They reeeeally hate women as well as POC.
It sounds like this woman may be a white lady. These were black men killed and a black woman that he had to pretend he gave a fuck about so I would like to know the race of this woman. He still gets no brownie points with me....
By good man, I was using a rather low bar,  for instance "doesn't shag interns in his office".   Thank you Bill Clinton. By good man, I was using a rather low bar, for  instance, doesn't do phone sex with a woman while his child is climbing in his bed (Thank you Anthony Weiner).
A man who posts pornography on social media, responsible for investigating child abuse and rape? Has SAPS  sunk so low that it delegates the care of lambs to jackals, then ties up and muzzles the sheepdogs?
This is absolutely delusional. Sounds like you think you are a victim, eh? Poor white males and their suffering at the hands of those aggressive women!
Kitzmiller is a phony and a loser.  Stop calling him "man" in your articles....he's far, FAR from it.
Axa Parvaz , and the 4 women of the Shafia family were all killed by their traditionalist Muslim families because they didn't want to wear hijabs and burqas as commanded by the males who dominated them.  This is less about fashion, but how to make  a slavery look nice.
The democratic party removed the filibuster to steamroll its agenda.  Suck it up boys and girls.
The idiot is in panic mode. The noose is tightening and he is acting like a man on his way to the gallows. The fact is that no innocent person especially a POTUS would go through so much evasive actions while being under the scrutiny of the entire country. Only a guilty person would be acting like how the Chump is right now. He has been a crook and scoundrel his whole life and its only a matter of time before KABOOM!
The U.S. Catholic bishops have, and deserve, little influence in the public square. It’s hard to get too concerned by the recklessness of +Naumann and other members of the Republican Bishops Conference. On the other hand, in Donald Trump we have a candidate who is a notorious racist, fascist and adulterer; an accused rapist, child molester and serial sex offender; a demonstrably unstable personality who should never have access to any of the levers of government, let alone to the nuclear codes; a demagogue who lacks even a minimal understanding of the issues of the day, who is contemptuous of American values and of democratic institutions and processes; a bigot who attacks racial, ethnic and religious minorities, ridicules women, and mocks the handicapped. By endorsing this despicable man, Naumann does more than embarrass himself; he disgraces the church and trivializes and diminishes the pro-life and pro-family causes he purports to support. Let's pray that his priests will oppose him
This teacher is quite simply a racist, as are the union officials who support her acts.  A student has no right to express an opinion on the matter because he's male and white?  That tells us all we need to know about this teacher.
Imagine a headline "Femininity is toxic" (re/gold diggers).     There would be calls for the author to be fired immediately.   Why this won't happen?  Because misandry (read/"masculinity is toxic") has been so ingrained into our unconscious that we now accept it as normal.    This is the paradox of toxic modern feminism: Men even when they behave badly don't hate women, in fact they love women too much so they use and exploit them...feminists on the other hand truly hate men  -- as exemplified here.
Hard to miss the rhetorical delirium enjoyed by so many writers@theGlobe (abetted by a cadre of “progressive” academics at masculinity-is-toxic.edu) in fanning the flames of male dread. The n-word is used mainly as metonymy in Fuck Finn (= black slave) but the book has become “toxic” in the minds of some because of its one famous use as metaphor (= inferior human). The same in reverse is the case with the insidious ways the m-word is deployed by angry feminists: powerful men are “garbage”; all men are powerful, by definition. Ergo…  It's imperative to take down "predators," not so to suggest, even semi-equivocally, that “rejecting masculinity” is key to being "fully human." You rarely read anything in the Globe that takes women to task for their part in the "semiotics" at play in the ways men negotiate "the spaces between archaic ideals and modern reality." It's true that the Globe employs Maggie Wente, who pleads for balance, but she's the lost-leader equivalent of NYT David Brooks.
oh save it loser, no one is forced to fly on an airplane but we all have to use electricity, man you lib trolls will make any excuse to justify the most incompetent file mess the ontario liberals have done to ontario!
HA HA this is so true.  I remember when the teleprompter broke on Obomber, he was " if if if if if if fi da da d if if if if"  Yeah Okay Barry, keep selling the BS, what a putz that man was. worst president in the history of the US, even worse than G W Bush
That makes sense as you are a very rude and insensitive person. What are you babbling about? The other two gold star families are saying that Myeshia is a liar? lol  Are you trying to gaslight Myeshia? That is usually what abusive males do, shame on you. Why would you say that her feelings are not valid? You are a very rude and insensitive person. It is disgusting.
Dead Men Tell no Tales!
This has nothing to do with what's between your legs. Unless you think you'd accidentally shoot yourself in your twig and berries... then I guess you would technically become less of a man... physiologically anyway...
Yeah right. His years of birtherism wasn't racialy motivated! Snort. And his hobnobing with Bannon and David Duke were just friendly chats. And his discriminatory actions start in 1973, when the United States Department of Justice went to court with a discrimination complaint against the Trump family business, which rented apartments across Brooklyn and Queens. Next in the Trump record on race came a 1991 book by John O’Donnell, who had been president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. O’Donnell quoted Trump saying,“ Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys wearing yarmulkes… Those are the only kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else…Besides that, I tell you something else. I think that’s guy’s lazy. And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. In other words, Tyrone, you are wrong. Trump is a proud bigot.
I feel bad that this bill was not passed. But tell me what color dress she wore is relevant? This pisses me off! Do they describe the asinine suits men wear like uniforms? Do they bemoan the tie? What a bunch of crap. Bite me, Erica Martinson!
A bunch of  spoiled men in shorts, throwing and tossing balls, with multi million dollar contracts and a President who should not be bothered with this nonsense.
Oh yeah, Medicare, the government health insurance that is slated for insolvency by 2028; long before I get to use a single penny of it. And, I have to pay for your stupid Medicare against my will. Guess what happens if I don't pay my medicare insurance (that I don't want)? I go to jail. Yes. If I don't pay this ridiculous medicare tax, men with guns take me to jail. So no. It's not a lie. If you don't understand that at the bottom of every idiotic government mandate is the barrel of a gun, you are ignorant and/or delusion.
and yet another stupid white man (as put by Bill Maher).  Why does the media have to point out (at least in the headline)  that the driver is Japanese?  Who the H cares?  Isn't he just a elite pro racing driver who happened to win the Indy 500?
NO! HE WANTS OUT OF JAIL!!! DENY THAT POS ANYTHING HE WANTS!!! MAKE HIM WAKE UP EVERY DAY UNTIL HE IS 90 AND DIES IN JAIL!!! SOLITARY CONFINEMENT!!! BREAD AND WATER ONLY!!!!  A BIBLE THAT TELLS HIM JESUS WAS A BLACK OR DARK SKINNED MAN!!!
The Church's treatment of gay people?  The Church was the biggest employer of gay people in history.   Countless thousands of gay men were allowed to be monks and priests, in the faith that celibacy could be maintained.  Then came the sex abuse revelations, with 4 out of 5 cases being that of gay priests raping boys.     Seems to me you side is the one that owes our side an apology.
This article is a perfect example of female...  1) Solipsim 2) Entitlement 3) Lack of agency 4) Hypergamy 5) AWALT  Only the craziest of men would marry Western women nowadays.
A silly and superficial man.  Wonder what Trump said to sway him.
You are obviously looking at him through rose coloured glasses. Listen to the "ah's" in every sentence. I  definitive sign of insecurity and confusion. He is a boy wearing a man's shoes, sliding around until he falls. As for Trump he is a fool drowning in a sea of vanity and hair dye.
So all men are "Proud Boys" now? Wow, I didn't get the memo over the penisnet.
Oh, boo hoo.  Poor put upon white male.
You feminists should have your male and female children taken away from you.
You are correct.  BLOTUS is not stupid.  But, he is a very, very bad man, and he is guilty of something.
Learn to vet your sources clown. lol. There is no evidence. Period. Jesus was never mentioned in any Roman sources and there is no archeological evidence that Jesus ever existed. Even Christian sources are problematic – the Gospels come long after Jesus' death, written by people who never saw the man. Get back to reality man. Quoting some moron's blog is NOT proof. Google the word evidence man. sheesh.
South Africa: Zuma rapes Kwezi...ANC -  response? USA: Trumps grabbing of the p****y.... Republican - response? UK: Fallon touches journalists knee.... Tory response?  Truth is, females do make things ambiguous, it is part of the mystery and males do misinterpret messages with testosterone in full swing and emancipated females are going full kink in the Grey areas of weak society.  The weaving blurred lines (intended) of acceptability are going to get more confusing for both males and females, set by "leaders" of society, pornography and the church leaders, not only Catholics where Parental leadership is being stripped by political correctness.   Feminism  is good, but when.
One big difference: Obama was an exemplary human being, and the white racist fringe and GOP old white establishment wanted him dead. He did nothing to deserve it, but was kind and inspirational and all inclusive. He tried to get everyone healthcare. A good man. Trump is a bigot, sexist, angry, childish, vindictive, unknowledgeable about the past, divisive, tweeting, insulting hack. He is not one for our children to look up to. he is trying to take away healthcare. A BAD MAN.
Instead of trying to unite the country our prime minister is trying to divide the country by having different taxes for men and women in hope of gaining a political advantage.  No prime minister in Canada's history has stooped so low.  Justin Trudeau has no shame.
As bad as this story is, and it is bad, I find something very interesting.  ADN has buried it, and I truly wonder why that is?  Actually, to be truthful, I know EXACTLY why that is.  The fact that the officer that shot the young man, and the young man himself belonged to the same demographic, and not only that, they knew each other.  So, ADN, obviously black lives do not matter UNLESS said lives are taken by a white individual, especially a Law Enforcement Officer of said race.  Why is this not upon your own front page within HUGE letters, as, as slaves of the Washington Post you seem, nay, actually do so often?  This young man was shot and killed by a police officer, and has sparked many a riot and destruction within the community.  Why is the story buried, ADN?  Have you no dignity?  Have you no independence?  Have you no respect?  Apparently not, because you, ADN, and so many of your own compatriots within the Liberal\Marxist ideology care only about one thing.  Votes.  Bastards.
@ALbertD3 >>So, in saying that, am I an online troll? You didn't define it very clearly, just as M103 fails to clearly define Islamophobia. This is a dangerous game. . Spot on. We have articles conveying 'Muslim victimhood' and 'Canadian -phobias' - most of the time authored by a Muslim woman in a head-scarf. Hold the outrage, before marking the post, and ask yourselves why is that a pattern? . Where are the Muslim male authors? Or non-covered Muslim female authors? Or opinions different than those having been relentlessly published in G&M?
I'm just a man.  I'm not a straight man or a heterosexual man, I'm just a man.  Elegabalus who posts here always let's us know that he is a "gay" man, i.e., he is sexually attracted to men and embraces that attraction as his identity.  Victor Victoria has a rainbow flag as her image, and that's not because she's a Noah's ark fan.  There's a gay dude who posts on Breitbart (until he was fired for supporting pedophilia, but I digress) named Milo who has the same position that I do on gay "marriage," yet he's all about being a "dangerous faggot" (his words, not mine).  It's not mere self-awareness, it's narcissistic pride.
This is what happens when a woman wants to be a man you get a foul mouthed she man want to be.
The FN Chiefs already know the answers they are looking for but refuse to accept that Indigenous men are the culprits:  Exactly, they will not accept anything other than it is all the white man's fault.
man.  this guy is dangerously horny.
.  Being a "toronto guy" - how many of the daily(now) shootings and stabbings in Toronto are perpetrated by white men?   Or you just see 'white'?
Yeah, all that bullying done as a direct result of the bullies studying and acting out about Catholic teaching on homosexuality.  \sarc  Few if any adolescents are committing suicide because the Church teaches that homosexual acts are sinful.  Most of the men I know who are homosexual are Jewish.  If there's a common reason for boys with same-sex attraction killing themselves, it's from the realization that they are out of sync with what is an inherent understanding, along with biological and anatomical fact, that boys are supposed to be sexually attracted to girls and vice versa; and witnessing such attraction all around them.
Time will tell who’s being “idiotic.”  Many like you said Trump was a joke and couldn’t win. Now they feel like idiots and are pissed.  We’ll see if all this brouhaha turns out to be just fake news or legit news. You voted for Reagan? Only three people in Hawaii voted for Reagan and to think you are one of them.  What are the odds?  You seem more like a Carter man. In any event, you voted so you’re not contributing to the lowest voter turnout in the country.  Kudos to you.  Now if you could only wise up…
What is with you hawaiikone? Can't figure you out. You just admitted that you are ok with a stupid president. You must really have some serious psychological issues because nobody wants a stupid leader except you. OMG incredible and you are telling everyone to relax? If you are a male I don't blame your wife for leaving you. If you are a female likewise. Geez!
Politicians today are liars, cheats and useless tools. We need to step back to a time when the elite shut up and the men are allowed to straighten the scum out. But liberals don't want that, as they'd have nothing for distraction anymore. 2019 trudeau has to go.
Your a fucking racist I’m sure. Judge a book by its cover. That dude is actually a really good dad and did everything for his kids. He held down a job always. Unlike a lot of people I know. Don’t be so judgemental when all you see is a black male with tattoos. Racism is real and people like you and comments like these that make America so ungreat you fuck head!!
Yeah, let's whine about someone's socks in the NFL while having no problem and arguing for the right for one of its franchises to keep a Native America as their logo and to be called the Redskins (hypocrite much?).  So what if he wants to wear a Fidel Castro shirt, when you actually use your brain you can see there is no difference between that or wearing a George Washington or other founding father t- shirt as they oppressed blacks and others (the Constitution originally had blacks at 3/5ths a man), which I am sure you would have no problem with.   He is upset at police officers abuse of citizens, specifically blacks.  Google police excessive force and stop closing your eyes to the issue.  He has every right to protest on this issue.   He had a platform and chose to use it during the anthem, not the game.   The reason why he is having a problem finding a new job is that because of whiney white people like you like to ride the wave of fake patriotism.   Get off your imaginary high-hor
It is a crazy world where it is supposed to be huge offense and  "sexual misconduct" to "leer" at and call a female "hot chocolate". Bloodless wimps do not understand a real man's  hormones. But painted women looking like harlots are OK to dangle their half naked bodies with surgically enhanced breasts like a bait in front of men?
I want every self righteous person,  especially men, on this planet to take a lie detector test and prove they never talked like this before. We all have done it and do it.  Man and woman have and always will talk sex.  You notice  Clinton talks sex it's hip and giddy , but when Donald Trump talks sex, it's  dirty and vile.  We are a nation of hypocrites.
Add to the story the fact that it was deemed newsworthy that the Saudi King, ACTUALLY  SHOOK MELANIA TRUMP'S HAND, while she visited his country, and it is not hard to see why the Mainstream Muslim World is just not compatible with Modern Western Society. NOT EVEN CLOSE. Women there, are treated like garbage.  It is not hard to see how that degree of male domination can sow the seed of hatred and radicalization towards anything or anybody who is different.
That's a real DBAG to shoot a man in front of children.
This is ridiculous! I feel sorry for the men who feel they have to rise to these heights and spend that kind of money to propose.  I feel sorry for (and a little angry at) the women who are expecting these kinds of proposals as a sign of love. Good for the business people who can earn a living fulfilling the fantasies though! Maybe I'm just a curmudgeon.
She's someone who is voluntarily leaving office with no axe to grind. I read Pruitt's website and watched his videos. If he ever had a clear thought in his head, it would have died of loneliness. The man is an airhead.
Is it really surprising that white men of that era were racist? Probably hard to find one that wasn't :(
Police in Winnipeg killed an aboriginal man who had a screwdriver and in Vancouver police killed a white man with a stapler.   Police have a bias against people holding weapons not their skin color.
"My guy" you moron? I'm not a member of the group that came out with the Executive Order that said that mental illness was not necessarily disqualifying for firearms ownership. Who the heck was that.
"Transgenders no longer look anything like the sex found on their birth certificates.." ha ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂. You mean like the man in a dress in the picture accompanying this article?? Clearly! Clearly that is a man. Yes he's an emotionally damaged and confused man, but he is CLEARLY a biological male. Cutting your genitals off and putting on a dress does not make you a woman. It makes you a surgically altered male in a dress. I'm sorry I'm not going to be forced by liberals to pretend that biological sex doesn't matter in physiology and human behavior.
I also want to leave another comment in hopes that at least one person that is responsible for burning our flag reads this. First, you have no idea the tears, sweat, and blood that our four fathers put into defending this soil that your unappreciative self dwells upon. The freedom you have is because of that flag! You wanna scream gay rights or black rights and disrespect the president on his big day? That's spitting in the faces of all of the men that has fought for this country and made your lavish way of life possible. Do you know that in many other countries in this world would kill you for being gay and that you wouldn't have a right to speak out against the government. You would be beheaded, stoned, or imprisoned for life for burning a flag. That's just something for you to think about the next time you decide to riot and burn flags. Go spend a couple weeks somewhere else in this world, you'll come back kissing the dirt of the USA! It's to bad you understand that.
"... and both major candidates behaved like civil adults."   What? Where have you been Phyllis Zagano?   Did you not hear Donald trump say the system was rigged and that he might NOT accept the outcome of the election IF he did not win? Did you not hear him incite angry mobs at his rallies  to "lock up" his opponent? Did you not hear him call his opponent "a nasty woman" during a presidential debate? Did you not hear him brag on video that he enjoys sexually predator behavior toward woman, married woman...while he was a married man? Did you hear where he likes to grab them --and all because he could because he was a big shot??  Donald trump has lowered our civil discourse into the gutter- into his swamp --and now that he succeeded in dubbing angry white uneducated men with his racist, sexist and xenophobic fears, we are supposed to sit back and behave nicely -- because you wouldn't want to be inconvenienced by a traffic jam?
Who is claiming white men are Earth's alpha males? Evil and hatred just like love and compassion are qualities ANYONE can possess. Your comment seems a little irrelevant and off topic.
"An ugly life for an ugly man."  Yes, I agree, and it would be absolutely grotesque to have him in the White House.
Regarding the practice of child sacrifice in Africa -- doesn't Christianity promote this false idea that there is a god or spirit that must be appeased with a human sacrifice? According to the Book of Hebrews 7:27, 9:26, etc., Jesus is the one and only sacrifice,  a man who offers himself as a human sacrifice to Yahweh.   But the Jews have it right, and also the Muslims, as they know Yahweh did not accept Abraham's human sacrifice of Issac, and God abhors human sacrifice, and God would never accept a human sacrifice, not even the sacrifice of a Jesus. God has no need for a human sacrifice.  A human sacrifice is an abomination. I suspect that Muslims and Jews are immune to Christianity because they know this fact about human sacrifice -- God abhors it.  Islam may be the solution to this problem of child sacrifice. Either that or adequate law enforcement
This will just force Canada to set up alternative trading arrangements. Angry white men often make terrible decisions.
Similarly, that does not offer any clue as to how you can blame Donald Trump, a supporter of gays, as responsible for a man slaughtering gays. Literally makes no sense.
Sounds like he is high and flying at this moment. Looks like he would answer a call by the comments he is posting on Facebook.  This guy really needs the suicide hotline number. To many young men and women are trapped in this deadly cycle of heroine addiction. How you like obamas doctors now.
As expected, the cowardly warmonger and wannabe strong man spouts more verbal excrement. McCain hit the malignant narcissist and mentally deranged sociopath where it hurts him the most. His precious ego.
then women should be prepared to returning to outhouse when white men stop being plumbers.
agree.  This man has played the judicial system for the fools they are.  He has revealed how weak and incompetent Big Island officials are.  He has no intention of revealing anything.  He has lied for decades.
Trump endlessly elevates misogyny in tireless pursuit of fascism's preference for psychopathic male control of everything within reach of their sinister pussy-grasping exploitation.
Romeo is a cowardly military ass kissing liberal elitist piece of do nothing and whine about it girly guy.
It makes zero sense that you commit treason of our lands for a foreign government. It makes zero sense to pillage BC of various rainforest with trees over 1,000 years old because a stupid man wants to sell CDO's and BBB's on the stock market.  and believe me, I will rip your balls off for lying.
Hypothetical question:  A great many commenters here have convinced themselves that whether one has a penis or a vagina is an insignificant detail relating to one's gender identity.  Ok, fair enough. So consider a business with two multi-user restrooms. It removes the signs that say "men" and "women" with signs that read "penises" and "vaginas," with no gender judgement implied.  What would be the objection to that? And on what grounds?
These were screaming, raging, angry white men with torches, they surrounded a black Church and were going thru town rampaging against PoC. If brave, good people DIDN'T stand up to the terror these white supremacists were inciting, WHAT MORE VIOLENCE would the racists have inflicted!  Of course Trump defends his fellow white supremacists, is anyone surprised. He's a racist, bigoted hatemonger, plain & simple. He's a disgrace.
Trump is just an awful and petty little man that is out to erase all things Obama. He doesn't care what it does to Americans.    Surprise, surprise another fake xtian voted into office by other fake xtians.  I wonder if he will quote Two Corinthians while ruining the lives of "the least of these".    These days, far more atheists are better at living Christ-like lives than so many of today's so-called xtians that are white supremacists and/or Dominiinists.
I never knew a straight man who didn't talk about pu$$y or getting it or there love of it this is the biggest non story in the history of political BS I ever heard where as sick slick willy was actually cheating on his wife in the White House at work stuffed cigars up that womans Vajaja that he swore he did not have sex with a known rapist an his enabler really have the moral high ground hear what a joke
Hilarious, lol. I doubt that football players in the NFL will soon forget their rightful place; In the millionaires club. I am absolutely positive that they also earned it. No problem with that at all. All the facts are against Leonard, if the main stream media were forced to present them. But they will not. Pitts will never stop the BS, either. Too much political capital lost if he cannot cry "racism", plus he would be out of a job. Same old same old. I don't even bother to read what he has to say anymore, because it never changes. I know what's in it. The big bad evil white man. Leonard, please name another country that has more millionaires of color. If millionaires of color are so discriminated against, how could they have possibly become millionaires?  Please explain, because you cannot. Next......
That seems like a pretty clear statement to reference. What exactly did Obama say when you were told "that because I am a white man I am a racist SOB"?
Your true agenda is that superiority attitude I see among "Christian" white males  What is that "Traditional value", was it whites live here and blacks live there.  Was it I'm a Christian and your a Muslim, and your religion isn't REALLY a religion.  Was it I'm not gay so I'm better than you, and if your gay your a sinner? Your superior attitude was tried by a country called Germany.  Didn't work.
Bill Cosby is innocent. The women are liars. Men need more rights. Women will say anything to get their way.
When did white men become such babies? Man up.
"Let him who is without sin throw the first stone." "Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye." "Suffer the children to come to Me." The words of the Christ.  Paul wrote to the citizens of Corinth that they were to marry, but Paul didn't tell Corinthians to drive out-of-wedlock mothers and their children from "the temple".  As for Corinthians 7:1 "“It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.” 4) "The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband." 10) "To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. 11) But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife."  Just a sample; but no requirement to shun or drive out a woman and her children born out of wedlock.
OJ made history by being the 1st black man that was involved in the death of a white woman, that bought his way out of a death sentence by hiring a dream team of lawyers. That ability had only been a white privilege before him.
Thank you, Marsha! FINALLY we the American people have a voice that rings with dignity and justice. I have seen the movies and listened to the horrors of splitting open the back of a baby's head (at late term) with special forceps and then vacuum the brains out, then harvest what's left and sell the parts to the highest bidder. Bless You, Marsha! At Last! We have a voice. Twitter has just moved to the top of my "stay away from" list. They are the perverts that, like Obuma, think that men that men should be allowed to go into the same bathroom as my darling 7 year-old granddaughter. Add P and another T to the GBLT whatever for Perverts and Twitter!
See my previous comment.   There is no such thing as hunting within city limits.   The man was not hunting.   Plus, the discharge of a BB gun within city limits is a violation of city ordinance.   So this shooter clearly committed multiple crimes.   It is appalling that he was not cited for illegal hunting out of season, and discharging a BB gun within city limits, on top of animal cruelty.   Those are 3 crimes that he most definitely committed.   Why the police would let the man off with just a warning is difficult to understand.  And you are totally wrong about Oregon's hunting regulations.  Unlimited shooting only applies to ground squirrels, not tree squirrels like this man was shooting.  Tree squirrels have a defined season and limit.  Any way that one looks at this incident, this man is a pervert and a criminal.
"I fly all the time around the world."  No, you do not. You're not an independently wealthy jet setter, and you're not a pilot. You're a retired garbage man.
man you are as usual a complete left wing ignorant sheep
All we can hope is that each one of the thugs involved in this horrendous crime are all locked away forever where they can become Bubba's sex slave.  It is too bad we cannot serve the same actions on them that they did to this young man.
Thousands of years ago, men who wrote the Bible warned of people like you that would eventually claim bad to be good, right to be wrong, and who would denounce Jesus Christ.  Sucks to be you.
There's something that needs to happen before we start talking about removing contraception from the "sin list." The Catholic teaching magisterium must finally acknowledge that sex isn't only about conceiving a child. This is almost acknowledged every time old infertile people marry in the church. I once asked a priest why the church would marry people who are clearly beyond their child-bearing years and do you know what he said, "to allow for a miracle." I kid you not. Seems to me if God can create a miracle and suddenly make an old woman fertile again s/he should be able to make a lesbian pregnant from, I don't know, the Holy Spirit? Or perhaps a gay man will miraculously be able to bear a child in a womb that God could suddenly create in him. But no, that would be foolish so we can't allow gay sex. Getting past that barrier would also remove masturbation from the sin list and also allow every straight couple to enjoy sex without worry. But I'm not holding my breath waiting for that.
80% of Muslims believe a man has the right to beat his wife if she disobeys him.  54% of Muslims believe homosexuals can be punished with death.  90% of all Muslims believe a woman is worth 1/2 the value of a man. 60% of all Muslims believe killing Jews is not a crime. 80% of Muslims want Sharia law in America. . Yea we want that in Canada and Justin is making sure we get it.
Trump is everything the left hates, a wealthy heterosexual white male, whose wealth was partly acquired through inheritance. To them he is the big bellied southern sheriff and they are the brave freedom riders. This is the romantic philosophy they have been taught and cling to and protest is part of this romance. If this writer wanted to protest something, maybe she could start a campaign to find out why there are so few writers of colour (I hope that is the right word) on the Globe staff. Maybe she could mentor a disabled African Canadian woman, help raise her up from nothing and as a culminating act of sanctimonious goodness offer her your job.
Many want to hang the man now and don't need the three judge panel.  Kill the mockingbird so you can have your politics.
White males laugh at these narco fems.   Your narrative shows everyone who the bullies and predators are.   It ain't us man It's you.   It is truly sad how you can watch  muslim women treated like dogs and not mention anything.  Why not focus on the true enemy of women.  You would get our support by speaking clearly and honestly about midieval muslim laws....  c'mon suck it up
Tell that to little boys and girls who were raped and sexually abused in residential schools who have suffered all their lives from toxic stress and lateral violence. Go ahead tell them.
If he did  he should. But if  he didn't he shouldnt.  Just because he said what he said doesn't mean these woman were his victims.   There are numerous accounts refuting these stories, but you won't read them in a paper in the tank for DNC.  And he ain't my man. I.wish he'd step down. But as long as the crook Harry is running Trump will have my vote.  It's sad beyond belief that these are our two choices.  I understand why we got trump. Why the left Choice this crook over bernie or didn't allow any other candidates run is a clear sign of DNC corruption.
Qman... I think the dumbest thing I have read today is the "comparison" (albeit it subtle) between Griese and Trevor. I would love to compare stats over their first 16 starts. Trevor is 2x Griese (now) and will only get better. Get him a RT and protect the man. #gobroncos!
How would vulnerability express itself in the real world? Would the most vulnerable not be the most common victims? If a poor black man is more vulnerable to murder then a rich white man, would we not expect more poor black men to be victims of murder?
Seems they still get used in these mass shootings.  It was the weapon in Orlando, Newton Mass., and Aurora CO.  So, it works in killing humans just fine.  Are you saying those who use the AR to kill in mass shootings you consider a "man"?  LOL  Certainly it doesn't take a gun to make a male a man.  In  fact, the bigger man is the one who isn't afraid to put the gun down, or even more so, never pick it up in the first place.
Despite how sad your comments are, at least they are entertaining.  You know so little about the practice of law that you think doing that requires the same skill set as predicting an election.  Can you understand how pathetic that is?  The case of the "grumps and grumbles" is actually a successful effort to thwart many of the illegal and unconstitutional acts that Trump has attempted.  There's no lurching or stumbling - just successfully defending the Constitution and the rule of law against a spectacularly unfit, terrible president.  You're a Trump sycophant - that's obvious.  But that puts you in a small and shrinking pocket of ignorance.   Adult men (except Trump and you, perhaps) do not entertain themselves by tweeting idiotic videos of golf balls hitting someone.  The fact that you defend that kind of stupid and juvenile act is not particularly surprising.
Larry, you and Johnny Mabry have a fixation.  But "terror" is bad, no matter the justification. Can you agree? - Sikh temple murders: religious terrorism. Shooter thought he was murdering Muslims. - Jewish center murders by a Nazi and Klan member: Thought he was murdering Jews.  Both terrorist acts based on religion of victims - that's religious terrorism.  Of course, Roof murdered 9 innocents in a church not because of their faith, but their race.  Purposeful terror based on race is no good, either.  The Planned Parenthood shooting was extremism based on faiths that demonize Planned Parenthood. Most mass shooters are unstable, but instability doesn't choose the target in a vacuum.  The Orlando shooter wasn't an Islamic extremist, he seems to have been a bisexual man tormented by that and his faith, which like many "Christian" groups, demonize homosexuality. So, unstable in part because of faith, but by what his faith did to him, not what he was supposedly doing for Allah.
But does it excuse all the millions women who know they can get ahead by sleeping with the right people. It is a two way street: Men want sex, Women use sex.
One of the failed asylum seekers just murdered a man in Hamburg and stabbed/wounded at least five or six more. He was a known Islamist.
Im not sure if people are being willfully ignorant or if their experiences differ vastly from my own and my spouses. I am a Black Woman and I have started a Family with a White Man and we are madly in Love and have always been. Yes we enrich each others lives in so many ways but there are challenges and they have the potential to negatively affect our union. As a White Man it can be extremely maddening that there are parts of my existence and Identity I simply can not discuss with him as he CAN NOT identify with, understand or feel my plight as a WOC. It is extremely frustrating that there are parts of who I am that simply don't resonate with him in any way at all. If you all want to trivialize that challenge that many IR couples face, as someone on this post commented on as well, then you are all clearly in denial. Talking about race relations, differences and challenges should not be taboo in any relationship as they are an intimate part of our identities in many capacities. Wake up
If he is an example of what it means to be a "recovering homosexual" (whatever that means. Can one be a recovering heterosexual?), then I am pleased to be a very proud UNrecovered gay man!!!
The Dims DO have a message: Free Stuff.  Power at any cost.  Whites are bad.  Men are bad.  War is good if it's a Democrat Party war.  Republicans put people in for drugs (even though it was Bill Clinton who signed and started the sadistic "three strikes" bullshit).  The Dims are every bit as bad as the Rethugs.  Real conservatives vote Libertarian.  Real "progressives" vote Green.
Trump is a tiny, tiny man. Everything he says is the product of his atrophied, shrinking, ever-tinier, tiny, tiny brain.  He has a tiny everything, to the extent he has anything. In so many areas he has nothin:  No heart, no morals, no ethics, no integrity, no common sense, no compassion, no empathy, no self-control, no education, and so on.  He is an empty man ocuupying an empty suit.
Are they in denial of what trump has done and said. Incites hate, racism, bigotry, adultery,sexual predator, dishonesty in his businesses, 3x married,manipulator,. Do they listen to what he says in his speeches. I am sorry but, Jesus is about loving, kindness and forgiving, which I do not see that in the words that come out of his mouth. To me he is evil.No way is he believer of Jesus Christ.In Genesis 1 :27 God created man in His own image, in the image of God he created Him ;male and female;He created them. Another thing is churches are not suppose to endorse or not endorse any candidate on pulpit, newsletter or church bulletin. there are very strict IRS laws for 501c3 non profit.
Me neither. Glad to learn that we both hate the neo-fascist regime of the KGB man in the Kremlin.
thats a lib for you, all is lost, government is the answer, man what an ignorant loser you are, anything can come back with the right set of policies
Never said they liberals weren't white! Stop Hallucinating, will yah? Let me spell it out for you: The Liberal Democrats are always playing the Race Card, using Race to diss the "white" man! They do it to get the minorities Votes! Doesn't matter the color of the Racists Democrats as they all play the race card. It's always the White Man's fault It's the liberals democrats who play minorities, in actuality theDonald done more in 8 months in his presidency than Barry in his 8 year reign. Barry, Al, Jesse, Fredericka, etc. all used racism as to those high profile minority deaths, said it all before the facts came out in those instances. Barry divided America as to racial lines drawn. Barry wanted to be the Leader of THE WORLD dissing America while he was on foreign. Out of Michelle's own mouth, she was never proud to be an American! Thinking the WH was a Prison? Hell, why did you run for Office then? No wonder why Barry preached as the World Leader and HATED on America! God Bless America!
I always hated, a white man impersonating an Asian man, or a white man impersonating a black man, in the old B&W movies.  It was somewhat of an insult.  What is wrong, with a Hawaiian, acting as a Hawaiian King?  This is the 21st Century.  Or, has political correctness, taken on a new definition?  Should there be, a white man acting the part of Dr. Martin Luther King?
The malignant element here is the press, DJT reacts in kind. He gives what he gets. To label him as Nixonian, betrays the PROGRESSIVE mind set..... OH, the guy talk ??  i can see how a metrosexual, millenial, gamer in mom's basement, safe place seeking snowflake, girley men have a problem there. Find me a testosterone infused male who has not made similar comments.
False.  He freely admits to relationships with both men and women and he has chosen men.  Gay people choose to be attracted to their own sex.  I wish we would have more stray cats choose to be gay, then we would have fewer stray cats.
Honest question, which has puzzled me..  In Lesbian wedding ceremonies, very often, one partner dons the traditional "Bridal Dress", and the other a tuxedo...I never see a gay wedding picture, where one of the partners dons a wedding dress, it is almost always two tuxedos or at least both are wearing male attire)...  What is going on? Or is this another example of where lesbianism has much different dynamics from gay society?
The KKK and neo-Nazis just rallied in Virginia under the banner of Unite the Right. The Republican president is in lockstep with neo-Nazis and the KKK on the issue of venerating generals and politicians from the traitorous, white supremacist, anti-black Confederacy.  Who would have guess a man named Donald Trump who was busted by two different Departments of Justice for repeatedly committing illegal anti-black housing discrimination would turn out to align and defend KKK and neo-Nazis and their ideals. The segregationist real estate mogul is the hero of the segregationist movement. What a surprise.
Yes the veils are an admission that men in the ME are pigs.
I would call this man a complete idiot but I am not sure he is even complete. He has yet to accomplish anything except demonstrating how his size 11 shoes fit into his tangerine coloured mouth. However there is nothing wrong that a haircut and a lobotomy can't fix. We need one of those guys with three names right about now.......hope you can figure that out.
Good for Don and the rest of these guys for having fun, and thanks to ADN for helping identify these Alaska legends to readers.   Society has gotten so sick and tired of the perpetually offended and professional victimhood agenda, it's good to see that Men don't need to somehow apologize for being silly, and this innocuous, locally-made tv ad is no exception.  Keep being "risque," fellas!
MEN OF CALGARY: GO GAY! It is the only thing that will save your skin. But in today's heated feminist empire, being gay may not be a defence from an accusation of sexual impropriety.
"...feminists have said that they were racist in supporting white men over sisters "of color;" or opportunists in clinging to men who held power; or secret misogynists, haters of women, who had come to despise their own kind."  I hope the Democratic party clings to this message of identity politics.  The empty calories of: "it is not because I am unqualified or incompetent rather it is because they are racist, mysoginist, xenophobic, homophobes who hate transgenders, that you should NOT vote for them.  Look at me I am your only real alternative so hold you nose and vote for me because I belong to one of our glorious special interest groups." Even people that pass the Special Interest groups litmus test want leadership and a vision.  Nobody likes a negative messsssssage.
There obviously were some"happy endings" by the male encounters with the prostitutes.  No more happy endings at this massage parlor.
The author is an "old white guy" with peroxide hair. He should feel right at home with Trump as president. Why is it acceptable to attack "white men" in the national media today?  Isn't that a hate crime?
Trump is a rude child. Instead if acting like a leader he tweeted all weekend about NFL players, pandering to his zombie base. A real leader would have offered support, words of reassurance and asked for donations to help.  Instead he ignores 3.4 million AMERICANS suffering and dying and chastises men for peaceful prostest. Now that he has been called out, he sends out a bunch of disparaging tweets directed at Puerto Rico's leadership.   How can you defend that? That is not leadership, that is childish ego garbage. This latest display of a complete lack of leadership is sickening. I have no idea how anyone can support this buffoon.
She won't get the uneducated white male vote.   Trump LOVES the poorly educated.
Trump is a sad insecure joke of a man. He represents every aspect of baby boomers that makes everyone else loath them. Tired, old, sad, and void of any ideas other than glorifying himself. He's a freaking child
. the sack of garbage trump goes ahead and totally repudiates his forced apology. he has shown who he is.  he is a racist and he is an anti-semite - even if his daughter converted to judaism  his daughter put on a big charade the Sat night before the election with her visit (all frummed-up with a hat) to the Lubavitcher Rebbe's grave. The Lubavitcher Rebbe was one of the few in his extended family to survive Hitler. Jared Kushner has played the "my grandparents were survivors" long enough His fatehr-in-law defends Nazis. His father-in-law condones torchlight marches with grown men shouting "jews cannot replace us" his father-in-law is a racist - started out as a racist landlord then graduated to racist noisemaker his fatehr-in-law is either an anti-semite, or he just loves and defends them because they love and defend him  The "cutesy" couple of wealthy jews have to either take a stand or get the hell out of public view
It's mainly a Fox thing because the Christian Right is the last bastion of the Male Chauvinist Pig...
Lets see...angry white men founded this country.  Certainly you have no problem with that.  If so, you are free to move to a Muslim country where I'm sure your voice will be tolerated.
Let's fac it .  The Dutch have reason to be less than thrilled to be swarmed by Muslim immigrants. The new comers have been violent, demanding and damaging to the otherwise tolerant fabric of Dutch society. Everybody but Muslims  get along and it happens everywhere. The gays of Amsterdam  are particularly unsafe, being attacked and assaulted by Muslim men enforcing sharia law.  Theo van Gogh was a gay man defending his right to live as such, and not some fascist right wing monster, as Islamic apologists would have you think.
No offense to women. Just an opinion.  As a single, fit, successful, 38 year old man, my life is pretty awesome.  I have great relationships with my single male friends.  They add to my life, unconditionally love me, and support me.  I have never had this from a woman.  In my opinion women don't add to my life.  Typically they have unfounded expectations that make my life harder.  These expectations stem from a life of constant male attention willing to trade time, money, or entertainment for access to her vagina.  Women leverage that attention, especially to men they are dating..."Make me feel special or I'll choose someone else."  It's a losing proposition as the relationship goes on.    Now that sex is easily attained, men are realizing that women are a pain to deal with.  We are opting for more short term low expectation relationships.  I suggest women ask themselves "How can keep a man happy if I didn't have a vagina?" Most women have no idea what a man wants.
A narcissistic ignoramus like Trump will profit little from a learned and holy man like Pope Francis.
Mass killings in America, by deranged men, are occurring ever more frequently. Every country has a sizeable contingent of mentally ill citizens wanting to vent their anger. America’s the only one that provides them easy access to sophisticated weaponry and the power to play god.
Jay whatever is a dick - he should stay in the US instead of coming back a failure with his tail between his legs - the other guy is just another ron mclean playing the straight man to the dick sitting next to him - both are complete morons and not welcome back
Yeah, until it's your mom or wife lying there providing a peep show for male nurses.  Maybe not so funny anymore?
proving once again that I can speak honestly and truthfully without fear while "little davey" dares not reveal who he really is because "he's afwaid !". are you shaking in fearbthat we'll discover who ypu really are "little davey" ?!  you're such a coward, afraid to come out a play with the REAL men are we ? ahahahahaha ! :P
I used to work in a hospital. The most sexually lewd staff I ever came across were homosexual males. I'm going to guess these nurses were guys or nearly all guys.
Lot of dirty old men on here.  Best wishes for a young girl trying to enjoy life.
"...troglodytes and peevish old men"  -- yeah, no sexism there.  How about you take a look in the mirror once in a while?
Von play football, your paid to hit QBs. Hate the QB not the flag, and those of us who fought real war. Your a sissy, men died for this anthem, you play a game get millions and there are guy's dieing....
It would be more like a skirmish. In less than an hour, little rocket man would cease to exist. War over and there was peace on earth. Rocket man knows this and while he may be a monster, although a little one, he's not an idiot.
What the heck is Q ( LBGTQ). Hip hip hooray  for Trump.1) male 2) female 3) Handicapped ( all though all those signs were changed..eg politically incorrect.  eg 3a) physically challenged.  All I have to say is a repeat of what I watched on TV.   Seven new planets where there might be life. Bathroom 4) alien.
Another example of a white male who cannot recognize his own entitlements but feels threatened when challenged. A person so deluded that he thinks men do all the dirty jobs, that women do not fight crime, and seems to be unaware of all the brave women in the military. Delusional and sad.
Funny how rape and sexual assault are the only things in the world in which it is always assumed the victim is lying.  I doubt you and your friends go around posting on stories - about a man getting robbed for example that "we have so little information." Or in the case of your little friend there, making a passive aggressive statement as to his disdain for women by putting "perp" and "vic" in quotation marks.  Of course in society we also don't go out of our way to blame the male robbery victim in my hypothetical either...we dont say he was asking for it, he was giving off signals etc etc.    But then of course, those who don't point the finger at every woman in the world and scream liar!!! is close minded.  Yep.
100 years from now they'll view the way we handled this form of mental illness and laugh.  Water is wet, snow is cold, and you are the sex you were born with.  If a man identifies with a chicken and is clucking in his front yard we'll put him in the crazy house, but if he thinks he is a women then he should get a trophy for being brave.
If you are whining about this article (most of you are) it's simply because you are pathetic. Great show. No statement. Trump remains the stupidest man to ever lead a nation. And his supporters are in the same intellectual percentile. Not high
the terrorists continue to be alienated white male citizens hon..not well-vetted immigrants or refugees.  Get a clue.
We probably all have a few we flub. Obama: "Corpse-man" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlkK65y_-T4
From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author. Bloom, a white woman, is a civil rights attorney and writer. You're citing hearsay, gossip, and malicious misinformation. Below are real indisputable facts.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
Thank you Tempmanoa.  That creepy man pretending to be female on here (Allie) disagreed LOL.
"Diversity" is just  a code-word for ANTI-WHITE, especially ANTI-WHITE MALE. Nobody ever says the NBA or NFL are not "diverse enough" or have too many blacks. Why does Canada take in an absurdly high 300,000 immigrants a year??!! That is a ridiculously high figure. We should be taking in a maximum of 50-60,000 tops.  And why so many from the third world? Easy votes for the Liberal party perhaps?
The guy was from Puerto Rico.  there is no evidence that he was a muslim - it sounds more like he was schizophrenic.  The statement that the CIA was sending him messages from ISIS through the internet is not an indicator that he was an Islamic Jihadist, but rather that he was mentally ill.
An adulteress? Remember the hew and cry from the Church on the appointment of a gay man as ambassador to Santo Domingo? What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Our peodophile protecting prelates should oppose this appointment. Think they will? An adulteress yes, a fag no.
Predator priests get sent Native American reservations!  Hasn't the white man done enough damage to Native Americans, (disease, genocide, alcohol,) without dumping pedophile priests  on them, too?  Any bishop who has done this needs to be removed faster than one can say George Armstrong Custer.
its not the camping, its the mounds of garbage. I don't care if people sleep in tents but the kinds of campers all along waterfront and out on the trail are the very worst offenders and clearly didn't get the pack in pack out message. that's what the city seems to be tolerating. giant shit heaps along otherwise pretty corridors. if the city is going to allow camping it better give its garbage men a raise!!!
I see this assertion a lot, but have never read why some people believe it to be indisputable truth.  It is not.  "As humans, we also need rituals"  SOME people may DESIRE to particiopate in rituals, but to say that ALL people "need" rituals is not true.    In the context of religion, some desire some rituals in certain contexts (they don't "need" ritual), others pretty much forgo ritual (for example, Quakers).    In the early church, the eucharist was a meal, presided over by someone chosen from the congregation, or by the head of household, who might have been either a man or a woman. No priests.  The rituals that have developed during the history of the RCC and christianity in general,  were developed by men, and sometimes have become a bit ludicrous. When any small change from the GIRM becomes a matter for civil war in the RCC, the notion of  the importance of 'ritual" has gone too far, becoming an end in itself that is often even at odds with true prayer and true spirituality.
"Taking liberties" with the facts is vastly different from brazenly making things up...which is what Trump has been doing...not only in his campaign, but in his business dealings as well. If he wasn't wealthy he'd be just another mentally ill man babbling to himself and everyone passing by while he stood at an intersection with his cardboard sign.
Black doesn’t have solutions to anything, he’s just a mouth piece that revels at some ones else's misery. Notice he's doesn't show up until a criminal has killed someone and he does that to place blame on innocent citizens. He's a man's man!
Oh you mean directly opposed to the teachings of the sexist male hierarchy of the church who blatantly and sinfully discriminate against women? Catholics most certainly do support a women's right to bodily autonomy and reproductive choice. I am a proud member of Catholics for Choice. All of you self-righteous busybodies should mind your own business!
Hey all you White Boys ... F)(K you and your electric light bulb.  Who needs your GD flush toilets ?
The definition of a nihilist is "a person who believes that life is meaningless and rejects all religious and moral principles."  And yet he shouts stupid,  racial, religiously-charged nonsense at innocent teenagers.  This man is a raving lunatic, BY CHOICE. And a very stupid man at that. Having pity on this fool, Jeremy Joseph Christian, is an attack against humanity and love for our fellow beings.  Although the current toxic political environment can be blamed and placed at the feet of a majority of politicians, this monster must be held accountable.  He should not be given ANY public forum to spew his hateful opinions but given a fair trial and a burial at sea just like Osama Bin Laden
This country has no president. We're on auto-pilot while a man-child bully plays president.
Michael: Now, let's be truthful here. "Who am I to judge?" The pope used that terminology to refer to a gay priest who was striving to be celibate;  he was not responding to sexually active homosexuals. He even reconfirmed Pope Benedict's exclusion of homosexual men from the priesthood. Additionally: The LA District Attorney's office found that 95% of the sexual abuse cases in the LA Archdiocese involved priests molesting teenage boys!  You cannot escape that fact.
What a warped little man. Like Tony Soprano as a six year old.
interesting.... As a Mandan female, I am always amazed at the number of angry, unstable, abusive men out here.
"a kid's word"??  You clearly haven't thought this one thru.  That kid is going to have to live as a girl 24/7.  That means hair, makeup, clothes, the whole bit.  No hanging with the guys.  No male sports.  Not to mention that they've removed themselves from the hetero dating pool, pretty much permanently.  And that's not considering the abuse they'll receive from their former male friends.  Words like gay, fag and freak come to mind - and those are the milder ones.  And then there's the little matter of abuse - a significant percentage of transgendered individuals are the victims of assault.
Conservatives constantly lambasted Ignatieff as "just visiting", even though they weren't members of the Liberal Party. It's the right who is being whiny. Constant crying from a bunch of man-babies.
Likely? Have you an actual cite? Regardless, if, as he claims, the sex was consensual, she would have his DNA as well. This isn't television, all most physical evidence can do is place someone at a scene, it doesn't determine guilt nor innocence of a criminal act. DNA is most useful in excluding suspects in a case of alleged rape, or impeaching the testimony of an alleged perpetrator who denies they were there at all.  Also, if both were impaired, then it is paternalistic and destructive to her agency to charge him with rape and not her using the "impairment removes consent" standard. Unless of course you buy into the Victorian notion that only men "want sex" and women are frail, helpless creatures who merely submit to it at best.  This is why rape investigations need to be made by actual police, not incompetent kangaroo courts driven by Title IX "Friend letters" explicitly saying to weight the process in favor of the accuser and remove due process protections from the accused.
Jeff, if Say Something (SS) did even a bit of research, he would start to understand the complexity of mid 18th century US politics, including the Know Nothings, he would recognize his own dilemma and be Say Nothing. As would those who jump on the bandwagon with 'Likes' for SS's simple, sanitized, dumb-downed 'good guys versus bad guys version of history. I am truly so fed up with uninformed, ignorant SJW posts and replies. To suggest that so many men would lay down their lives simply to defend Slavery of other men is such a gross simplification of the causes of the war as to make one wonder whether SS is truly so ignorant (yet confident of her views!) or Zer is simply not out even out of short pants yet.
"One heavily Muslim school in Toronto faced tough questions a few years back because menstruating girls weren’t allowed to take part in the prayer service.There have been concerns about sexism... what kind of Islam is being preached." ~ ` ~ No Kidding. What pure primitive nonsense.. the female reproductive process is no-one's business, especially that of 'supernatural power-mongers'.  That may have worked in centuries past when missing females during prayer service alerted males to those females who were ready to be impregnated after cultural customary marriage rituals; adding to the male's pack of  multiple wives from same said culture..  . . And for the 'bigoted wunderkinds of the Planet' -- the perspective of this writer has nothing to do with "Islamophobia" & everything to do with being from the enlightened North American "Modern Western Civilization" & believing in 'Personal Freedom of Mind.  . . . Humans playing Stupid Power-Monger Head-Games -- using  'supernatural excuses'.  /.
Not surprising the man is an academic idiot...knew that years ago when he first ran for office when he came to Cooper Landing wooing the old folks in our town and they being so stupid bought it.  I didn't.
Democrats, proven wrong every single time, still think their fantasies are true: "I have always been proud to be a Democrat because of the way members of my party fought to bring a voice to the voiceless and to prioritize the needs of the vulnerable" No, you're all evil enabling morons who champion the slavers of men. The cancer you give yourselves is never enough.
You would think that there are so many other more important issues facing the world then to focus on what really amounts to be a non-issue.  Trump does this to posture to his dwindling supporters and to take the focus off of his total lack of effective leadership.  The man is a dunce who cannot get specific about any of his supposed policies.  When will his madness end?
Since my last post was removed, I'll try again and this time NOT of offend some of the smaller left wing brains...  This piece was total trash.. I suggest Ms. Fox go out into the REAL world to discover what's really happening.  It's obvious from her rant that she is one of 'those' that choose to blame the FAILURE of those on the LEFT to adjust to the realities of the what is going on around her. She may THINK that 'old white men' will fade away but she conveniently forgets that people get older and as they mature they realize the mistakes of the 'young' thus their opinions change. Have NO fear, 'old guys' (and gals) will be around a long time and will have NO problem voicing their opinions and taking action when needed.
Since black people don't like anything Confederate, maybe they should erect a monument of the first slave holder in the U.S. His name was Anthony Johnson, who BTW was black. They could add a mural of the African tribesmen hunting them down and selling them to the white man.
People with male genitalia shouldn't be in the girls washrooms period. If you want to recognize a very small  group of society in the process of  transformation give them their own space!!!!! Trump isn't responsibly for the amount of media attention  surrounding this group that makes up less than 1 percent of society!!!! Truly, trying to understand the leftist mind set is an exercise  in futility.
It boggles the mind reading some of these letters, like LW1, that someone in a relationship like this needs a neutral party to explain what a jerk she's attached to.  My suspicion is she knows it, but adores the child and doesn't want to cause the little girl pain, and may even worry about leaving the child with such a horrible father.  Regardless, nothing about that letter notes any logical reason to keep this guy around.
He placed people who had been arrested only upon suspicion of their immgration status in a tent city in the middle of the desert, with heat that reached 141 degrees, without proper healthcare or nutrition.  Some of them died.  I don't care how you define that.  Most people see that as murder.  Joe Arpaio is a murderer.  Anything else you have to say about this is semantic nonsense.  The man is a murderer.
W   O   W......REALLY............. Andy Taylor..........John Kerns does not have any RESPECT for his parents.  HE made his "STUPID" decision to violate his parents premises,  and BREAK the LAW.   SHAME ON YOU for DISRESPECTING  Mr. Kerns,  who is an OUTSTANDING CHIEF OF POLICE.  This man has INTEGRITY, something you are seriously lacking.      And,  YOU are yet........... ANOTHER ONE,  who does NOT   UNDERSTAND ABOUT BREAKING THE LAW.
I'm sorry you are so full of hate that you can't see the blaming of Trump for the random killing of hispanic people by a man hearing voices as anything but deranged. I think that may be bordering on a mental illness of your own. You are proof of my original statement.
Just keep drinking that true believer brand Trump Kool-aid and everything will be A-OK.  Ignore the many bold-face lies. Ignore the historical and governmental ignorance. Ignore the constant whining. Ignore the constant blaming. Ignore the nepotism. Ignore the budget proposal that doesn't add up. Ignore the gaffes with our allies. Ignore the "Health Care" bill that is nothing but a tax cut for the rich. Ignore the fact that this guy's whole life has been spent serving no one but himself, but suddenly it's not about him anymore. He has seen the light! and cares oh so much about US. Oh how lucky we are to have such a man in the Oval Office! Leadership at its finest? Uh, I don't think so.  The sooner this self-serving, narcissistic, man-child exits the scene and is replaced by Pence, the better off we all will be.
I hope Ontarioans arent that stupid to fall for this one..  Ohh wait a minute..they elected here in the first place..along with the Selfie Boy PM and her main man, Butts..  I guess they are that stupid...
Certainly Trump is no Kennedy or any other President in history. He doesn't learn from his mistakes just blames others and moves on. He doesn't read. That I find scary. A man in his position who gets virtually all of his news from biased right wing new sources and the National Inquirer. The man is a farce and his agenda is soon to be in total ruins. As he recently quipped "nobody knew how complicated health care is", his depth of ignorance knows no bottom. Sad.
You will notice that the rise in VEGETARIANISM coincides with the rise in FEMINISM and male white knights. ` Men are the bad hunters who kill animals. Well that's evaluation! Humans have been consuming meat for hundreds of thousands of years on earth, so know we should change? Now we should feel bad? ` Notice how feminism has no respect for men? For their fathers, grand-fathers, great-great-great----- grandfathers? If man was part of it it must be bad. ` The men who protected women and provided for them for the last 100,000+ years are now scum! ` Let's listen to the Immutable Laws about men and women by Paul Elam, (this will explain a lot) ` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BJmIXG1jYw
Rita , the US bishops, for the most part, are not really Christians or Catholics- they are Right Wing GOPers masking as such. The fact that only two guys had the guts to say something  about what just happened this weekend speaks volumes. They are only interested in PELVIC issues, money intake and living lavishly - nothing else really matters. So don't look for guidance or kindness coming out of the mouths of these boyos. Shame, shame, shame on them. Same sort of thing happened back in the days of Hitler - nothing new and see what happened.
The brow beating men have taken the last 20 years has been passed down to our sons. You told us we were dicks, now we are.  In private conversations we explain to to our sons that girls and women today are simply spoiled princesses and too expensive to ever marry. Their parents have turned them into brats not worthy of marriage. Look at these girls today, they are narcissistic jerks.  They are spoiled, self centered, flaky twits who leave for the next great Tinder bang....  Then we get into the feminist movements, our Yoga PM and his royal family, etc who tell the world women are useful and men are prIicks.... You keep telling us we are aholes - after awhile you live the part. You reap what you sew ladies. We are pr1cks and better for it
Respecting Pope Francis's priorities (and an American national priority), an aspect of common urgency is to drain the swamp of male-ego self-satiety. Humanity, and our Church specifically, suffers the arrogant frustration of male-cultic self-superiority.
If Meredith has any honour, he should resign. I care not a morsel that his wife and Jesus Christ have forgiven him. A married Preacher scumbag that exploits a 16 year old has no place in the Senate. The emotional scars and impacts on teenagers from much older men luring them into relationships stay with these young women for a lifetime. In their efforts to clean themselves up and regain some credibility, Senators must find a way to get rid of this disgusting man.
I agree that women groping men has to stop and all the gossiping women do has to stop also.  NO MORE SEX until then.
So who called out Notley when she said Catholics don’t have consensual sex. Is that coded language for male Catholics are rapists?  The fact that she wouldn’t aknowledge what she says puts her as a bigot and racist?
A smarmy con man.  Fool me once.....
This whole thing has been a very pathetic display and definitely not an American one.  And the amazing part, man almost all of them probably have no employment. How could they staying out there that long doing nothing but most likely sex, smoking weed and feeling good about themselves, smells more like a robust woodstock reunion than patriotism.
She was an unfaithful sleeze. She made a vow and did not keep it. She couldn't keep her legs shut. She completely destroyed her hard working man because of her sexual addiction and welcomed a man other than her husband into her bed. Of course he lost it. He goes to work while she shares there marriage bed with a low life scumbag. Those kids belong with his family not hers. Who knows how sleazy that sister is. She is probably after the PFDs and probably is just as sleazy.
Many suicides are impulsive and if the individual has a gun it is all the more easy to give way to the impulse.  And young males can kill each other more effectively with guns than anything else.  Besides, suicides, young males or not -- the deaths matter.
I am totally disgusted with this article.  Sarah is comparing not letting transgender people serve in the military to the Nazi roundup and murder to millions of Jews (along with Roma, communists, the challenged and some Catholics). Man, she is a disgusting d.b.
Jack: "Wow, you are getting desperate! Should we hold a mass trial including Obama for his "corpse-men" blunder, throw W in too?"  -  1. Trump says stupid things 2. But you support Trump 3. Your self-esteem says "Hey, wait a minute..." 4. You lash out
"One man on a loudspeaker said the largely Latino protesters belong in the kitchen."  What a gasbag.
Yawn, another woman under attack by Trump, what else is new?  With him, a woman is either a passive, beauty queen contestant who allows men to grope her and "compliment" her physical appearance or a bitch with intelligence who has the nerve to question bad policy.  Looks like Sen. murkowski is being categorized as the latter, though there were also several Repub men who voted no......
OK, ... and not pay your taxes, not yell fire in a crowded theater, not license your vehicle.  Your line of reasoning is that of a sociopath and pathetic to boot.  No man (or woman) is an island, get it, or would you prefer to build your own school, highways, and runways (for example)??
Ben, your comment points to the very heart of the matter. You assume that someone who is transgender has a choice. That they actively choose to go against their sex in order to claim gender. Did you choose your sexual preferences? Did you choose to identify male?  Or were you simply born that way? And if you were born that way, does it not stand to reason that transgender people were also born that way? So, by extension does it stand to reason that these 'kid's aren't so much making up their own minds, but rather are trying to live with the inherent gender with which they identify? Does it not also stand to reason that the more a person tries to subjugate his or her nature the 'more screwed up' he or she will be in the long run? There are a number of studies showing correlation between repressed sexual and gender identification and depression and suicide.
Yes, some women can be more careful.  Men can also do more to make sure that women who drink too much aren't taken advantage of.  If women thought they were going to be raped they wouldn't have walked down that alley or went to that party, or gone to a bar, or a friend's house.  Hindsight is always 20/20.  Since we are using cliche's.     But we've all made mistakes.  Some people have addictions and other problems that make them more prone to being victims.  Others are practiced perpetrators who know exactly how to find their victims.  The problem is why is it OK for men to get shit-faced drunk and women not to?   Men need to step up and take responsibility.  It is rarely women who rape.
This 'man' needs to be removed from the public teet. Based on his age, he's got another 20 years unless something is done.  No excuses. Just gross in every way imaginable.   And not partisan here either. I'm a hard core small 'c' conservative who's in favour of removing the rot wherever it may be found.
Quick! A straw man! Shoot him!
God must be a freewill man. A female God wouldn't allow this freewill crap.
His father was a con man and a thief not a mass murderer.
In other news, a person with a penis  is demanding the right to attend a women's only event where nudity is common. See: http://www.metronews.ca/news/toronto/2017/06/14/women-only-spa-s-no-male-genitals-rule-ignites-transgender-debate.html
Blame our forefathers:  "....We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, ...."  BTW, I'm not gay.  I am respectful of the rights of others, though.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal
Huh. Hard to "fight" or "fight back" with five broken ribs and possible lung puncture. What a stupid comment. I've had one broken rib and man, did it hurt. Not five. But your comment is surely a brave one to make, Rocky.
The critique of Shakespeare is based on the postmodern notion that Shakespeare is overrated  for having been a white male.  All other qualities he may possess as a  writer are debased by that singular sin.
Another tantrum by an undisciplined man who is supposed to be leading this country.  An embarrassment to this nation and its laws that make this nation a free democracy.
The definition of treason contains the phrase 'providing material assistance to a hostile government'.  Yeah, I don't need Mark Z. Barabak telling me that's highly unlikely.  I know Trump and he has already provided material assistance to Putin.  Trump is a traitor and treason is an integral part of his scam.  Trump's trouble is that he's so incompetent that his scam is falling down around his ears.  Trump is a weak man who jumps at any chance at self aggrandizement.  It is his downfall.  HIs insecurity will take him down.  It's his most dominant characteristic and it will end his scam.
Just like Trump to not get that the real reason he was voted 'Person of the Year' is because of the massive amounts of negativity and divisiveness he produced at the expense of many, many innocents. The old narcissist thinks it's because he's a great man. Kind of pathetic.
During the campaign I came to believe that the election of Donald Trump would represent the most serious test of our constitution since the Civil War.  I continue to believe that's true. Trump shows little understanding of how democratic institutions actually work and he demonstrates no inclination to work within them. He's a dangerous man.
As I understand the issue, a truly transgender person seeks to change their born with genitalia to their believed sexual orientation. So a transgender male wished to have a vagina instead of a penis and balls because they believe they are truly a female. During this process, transgender individuals can legally change their driver licenses and birth certificates to represent their rightful gender. Like so many other concepts in America and around the world, trans gender means a process of changing. If you haven't changed your genitalia to the correct genitalia then should you really use bathrooms designated for the other gender. And once again why don't we just make all bathrooms unisex. That would solve a lot of problems and wouldn't cost that much.
I wonder if I could apply to the U.S,surely living under Wynne and Trudeau qualifies as cruel and unusual hardship,and that is without mentioning being disenfranchised as a White,English Speaking,Hetero Sexual Male.
I believe Indian on Indian abuse sexual, physical  and mental abuse has been going on long before the white man showed up. The government knows this but are too cowardly to say it. The age of consent law was not changed by the Liberals because Indians were having sex with young girls. If Indians are given a pass on this all white abusers need to be released from jail because they have been abused also, it is a learned experience . A new way to deal with abuse has to happen or start arresting Indians.
A man who sexually abuses women.  Not my idea of a man at all.
Jimmy Carter admitted he was human and also demonstrated that he was able to resist temptation.  Bill Clinton finally acknowledged that he did "have sex with that woman"..but only after he had no choice in the matter.  He demonstrated he was NOT able to resist temptation and was a philanderer.    Donald Trump didn't "admit"..he bragged about his sexually assaultive behavior.  He documented for all of us to see that not only was he a sexual predator, he was proud of it.....it made him a real "manly" man.  BTW:  There are a host of women who have "documented" his sexually assaultive behavior.    I respect President Carter......a truly decent and honorable man.  I have little respect for Clinton, who showed us he had no decency regarding truth and faithfulness to his wife and family.  My disdain for Trump goes far beyone that.  He's shown throughout his life that he cares nothing about others and acts only for his own self-interest, often to the direct detriment of others.  Gary Crum
Apparently you're not very good at accurately identifying tone.  That of Moore's column mostly consisted of well-deserved ridicule and sarcasm directed at those greased-up male prostitutes crapping up the statehouse.  Pretty much the OPPOSITE of "whining."  Herein endeth the lesson.
Hi, I'm a straight white cisgender retired combat veteran who has a Gay Godfather, my son and daughter have "2" Gay Godfathers, my family waves the "FAMILY" flag in a neighborhood who doesn't agree and I have lost friends in the military due to my stance on gays in the military and then your A** goes and does this!! How the hell do you expect us "WHITE STRAIGHT MEN" to stand up with you when you are secretly shooting us down? I love my big gay family and it's "women" (yes I labeled you) that will make it harder for my "FAMILY" to be accepted.  I hope that you get all the non white non cisgender people for your department and get your ass hacked to the stone ages!  I'm sure you will go and find a safe place now and blog/tweet/skype/snap/facebook and your probably so hipster you still use myspace or BBS and say how this warpig hurt your feelings. Rome was not built in a day but you are damn set on seeing it burn in one to get your way! Have a Happy Thanksgiving and a MERRY Christmas!
Poor gray whale was doing some inland sightseeing, and discovered the gross ignorance of man.
Man this is really dumb. This has greatly damaged their brand and will cost them millions and it didn't need to happen. Even after it happened they still could have mitigated the damage by standing up and taking their lumps. They should have said what we all know - that they were absolutely wrong and should apologize to everyone on that flight.  To avoid it in the first place they could have refused the late coming flight crew seats or if committed keep upping the ante until someone volunteered their seat. Whatever the cost it would be far cheaper than what they did.
Come in your car, come on the bus, crawl out of your box, every tranny, woman, and cisgendered male has a claim on the impeachment of this fool!  Just bring your own hypodermic needles
This editorial is a ridiculous piece of print, "In other words, Gelser, a 43-year-old woman, is incapable of arousing the physical interest of a male colleague. She’d have to be 20 years younger for her allegations to be taken seriously."  Female beauty ends at 23?  What moron thinks that?  The RG's editorials are becoming harder and harder to take seriously.  Who is writing this stuff, a 22 years old kid?
It's about racist targeting of black men on the part of police.    San Francisco effectively fired Kaepernick and no other team has hired this Super Bowl quarterback.  No racism or punishment here, move along now.
@ALbertD3 >>So, in saying that, am I an online troll? You didn't define it very clearly, just as M103 fails to clearly define Islamophobia. This is a dangerous game. .   We have articles conveying 'Muslim victimhood' and 'Canadian -phobias' - most of the time authored by a Muslim woman in a head-scarf. . Hold the outrage, before marking the post, and ask yourselves - why is that a pattern? . Where are the Muslim male authors? Or non-covered Muslim female authors? Or opinions different than those having been relentlessly published in G&M?
I might have a claim on n a FC seat but not this confused man.  Turks are really outrageous anyway.  They are so disliked in Europe.
I suspect it is primarily white liberals that have been surprised by the level of racism and bigotry Trump has managed to harness. Since I'm black, I get reminded daily of the racism in my fellow Americans. One of the more subtle effects of racism is the constant concern minorities must have for the emotional fragility of most of the white people here. If you are black and ignore that, you will never have peace, a job, or you freedom. The truth is that as a nation we have not made peace with our racist heritage. Being polite became "political correctness" when us "others" demanded the same rights and freedoms that white males have. For example, the 2nd Amendment is a white privilege. Cops routinely kill black people on the suspension of being armed. White men can attend political rallies while armed. We have never had equal protection under the law. I would pity the white people that are losers in globalization, if they didn't think killing black people would solve their problems.
Once again a unarmed Black man is executed by rogue cops in Oklahoma. Hillary objected heart and soul. Trump and his white supremacists said absolutely nothing.
The "thinking" might have gone something like, "If a black man could do it ..."
Have you READ all the available information? The women both had consensual sex; the man is a playboy, and the girls got mad and got even. Billy-boy brought up wmd on the eve of the monica investigation. Poor Bush bought in to the lies. (Though I have always thought Bush, Sr threw the race to Bill.) They are all in bed together! And please, would you people retire McCain! He is a war monger, a dork, a tired old fool.
No he was bright enough to pander to the uneducated white males which are numerous in the States, hence the ku klux klan support, and then he was betting on the stupidity of the Republicans who would rather vote for someone they despise rather than for a democrat.
"Are men who get angry when a woman says or texts #MenAreTrash doing anything but proving the point?"  The point being that people don't like being libelled based on their gender or skin colour? The point that people object to double standards? The point that "rules for thee but not for me" is the archest hipocrisy?  What a ridiculous piece of argument. "By contradicting my point you prove my point!" No, that's not how proof by contradiction works, that's how stories by Kafka work.  The mental gymnastics the author is performing in an attempt to wriggle out from the bigotry of the phrase are doomed to failure: scorning an entire gender is sexism, plain and simple.
Hay Dana.....Speaking of "political violence", I see Hillary fans are rioting, looting Wal Mart, lighting fires, assaulting police and hating white folks because a black police officer shot and killed and armed black man.  These anarchists are voting for Hillary right?    No mention of this story in the RG.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/21/protests-break-out-in-charlotte-after-police-fatally-shoot-man-they-say-wielded-firearm/
Being a small minded and nasty person who is lacking in emotional and spiritual maturiyt and whose ministry is basically scamming gullible people out of money certainly strike me as disqualifications to the priesthood.  And I'd prefer that the right men (and sadly it is still only men) enter the priesthood rather than ordaining anything with a pulse.   We really don't need immature woman hating men who want to play Latin Mass dress up and act like little dictators becoming priests.  They do so much to chase people out of the Church.
''Kelly was a jerk'' says the guy who comments on an article about a man who was killed in a plane crash. I didn't care for his political views nor his brothers much but geez Frank the man just passed away and all you can think of to say is the guy was a jerk? Nice. Full of compassion for your fellow Alaskan I see. Karma is an evil bitch Frank.
It is odd how the bad things about a person get so glossed over, and we look at them through rose-colored glasses after death.   Ali was a bigot.  He looked down on white people and Christians.  The radical Malcolm X himself converted him to follow the Nation of Islam, which is a well recognized hate group with strong antisemitism, and gave him his name of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.  And he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: "I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough"  And he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam "a white man's war", and said that "My enemy is the white people!"    Other quotes from Ali: "All Jews and gentiles are devils",  "The sins of drinking, smoking, prostitution, homosexuality, stealing, gambling: It all comes from white people."
Men are afraid women will laugh at them; women are afraid men will kill them."  -Margaret Atwood
You aren't all for protecting women and girls.. a few months ago you were whining about your Alaskan Airlines flight being delayed because a 16-year old girl was assaulted by a drunk man next to her on that same flight. All you cared about was your flight being delayed. You didn't give a damn about her. But here you are pretending to champion women and girls. You're a self-serving bastard protecting bigots in the name of safety. Take a hike!
Where's the perp's mugshot? Oh, that's it- must not be a despised American white heterosexual male. ADN; typical leftist, anti-white, rag...
Carrying a weapon is the quickest way to get shot by a cop, especially if you're male and black. Your best bet is to simply be polite and refuse to cooperate if you're convinced you're in the right. Do not physically resist under any circumstances. You may be arrested, or even knocked around, but if you pull a gun, you'll be dead.
Mostly, blacks kill other young black males.  Those statistics are consistent for decades.  "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homicide was indeed the No. 1 killer of black men between the ages of 15 and 34 in 2011, the most recent year with statistics available.    Compared to other ethnicities, the numbers really stand out. Forty percent of African-American males 15-34 who died were murdered, according to the CDC, compared to just 3.8 percent of white males who died.   Overall, 14 percent of all men 15-34 who died in 2011 were murdered."  In Portland, Oregon, reading the Oregonian, it seems that the two most likely places for a black person to die is outside of a strip bar or on their own front porch.
A sad pathetic comment about a brave man.
agree with your co-workers because everyone needs to have the same views on everything....being an individual is now out!  Male and female alike all must shave their heads and faces, no makeup allowed, no eyeglasses, must use contact lenses.  Conform to the liberal crap everyone, so none of them are offended by anyone actually  having a BRAIN!
LOL WTF. Your argument is puerile and ridiculous. What is this, a new talking point from the NRA? It's dumb. No women are backing you up on this because we know what ACTUALLY is sexist. And hey, a man speaking for us is in fact sexist, so you can just stop now. It's not appreciated.
“I'm a CONSERVATIVE woman and let me clue you into one fact, most men ARE jerks.   Let me fix this sentence for you, most men ( whom you know personally  ) ARE (most likely) jerks. In my experience, women in particular tend to attract( and are attracted to ) those persons who are most like them, or who are similar to a person they grew up with whom they fear and/or respect. Then there are the gold-diggers...
I surely think that women SHOULD stop teaching the gospel. I'm good with that. Let men do it all. Or even half of it!
Oh man, such total PC garbage.  In a small number of cases bad men abuse blameless women.  That is bad.  In general and predominantly, couples fight and get angry.  The typical woman will scream, hurl insults, throw things and strike her partner.  She will never be charged unless she actually stabs or seriously, and seriously means hospital treatment serious, injurers her partner.  Evil people, like the writers of this article will tell the women that they are blameless.  They will tell them that they can behave any way they want without consequence.  The writers of this article are incredibly evil in that they fuel conflict and perpetuate bilateral abuse.  But this is sick America.  So it is okay.
Wow- new owners and already fresh, diverse opinions that are NOT from the Washington Post or New York Times!  I applaud Christine Flowers' unmasking of 3rd wave feminism and Leftist identity politics has made for itself-- largely fake campus "rape culture," perpetuated largely by campus feminist groups.  After the 'Rolling Stone' falsifed its campus rape story, coupled with the numerous examples that Flowers brings up, society has slowly started to realize the harm this kind of faux victimhood thinking is doing to the next generation of youth. Yes, there are many examples of sexual assault- both from males and females- but to say "rapists and perpetual rapists are everywhere, out there in the ether!"  Is not helpful to anyone, and this 3rd wave feminist thinking is toxic to everyone, including their own children: . http://www.dailywire.com/news/18590/monster-bigoted-feminist-writer-shames-her-amanda-prestigiacomo
um...no. the 2-8% false reporting figure is a complete fallacy, and the "research" you mention is by those who want the outcome to be 2-8%. For every "report" you show me that's supports 2-8% as lying....I can show you a report that shows 25% are lying. Lies...damn lies...and statistics.   Ms. Doolittle, like most feminists, has a very, very hard time reconciling the unfounded rate to the fact that many, many women have and continue to lie about being raped...happens every day, countless times, around the world, in every society.  It's a cognitive dissonance, stemming from the "Sugar and Spice" myth.  The answer is really quite simple, just have everybody stop lying. Bu that'll be tough, as many, many studies have shown women casually lie at a far greater rate and frequency than men do. That's why they grow to be much better at it.  Ms. Doolittle's Feminist la-la land is just that....a fantastical echo chamber.
At risk of telling you more than you want to know: Milo Yiannopoulos is a senior editor at Breitbart News. The creeps at Breitbart prop him up because, as a self-loathing gay man, MY is useful to them. They promoted his “tour” from the get-go: "Suck It Up Buttercups: Dangerous F*ggot Tour Returns in September” (7/6/2016): www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/07/06/milo-yiannopoulos-dangerous-faggot-tour-returns-campuses-fall/ MY is pathetic, more to be pitied than scorned. His message is right wing cliches that are notable only because they are spewed by a gay man who both encourages gay men to stay in the closet and flaunts his own homosexuality for profit. People have every right to protest if they so choose. They do not have the right to commit violence, to do harm, to cause damage; they especially don’t have the right to stop the man from speaking. It’s incredibly stupid. It transforms a pathetic figure into a sympathetic one.
The inquiry's only mandate is to absolve native men and to blame white people ( white men) for decades of  harm  done to indigenous women. If  the inquiry fails, it will be blamed on white people.  No matter what direction it goes,  natives themselves have already decided they have no responsibility for what they do to each other.
i'm confused.  you've stated that most of the comments are based on assumptions, yet you continue on to provide your own list of assumptions as to what happened, prefaced with "most likely?"    "Some of the juveniles may have been guilty mostly of stupidity."  nah.  ALL of these punks are guilty of stupidity.  and considering that this poor guy is being fed through a tube now, i'd say that "guilty mostly of stupidity" is a gross understatement.  granted, beatin' the guy with a hammer may have not been part of the original plan.  but that is neither here nor there, at this point.
Men do not dress and paint themselves as indecently as many women who are "expressing their sexuality!" for the purpose of titillating the other sex. I dislike painted women, they are frauds wearing a false mask, I consider high heels ridiculous, glued on eyelashes as well as  showing their off their breast cracks a hilarious shame .
Another typical leftist. Attack the man not the argument.
J,  so the rest of the losers didn't even get off their butts and vote? Sorry man, no vote no say so. That's how things work in the good old US of A!
Where did this insulting stereotype come from? The black-as-criminal image has been with us at least since the nineteenth century, when explicit racism portrayed African American slaves’ essential nature as ignorant and savage, in need of the “civilizing” influence of the white man.  At that time little black crime actually occurred, as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled, and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the slave owners, who acted as judge, jury, and executioner.   On average, an African American man, woman, or child was hanged, generally by a white mob, once a week, every week between 1882 and 1930, as police actively participated or stood by and condoned the murders.  Lynchings continued until the 1950s, as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like “disputing with a white man.”
Nonsense.  He was an armed Polish squatter, land-thief, terrorist, mass-murderer and rapist.  He led Irgun when they slaughtered 120 unarmed men, women and children in Deir Yassin, and when they bombed the King David hotel.  We're talking about EARTH history here, not that of whatever imaginary dimension you would apparently prefer to reside in, OK?
I see your logic -- because a white man killed people in Las Vegas, it means that Muslim terrorism should be ignored.    Brilliant.
instead of labeling restrooms for men or women which some may not "identify with" label them penis and vagina instead. there problem solved. if you have a problem with that you're just trying to stir up trouble.
"Nobody is afraid of him?"  Man, if you listen to the dems Trump is the anti-Christ and he won't only destroy this country, BUT THE WORLD!
The comment by an unknown who calls itself skinnerAK, asks: "Alcohol fueled, as usual?" Nothing in the story mentioned booze. But this person did. Which leads me to my own racist question; Are all white men child molesters who kill their prey?
Does it boil down to stupidity and lack of male parts to past presidents to uphold the immigration laws and not allow this to happen. It's well known that Anchor Babies would cause future problems someday and the people crying the blues and doing the assisting have known all along and did nothing to stop a problem before it starts. The young people now in trouble are pawns of the people supposedly trying to help as they knew all along this was coming.
Let me guess, you're a white male, and although you are frequently accused of being racist, you deny this.  Just a guess.
as for the fight itself I hope Mayweather wins big if for no other reason than to shut McGregor's foul impolite rude jerk mouth up. The man's an uncouth jerk, plain and simple lots of evidence shows and for those who say 'it's just hype, that's not the real McGregor' well anyone truly real and true to themselves would not succumb to fueling hype if it did not truly conform to who they were, now would they?
You recall one incident where a girl falsely cried rape. That does not invalidate or disprove the issues of mysogeny and rape culture in our society. You are able to post these words online, but could you look into the eyes of this terrorized and sexualized girl and accuse her of making this up? Explain the statistics that 321,500 victims over the age of 12 are raped or sexually assaulted each year in the United States. As of 1998, 17.7 million American women have been victims of rape or attempted rape. And those are just the ones that get reported. And you think that the tiny minority of people who fake it should invalidate survivors? 82% of juvenile victims are female. 90% of adult rapes are female. This is a gender issue. Men have been trained by society to act privileged and entitled over women.  She is not lying. And neither are the 17.7 million victims and survivors. She is valid and needs men and women alike to stand with her.
Your analogy fails as does your argument.  Trump did not run on the basis that he is a white man, he ran on the basis that he represents everyone.  Obama ran on the basis that he is a black man and the time had come for a black man to be President.  Obama is the racist, not me, I could care less what race a person ascribes to be.
Louis you look like a dam n fool with that man pony tail and baggy aloha shirt. C'man!!
You see how trumpf people dissappear. Hmmm. No more Conway,now Spicer. Watch as he will get boot. It's the Shell game folks. A sides how in the Bizzare Carnival. So much coming and going thru the tent. Tillerson is off in the world? Does trumof know what he's doing? You know his staff is like 45% vacant right. FLynn was an example of disorder. Trumpo got slapped in the face by him. Then ryan suck er punch trumpo with the ACA thing. PUNCH THE CLOWN IN THE BIG TOP. STOCKS UP, GOOD SIGN, BILLIONAIRES MAKING BUCKS. THE 85% white uneducated males, well they got medicare,lol.
I love bashing your guy!
Judge Gorsuch might be a man who thinks for himself and who cares about protecting his children from sexual abuse by Catholic clergy. Even though his mother was a strong Irish-American Catholic, from what I read about her, she was also very concerned that children be protected from sexual abuse. The fact that the judge was raised Catholic, and now has chosen to be a member of the Episcopal Church, makes me hope that he has learned of the ruthless tactics of the Catholic bishops in hiring lawyers that will do their bidding, so that they can continue to protect their predator clergy, and demoralize victims and their lawyers. Sincerely,   Dr Rosemary Eileen McHugh, MD, MSpir
So Alt-right excluded him and fellow Bernie Sanders supporters disavowed him-- gee, it sounds like no one wanted him, "Frank."  Man it sure sucks when you can't pigeon-hole him into your failed narrative, huh?
The Charter also says it isn't wrong to discriminate against white people or men.  An official copy should be printed on truck stop toilet paper and displayed at the House of Commons to highlight the message that "it isn't good enough to wipe your &$$ with".
No, Trudeau blew it while still at Rideau Hall at the swearing in ceremony.  He pledged allegiance to the "Queen and all her hairs."  Did we really elect a man so stupid he doesn't know what "heirs" means?  Google the video!
One guy shot up planned parenthood. One guy shot up a church. One side has been preaching the politics of if it white it ain't right.  Your feeble attempts to try and pin this on the jewish community cause Trump so idiotically did it, doesn't actually make any sense. This has been happening world wide for the past few months.  What is the motivation for the jewish communtiy, the idea that they are attacking themselves with absolutely no evidence is silly at best and neo-nazistic at worst.
OMG, unbelievable that white males like Scat here could possibly believe criticism against racism, sexism or even discussions about equality are equivalent to the hatreds meted against people of colour, Muslims, women, etc. (mostly by white males).  Pathetic #WhiteMaleTears.
---What about the boy who hugged the wrong girl at school or the Person who peed in a park/alley when they thought no-one was looking. Did you know that a rapist will usually serve a shorter sentence than the guy who peed in the park? Does that person deserve to be ridiculed the rest of his life?---  So, because legislators have yet to distinguish between clearly non-threatening violations such as public urination and friggin pedophiles, you think all of them including the pedos deserve to be free and clear of scrutiny despite that all the research indicates this is hard-wired behavior?  Clearly these differences need to be acknowledged and addressed, and sex offender lists reserved for the most dangerous criminals, but saying they all deserve to lurk undetected wherever they go because of a stupid discrepancy is exponentially increasing the stupidity.
Wow, wow, wow.  The loud-mouth who you hear in this video should have been arrested for inciting the crowd.  The idiot who was arrested broke the law if he was dealing--I'm pretty sure it's illegal to deal pot in the middle of downtown Eugene.  I moved from Eugene in August because I wanted a safer place to live (after my home being broken into as well as a couple of attempts to break in).  On my last day in town, I strolled through the city with sadness--it had been my home for 44 years & I have many fond memories.  On that beautiful sunny day I was accosted by several men, all wanting money.  When I said "sorry, no" I was called names & spit at.  Not very kind actions toward a 65-year-old woman.  Most of these creeps are "homeless" because they want to be.  They didn't lose their jobs--they never had jobs.  Who would want to hire them?  They refuse to be accountable or responsible for anything but their own selfish whims.  City Council, get your act together!
You are a misogynist.  You treat women as little tiny children unable to speak up for themselves and set boundaries as we males do routinely.  It is unfortunate for women that persons such as you who relegate them to the status of weak second-class citizens.   Gelser and Kruse are equals on the power structure.  Thus her response and interaction with him, sans your relegation to second class, would be to define limits via dialog and communication.  In your world, she as a female is a perpetual victim whose very constitution prevents her from being an equal.  You are a misogynist!
the demonization of white men has gone well beyond absurdity in western culture but I neither need nor want a white nationalist like Gavin McInnes speaking for me. If white men and their cultures were as evil as the snowflakes would have us believe, the peoples of the world wouldn't be risking their lives to come here.
We should be having referendums about a lot of crap, both truedopes and cretin and martin foisted on True Canadians. The Real Men and Women of Canada.  Both this little commie dick-tator wanna be hasn't the stones.
What the hell is this article about?  nothing.  Describing the residence of a Chinese Investory/ Business man?   give me freaking break..
Now women are giving up sex as they always had, just not getting a thing in return because they don't need it. Some try to withhold it in order to get more than sex for it, but fails miserably because there are plenty of sex starved women frequently willing to give more for it, specially if they can pretend to themselves and the world that they aren't paying for sex.  Women aren't happy with it, one because they have that itch that say sex isn't as hot if they aren't exploring the man, second because they aren't getting it easily, worst, they are having to work for it, specially because they think they could get more. Back in the day a woman was happy to fuck a guy, and if she got pregnant she was happy to have him to help her support her and his kids and to have someone to fuck for the rest of her life, and she'd be probably happy to cheat a few times too. (so would he)
' In other news tonight,   .  Alleged National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn got caught again deleting a tweet that he made up about Hillary Clinton, money laundering and sex crimes involving children.  The man's a sick and demented menace. .
Absolutely on all points. Canadians wish him removed with immediacy along with all men who wave promises in the faces of young girls along with their anatomy...and on-line to boot...which in itself shows a laughably misplaced arrogance and entitlement. Bring down he hammer today on this man.
Ah, yes. MGTOW. Every dumb "movement," trend, fashion, craze, mania, cultural progression or regression from the US does eventually make its way across the border. Because, the internet.  I've been hoping that perhaps men in the country of my youth are perhaps more moderate, more sensible, happier, and more mature than American men are. But no. Just one other way the US influences Canada negatively.
What if it's true? Dumb is dumb by any other name too.   But: If one woman called one man a bad name would that then prove there is a world conspiracy in play to humiliate and keep men down?
If we did, we wouldn't accept a single lie, but we let them lie to us, then we feign anger about something that is irrelevant??  This has nothing to do with her sex.  It has to do with he brainless performance.  If she was a man she'd be more like prime minister Zoolander.  We have no problem with her being a female. We have a problem with her being a liar, and incompetent.
Sounds like a toothless protest of the type that did not prevent his election. You know, making fun of his name, his hair, his buffoonery, and generally not taking him seriously.  This man is not a joke. He is DANGEROUS.
' ' …uh, no, ...nothing about Trump demonstrates that he might be deserving of any civility. . The man is a belligerent, childish, and ego-maniacal buffoon. . Civility? Not due in Trump's case, …the man is not deserving of any civility. .  He'd have to earn it back and there's no chance that's going to happen given his behavior. .
Once again, and again and again, a whole raft of comments from the "smart, white men" someone with the moniker "3rd gen AK" referred to on these poor Civil Comments pages as "Earth's Alpha males"  making dumbass remarks about things they know absolutely nothing about. Laughable nonsense, all of it.
What a deplorable man.
The left will try any lie, to stop themselves from owning up for their murdering ways. If they think the people who democratically put Trump in power will lay down while the left rapes the working man, I'll be laughing my azz off, while all the crap comes down. I'll sit back and enjoy watching their fairy tale world  implodes.
Then you, Rich Olson, should be on the No-Comment List.  She's NOT an airhead; she's a 71 year old who kept her head, calmly BUILT A BEAUTIFUL SHELTER BY HERSELF WITH NO FOOD for almost a week while trying to honor her loved one's memory.  If a young man had done half of this (and for no good reason at all), the coverage would be about his bravery and ingenuity and engineering skills, all while he managed to injure himself in the process and come out of it tear-stained and whining about how hungry he is, and with no mention of how a dick tax should be levied for all the times we have to bail out men for CONSTANTLY doing incredibly stupid things, putting themselves & others in grave danger.  This woman is strong, wise and created beautiful, useful things out of a scary situation that would probably leave you crying for your mommy.
Yeah, akgen, too funny man, too funny.  But it's damn true.
“Frustrated White Man”  There’s an ideology  The press has been using this ideology to justify how an idiot like Trump got voted into office.  At the end of the day, this is all Obama’s fault: after he was elected twice, Frustrated White Men everywhere could no longer count on the racist patriarchy to empower them. So they turned their frustration on other white people.  People please! This white(trash) on white(trash) crime needs to STOP. Or your country will be overtaken by women AND visible minorities, like in Canada.  To the Redoubt!
Trump has associated himself with right wing hate groups.  It's also a short walk from exploiting the resentment of white men to feeding it. Even beyond Trump how much does the GOP itself depend on the racist minority for electoral success?  The Republicans who waltzed into power with their dog whistles now are led by birther in chief who can't bring himself to criticize these racists.  There are too many well placed facts for you to cry nonsense.
Probably the same way a lot of people on these boards think the GOP reviles minorities, immigrants, women, poor people, gay people, really anyone who isn't an old white man.  Be pretty helpful if we all stopped asserting the caricatures we've drawn of others as unassailable fact.
Betcha ten bucks that many of these victimized white men also scoffed at the #MeToo protest that is going on to highlight sexual harassment. If you are the white prick who is some hateful mutation of Archie Bunker and you want the workforce to revolve around you, you deserve your feelings of discomfort.
cars are not subsidized pal they pay the taxes, and they are not privileged, they are used by every aspect from the poorest to the top , man you are ignorant
Trump is the most ignorant and least worldly President in modern history...he makes George W. look like a Rhodes scholar. A man who's too ignorant to recognize his own ignorance is now the most powerful man in the world...truly frightening.
Why does this story continually make the blatent mistake of referring to Mr. Manning as "she"?  No matter the amount of make-up or even surgery a man may undergo to appear as a female, he will remain a male.  Anyone who is under the mistaken belief that they are of the opposite gender requires psychological help, not a surgeon.
arming to protect themselves from mainly black men?
Man, you're twisted.
The difference is that the progressive left actually has actions that conflict with their public views - Ted Kennedy leaves a young woman to die while he gets to his lawyer to concoct a story to cover his sorry ass and he is hailed as the Lion of the Senate.  Clinton rapes and harasses women and he gets pass from the very progressive feminists (I believe with was Gloria Stienham who said that men should get a one rape pass - or something like that and of course lets remember the famous words of Whoopie Goldberg speaking about the icon of the celebrity left, Roman Polanski of his sodomy of a 14 year old girl who he drugged - it wasn't rape rape!)  The progressive left are hypocrites of the first order - protected by their celebrity and the media.
No, Trump is not the "classic American man."  The classic American man, in my life, was a man who worked hard to support his family, raised his kids and was loyal to his wife.  Most of the ones I knew as a kid had done their time in the service of their nation in WWII or Korea and made an honest effort to live a decent life.  Trump is a serial adulterer, draft dodger, and behaves more like a spoiled 6 year old than a man.
The photo shows two arrogant, despicable men! Disgusting actions by both!
so many abusive, angry men out here.
There's no such thing as "topless equality" since men don't have boobs.   These women are loonies.
Whites don't have to do anything to get their white privilege. No one follows you through stores. No one questions your motives. You even questioned my  motives. The GOP has become a white identity party. Most white folks voted for the GOP in the last 2 elections. Obama only got 39% of the white vote in 2012. The GOP is doing everything they can to deny minorities the right to vote, even today. It seems to me that a lot of white folks think I should be grateful to them. Where would they get that idea? I've been told that I should be grateful for slavery because I'm an American. I suppose I should be grateful that they used rape as a profit center too. You don't want to know about how much rape, robbery, and murder is done to give you your white male privilege.
I'll see if this gets past the Civil Comments and ADN editor. This is a special message for Wasilla State Rep. David Eastman. From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a longtime and regular Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author. She is white.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
How about instead of killing her innocent child, giving the woman the option to execute the guy that got her pregnant.  Do we give women these special murder rights because somehow we think they're stupid?  If anybody else kills the child, it's considered a capital crime, but if the woman kills her own offspring, that's ok?  Wicked juvenile men will keep abortion around just as long as they keep pornography around.  This enable these men to abuse women as toys, making them cheap, accessible, and exchangeable.  And the men bear no responsibility, make no commitments, and hardly bother to be considerate.  Stop killing children and start executing rapist.
What a rag of a "newspaper." Constantly promoting division and hatred against men and especially white men for some reason, I suppose for click bait and the almighty dollar, rather than true social justice. The way forward is not to make every other segment of society feel better about themselves by telling them that "if only the white man didn't.........." and that white people are scum and should now be treated as second class citizens, nudge, nudge, wink, wink, but for society to truly become colour blind, including white people and just be people without some kind of qualifying modifying verb (white, black, asian, indigenous) before the word people.
Men-tally iL is the next NK leader after this lunatic is gone.
If you think sending dick pics makes a person's mental state "questionable" (which I don't think I'd argue), then the vast majority of men have a questionable mental state and shouldn't be allowed an once of credibility.   It's just tiring how Hillary is being somehow blamed yet again for the bad behavior of yet another man; this time one she has had absolutely nothing to do with.   Meanwhile the people who hate her (and women in general) are turning a blind eye to their own candidate's violent words and actions; he's said and done horrible things and has admitted to doing them, but they'd rather vote for the person who has committed assault on multiple women than for the woman whose aide was cheated on by the husband she is divorcing for that very reason.   This is how toxic masculinity, patriarchy, and misogyny works, everyone.
yada, yada, yada, its like men deciding womens issues, straight people deciding lgbtq issues, christians deciding religious issues and healthy people deciding ill peoples issues. if it doesn't directly affect you, its none of your business, no matter what that invisible guy in the sky or the horned devil tells you.
Does Trudeau think we are all stupid?  This man is beyond delusional.
It's always amusing when people expose themselves for who they really are by relating their view  of human beings born different from the vocal majority as "misfits."  Anyone who isn't white, male, heterosexual, and can usually belt out "Jesus Loves Me," is subjected to their laser-like judgement of human diversity.    Given the chance to govern with such an attitude of inclusiveness, the U.S. under their loving guidance would soon be as strong and pure as 1939 Germany.
bunch of little wussies anyway, real men race and care for dogs. Silly little machine men
This country was founded as a white racist nation. The proof is in the original Constitution. Violence has always been at its core. What do you think the 2nd Amendment was needed for? The nation was built on ethic cleansing of the locals and race based slavery. The country has been a giant affirmative action program for people that Europe didn't need or want. We have been working on becoming "a more perfect union" ever since. As we move ever so slowly toward a merit based society, white male privilege is losing power. It is now illegal to kill black people while they are praying in church. That use to be one of the many white privileges that white men had. Lynchings are no longer considered family entertainment. There are photos. White folks invented the "race card" when they decided that being white was more important than being human. The good news is that younger people are generally less racist than their elders. In another 200 years, all lives may actually matter in this country.
So he was a man who took a chance on building a business and he failed. So what? People have been doing this for hundreds of years. Kirk Mitchell, were you drunk when you wrote this garbage???
best selection.  I was not impressed with any of the male  candidates.  Ballard is honest and tough.  If the men think she is not they will be in for a surprise.  I like the choice.  It is sad we wasted 7 years with the silly goose Kealoha.  Put merit first!
She won't get the white male vote, after bashing them for 35 years.  We don't need a liberal feminazi in the white house
A black guy spray painted "N____R",  KKK and swastikas on my house because I had a black room-mate.  When confronted he said us white folks have no sense of humour. Nope, no racism there.
http://www.bullshitexposed.com/scandinavian-socialism-debunked/  https://fee.org/articles/the-myth-of-scandinavian-socialism/  Yes, Scandanavia has moved closer to capitalism.  See the above links. Their current problem is immigration policy, allowing in vicious muslim men who are eager to rape and pillage.  Hee. Tough to have your entire world view wrecked.
That Two Toned Trump had draft deferments as a young man are irrelevant.  Was is important that a President aka Commander in Chief has the authority to put US citizens in harms way.  What person in their right mind would entrust this narcissistic sociopath with that kind of responsibility and authority?  This man should be measured on his own merits and lack of good judgement.  Addressing his viewpoint of the military: Who in their right mind calls POWS losers and disses the bereaved parents of a fallen US soldier.  Trump's own stated Viet Nam Era 'war sacrifices' were going to bed with women and dumping them because they bored him.  Had he got a STD, he probably would have put in for a Purple Heart.
Middle age white males are his target audience, no joke. It's on the front page because it bashes Trump...of course.
And one more thing, Roberts: get rid of the 6 man rotation. It was just another dumb idea you got to rest pitchers with a big divisional lead. Look at how it has played out.
Yeah man.  We are all fuckwits. So keep on robbing us.  Of our money, and our rights.  But just wait. What goes around, comes around.
When you see terrorist events in Western countries they are usually being committed by Muslim men, sometimes they are not. But remember, Muslim men are not a significant portion of the population in any Western country. They are just 4% of the population of France, 2% of the population in the United Kingdom and 1% in the United States.  They should not be committing the majority of ANY crimes.
We don't need M-103. We have a Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  BTW is it white males who are requiring some Muslim women to cover their face and relegate them to the back door and women seating area of mosques? Is it white men who are arranging marriages for some women. Insert mail order bride comment if you like.
Let me guess...a white boy that failed to take advantage of the educational and other opportunities that Canada provided to get ahead, so he now screams 'white genocide' because a white girl chooses to be with someone that did take advantage of the opportunities but just also happens to have a slightly different skin colour. In other words...a loser.
Affirmative action to match the US population?   C'mon Man!  It's gonna really be hard to find that many non-blacks (other than  some Samoans) who won't get squashed flat on their first 1st down or slammed over the top by that 6'8" black forward!  You're talking like a crazy man!
It is a tough issue.  Trump's campaign rallies are hives of violence and bigotry.  His campaign is supported by the KKK and numerous anti-immigration hate groups.  When he and his supporters embrace such racist ideals it is difficult to say that a "Students for Trump" club is much different than the "Anti-Muslim" club or a "He Man Woman Haters Club".  Trump's campaign events are closer to a hate rally than a political rally.  You have to draw the line somewhere.  Trump needs to draw the line, but he so far has refused to do so.   The voice of love needs to be louder than the voice of hate.
So? Because some men beat, rape, and otherwis their wives...we should assume ALL do?  Okay.
Hayek has the following to say, talking about Adam Smith    " .. the main point about which there can be no doubt is that (Adam) Smith's chief concern was not so much with what man might occasionally achieve when he was at his best,  but that he should have as little opportunity to do harm when he was at his worst.    It would scarcely be too much to claim that the main merit of the individualism which he and his contemporaries advocated is that it is a system where bad men can do least harm. It is a social system which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men to run it, or on all men becoming better than they are now, but which makes use of men in all their given variety  and complexity, sometimes good, sometimes bad, sometimes intelligent and more often stupid.”
Eastman is an uneducated zealot. He typifies ignorance of the Dark Ages and other benighted, repressive eras of humanity. He would be a witch burner or a man who stones women to death when their beliefs run contrary to his. Thankfully, he is not bright enough to rise above his lowly political position. Just as Miz Palin was revealed as a philosophical loon and the grande dame of idiocy, so too will Eastman ultimately be gored and meet his political demise at the hands of more smart voters than dumb ones.
Dear crooked Hillary, that's just the demons in you reacting to a man God chose (over you) to rebuild our failing country.  Seek an exorcism.
children are mostly born with male or female genitalia. that makes them boy or girl. very few have that strange condition of both. it is this perverted culture that lives to confuse the most innocent. shame on these perverts and purveyors of filth.
Three quarters of the players in the NFL are black males , 6 percent of the population are black males. 21 per cent of violent crime is done by black males. 51 per cent of murders is done by black males. Maybe all the white fans should take a knee to protest the race problem because it doesn't seem to me the police are to blame.
Many Americans, including many who claim to be "christian," worship false idols. The golden calves they worship, are wealth, celebrity, and guns. Even the mildest suggestion that limiting civilian access to guns whose purpose is to kill as many people as possible as fast as possible is seen as a violation of the 2nd amendment.  The gun lovers have been fed a false narrative about the "dangers" they face to justify the gun culture.  The reality is that the average American is in greater danger from angry white men with semi-automatic weapons than they are from immigrants (lower crime rates than native born Americans), or from terrorists. The US rate of gun deaths is many, many times greater than all other DEVELOPED nations, on a par with some central American, African and mid-east countries.   https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/upshot/compare-these-gun-death-rates-the-us-is-in-a-different-world.html http://www.businessinsider.com/death-risk-statistics-terrorism-disease-accidents-2017-1
oh that evil girl that caused her old men to be unavailable to pay her off for years of abuse.  totally destructive of the old man to go to jail  - ONCE AGAIN - IT'S THE GIRL'S FAULT.  you are consistent - ignorant as anyone could be in this day and age., but consistent in your 1960's stance .  what should have  the girl done?  what do you believe outsider?  just WHEN would it NOT be the woman's fault? and why do you hate women so much?
What a liar. Little creep behind a key board telling lies about a man who refused to be released until the others were released, and his captors made him pay. You are a little b!tch troll who lies through his teeth. How old are you to know anything about this punk
Yes, people forget the bigotries of the past - even those who were the target of the bigotry. It wouldn't surprise me if some of the bitter old men in these comments were Italian or Polish Catholics, who the WASP stock of Canada was once horrified of, bringing their illiteracy, papist ways, and families of 6 and 8 children each to decent Anglo-Protestant Canada.
Trump's a joke...  People who support this man child are so gullible.
Why shouldn't a black man be able to open carry without getting shot? After all, white intoxicated guys do it all the time.
This is a guy with a known mental illness... Not some battered women or man.
There is a difference between a person stealing axes and hatchets, assaulting a loss control employee, and then throwing those axes and hatchets at police and then charging them and probably wanting to die by suicide by cop versus a black man dying because of a simple traffic stop, or selling CD's, or running from the police and being shot in the back, etc. etc. etc. You can't blame for black people for being tired of racist b.s. and murder by cop. Turn off Fox news, open your brain a bit and maybe you'll realize not everything is black and white (no pun intended.) as much as us white folk wish it was.
Are you just another Black man who has kids all over the place…."that my baby mama, that my baby mama too, and that one too," and don't take care of any of them? Even Black women say it's true. And a drug dealer and pimp? No job? Let a woman take care of you? That's the stereotype I've heard for decades dude. How 'bout it?
Adviser: Trump hates the job, but 'doesn't want to go down in history' for resigning. Trump has been yelling at televisions and at his own staff for not making him magically successful and popular. He's tired and cranky to the extent that, according to an “adviser,” the thought of resigning has already been on his mind. We're only five months in, you know. That's it. The man is "strained" by the job and the town and the lack of gold-painted ceilings after only five sodding months in and, according to one of his own advisers, is hanging on after these first twentyish weeks not because he gives a flying damn about any of it but because he's afraid quitting would make him look like a failure.
Gay men are only sexually compatible with other men. Gay women are only sexually compatible with other women. This is a scientific fact of their biology. Gay men only have sexual complementarity with other men, etc. THIS IS A FACT! If you are going to base relationships on biological appendages, then you cannot deny consenting adults of 'committed, consenting, life long incestuous relationships' as long as the plumbing is to your personal bias. I am not advocating for this and am strictly against this, but by YOUR logic, this must also be included.
Sure we do to let everybody know what a loser he really is. And this guy is supposed to be a role model for kids. He's made enough money he better retire on some island where no one will recognize him. Nike and multinational corporation's continue to support loser athletes like him. He's done.
sure let's support a religion that discriminates against women, kills gays for gayness and wants to vaporize Jews - let's endorse the hatred and bow down to it - this religion is overall the most the tyrannical, intolerant value system known to man - hey editorial writer wonder why Canada is ripe for a populist uprising - its cuz u keep telling people that criticism is racism when it is not and for u to cherry pick single incidents as relevant proof shows how shallow ur arguments are - where was ur team when anti-semitism was rearing its ugly head at McGill or do u editorial writers at the G&M condone violence aginst a specific group - maybe we should punch a journo today - shows how limited ur thinking is but go on back to ur silo and listen for the echo to confirm ur bias - wrong on some many levels but that's the G&M Canada's answer to fake news
The mindless loyalty of Trump's base supporters and of his little band of fans here, in the face of his obvious incompetence, has more to do with their childish stubbornness and inability to admit their mistake. In their pathetic desperation for the blustery leadership of the so-called strongman who'll rescue them from their disappointing lives, they have given this bogus president a blank cheque, forgiving of his every word and act. No leader, left or right, deserves such uncritical loyalty. They seem to have him confused with Jesus.
Novick and Treat chose Motivate as their vendor for this program. Novick is a graduate of Harvard Law School. If he didn't read the agreement he should have. The point is, regardless of all his progressive, man of the people rhetoric, he is in fact full of shit. He is an ass.
Trump is a racist, …and a petty con man, …and a traitor. But back to the racist part.   That's what attracted so many of his supporters.  There is no longer any doubt that Mueller's office is investigating Trump for collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice in the Russia investigation, …it's just a matter of time now. Being rid of the racists in the White House will go a long ways to making all the other racists scurry back under their rocks where they belong.
I simply do not understand what BLM has to do with Gay Pride? The violence perpetrated against black people by the police needs to stop and be dealt with and for that I support BLM-TO, but what has that got to do with me being Gay? It isn't just Black gays and please tell me if anyone has ever heard of this, being murdered. Its every Black male who is in danger. But, I'm celebrating being Gay so where does BLM-TO fit in here?  It would be nice to know without a pile of rhetoric being thrown at me.
Man, you are a real dumb bunch.
You're pathetic Roy.  A little man hiding behind a computer screen.
There is no Pride anymore, only Shame. She is a hate filled racist and homophobe. She hates the gay white men who created Pride in the first place and is determine to steal it for her own political ends. If the thousands of gay men of Toronto stop supporting Pride she will hate them even more. All she will do is destroy it  if she stays on this path of bigotry and division.
I am so not surprised to see a woman gleefully demean the character of men. Like she's doing us a public service by sharing her "here's how I like to hate people!" point of view. Toxic, indeed. Getting SO sick of this crap.
White man kills three Latinos   Killer described as nonchalant, or showing no concern.  Trump nonchalant too,  shows no concern, keeps silent.  That silence speaks volumes.
"GOP men tend to be much more manly than the progressive Democratic men" Wich ones exactly: Lindsay "I do declare" Graham? Marco "high heels" Rubio? Aaron "Downton Abbey" Shock? Rick "rented boots" Perry?  Don't look now, but GOP men are VERY effeminate.
Do you realize how many of your silly posts are personal attacks on Donald Trump?  We get it, you don't like men who espouse a traditional image of masculinity, patriotism, and an eye for attractive women.  Just because you don't like him doesn't mean that everything he does is wrong or is a conspiracy.  It looks like snow....
This kind of adults forcing kids goes on a lot.  This time it made news because it was a sympathetic little white girl.  I taught for over thirty years and have seen coaches (football primarily)extol pain and inflict it in practices to prepare young boys for the pain they will feel in games. Talking heads even extol 'playing through the pain' and fans boo when a player will decide for himself when to sit out rather than go back in.  This is one of the few cases when being a white male in america can be a disadvantage. It's very similar to sexual abuse with adolescents.  We snicker and give light sentences to adult females having sex with underage males, but are horrified if an older man who diddles little girls and give him decades in prison.  Sexism at its most hypocritical.
No, you ignorant wretch. Too many suicides, particularly of young men, because of the constant barrage of negativity and damnation from the likes of you.
Trump be da man!
Trump is demonstrating great reserve and stability in the face of the insane attacks on him like Robinson's.  The completely false portrayal of Trump's response to Charlottesville presented by the media would drive a man lessor than Trump to extremes.  But he absorbs the nonsense.  The liberal dogs who bite at his heels every step he takes are hurting the country deeply.  Time to lay off the man and focus on issues.  End extremism.  Protest for single-payer nationalized health care.  End military adventurism.  Forget the wall and just patrol the border.  Lot's of issues to focus on.  Drive him from office and you get Pence who is apparently more of a hard core Republican, i.e. small government, low taxes, etc.  You liberals will be very unhappy when you are stuck with Pence.  Imagine how bored you'd all be.  No more Russian bromance, No more supporting the Nazis.  No more groping to tsk tsk about.  Life without Trump would be so boring you libbers would wither.
Allowing perverted young males posing as transgenders to have access to female bathrooms will also have "consequences".  Rapes or suicides, what's your choice?
You obviously know absolutely nothing about salesmanship.  Trump is a salesman.  Would you ever buy something from the cartoon character you have created in your mind and call Donnie Moscow?  How did this guy become a billionaire if he was your fiction?     No one would make multimillion dollar deals with your fantasy man.  Your fixation with "white dudes" borders on racist homosexuality.  Keep it in check.
Oh my God, man. You want to give the state the authority to execute sociopaths? First, as a Catholic state-sanctioned execution is off the table (no matter what Catholic death penalty enthusiasts say). Second, it's dangerous to give the state that power. Third, neuroscience may yet develop treatment for dangerous sociopaths.  I'm genuinely shocked you proposed such a thing.
garycrum:    Nice post and I agree with you.  Kitz and his" Strumpet friend with privileges",  Hayes need to isolate themselves on their Marijuana Farm and stay completely out of Politics or any association with it.    I thought Kitz was a Intelligent Man up until he became involved with Hayes.  Kitz should be totally ashamed of himself for letting this woman suck(sorry for the pun), and screw(sorry for the pun), up his career and drag him  down to the bottom of the PIT.  As many Intelligent people state," Kitz and Hayes, quit digging, you have reached the bottom of the hole"................  Read the Sign:  DENIAL at Work Here................
Well if they pass this law grown men will be in the bathroom w your granddaughter because the law forces them too. They are men (with vaginas) that like girls.
White male, and your assumption is incorrect and rather insulting as well, as it should be obvious that what I wrote is intended to help as many as possible, and not perpetuate the cycle of death and rape inherent in the present situation.  As for the white privilege nonsense, spare me.  I'm not going to be unpacking invisible knapsacks any time soon.
He's a misogynist who thinks women are weaker than men and need to be given special privileges to compete with men.
I ask you about labour's socialist policy and you give me a diatribe about the Austrian school. British Labour to day hate the lower class worker/men. Plus you quote Krugman! What the hell do these two have to do with policy this election? You have a grasshopper mind that flies all over the place when cornered and a simple truth is asked. Krugman's Nobel prize means zero, for 8 years of Obama he defended QE and poo pooed the idea of a huge debt being a problem. Early Jan this year he questioned the correctness of a high debt, wonder why, confused or Lefty BS? In 1987 Kinnock's Labour said: 'this election faces the British people with choices more sharp than at any time in the past 50 years'. Corbyn 2017: 'what makes this election different is that the choice is starker than ever before.' Wonder why they got trashed both times? The British voter (most) have good BS detectors.  Both times it was un-loved women doing the trashing, wonder why? Tell Labour to jump into the 21st era.
Another myopic decision made by the worlds most insufferable man-child. Impeach and jail this treasonous Russian puppet.
The men's rights movement is as pathetic as the flat earth movement.  Colleges and universities have been at the administrative level, neglecting or even punishing rape victims.  No widely publicized accused rapist has been shown to be a victim. The Duke lacrosse team is not a victim here, backlash has college students afraid to report rapes, yet men's rights advocates see themselves as the victim.
Just checked-out the web site: "newemangalization" the author referred to. Yes "new - MAN - gelization". This is so ridiculous, sexist and retrogressive that it would be funny if it weren't so insulting.  It is something that NCR should shun and not render a shred of dignity.  "There is a strong emphasis on Catholic men asserting leadership in their famillies...."; "sports luminaries".  "They are told there are dangerous cultural crosscurrents  out there, threats to the family that Catholic men need to oppose... (feminism???? wink, wink) Cardinal Burke would be pleased.
Now its time for liberal trolls to start tearing down a decent man.
heck no! you must be male. being female, i do not want you in my locker room/changing room/bathroom/shower. are you crazy? you liberals are certainly sounding more and more that way. yay, pepper spray!
Allan, killing more female fetuses than male fetuses? do you mean this is not equality for females?
But what about the other data from these 10,000 cases?   How many were alcohol involved? How many were friends or lovers already? \  The fact is 1 in 100 people are psychopaths but not that many will act on it. 1 in 100 women are psychopaths too, not just men. Women can hide their metal issues also borderline cases. These women will lie and claim they were raped as revenge.  ^  Must watch "Six Subtle Gateways to Borderline Hell "  ^  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iihsbrwqZLU
He never served any time for his two murders.  Horrible man.
As much as you loons just wet dream about this being Antifa, it was a white guy with guns. Period. LV has more camera's than people, don't you think that one of those thousands of camera's would have caught something like that? Common sense man. It seems lacking from a majority of the gun totting coward crowd. And furthormore, as a CSU grad, I found this article important and touching, and the DenverPost has been reporting on the massacre. Now, maybe it's not the youtube video stories that you are looking at, but that's the biggest difference between professional journalism and someone sitting in their basement making a youtube video... and suckers like you eating it up.
"Jeremy Christian allegedly stabbed two men to death and seriously injured a third amid what witnesses called an anti-Muslim tirade on a commuter train."  What's the difference between this guy and the guy that shouts "Allahu Akbar" as 4 ISIS inspired terrorists (pro-Muslim group) drive a truck over pedestrians killing 7 (some by stabbing) and put 48 more in hospital, 28 in critical condition?   The difference is Christian is insane & London is not Portland.
Meanwhile, *male* genital mutilation remains widespread, and hordes of hypocrites insist that fundamentally identical things are somehow not the same at all.
Yes but we are talking about a man who praised a brutal dictator on the international stage, the fool still thinks we live in the 70s!!!  His credibility is free falling.
If a white community had a problem with white meth heads killing, stealing and intimidating the residents, guess what, they would get the attention of the police.  If Asians were doing the same, they would get it.  You're complaining that police are tackling the problem of blacks and hispanics committing crime in organized street gangs?  You condone this behavior?  Unarmed black men are killed by police officers in .001 of all encounters, so your theory of them hunting down unarmed black men is null and void.  Paid leave is paid for an investigation, if that officer is found culpable, he is fired.  Why punish an officer in a righteous encounter and response?  Show me a video that hasn't resulted in exoneration or firing?  There - I answered.
Trump's boasting of grabbing a woman's pussy without her permission is not locker room bragging. To call it that is to denigrate women, men, and locker room talk. He was the presidential candidate,. but given the alternative of Hillary, people minimized his behavior and the women who confirmed his sexual assaults. As Meleana said, "boy talk" from a presidential candidate.  You second assertion that we assume Christians agree with everything a politician does is not correct. We know Christians are generally not single issue voters, but many ARE Right to Life Voters. When Trump said a woman who gets an abortion must be punished, he got the Right to Life vote.  And no, they should not have voted for Hillary either. All I would ask is that they admit they are not so pious as they profess (but then deny because they are "humble before God). Trump is a narcissist who even complained that he got Person of the Year instead of Man of the Year. Winning for him is empty because he beat losers.
Step away from fiction for a sec, and consider something that's real: Man and woman agree, "hey, we're dating, let's have some consensual sex." "okay?" "okay."  "Hey, so we agree we don't want kids [yet]."  Yesses all around. Guy asks, "so you pro-choice?", she says yes. Later, she gets pregnant, and tells him she wants to keep it.  Law says he's obliged to pay child support for a child he didn't want, conceived unintentionally by a woman who reneged on her word that  a) she didn't want to become a mom, and b) also concurred about being pro-choice.  Effectively, she stole his sperm and used that sperm to extort him for money.  If you can find the man's reproductive rights in this picture, please let the rest of us know.  (Hint, no Margaret Atwood book is required to answer).
$100 dollars says it was a black male that killed them. A pointless murder in a park. hmmmm. Odds are far in my favor. Just sayin.
Had you taken 10 seconds to read the article in the Aspen Newspaper, or even my reply to Karl Sandin, (before you offered your zero cents worth) you would have seen that the police officer DID try to help them get to a different place where they COULD legally cook the food.  "Fabrocini said he tries to be sympathetic to people's situations and even suggested a spot where the men might be able to finish cooking the food. The men were not arrested or cited, he said."  So much for another ignorant opinion.
"TV ads,guy is an idiot,woman is smart and stable." From my observation on modern sitcoms now even the family 8 year old daughter (it is NEVER the son) is smarter than the father and has to teach him about life, not the other way around. It is the reason that I mostly refuse to watch sitcoms anymore.
Hmm. So, do you message women you don't find attractive on dating sites? Would you want to marry a woman you're not physically attracted to?  Funny how the idea of men being "visual creatures" is simply taken for granted. It is what it is.But how dare women want to date men they're physically attracted to. Who the heck do they think they are?
Racist much up here in Alaska?  thehighway wrote: “This just shows how big of a joke blacklivesmatters is. Where is their support now? No outrage, no protests? The police just killed a man… Hello… Oh yeah BLM is a joke and doesn’t care if anyone else except black people guilty or not are killed by police. A black KKK all for the destruction of police offices. If BLM were truly a just cause there would be supporters at the scene wearing their oh so special t-shirts…”  So can you, “thehighway,” explain in your next comment why police nation wide try to confiscate videos made of what they have done, or why police  routinely harass photographers and steal memory cards from peoples cameras?  WTF does BLM have to do with any of that? Educate yourself or you will remain a fool. Also, why do POs lie so often when they are deposed (frequently loosing their jobs for purjury)? Why don’t POs records follow them around when they are fired for cause? Give me a break and head south ASAP “highway man.
While NCR correctly promotes a dialogue on sexual issues, the laity have moved on. To admit of a single change in its current interpretation of sex is to cause its house of cards to tumble.  An issue near and dear to celibate men only. No women, even celibate, have a seat at the table. There is no table only a throne for pronouncements.  "If bishops like Paprocki were more vocal about their opposition to masturbation ..." This one issue would cause the house of cards to tumble.  It is still a mortal sin to masturbate. The RCC isn't even going to reduce it to a venial sin.  A male who needs to give a sperm sample for a medical evaluation commits a mortal sin. A one way ticket to hell!  "Every sperm is sacred."  Same-sex marriage will not be accepted, especially between  males, because sperm is not deposited in the proper receptacle .
Mr. Ritz is a rude and uncouth man. He won't be missed.
It would be plagiarism if Sid took credit for Tom Burke's writing  What was Sid writing about? He was calling the President a big fat liar. He listed his sources and almost dared you to prove him wrong. All you could say was  "this man hates others". I can fill this comment with all the lies and hate spewed forth by Donald Trump. So is Donald Trump a liar? . Is Donald Trump an unrepentant sinner. I believe you are a serious Christian and a Christian supporting Trump. Is Donald Trump a repentant sinner? He lies again and again and is unapologetic, he has committed adultery at least twice that we know of and shows no remorse, molested women and is shameless, demeans women over and over again with no apologies, is he unrepentant; remorseless, unashamed,shameless, unapologetic! I side with Sid. . A repentant sinner would go and sin no more, “See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you”  . Donald Trump is a liar and a unrepentant sinner. or prove him wrong.
It is WILDLY AMUSING that the columnist praises the young woman for HER COURAGE (fair enough there, she boldly wrote a striking piece that struck a chord)...  ... but the best that the columnist HIMSELF can muster, in the area of courage, is this feeble, anemic, laughable and pathetic diversion from reality:  "I know there are a lot of reasons (Vancouver house) prices are so high: land costs for one. And of course there's supply. That's all developers ever talk about: if there were more condo towers, prices would come down."  HELLO?  SERIOUSLY, MAN, HELLO?  Look, man, the reason Vancouver house prices ARE SO HIGH is because SO MUCH OVERSEAS MONEY HAS BEEN FLOODING INTO THE PLACE in recent decades EN MASSE!  How ON EARTH can a columnist write in this area without stating that plain fact front and center?  Seriously, man, how?
"Working man"? How about working people? Maybe if all these companies from the lower 48 stopped bringing most if not all of their people from TX and LA up to AK instead of hiring Alaskans...(the white/black/asian/etc. people who actually work that is) then maybe our economy would be better. Am I racist? No I am not... it is not secret that native corps take and take whatever they are handed by the fed and state governments...AND THEY CONTINUE TO PAY NOTHING FOR ALL THE SERVICES THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF... ever been to a native corp office?...they do nothing, but get paid for "working"...been their twice...both times a joke! Seems like they are all in a fog... always have their hands out though! Isn't that Native Land Deal already paid for dearly? Seems like we are still paying for that... am I wrong? Nope! Do some research... how many grants from the feds does one actually need when making millions in profits! How pathetic! Pay for your own shit!
If white males are so sexist, how did Margret Thatcher, PM of England get elected?  If I recall, she got elected because she had a history of doing what she said she would do, not because she carried a ladies purse.
Trump is an unhealthy 70 year old man. Did anyone actually expect him to modify his behavior? If you want to see the future Trump simply look at his past. He has amply demonstrated that he is an  entitled, ill-educated, ill-informed, bigot whose only concern is catering to his insecurities. Get used to it.
"Simply, the word “sucks” abuses those who perform “fellatio” by referring to them as “contemptible” people. It is extremely misogynistic and homophobic, yet both men and women use it."  According to my research, both males and females perform  “fellatio" and on both genders.  And have for at least five or six thousand years.    I recently saw a mural in Pompeii that advertised the availability of the service in a business establishment of the time.   That was only a couple thousand years ago, (79 years after the death of Christ mentioned in this Letter) but it wasn't a new concept even then.  Sylwester needs to worry about his own "evil intentions, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander” and let the rest of the society muddle through.
Donald Trump has been in a joke for as long as I can remember.  A Silver Spooned narcissist who back in the 1980s was obviously a used car salesman and a con man.  Since, he's only proven it.  He's a man who's laughed at and distrusted in business circles.    He's no leader, just a smug authoritarian.
You are well read?   Yet you had no idea who Larry Elder is and he has a nationally syndicated talk show.  Myopic is a better term for you.  You clearly stated that you judge by whats inside, not skin color.  And here are two black men who have contributed much to society, yet you judge them to be bad.  Clearly you are not judging them by what is inside them.  So yes, a liar.  You are lying about how you judge people.  And if you are as open minded as you claim, have you ever voted for a Republican?  Are there any conservative ideals that you agree with?  Usually people who make the claims you are making are just covering for the fact that they are the complete opposite of what they claim.  Just like when people say "I'm not a racist person, but ....", those people are quite racist.  And I don't hate you at all.  I'm just pointing out what a hypocrite you are.
Married priests are a no brainer, these men are already educated, ordained and ready to go. The deranged hierarchs that run the Catholic Church are amazing.....if you rape dozens of 8 year old kids you can say mass for the rest of your life.....if you marry a woman you are banned from celebrating the Eucharist. How many more parishes will have to be closed before the laity stand up to these ignorant leaders.
All of us are treated differently....some because of skin colour....some because of ethnic sounding names....some because of age....some because of visible affluence. It is the way it is in life.  Most people treat police officers with respect, or at least cooperation.  Black culture (hip hop etc) treat police as scum who deserve to be shot. Perhaps black fathers should be present in the home and set positive examples for their black sons....or perhaps young black women shouldn't get pregnant by men who are unreliable at best.  Seems obvious to me.
No, it shouldn't be debated. Let's debate how a man gets zero blame or shame for impregnating a woman and rarely pays even a fraction of the upkeep for his offspring if he doesn't want to, and how his vasectomy is covered, as is his penis hardening medication and contraptions, but for women, not so much.
The judge knows that this former investment advisor, arrested while driving his 2012 Lexus, whose charges include methamphetamine, heroin and cocaine, who is also under investigation by the SEC, and who has 20 firearms won't skip? How about if he were a black man, with no job, driving a 2000 Lexus or a Mexican in a Ford Tempo? No flight risk?
Apparently your read well, but understanding is certainly not one of your strong points!!  Never challenge you or your family the way you have mine, with your continued "little man" hateful rhetoric!! Tried to point out there's plenty of bad, worthless citizens to go around, but your clueless butt is always blaming the other side, while giving your side of anarchists, environ terrorists, Islamist, black thugs, etc, a complete pass and still going after ole whitey.  Well here's a FACT hateful:  White supremacist, skin heads, etc, aren't attacking innocent citizens, burning, looting, attacking police, but racist blacks, snowflake college liberals, radical Muslims, paid agitators are; while the so-called leaders of the racist Dems/DNaziC stand silently by, cheering them on.  With citizens like you still running your hateful mouths about whites! Don't accuse my party of the KKK, Jim Crow laws, lynching, the problems in cities like Chicago, DC, etc, that lies with liberals. Your kind!
So adding "too" will make the concept more acceptable? If I say "I have an idea!' does it mean that I think you have no imagination or that I'm smarter than you? The nexus is, the phrase Black Lives Matter was coined because it appears as though there are some who think otherwise. Those who wish to play semantics can hang on to an imagined slight or oversight. In the meantime, we watch the latest videos of  black men being shot...
A co-worker of mine attended the rally.  He told a Trump supporter he was there just because he was curious and he was voting for Sanders and the man immediately started shouting and calling him lazy.  (He is working full time and going to school).  My friend then witnessed a group of African American protesters being called the n word repeatedly.  He also saw a Trump supporter with his grand daughter in tow, yelling at a woman protester and calling her a cunt. Get your blinders off.  The blatant racism and sexism displayed by Trump and his supporter is just plain wrong.  You should be ashamed that you can't see that that is a problem.  Race-baiting, degrading women, and name calling  by Trump has attracted jerks who seem to think that is OK.  It's really easy to just go along with the bully while he tears down others around him.  He is unstable, un-presidential, and manipulating people. He is a spoiled billionaire, narcissist, who plays on people's fears and prejudices.
Indeed.  Hating everyone who is NOT a white, american, hetero, male who happened to be born in the US isn't hateful at all.  Rather, it is when you are not filled with such hatred that is the true racism and hatred.  Always a fan of the "I couldn't possibly be a racist, I totally know minorities..." paradigm.  Well done.
Neo-CONservatism resurrecting and revealing the true nature of the Republican Terrorist Party in all of its forms, nationally and locally.  The Republican national nominating system offered a group of white men competing to represent the values of Old South christian fundamentalism in all of its racist, bigoted, misogynist evils.  Each trying to cater to the White Supremacists and religious patriarchy idolators still infecting the nation since the Civil War and Segregation eras.  The Trump "winning" despite the worst female hatred ever seen in a candidate released the hounds of racist bigotry, coupled with Corporate Media slavering, salacious broadcasting, to make it all acceptable not only in private, but throughout the public discourse.  Every insane White Supremacist idiocy joined with religious anti-human dogma became acceptable.  Now, the ultimate Alaskan purveyor of it all is elected and allowed to fill the media and government with traitorous actions and language.  Disgusting.
Hillary Clinton: not a terrorist but the #1 choice OF terrorists, Libyan rebels, Iranian Mullahs, ISIS, Big Finance, Big Pharma, Big government and the Political Class, BLM (proven racists), illegal immigrants, and of course the anti-white/male ambiguously guilty self-loathing liberals.
God is bisexual, eh? Both male and female. I guess that solves my question about sex.  As for Jesus, we're in agreement. Joseph was a cuckold and Mary was an adulteress.  Back to God's gender for a moment: Adam was created in God's likeness, not Mary. I think God was considered a "he." Certainly, but Church of Rome authority he was and that's the original font of Christian knowledge.  So, God's a guy with no woman around for eternity. That would explain a lot.
Excellent article. Women have become nearly completely useless while they actively try to destroy the very men who built society and and protect them from death only to receive nothing but ridicule in return. Men should let women learn a lesson and let them save themselves. I bet in a year a hollywood movie will come out that will have a lead actress saving men in herricane Harvey. Women are ungrateful and become a detriment to society.
Quran (7:80-84) - "...For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)".  So the most intolerant and easily influenced followers of Islam feel that they have a duty to make that happen.  And the others ... are not sure.   Of course the Bible has a similar verse, but the New Testament then has a better message to love your neighbor and to love God.  And that helps considerably, for most people. Muslims are a greater danger to gay people than Christians are.  I stand with our gay brothers and sister in solidarity against Muslim terrorists.
The globe only rag I know of that's on their kness for trudope. Time we dump this useless rag. It might be okay if NK can hit  Toronto or anything in that useless welfare Eastern Canada, then the real men in the West will clean up the mess. Just a lot less scum  to support.
If the shooter was a Muslim man, then Donald Trump would call him a terrorist and a ban on Muslim immigration. If the shooter was a Hispanic man, then Trump would call him a terrorist thug and a crackdown on illegal immigration. If the shooter was Asian, then he would be a criminal terrorist and a crackdown on Triads. If the shooter was black, then there would be a crackdown on gang members. If the shooter voted for Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, then he would be a political terrorist and a member of the Antifa.  Since the shooter was a white Christian male who taught bible school and an ex-member of the Air Force, he is a mentally ill man who needed help. No need for gun control.
This article shows how most older, uneducated, white men in Merica ARE the problem!!! WHAT A LOSER  By the way everybody should read the third line in the real national anthem not the one that said in school and you will see that it's all about slavery you racist, loser,  old white man! Merica land of the stupid!
I FOUND HIM.  The only person or thing this whining bitch has not blamed is the man in the moon.
"You are basing your opinion on a small pool of evidence and then extending it out to all law enforcement." Nope, never said all law enforcement in fact I said, " I have met far more professional and respectful LOE's than the playground bully type, then again I am a white male so I have that in my favor. Statistically it is true as well, that most cops aren't the "bad apples".. which is the exact opposite of what you asserted.  "And yes, I was LEO and then went to law school. What training would you suggest I am lacking?" That's my point, if you are a LEO and your training and the way in which you read the law makes you believe that police shootings are always justified, then your training fails you as well the people you serve.   Police must be held to a higher standard. LEOs former or current who deny there is a systemic problem are just as responsible for the mistrust of law enforcement as are the "bad apples" that keep getting away with murder.
I am tired of cowards. Cory Gardener is "studying" it because he doesn't have the balls to tell people that he , of course, intends to vote for it. He needs to man up and take a public stand,if he is not craven.
You're a crazy lady/man/person whatever. You're just plain crazy.
Why is Donald so concerned with what the Russian's think? He needs to know the entire world is laughing at him. The Russian's and everyone else find it amusing how Donald pushes his nose around Europe, and how this pathetic little man is crumbling..
Male genitalia are weapons of rape!!!!
The men can see the park while peeing in the urinals the women's bathroom is on the other side so people saying this may be a feature are ridiculous
Nonsense....... The Republican party needs many more good men........  All 18 candidates last year were pathetic
Disgusting anti-Alberta bigotry and generalizations.  Even more disgusting is the fact that you have attracted a positive reaction.  No doubt you spread this hatred in your water cooler conversations, tossing off those type of bigoted statements casually.  You remind me of a lady from Ontario who was a guest in my home a decade or so back - she had just recently moved to Alberta for work. She oh-so-casually mentioned that her Ontario friends had warned her that in Alberta she was to expect "big trucks and small minds". And she mentioned this to my face, in my house, completely oblivious to the fact that she was expressing her bigotry openly and without a hint of shame to a man whose great grandfather had homesteaded in Alberta in the 1800's. Not even a hint of shame.  I was stunned into silence then.. No longer however. Shame on YOU.
It's fun to joke about but don't kid yourself.  We are in the middle of a culture war and the left have shown their true colors,  Bernie red, and have stolen the minds of our youth.  AntiFa sealed the deal in the left's conversion from Marxist to Communist beliefs and violent tactics.  It will only get worse from here on out.  They will not be happy until the "white man" is punished for what they feel are crimes committed by our ancestors towards their own.  The victim culture created by our race-baiting former POTUS was done on purpose.  The red seed has been watered with hate and the tree of liberty is now wilting.
.  Move on Ladies and Gentlemen,  nothing to see here.  Larry Smith is an idiot of mammoth/biblical proportions, whenever his name is mentioned, better move on in the name of sanity, intelligence and integrity.  Larry Smith never had any of these qualities/attributes and he is not about to acquire them at this time, now is he?  .
'Those white men'  'should be humiliated'. Who's the racist now?   Sounds like you want revenge?  You my friend or no better than they are.
If ever there was proof that Donald Trump is the poster boy of ISIL and Jihad, this is it. Already Islamic terror organizations are dancing with glee because Trump has handed them their raison d'etre on a platter. What a stupid asinine thing to do? Of course, the move to ban people from Islamic countries, the brain-child of the physically  repulsive S. Bannon, publisher of Briebart, a racist and antisemitic rag,who has been furtively moved to the American National Security Committee  is right out of Moscow Rules.   We can expect an increase in terrorist activities thanks to this horrible little man. Trump is not qualified and he even doesn't have nice hair.
To  - Stupidity-the_final_frontier  the population of USA is predominantly white so of course there will be more crimes buy White American Male  than  males from Middle east for example
christ the guy lets a honest and vulnerable side of himself out, then predictably impulsive judgmental hypocrites throw imaginary accusations that they probably need to deal with themselves. Buck is a rare kind who has more sincerity than any of you best guess shit talkers here. he dares to take honest looks at himself and still keeps fans informed while doing it. thats fuckin guts you aint ever gonna have boy
You can't be serious . As I've mentioned in another reply in this section I'm all against deadbeat dads . I even pointed out how Alaska needs to go to the system many states use of if a dad won't pay , or is behind , they go to jail.   A man knocks a woman up , of course he is responsible to pay until the child in 18 . In some states he has to pay until the child finishes college.   My point is , if women really controlled they're body , they wouldn't get PG and wouldn't do what it takes to get PG unless they had protection.  Sure , a man should use protection as well , but the buck stops with the woman. She alone can decide if she wants to get PG or if she wants to kill an innocent nearly born baby. Except in the case of rape. Rapists should be executed . If Planned Parenthood is all women have concerning health care---they are in deep trouble . IF PP really cared about women , they'd stop doing abortions and over night the conflict would be gone towards the use of taxpayer money.
The CPC picked a loser as a leader. Harper 2.0. What is his plan? Throw black men in jail for weed, kiss Trump's ass, pull the plug on grandma?????? What young person is going to volunteer for these the CPC? Their base is older then dirt!!!!
haha, he wasn't even very close.  Man her mind is screwed up.
Tell that to the Islamists who pray five times a day.  Tell that to the sex fiends who are teaching Grade 3 students homosexuality and gender identity  What kind of men and boys will these students be to women when they have no "SELF CONTROL".
An intelligent, educational review of the blight of fundamentalist christianity on this nation.  For additonal history and information on the entire mythological basis for the Jesus Christ/Christianity lie read, Man Made God by Barbara G. Walker.  An intensely researched, documented, footnoted revelation of the greatest lie and ultimate system of lies ever perpetrated on the world's humanity.  Jesus never existed and the creation of Chrisitanity was done by a 2nd Century A.D. Pope in collusion with a Roman Emperor to get rid of all of the pagan gods to bring all under better control under one god.  The miracle and tales were gleaned from previous religions to be applied to the Jesus Christ character.  None of it is true.  Everything coming out of the mouths of preachers, priests, bishops, popes is based on an absolute lie.  The patriarchal establishment of men superior to women and ruling over them isn't found in history until One God religions were created.  All by Men.
I'll take the twit who tweats over the boy who wets his bed daily any day of the week  That's the difference between you and me. I'm a man and you.... Well who knows
What a bitter racist. Do you ever make a comment that does not have "White Men" in it. Sorry you were not born a White Man but you will just have to live with being Part White Man. Change your name to The Mighty Racist.
This woman is like that idiot dad...  now an idiot mom.  Quit politicizing your son's death you fool.  Dems will chew you and spit you out like they did with Weinstein..
The Lesbian commenting above is a perfect example.  They care only about themselves - no need to read the US Constitution nor accept that many of us are sickened by their actions.  A man showering in the same locker room at a pool where women and girls go to the bath room and shower??   Sick.  Call the police - there's a pervert who needs to be arrested.  Claiming that he is a she makes him a mentally ill pervert.
Comparing our Good American president to these spoiled black athletes is wrong, just as they are.   60 years of programs to raise the level of life for the black race in America, and what did it accomplish?  More crime, more fatherless children, and more demands.  'affirmative action' 'The Black Caucus" 'Black Miss America' 'quotas for black hiring'  'extra credit on SAT scores for black students" 'quotas for contracts given black contractors'  the list goes on and on, and they are 'protesting' once again.    Ask them this 'what do you want?'  With all I've listed,  it's never enough.  Do they want the police too 'look the other way' when 6% of the population (black males) are doing crime?  When 6% of the population makes up over half of the prison population?  It's what and who they are, not what they imagine.
Well, Rivers, let's take a looks at the connections here.  The horrors of Auschwitz were perpetrated by a powerful nation (Germany) against a minority people (Jews). The proper echo of that basic pattern (tyranny of the majority against a minority) in modern US politics is the Trump administration determination to remove/prevent entrance to specified ethnic/religious minorities.   But this moron appears to want to associate his group (white America?) with the persecuted minority, implying that the powerful nations perpetrating the atrocity is Islam? Mexico?   It's not just offensive to use images of sacred memories for political purposes, the message itself if inverted, perverted, profoundly anti-intellectual.   How do men like this get elected to the US congress...should the world tremble?
Just pointing out the hypocrisy of your position.  "All his parents did was be related to a very brave man"  You assign responsibility for children's poor behavior and upbringing and give credit in those situations, but when they instill values that you espouse and their child becomes a "brave" and "honorable" man, joins the military to serve and defend the morals instilled in him by his parents, they have nothing to do with it.  You are a class A denigrate.
I am the Joe Scarborough of the ADN comments section! Except I have not entered into a Clintonian power partnership where each of me and Mika Brezinski could achieve more power by being "together" than separate. She is the Hillary to my Bill. (They set the standard after all). Joe and Mika still have sex as I understand it - and it has a lot to do with their political arguments! So let me give you an opinion coming from a pussy-whipped beta male being dominated by an alpha female! Watch Out!
That guy sure doesn't get tired of screwing the little man, does, he.
The guy's a jerk.
The war on people's choices and constraints continues. For decades men have been bashed, and paraded around as patriarchal totalitarian sexist fascist pigs, (and otherwise ignored in terms of failures that need addressing) but now we're "needed" to play White Knight in order to get their agenda, based on deceptive stats at best, realized?  I think the kind answer would be "eat my shorts".
With that said, Fall Kabib, here's more: From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.  "In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."   Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.  Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.
The big difference is the other two men were guilty of their peccadilloes while POTUS and IN the white house.Trump was talking about ten years ago while in show biz.  Where sleeping your way to the top on the casting couch is common, well known and acceptable behavior.  Getting a blow job by an intern in the OVAL Office is NOT. Further he DIDNT say he did grab  them, he said you COULD  grab them and they wouldn't mind, if you want to split hairs.
"So let me get this straight ..." She just thinks men shouldn't be masculine. She thinks they should be whatever women want them to be which in her case seems to be a woman, with male genitalia. In fact that seems to be exactly what most feminists want. They get there by deciding that the way they are is what it means to be human and anything else is there not really human and is defacto a problem. They are the ultimate xenophobes.
White Privilege has been earned.  Black Men represent 3% of the population yet commit 52% of the homicides,  Black men are FORTY TIMES more likely to commit a violent crime than white men. Those are FACTS not fluffed up heartfelt opinions. And I can't wait to see how many of you snowflakes get your panties in a bunch and accuse me of racism.
You're wrong.    You have MORE of a chance of being killed by a mentally ill or angry white guy with a gun.  Exponentially more.
Read little lefty cry baby.  Lefty Checklist Let the criminals out. Let illegals in. Mainstream media 100% gospel. Let boys in the girls bathrooms. Condemn police officers. Don't care about the veterans. Eradicate history if offensive. Believe Healthcare is a Constitutional right. Kill the unborn-Stomp on and burn the American flag. Accept barbarity in the name of Islam- hugs,love and no borders will stop terrorism. Protect the Sanctuary cities. Black lives only matter. Coddle the lazy. Encourage hate crimes.  Call for the assassination of our president, talk of overthrowing our government. Burn businesses, attack innocent bystanders, destroy City property, call for, and try to incite a civil war. Refuse freedom of speech on others, while demanding their own political and government obstructionists.
Seriously? A guy has to apologize for not being black or trans?  These are weird times indeed.
So are you suggesting that the global child abuse scandal that the Catholic church is still dealing with was because non-believers chose to become priests, in order to gain access to children? That is patently ridiculous. These were men (supposedly of god) who leveraged their positions of trust to abuse kids all over the world - there's never been a scandal of this size in any other institution. And to top it off, the church covered it up for years - which makes it even more offensive.  What about the Magdalene Laundries in Ireland? Yet another horrible abuse scandal conducted in the name of catholicism. Moreover, non-believers don't blow themselves up in the name of anything, in order to further an agenda of any kind, if only because we know we only have one life to live.  And I didn't even raise the issue of the horrible crimes committed in the name of Christ by the Crusades and the Inquisition.
Apparently you haven't read Kon Man's censorious remarks to other commentators. I was just feeding him back his own, hypocritically self-righteous words.
I picked up a few likes on my original comment. The majority were from women. Since there are now more women exercising their right to vote than men I'd say the gun rights folks have their work cut out for them. It is the newly enfranchised women voters (1920 for white women,1965 for all women) who will decide what we do about our gun problem. Maybe women can see the senselessly killed people more clearly than the pictures of the latest handgun at Cosco. Many probably know the mother of someone shot dead. And those that know their history remember how Mothers Against Drunk Driving took on the booze lobby, won and transformed America's previous dumb behavior permanently. I think women, like your mother, sister, aunt, daughter and wife, are the ones you need to convince that the status quo with American guns is just fine. Good luck.....
Don't even bring up Tory. The man can't have a thought unless it's written out for him. All he does is smile for the camera and hand out platitudes all day. He's useless and pathetic - which is just how we like them here.
It's obvious  that the man hates pussy, lol, I guess everyone has the right to not like something, but when you go into someone else's Place, and grab there pussy they love so much and then grab there pussy right in front of them!!, and then beat it up real bad, he must be a real bad man!!!!!!
I can get behind what you're saying. But our society is obsessed with crying for equality. Same kind of example happens when an older male teacher statutorily rapes a younger girl but an older female teacher seduces a younger boy. The hipocrisy of crying for equality when you really mean special privileges
"Woman just want two hours of peace. Which, as many women know, is practically impossible" Wow, my wife and I just read your article and we are both embarrassed for you. Must be tough for you being a woman with all of these wretched men around. Get some help.
That's not true.   If a man comes into a women's bathroom, we most definitely can kick him out and report it.   If he was a transgendered person who was acting, dressing, and LIVING THEIR LIFE as a woman, he could then go in to and use the women's restroom.    Do you see the blaring difference now?
What are you talking about good girls getting demonized by good guys? Are women just randomly making up stuff to be worried about? Fact is, women are more vulnerable than men. If women walk alone and get attacked, that doesn't reflect on good men, that reflects on many men that prey of females. When was the last time a man said he was scared to walk on a secluded trail because he was afraid of some woman waiting to rape him?
I find this civil comment thing to be the most ridiculous muzzle, put on the users of this site by an industry that wholly believes in incivility in the interest of ratings. A black officer killed a white man last week but we won't heart about that. Flip the script and it will literally be the only thing we will see.  This forum muzzles any true form of free speech. Yes, I know there are troglodytes that will abuse it. So, a few bad apples and then you take away the chance for any true freeform conversation. Because of this new forum, several of my comments, which weren't horrible, get banned due to the thin skinned sensibility of some of the people that use this.  No conversation can be pure when people are disallowed from speaking freely, regardless of how unfounded or vitriolic.   But in regards to the news today; whether Muslim or white bread American, young men in this country are extremely susceptible to this type of behavior. Frustration with no clue how to deal with it.
I'll bet your not the average Black man, who saw their incomes not keep pace with the rest of the country.  But you're right, President Obama's friends and donors on Wall St. did very well.
