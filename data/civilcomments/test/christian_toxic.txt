"..men ordained priests to 'embody Christ's presence' on Earth?  However, it is obvious that Pope. F. and the entire Catholic clergies are not interested in serving God and/or embody Christ on Earth, the way these Pope F. and the entire Catholic clergies processing clergy rape of children.  We can embody Christ on earth by our presence and a simple smile.  Is there one person think what Pope F. and these Catholic clergies are doing with raping children embody Christ?   To me, what these bishops and clergies are doing embody more of devil on earth! So what is the point of the Catholic religion if we are not interested in serving God and embody Christ??? Is Catholic religion exist to serve these sick devilish clergies and nothing to do with God? If it is nothing to do with God, why bother? These clergies represent more of 'Devil' and evil spirits, these clergies are a man of devil to me, I do not care to do a thing with these evil clergies or an evil Religion they portray!!!
Let's not forget that other adorable example of good Christianity, the Salem Witch Trials. Let's hang 'em in the name of God!
On the contrary, it shakes no orthodox Catholics to the core. Never have they hung on every word uttered by the popes. St John Paul II and Benedict XVI came under criticism over Assisi and for their failure to turn back the tide of Modernism which is flooding through today's Church unchecked. Those two popes did not, however, threaten any dogma or doctrine like is happening now. The charge that orthodox Catholics reject the Church's social teaching is absolutely false. There are many differing opinions as to how the social teaching is implemented, the Church does not endorse any political system or economic theory: despite what progressives think or desire, the Church does not preach Socialism. Cafeteria Catholics have long falsely accused orthodox Catholics of also being in the cafeteria. "You're as bad as us is a common cry," from those who wish to minimise their guilt.
Sounds an awful lot like a threat, bro'. Fact is. you rednecks need green liberals to watch out for you. If it were up to Weyerhaeuser and Georgia Pacific the whole damn country would be clear cut to send chopsticks to China, and the mountains would all wash into the sea.   Likewise, if it weren't for liberal groups policing the divide between church and state, the US would be overrun by Christian taliban and ruled by Baptist sharia. History is not over. And the USA is not immune to it.   Face it Bill. You're on the wrong side of history. White supremacy is illegal. The destruction of the living planet in pursuit of profit is illegal. These things are true whether you like it or not. And if you keep talking about violence against these laws, you'll be the one who ends up in stir.
Ms. Hammond's lawsuit against SNAP is itself an exploitation of Catholic clergy sex abuse victims!  And she is hardly in a position to claim that anyone else is doing the exploiting!  Especially by hiring "greedy attorneys" of her own!
The pastor is not a Christian and an idiot to compare Hillary election loss to Jesus death and resurrection. Hillary is not a Christian either.
Your attitude toward Protestants is ridiculous.  Or do you think that the Holy Spirit ONLY guides the Catholic church and NEVER Protestants?  Christ want ALL to be ONE---therefore the Holy Spirit can guide Protestants, or anybody else who wishes to do God's Holy Will. Looking at these young women, who are willing to serve God's people, God is guiding them.  God is not S L O W in operating to meet the people's spiritual needs, but the Catholic Hierarchy IS.
Wow...let me guess, you support Christian only invocations? And invocations should be banned from government meetings if someone is prohibited from offering invocation because the members of the assembly disapprove of the religion or group. It's illegal and the court will rule against this asinine rule while taxpayers foot the bill.
Just as pseudo Christians/ pseudo conservatives have destroyed the GOP, political correctness has destroyed liberalism.
What a hypocrite. She is just as responsible for any genocide as every non-indigenous person currently alive in Canada. She is living on 'stolen land' and enjoying the benefits of previous generations of immigrants as much as anyone else. She should move somewhere where no person has every stepped foot and live off the land. Her attitude is not surprising given our education system indoctrinates our youth in code that all the ails of the world are due to white Christians. A white person making similar rants about people of brown skin color would be expelled from the university to great fanfare.
This is absolutely horrifying. It's  needlessly cruel, racist, illegal, counter-productive as a measure against terrorism, and nobody who supports this atrocity has any right to call themselves a Christian.  I'm sickened by how much hatred and bigotry is around us.
Cultural competence says Jesus would have told them to 'go and sin no more'. Homosexuality was never accepted in Jewish or Christian teaching.  It still isn't. Neither was men or women wearing the other sexes' clothing. The Church is warned about 'wolves that come dressed as sheep', a falling away in the Last Day, and people with 'itching ears'. I am sure that once again I will be 'stoned' for my thoughts. But the liberals love to kill the messenger, because they hate the Message.
Thank you for showing the extent of white, christian, republican arrogance through brainwashing.  Later, when your son learns to think for himself, he will realize what an total asshole you are.  He will still love you, but he will no longer respect you are feel your opinions are worth his time.  Nice job, dad.
"Rage, rage against the dying of the light." They voted for a fascist. The Germans accepted that Hitler was elected. Trump was endorsed by the KKK and neo-nazis and did not reject them. He doesn't believe human caused climate change exists. He wants to break the Geneva Convention's rules against torture even though this is our law and doing so puts every American military person at risk. He wants to ban people on the basis of religion and race thereby going against the U.S. Constitution. His positions fly in the face of the heritage of American and Christian values and morals. He is on the record as a pervert. What kind of person are you?
Good, will skip this trash.    Christians need to raise their standards.
I think we do know what is going on. ALL US terrorist attacks since 2001 have been domestic based and none by those in the banned countries. And why is Saudi not on the list? Priorities to Christian immigrants? Really? Trump is a pea-brained narcissist with dictator qualities. You can run your own business like that and live with the consequences, but not a democracy.
The Church teaches that committing a sin against God’s law is never justified by a good end. Thus, to directly act to kill an innocent human being within the womb is not morally permissible.  The Church also condemns killing the mother to save the fetus.  The proposition that a dead fetus is morally superior to a dead mother and a dead fetus is justified only by situation ethics, which the Church categorically rejects.  We all die.
When are we going to acknowledge this radical Christian extremist terrorist?  Why are so many cowards afraid to label this what it is?  His religion is the basis for his hate and desire to murder so many of our American citizens.  How is this any different from "radical Muslim extremists?"
You conflate the authority of theologians/historians with the Magesterium of the Church.  An analogy:  Often times the SCOTUS makes some very bad decisions.  They use very bad and very stupid arguments to support those decisions.  Roe V. Wade is but one of numerous examples.  Their arguments are so bad and stupid--it does not even take a lawyer to drive a truck through them.  Even a person without training in law could drive a truck through them.  That does not unmake the decision, that does not change the decision.  The decision is what it is, no matter how bad it is and no matter how stupid the arguments used to support it.  Whether the Vatican uses good or bad arguments to support their statements, whether theologians can drive a truck through them, whether we like it or not, they, like the justices, have the authority to judge between competing opinions and arguments and render decisions.  That is how it works.  Some decisions are irreformable.  Women's ordination is one of them.
I would like to know why the religion of "peace" promotes child predators? Muhammad even had interests in girls as young as 5 yet people worship him as a God. They even promote the killings of gay and lesbian people. Where in America do you see people doing this? Nowhere, Christians may not agree with homosexuality but at least they aren't cutting off heads.
I am an atheist and a historian, and yes our laws are based on Judeo-Christian values.  And whoever the guy was that thought they were based on Shria... well that guy is a nut.
Regarding :" gay culture" - This old phrase, 'particular friendships', might best explain what the old men in the Holy See want to address. - That is, secular clerics, as well as consecrated men and women, must avoid an, albeit natural, human tendency to have friends that are just like themselves.  That is, they do not have an 'open' approach to relationships and thus act in an exclusionary manner. - In houses of consecrated religious, 'particular friendships', raise suspicions, isolated one religious from another and thus are divisive. - More diffused, but just as apparent, secular clerics who have 'particular friends' limit their own ability to be a brother to the brothers and sisters of Christ. - So, this document is best read if 'gay' or 'homosexual' is replaced with human.
I can just see Jesus in heaven rolling his eyes and saying, "Why did I ever agree to go down there in the first place."  These village idiots do not understand what I was doing, asking of them.  First, it was a nice cabernet that was used, but any wine will do, it's just what was on hand at the time.  Secondly, it was a barley loaf, the food of the poor.  And we added salt and honey to the recipe, hey, it was the last supper and a good loaf of bread was expected.  Geez, you'd think I was handing out oreo's or twinkies, but then again what can you expect after 2000 years of not doing my will.
Yes, and no one is more threatening than gays. The Catholic Church is more welcoming of the unrepentant, serial rapist than a married homosexual.
Liberals like Larry are angry, disturbed people who can do nothing but scream how conservatives are filled with hate. But it is Leftists who spew their hatred and intolerance, most often on social media – the coward’s way of dialog. Read some of the tweets about the murdered cops in Dallas and Baton Rouge. Who spits on Trump supporters while screaming profanities? Leftists. Who attacks and beats up Trump supporters? Leftists. Who marches in the streets of American cities shouting “Pigs in a blanket, fry’em up like bacon”? Leftists. Who shuts down conservative speakers at universities, denying free speech? Leftists. Who hates Christianity? Leftists. For fascists like Larry, bereft of a coherent argument, the only thing to do is bellow that people he disagrees with are racists and haters. It’s pathetic, but a shining example of the decline of our education system.
I would not have a graveyard next to me, nor would I buy a property next to a graveyard. It may have been for Muslims, Protestants, Catholics or just a place to bury people, it does not matter. It is the press making up news to make it a Muslim issue, who cares, not me I would vote the same, the same vote I would pass for a pig farm.
I trust, now that the  authorities in Australia feel confident that there is a case for Pell to answer with respect to allegations of historical sexual abuse, I presume the Church will now treat him like any other priest in a similar circumstance, namely;  Immediately suspend him from public ministry Removal from his current ecclesiastical place of residence Have him undergo a psychological assessment and other psychometric testing Leave him to his own devices until as such time as the legal process has concluded  I would be interested to know whether the above process, experienced by many priests in the UK and Ireland, will apply. Somehow, I do not think so.
No, rejecting the authority of the CDF is NOT rejecting either the priesthood or the Church.   Tell me, RD, are you really Kurgan in disguise, saying really silly things to poke fun at conservative Catholics? Or do you really believe the silly things you say?
Jenifer; What those in the Hierarchy fail to understand is how many Catholics have either left the Church or if still there refuse to contribute financially because of their handling of the sex abuse crisis. Cardinal Dolan, of New York was recently heard complaining that Catholics are not contributing enough. There has been some training for those who work in the Church. That training has been targeted on lay people who work there and not on clergy and especially not on Bishops. Their financial problems are self made. If they were to recognize the abuse, admit to how bad it was/is and that they purposely covered it up,  many of their financial difficulties would eventually go away. But that would take leadership. Something tremendously lacking in the Catholic Church.
These intolerance's are about disgust. Nazi's were disgusted by the Jews. Muslims are disgusted by infidels. In Canada many Christians are disgusted by drug users, sex before marriage, gays even free speech. Religion breeds narcissism and disgust for the 'other.' Putting people in prison because they disgust you is not much different then violence against them. Of course, we should be disgusted by genuine crimes and violence and even look at the mirror we hold up for others.
They are NOT "despising the flag". They are protesting such things as the endemic racism that the president you take such pride in supports.  Trump is a bigot and supports bigotry. No actual Catholic -- or American -- should view him with anything other than revulsion.
This is completely outrageous, the ACLU is seeking to subject americans to foreign nationals who have already been determined to have committed crimes in this country. Iraq is a Shiite majority nation, the groups killing christians are Sunni muslim extremists who no longer control parts of Iraq. They have nothing to fear in going home except maybe much harsher punishment for those who choose to break the law.  Since when is foreign immigration a civil right anyway?  The ACLU should stick to their mandate and stop interferring in foreign policy.
Wouldn't the world be great if we had no religion at all?  Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, etc--all a collection of stupid superstitions and archaic customs and traditions that divide people and by the very fact of the division causes suspicion, superiority, hatred and violence.  Maybe we needed religion when people couldn't understand what was in dark corners and relied on others to allay their fears, but it no longer serves any useful purpose.
Again, the Catholic Church - and the religious orders therein - are called out for protecting predators... but when will the language be changed to include all forms of abuse by priests and bishops? Confining the problem to sexual abuse leaves the door wide open for a host of other abuses by these men, which often happen to the victims after the reporting is done, or in "stand alone" situations which have nothing to do with sex, but which are equally traumatic for the victims. (Victims of Emotional Abuse by Priests, on Facebook)
This story highlights what I've know for years, 'christians' are totally screwed in the head and need to be fought at every turn.  They can't even protect THEIR OWN DAUGHTER ... from this 'religious' monster.  Yikes!!!
It was WHITE Catholics who voted for Trump in large numbers.  Catholics of color were smarter.
Let's face it, the R-G is operated by educated whites who rightfully find today's brand of conservatism both embarrassing and threatening. Kathleen Parker is not a liberal, she's a Republican but I assume even for an idiot like her it's becoming harder and harder to stomach the likes of a president who feels up his own daughter, jokes about having "sex" in common with her and claims he would be dating her if only she weren't his daughter.  Don't get me wrong, I think Trump is a good fit for the Republican party. It's good they've come out in the open with their values. I find it especially heartwarming that the Christian Right has overcome its aversion to activities such as adultery, fornication, possibly incest, grabbing private body parts, and other previously and supposedly shunned activities.  At the same time, most of this stuff is a big turn-off for most Americans, a majority actually, so don't hold your breath on the R-G becoming Breitbart or Infowars.
They are Wolves in Sheeps clothing. Have the seen the Jesse Waters piece interviewing Muslims in America as to Sharia? Most want to have Sharia, you ask yourself why they came to America? and it's obvious they are laying the groundwork for the future to change America and the Liberals/Democrats are in kahoots with them. Ask yourself why these Liberals/Democrats spew hate against Conservative speakers on school campuses, ask yourself why these Liberals demonstrate against the anti-Sharia protests, etc. . I can only surmise 2 scenarios of the Liberals/Democrats anti Christians ways and it's either they are in kahoots with Muslims/Islamist and that includes the Islamist Fanatic Terrorists or they are plain "air headed". They stand up for a cause just to prove a point without regard to how America is today. They are spoiled brats brought up in the good ole US of A and are so blind in their sheltered minds what Muslim/Islam is all about.
You obviously don't know what you are talking about. If you are a "catholic", you don't know much about your religion. Nobody is playing dress up. And if you aren't Catholic, you should keep your mouth shut and hide your ignorance.
Thank you, Sr Joan.  This election was devastating to me as an American, as a christian.  Devastating not only because a totally unqualified, uneducated in policy issues, con man manipulated voters by playing on their fears and prejudices, but also for what it says about what has happened to our country.  The ideals of America - the shining city on the hill, the ideals engraved on the Statue of Liberty (give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free) - are gone, destroyed by voters who chose a man whose statements and rhetoric are both un-christian and un-American.  America now turns its back on those who suffer.  Jesus said to love, not to hate.   What has happened to the American people that they would choose such a man?  Hillary was very flawed in countless ways. But her flaws, weaknesses and even lies pale next to those of the man who was elected. His were beyond any normal political candidate - yet he won.  A demagogue.  I weep for our country.
Does that strike you as implausible? After all, when Christianist homophobes kill gay people, we don't rush to condemn Christianity.
RE: Boston Globe commentary: "For some Catholics, endorsements from the pulpit don't work"  The author is right on target.  In fact, prelate pulpit political endorsements imply that the laity are too stupid and spiritually vapid to sort out complex issues for themselves,  and should instead obey the voting dictate of the local bishop... a man whose first and only allegiance is to Rome, not U.S. representative democracy.   I've watched our own local bishop happily go down the rightwing culture war rabbit hole of conspiracy theory more than once while issuing letters on how to vote on issues and candidates.  His tunnel vision and lack of regard for complexity is astonishing.   The olds days of blind obedience to prelates are over...  it's no wonder that certain retro-bishops and their followers long to return to the 1940s and 50s... no one would actually have to learn and think.
One more diversion and waste of time for the governing bodies to hide the failure of dealing with real issues.  The Republican hate agenda combined with fundamentalist christian religious fanaticism continues to gridlock the conduct of the governments at all levels from local to national.  A specific agenda and traitorous actions to nullify the governing system to allow the wealthy elite traitorous thieves to continue to loot the nation protected from any regulatory hindrances.  One of the most stupid and useless pieces of legislation ever conceived by the ugly minds of the religious fanatics demanding their own strict regulatory controls over all human bodily functions.
They will make the fatherland great again, they say, by weeding out the non-Christians and "dangerous" ethnic people, by slashing aid to the elderly and care for the poor, and by building the greatest military the world has ever seen. They will publicize government-sponsored lists intended to demonstrate the "criminality" of the ethnic other. They condemn revelation of inconvenient facts as merely the continued plotting of the Lügenpresse. And they brag to their admirers about the inspiration for all those plans, not being the least bit shy about doing so. Call it what it is—and call Republican support for their plans what it is, as well. Trumpism = Fascism = Republicanism. The right adopted Trump and his agenda, all of it. The Fascism, the Racism, the Nazism. That's what winning looks like. You're a winnner.
you gotta be kidding.  trump a Christian, nope, he is the devil, he hates blacks, Hispanics, muslims, gays, Asians, etc.
Your true agenda is that superiority attitude I see among "Christian" white males  What is that "Traditional value", was it whites live here and blacks live there.  Was it I'm a Christian and your a Muslim, and your religion isn't REALLY a religion.  Was it I'm not gay so I'm better than you, and if your gay your a sinner? Your superior attitude was tried by a country called Germany.  Didn't work.
The U.S. Catholic bishops have, and deserve, little influence in the public square. It’s hard to get too concerned by the recklessness of +Naumann and other members of the Republican Bishops Conference. On the other hand, in Donald Trump we have a candidate who is a notorious racist, fascist and adulterer; an accused rapist, child molester and serial sex offender; a demonstrably unstable personality who should never have access to any of the levers of government, let alone to the nuclear codes; a demagogue who lacks even a minimal understanding of the issues of the day, who is contemptuous of American values and of democratic institutions and processes; a bigot who attacks racial, ethnic and religious minorities, ridicules women, and mocks the handicapped. By endorsing this despicable man, Naumann does more than embarrass himself; he disgraces the church and trivializes and diminishes the pro-life and pro-family causes he purports to support. Let's pray that his priests will oppose him
... Cheetolini supporters are wonderful, I love how you remove ANY DOUBT what complete racist homophobic xenophobic morons you ALL are ... yet ... consider yourselves Christians.  80% of Cheetolini supporters consider themselves Christians.  'christians' is the reality ... super fakey, horrible human beings.  Waste of human flesh.  When you die the earth becomes a better place.  Jesus was a person of color.  Suck on it.
No Jerry Burle, you cannot be a Christian if you practice murdering the unborn, just like the Canaanites who sacrificed  their children to Molech/Baal. Stop deluding yourself Jerry Burle.
Because that's what civilized countries do they don't just take you out in the back and shoot you sorry even though this guys a jerk we still have to be civilized on our end.  But maybe not anymore TRUMPELTHINSKIN  just named a religion (Muslim) as a problem not particular people in the religion that's exactly what Adolf Hitler did he blamed a whole religion (Jewish) not just specific people in the religion ESPECIALLY when he says he is going to save Christians. That creates a religious war  I know it's hard but try to read and comprehend history   HEY IT IS THE SAME THING
"Hatred is at the root of much of the world’s horrors"  Muslims and liberals love to excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of Christianity, Europe and America, destructive iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other.  Entrenched civil  wars between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects, ISIS , Taliban and Al Quada are the root causes of most of the wars and social chaos happening around the world today. It is a purely thankless job to try to stop Muslims from killing other Muslims, or non Muslims, or gays, or women,  or Jews, or Christians, or Buddhists or Hindus..  It is worse than anything expressed in the west, even by trolls.
Rich,    Don't you think Trump's supporters appreciate his twittering as having the common touch, keeping in touch with the people, and being transparent?    At first I thought it was juvenile, stupid and unpresidential. But it has its upside. At least we all know what's on his mind - as opposed to, say, Stephen Harper.   In my view, the juveniles are greedy middle class liberals who don't want to spread the wealth around, don't want to upset the !%, are afraid of their corporate employer, and refuse to admit any responsibility for all America's ills.   They need to repent and change their evil ways.   They should don sack cloth and ashes and parade down main street flagellating themselves with birch tree twigs. A little Christian repentance is a good thing.
Aung Sung Suu Kyii has only a ceremonial role in the Burmese government, she is called the 'State Counselor' -- the Burmese military runs the country for the 88% Buddhist majority who want the Rohingya (4.3% of the population) and the Christians (6.2% of the population) and the Hindus (0.5% of the population) out of the country.  If they don't leave, eventually they'll all be killed.   It's just the way it is there, it will never change. (I've been there)  The level of hatred for the Rohingya by the Buddhist majority is unbelievable.  But Burma's loss is Bangladesh's gain, becuase the Rohingya are amazingly good farmers, even with the crap land they're allowed to live on, but not ever own, in Burma.  Cheers! JBS
These charlatans have no shame. Bigoted bible thumpers that don't even follow the teachings of Christ. It's all about power and the dollar for these folks
Well, the OP singled out one religion, and claimed that students wanted a mosque in school, which is complete nonsense.    If the OP has an issue with the law, then it should only be changed when it is applied uniformly to all religions.  When Catholic schools are shut down and no one is allowed to pray or celebrate religious holidays in public schools, then the prayer room should also be eliminated.  Until then, it's quite hypocritical to say that Muslims shouldn't be allowed to pray for an hour a week when we have entire taxpayer funded schools dedicated to sects of Christianity.
Of course some are "arrogant" but then, so are some of the far liberal. Someone else referred to Evangelicals as stupid. Of course some are but, let's face it when it comes to "faith" and faith systems there is a tendency to leave fact and reasoning behind and fill the hole(s) with emotion (seeking something to be emotional about) and judgment (unhinged from reason). A protestant clergyperson once made the comment to me: we suffer the tyranny of the "book"; you suffer the tyranny of the "chair". Revealing. Data seems to indicate that it wasn't the uneducated, unemployed who "elected" Trump.
When you invite the murderer into your house why are you surprised he kills? Unfettered, zero- vetted hundreds of thousands of Muslim invaders who have been targeting Western Christian lands and people for over 1,400 years and they are surprised they will be killed, raped and maimed? Some times you have to wonder if the STASI in the GDR  needs to be reinvented to protect the average German citizen in the unified Republic of Germany.
Tough luck if you are Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, Pagan, or Jew.  This is a good Hypocritical Christian Nation.
The nasty person here is you, Pandora. You pretend to seek truth and honesty, while actually showing neither. Let someone disagree with you, and you show your nastiness in full measure. You rejoice in dishing out the "nasty, cruel, untrue, and uncivil", and "decency, civility, and Christian charity" make up only a tiny part of the nastiness that is Pandora.
Just the White Supremacists emboldened by their leader to resurrect the 1930s pogroms of the New Hitler/Der Fuehrer  Trump and his National Security Advisor Herr Bannon.  Start with a small non-christian minority to appease the Fundamentalist Racist Christians following Judaeo-Christian ethics, expand to Islamics and all immigrants while imposing martial law in all Black urban areas.  The 4th Reich in full flower.
"Since most Catholics in the USA are in favor of gay marriage..." Does your statement refer to Catholics who go to Mass every week, or just anyone who self-identifies as Catholic because I've seen polls that show that 70% of devout Catholics who attend Mass every Sunday oppose same sex marriage?   I'll agree with you on one issue: If gays who are civilly married are not to receive funeral rites, then anyone who is married civilly, but not sacramentally, should also be denied funeral rites.   A person can be scandalized by any doctrinal infraction, can't they?
Is that list in reference to the actions of president-elect Trump...or the Catholic  church?    Isn't the fact that your own religion has acted worse than Trump a matter to ponder?  Sexually assaulting.....not women, but children.  Misogyny galore.  History of vitriol to Jews and other religions.  Rapaciously greedy?  Yes -- so much so, a protestant rev started by indignation over corrupt indulgences, that's still in full force.  NOT PAYING  TAXES!    Oh my gosh...  Priests and workers and teachers make a pittance, while Bishops live like princes in mansions.  Funny that you object so to Trump (and all Catholics who voted for him), but here you are in the RCC.    Paging Dr. Freud...
filipino psycho killer!  filipino and filipina pride!  life long filipino catholics are life long atheists.
100% BS.....even "conservative" bishops spend 20-50X as much money on liberal social justice nonsense than they do on "conservative" issues like opposing abortion and defending marriage.   The Catholic bishops have been whores for liberal garbage like Nancy Piglosi, Ted Kennedy, Biden, and the rest of the Democratic Left.  Meanwhile, the civil rights of WHITE ETHNIC CATHOLICS have been under assault for decades:  forced busing...racial quotas....affirmative action....diversity garbage.  The black political establishment is the ENEMY of Catholics and the Church.  A Chuch whichi is 97% white has no business ass-kissing anti-Catholic Negroes.  Time to act accordingly.
'Islamic' terrorists, 'rght wing' 'Christians', atheistic killers, anti-abortionists, the Dallas police assassin; other than the truly mentally ill (Sandy Hook), the only commonality I see is that they all are in truth and in fact 'losers' and perceive themselves in that way.    They are trying to achieve something based on how the media will portray them after they are dead.
Maybe the Catholic Church needs to lose their tax exempt status now that they're getting political. They continue to make me glad that I left the religion of boy molestors and perverts a very long time ago.
The fundies I know think of the Vatican and Catholicism as a pedophile ring.
Notice how Hollywood 'celebrities' are unusually quiet on the news of Attacks and murder of Christians. They jump every opportunity to insult, mock and even call for the assassination of the American President, they can't phantom a temporary ban on islamist nations hostile to America, yet all crickets of the attack on Christians .
When Harry goes to church he sits in his pew and points out to himself that liberal is a liar, that one is a racist and says amen when the pastor says a prayer to love thy neighbor.  . Have a wonderful Christian life Harry.
<<I am curious what I look like thru "hairy eyeballs.">>  It seems I wasn't explicit enough: You look like a Catholic fascist.  But I didn't mean to derail the thread by throwing out a bit of snark.
"Trump advocated divisive politics of identity — he raised racial and ethical tensions and inflamed passions against imagined enemies — Mexican immigrants, Chinese exporters, Muslim refugees."  Trump's rise is based on white supremacy.  Trump's bad guy is always some non-white boogeyman.  It is the duty of every American and Christian to publicly stand up against this racist tide.  People in Europe had the opportunity in the 12920s and 30s and failed.   What will history say about us?
You assume no gays are Christians and no Christians are gay.   A gay person with religious beliefs is more than welcome to challenge any given law on religious grounds. The fact he is gay doesn't matter. For example, a gay pacifist could challenge draft laws that require him to perform military service. And the court will take his challenge seriously and likely grant him relief.  Religious rights are very real rights found in the Constitution. They are not imaginary rights created by Christians. They exist. They have legal standing. The courts have respected them over the years. And, yes, those rights can conflict with statutory rights, as they do in this case. And they exist as individual rights, not merely group rights. A Christian doesn't have religious rights because he is a Christian; he has those rights because he is a citizen. Everyone, including gays, has those rights. I want to keep them. Some people don't.
Where's the incredibly attractive Janet Reno when you REALLY need her?  She'd burn him alive as if he were a christian from Waco.
Religion doesn't teach morality, it teaches you to obey what your church leadership wants.  Evangelical "christians" voting for any republican and especially Trump is just proof of that.  They love Jesus, but ignore every thing he taught.  And they wonder why young people today are less religous.
The best way to improve the safety of public bathrooms is to ban the fundamentalists from them. That group as a whole is always getting arrested for child rape and child pornography. I have no doubt that any and all activity in public restrooms that is criminal is performed by someone who claims to be Christian.
I'd say the division is between Sensus Fidelium and the Hierarchy and their rich 'hangers-on.' Millions of ordinary Catholics witnessed what their parents went through, as outlined by justmaybe above. (And you forgot about the names being called out about who put what in the collection the week before. And 'Benny-addiction' on Sundays.)  They saw the damage they inflicted on their parents and grandparents. They feel utterly betrayed by a succession of Popes and spineless Cardinals over the abuse crisis.   The conservatives love to blame the VII clergy for the abuse. (It wasn't.) But the one thing that cannot be denied is that the cover up was perpetrated by JPII / Benedict's men. Every single one of them was appointed by those two.  The thought that the People of God will accept a return to that is risible.  Cardinals and Bishops would do well to wisen up soon.
The majority of white folks don't realize that our race relation issues were created by white people for white people. We minorities have had very little say about our public policies in this country. Heck, our 1st black president was followed by the guy that said he wasn't born in America. White folks did build our racist heritage. We have been working on becoming "a more perfect union" ever since the founding of the nation. The 2nd Amendment was necessary to commit ethnic cleansing and building the macro economics of the nation on race based slavery. Murder and rape were part of the business model for the nation. Clearly, Christianity doesn't prevent white racism, rape, or murder. This country is proof. The beauty of white racism is that it allows the average white person to go through life thinking they are innocent while collecting their white privilege. For example, white folks aren't racially profiled. This despite the fact that most mass shooters are loner white men.
RD is saying "You can't call me a liar because you are a liar". Even if I am a liar, it has NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with YOUR lying. It is an excellent example of the Tu Quoque logical fallacy. Would you come before a judge and say, "You can't say I'm a thief, since Joe Doaks is a thief."?  Since I have disposed of your fallacious response, how about you doing what you say others should do and apologize to me for your having lied about me? Do you need to be reminded of your lie? It was when I called you on having said that the Turing machine was another name for the Turing test in the "Pope Francis discusses married priests, women deacons with German newspaper" thread. You replied in the "Delve into the Bible during Reformation anniversary" thread "Except I never said 'the Turning [sic, Turing; he got it wrong twice] Machine is another name for the Turing Test.' That my dear friend is a falsehood, a lie."  It was, in fact, the complete truth, as shown by actual quotation. You lied.
the left: asian cop shoots unarmed black man- "i hate white people! kill all cops! pigs in a blanket, fry em like bacon!! no justice!!! Let's destroy the local convenient store!!!" obvious terror attack by an islamic extremist- "ok guys, lets wait for all of the facts to come out before we start pointing fingers. we dont want to spread hate, ok! besides, this attack is nothing compared to the Christian bombing on planned parenthood in the 90's."
But it is.  Because the religion itself and practiciers of are not trying to kill you.  Specific radical individuals are trying to kill you.  But they no more represent Islam than all of the white christian mass shooters in the US represent Christianity.
You'd "like to trust" that people aren't scared, stupid, and fearful.   I, however, would also like to trust that, but I know better. Given the opportunity, evangelicals WILL impose their misguided and fearful beliefs on anyone they can.
A Catholic drone, no thanks - opens his campaign in the Horseshoe tavern - a place I frequented quite a bit getting wasted but is in no way appropriate to run country, like him. A drunk more interested in hanging out in bars who came up through catholic church stuff? No thank you.
Yeah, you're Exhibit A alright. Parroting the GOP talking point of (last) week: Never mind the president's sympathy for the "fine people" marching with Nazis and white supremacists. Look over there! It's Black Lives Matter! And how "horrible" they are to virtuous, non-racist, Confederate-monument-opposing white guys like you! It's so unfair! Really, Counselor?  Considering a majority of white voters (and Catholics!!) opted for the racist Trump, I rest my case.
Some of you white folks just can't handle the fact that you benefit from a lot of rape, robbery, torture, and murder. Before Pearl Harbor the US sent a cruise liner full of Jews back to Hitler. I suppose they thought that was the Christian thing to do. All lives have never mattered in this country.
So if religion is supposed to be private, are you protesting state-funded Catholic schools as well, or are you just a hypocrite?
hapaguy 1 hour ago "I said that the vast MAJORITY of terrorist shootings/bombings etc... in this country since 9/11 were perpetrated by RIGHT WING "Christian" extremists. Since 9/11 there were 21 instances of right-wing, white extremist, "Christian" terrorist attacks in the U.S. that caused 53 fatalities...." hapaguy 44 minutes ago "Nowhere did I say that a "Christian Extremist Group killed 53 people". I said that since 9/11 there were 21 attacks that caused 53 fatalities...."  You making me work haad tonight, lol I don't know hapaguy.  Maybe you misrepresented yourself or it's nai nai time. No worries hahahaahahaha, who's on 1st? What's on 2nd! I don't Know is on 3rd.
In Turkey's case, the label 'islamist' is a pejorative description, but Western Europe and North-America are 'upholding Christian values' and Israel is under the thumb of zionist religious zealots at all levels. Pretty hypocritical, if you think of it. Seems, like 'democracy' doesn't do much for secularism, but dictatorship does, like in Syria.
You are so precise in your understanding of the concepts of "in the person of..." vs. "in the presence..."   Vatican II was the theological force that changed the distorted medieval reliance of the priest being the presence of Christ, rather than all of the baptized having Christ present within ("in the person").    And yes, the Eucharistic celebration is a symbolic remembrance.  If it was a reenactment we would either kill someone at each Mass, or expect that the blood and bones of Jesus would be crushed in our mouths upon receiving communion.
I don't know if the bishops ever told priests that if they rape a child and celebrate Mass they are committing sacrilege.  But even if they didn't, the priest should know that...it is pretty basic Catholicism that receiving Communion with a mortal sin on your soul is sacrilege.   By the logic of your second paragraph, there can never be a mortally sinful sexual act, since sex acts by definition occur in a state of passion.  Which begs the question, why in this case would the Scriptures go through the trouble of condemning sexual immorality? This sounds like something your example of a rapist priest could say to himself to justify himself taking Communion in a state of mortal sin.
so happy to leave this religion behind, and now it is morphing into a political advocacy group.  they are the kings of the shakedown, there's a big difference between religion and god, and there is not so much of a difference anymore between catholicism and political propaganda masquerading as a church which is welcome to all.  The fish of catholicism  is rotting from the head down. Good bye and good luck.
Predictably you cannot answer the simple question, because that would require you manning up and admitting your faith is based on babbling nonsense. You cannot be both a slave to sin and have a free will. Furthermore you don't believe a word of the Bible, you have no faith in what is plainly writ and like most deluded Christians, in every aspect of your false gospel you call your god a liar. It's why you run with this chicken)(*& bs about scholars. It's plainly written there is none that doeth good, no not one. You say the Bible is a liar, you do good, you chose to love Jesus and yet the same Bible plainly states ALL rejected Christ. It is beyond your intellect to grasp faith is a gift from your imaginary God, unless he gives it to you it is impossible to believe. You call your god a liar and claim you believed of your imagined free will. that faith is a product of your will. But now I am just confusing you with simple facts and why churches are full of simpleton mindless sheep.
"You can be as angry and insulting as you like, but I will choose to obey God and demand that my church do the same."  ...yet, American Christians are so incredibly hypocritically selective in obeying Gods word(s).
"I'm impressed by her strong Christian faith and her dedication to regular attendance. She regularly volunteers with Church activities such as greeting parishioners and helping with childcare for our members," Rep. Munoz went on." WHAT CHURCH ALLOWS HER TO HELP WITH CHILDCARE??!? People wake up!!! This is EXACTLY how sexual predators operate! They PURPOSELY find ways to be around children so they can cultivate additional victims!!! This lady isn't sorry, she's looking for new victims!!!
Right, blame the victims.  So, according to you, it's OK to misrepresent the religious symbols of others to get at somebody whose comments you don't like.  Don't even know what a sacrament is, or anything 'bout mass, Catholic or otherwise.  If religious symbols have no place in hockey, then why did you go there in the 1st place?  Double standard.  Ok for you to make jokes at the expense of the religion of others, but when they object, when they say you got your stuff wrong, you then get all high and mighty.  Hypocritical rebuttal, sir, hypocritical.
"Anyone who thinks that sitting in a church will make you a christian, must also think that sitting in a garage can make you a car" Walk the walk or shut up; the only thing stinkier than a thief is a proud hypocrite.
Are you high??? Selling someone a cake?  Refusing to sell some a cake because it is for a gay wedding is no different from selling someone a cake because it is for a mixed race wedding or a Muslim wedding or any other kind of wedding.  IT IS DISCRIMINATION!  Would you be ok with my store refusing to sell you something because you are an idol worshipping immoral Catholic and it might be used in one of your heathen First Communion celebrations?  You know when those Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread don't you?
Isn't Allah the Arabic word for God? Isn't it the same God that Christians and Jews worship and defile?
Everything is a money making exercise. Or let's rather say a profit making one. Even the real Mother Teresa (not this ridiculous British Tory one) did it for heavenly profit, and was more interested in converting Hindus to Christianity than getting them out of poverty!  Whether climate change eventually proves to be completely caused by carbon emissions doesn't really matter now, because renewables are so taking over thanks to both their rapidly reducing costs and job creation potential that the momentum is unstoppable. One big bonus is that oil will now be used more cost efficiently, for plastics and other derivatives.   The best thing of all though, is that the Good Ol' Boys who voted The Chump in might finally work out what a total twåt he is.
The GOP has learned to play the race card, the abortion card, and anti-gay card.  This pro-nuke, anti-poor, pro guns, anti-health care Agenda  - not the Beatitudes - has the full blessing of the American Catholic Bishops. The tragedy is not the GOP, it is the American bishops - sold their souls to racists.
Peter, yes I am saying they bred their slaves like cattle. It was cheaper and more fun than buying adult slaves with skills. If you read the memoirs of Mary Chestnut, you will read her comments about how she and her girl friends resented the fact that so many of their slaves looked like their husbands. She was cited in Ken Burns documentary, The Civil War. Most white folks don't want to know this. Most blacks with English surnames are descendants of slave owners. That is how they got those names. Slave owners didn't consider themselves to be racists or rapists. They considered themselves just capitalists. So much for Christian morality. Raping black women was also common practice throughout the Jim Crow days. Black families sent their daughters to school more than their sons because their daughters would be less likely to be raped as a condition of employment if they were teachers, or nurses. Remember Strom Thruman's black love child?
Free exercise of religion? Nonsense. point to the passage in the Bible where it says that as a good Christian you are to refuse services to homosexuals.
According to Burke in April it didn't threaten anything at all. His reason for making a fool of himself now with this silly letter would appear to be that we are all running around in a state of confusion and bewilderment.   Most sane Catholics have a fair idea about who is confused here, and it is not Francis.
"neither Catholic nor are they followers of Christ" At least the poster implicitly recognizes that "Catholic" and "follower of Christ" are not synonymous.  We have many examples of that.  JPII was very much a Catholic, but as an avid protector of pedophiles, he cannot be considered a follower of Christ.
Firing gay employees for getting married is standard operating procedure for American bishops. If you were going to fire all sinners, then there would be no one left. IN FACT, gays are rejected by the institutional Church. This is being unchristian.  Yes, abortion is just one issue among others. But to hear the bishops, it is the ONLY issue worth considering. I believe this attitude is wrong.
Well, this is what she said on the Emmys,    'she declared that “a lot of people come up here and thank Jesus for this award. I want you to know that no one had less to do with this award than Jesus.”  Then she held up her trophy and said, “Suck it, Jesus. THIS is my God now!” How's much do you think seeking salvation will she try and do.  She's a pua'a with kukae flowing out of her waha.
Meanwhile, Christians are getting killed all around the world - literally and figuratively.. In Egypt they shoot them or blow them up, in America and other Western countries, believing in Christ results in scorn and ridicule.  This was predicted in the Gospels.  No one is paying attention to the eerie accuracy of those testaments....  nothing surprising here..
Dennis, I remember well a very bitter older woman who was really outrageous in her condemnation of others in the parish. She attended everything, daily Mass, Rosary, Benediction, everything. She was a one woman brood of vipers.   Then we had a parish renewal weekend. I deliberately engineered it so that she would be in the same sharing group as a young, single mum. Over the course of the weekend, the older lady heard the very sad story of the young Mum. She changed. She got a glimpse of her own cruelty and stupidity. The two women became close friends thereafter and it was such a joy to see. The poisonous words stopped.  I believe that, that older woman had been disobedient to her very self for decades, disobedient to her God given feminine inclinations and natural instincts. She had been taught to disregard the Christ within her. The result was that she became miserable and brought misery to those around her.   The one common denominator for all of them is a lack of joy.
Oh dear, John, I'll spell it out for you. Mike AA brought Bill Clinton into the equation by saying that he was a paragon of virtue compared to Trump. Bill Clinton was a notorious womaniser among other things yet none of you liberals at the time berated or disparaged him on account of his lack of sexual mores because you supported the political aims of the Democratic Party.  Donald Trump's alleged sexual behaviour has you all  hypocritically responding in high dudgeon, outraged that such a person should become president of the USA., because you do not support the Republican Party. You were not outraged by Clinton's behaviour why are you outraged by the same behaviour attributed to Donald Trump. John, your literal readings and interpretations of what people write here cause more amusement than anything else. I can imagine the Democrats and progressive Catholics cringing when they read what you write.
I won't base my life on a book written 2000 years ago. The Bible is full of stories and written by people who participated in heinous crimes ranging from murder, genocide, mass murder, horrific child abuse, rape, incest, stonings, crucifixation, plagues etc. People bitch and moan about sex education in school but find it perfectly acceptable to teach their children about an innocent man crucified on a cross. The Children's edition has color pictures many churches especially Catholic Churches have life size replicas of naked bloody Jesus hammered to a cross.  God did not forgive or forget. He killed men, woman & children. He killed anyone who crossed him. He killed to make a point. I was raised in a Christain home, grew up in church. Now I refuse to go to church. I despise organized religion. God is a God of love, forgiveness and compassion yet the biggest hateful hypocritical bigots I have ever met claim they are Christian & people of God. Hate preached from a pulpit is still hate.
Regarding the practice of child sacrifice in Africa -- doesn't Christianity promote this false idea that there is a god or spirit that must be appeased with a human sacrifice? According to the Book of Hebrews 7:27, 9:26, etc., Jesus is the one and only sacrifice,  a man who offers himself as a human sacrifice to Yahweh.   But the Jews have it right, and also the Muslims, as they know Yahweh did not accept Abraham's human sacrifice of Issac, and God abhors human sacrifice, and God would never accept a human sacrifice, not even the sacrifice of a Jesus. God has no need for a human sacrifice.  A human sacrifice is an abomination. I suspect that Muslims and Jews are immune to Christianity because they know this fact about human sacrifice -- God abhors it.  Islam may be the solution to this problem of child sacrifice. Either that or adequate law enforcement
Look, these endless one sided stories of the poor poor Muslims is not helping.  Please stop trying to portray the Muslim faith as an innocent.  Muslims have been murdering Christians for a very long time.   To try to rewrite reality, and push aside that fact is causing many hard feelings.  Schools are not allowed to have Christmas Concerts, why is Muslim prayers being allowed?   We are not a Muslim based or founded country......thank goodness.
I applaud Gardner for saying this, but it's too little too late. The entire GOP has to take a stand and forcefully rebuke the racist scum that make up the KKK, neo-nazi groups and right-wing Christian identity groups who spew hatred and ARE part of Trump's and Gardner's base and part of the modern GOP who rely on racist dog-whistle politics to stoke racial resentment and divide our nation. Shame, once again, on the GOP.
The Catholic Church doesn't allow Jews in the club.
We will see articles in the G&M about the bigotry, hatred, and Christianophobia  exhibited, practiced, implemented by Muslims in Muslim dominant countries against non Muslims?  Nah.  I thought so.
It is false Christianity to preach and practice fear, loathing and rejection of gays.
Richard231, you are welcome to your religious beliefs. And don't kid yourself, your atheism is a religious belief. It's not scientific. Agnosticism is the scientific stand, even Bertrand Russell admitted that.  And stop pretending you know anything about other religions when what you're doing is creating a Straw Church to knock down. If you don't like the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, try Stalinism or Maoism. They were atheistic systems that did wonders for murdering millions of people.  I cherish freedom in all its messiness. I don't take religion or science dogmatically. I find Richard Dawkins as much of a buffoon as I do Franklin Graham. Atheists aren't immune from being stupid, cruel, misogynistic or just plain silly. Indeed, they're often as arrogant as those who think God speaks to them.
Christians and others are being slaughtered by Moslems all over the world because they are not Moslem.  Moslems  are killing Moslems because they are not the right kind of Moslems. Why do we allow them entry into our country?  Keep them and their scrabbles out.  Let in those that are willing to get along with there neighbours.
Dear Joan Chittister,    I can not fathom how a Catholic  or one who professes to believe in a loving God would EVER  praise  Clinton who heartily believes in sticking a scalpel into a baby's neck just as it is ready to be born...your politics DISGUST me...Clinton also stood by while her husband's mistress of the week performed Fellatio in the revered Whitehouse...not to mention the 30 -40 people the Clintons had mysteriously die or disappear...not to mention how she left our servicemen to die in a foreign land...or how she and her husband have been tied to human trafficking as it is a very prosperous trade...YES,you are ignorant and I am sorry for you...Hell awaits....Virginia Kellenberger
This action by these bishops is disgusting and has nothing to do with the christian life.  The only people "causing scandal' here are the bishops with this mean spirited and cruel directive.
Hey Johnny, apparently you live on Jupiter, because you're so utterly uninformed that you don't know about Dylan Roof.  Racist, white supremacist Christian who committed a deplorable act of terror.  So in other words, you're an idiot as well as a bigot.
I make no claims as to intention. When Trump put his hands on his daughter's gluteus, his eyes cast downward towards her bosom, he was likely engaged in saintly contemplation of the Holy Scriptures--perhaps Song of Solomon 7:6-9.  A great many Christians--just not Right-wing Christians--voted for Hillary Clinton *because* they support abortion rights and believed her to be the best candidate for the Presidency and is why Hillary Clinton won the popular vote--more Americans thought she was the best choice and didn't buy into any of the nonsense that she compromised national security. Now we see that for Republicans national security issues really have more to do with partisanship as they now embrace foreign actors having a role in our national politics. Their embrace of Putin--a dictator, is revealing and contributes to the perception that Republicans do not support the idea democracy, something their record on restricting voting rights supports.
"Trumps [sic] the greater threat to the U.S.!"  Well, yes, obviously. But Trump is also a greater threat to world peace than North Korea.  Note that Trump, the Trump Regime, and The America Treason Party want to deny many tens of millions of USA citizens health care. In the USA we already have about 45,000 citizens die every year due to the lack of medical care--- according to Harvard University, year 2013. The number is probably less now, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.  Repealing the ACA will kill more USA citizens every year than died in Vietnam; more than in Korea; more than all the domestic Christian terrorists in the USA have; more than foreign non-Christian terrorists have.
C. Dolan wants to prevent that Catholics will not donate money in fear that donation will be used to pay for the clergy sex abuse victims compensations.  He is spinning his little brain.  You would think a Cardinal would be a men of God, pray for the Holy Spirit's guidance instead spinning his little brain.  In light of C. D's tract record, who will trust this clergy 'conmen'?
So LGBT people are "dogs?" What about  fornicators ,  adulterers, or clergy that buy an anniversary cake or want a photographer at their church event - how does the business know that they're  doing business with an apologist for child sex abuse and trafficking?  Also, as far as even Catholicism is concerned, even in Latin America as in the United States, the Church was segregated ; in the former, special chapels were built for Black slaves. All this so called "religious objections " to serving LGBT people is a smokescreen and a slippery slope down the road to making it legal in the name of "religion " to refuse to do business with non White people hence, a return to Apartheid.  If you don't wish to serve the public, then cease being a business  owner that does just that.   Although I don't doubt that a return to Apartheid in America is what Trump supporters want.
Fake commenter.....  And, likely, a fake Christian.
Homosexuality is a grievous sin and should not be tolerated by any Catholic. It is quite clear about the sinful nature of the practice in the Bible. If you want a more relaxed/looser approach to God's law then there are many protestant assemblies that condone the practice. If a homosexual (or homosexuality apologist) cannot recognise it as mortal sin and/or obstinately refuse to repent and remain celibate, then the Catholic Church is not for you.
You guys were vile and filled with hate words. I don't care if your a liberal or staunch conservative or bible thump-er, the words coming out of your mouths was hateful, rude, clueless and belongs in that special place called hell.
Catholic nuns have bad habits, too.
I see that your ignorance extends to literature as well as history. I was slightly misquoting Voltaire's Candide: "All is for the best in this best of all possible worlds."  And clearly you do believe that the Catholic Church is perfect. Those of us in the real world know it isn't.
To blame evanagelicals for beating gays 500 years ago, when the movement only came into being less than 50 years ago show your ignorance.
"You, like other liberals, want to cloudy this issue by offering scenarios that either won't happen (pagan schools) or that you think will prove that Christians can't read the Constitution." . By the standard definition, there are hundreds of pagan schools in the US. Claiming that they are a scenarios that "won't happen" is simply nonsense.
He was running for President of Indonesia.  A lot of white Christians wanted Obama's head too. For being a Muslim African with a fake American citizenship.
Lets address all the LIES in this article: 1.We do NOT identify with the Westboro Baptist Church. We REBUKE those fools. The reporter was told this and yet lied in this article. 2.We are not "anti-gay" We oppose the sin of homosexuality just as God does.We love homosexuals enough to tell them the truth about salvation in Christ and warn them of the judgment of their sin if they do not repent. 3.We are not "protesters" or "activists". Those are political terms and apparently some reporters are too ignorant to understand the difference between religion and politics.Or they are blatantly biased and ceded their journalistic professionalism for the sake of editorializing. 4. There were not "20" people involved. There were two of us (the rest of our group had to leave for another outreach) There were about 6-8 of the homosexuals who dragged off our cross and stomped on it and assaulted us in the process. The police would have no idea how many there were as they had left and were not there.
History suggests it will be Muslims who will take the place of White Christians.  I need not tell you which sex.
I don't know why he's so focused on the travel ban; we have the birthers, the neo-nazi's, the white supremacists, Russians, deplorables, evangelicals (the holy liars), the Real Americans, and other problem citizens he needs to be aware of......aoha and enjoy all the Fake News & Fake Facts......lol
Plus, like the Church today, the APA was incredibly over focused on gay men which made the APA appear to discriminate when it came to homosexuality.    The APA finally bent to three facts.  The first and foremost being their treatment paradigms didn't have any effect on the mental illness they were stating they could cure.  The treatments had no credibility.  Second, many of their own came out of the closet and lo and behold they weren't neurotic. Third was the political pressure, but that was given more credence because of numbers one and two.
Burying this story under oblique language 'Coptic churches' obfuscates what occured--muslims once again slaughtering Christians, this time in their place of worship, on one of the holiest days in the Christian calendar, Palm Sunday. Where are all the screaming headlines, the soul searching, the gnashing of morality; where are all the pundits decrying this blatant Christianphobia; where are the politicians bowing their heads in Parliament? Hyprocrites.
Is that what CI (Catholic Institution) want you to say here? Always blaming others for CI clergies sexual abuse of children!  Never own up to what CI clergies did to the children, diabolical crimes for centuries!    ".. that will work for the good of victims and be helpful to the Church in addressing the problems. Must not be angry all the time.  "  LOFL, LOFL, LOFL!  Sure what to be angry all the time for, it just the clergies raped children, ruins children's/their families' lives or children kill themselves!   Every parent knows instantly what to do with the rapist!   Why is it that CI clergy claim that they do not know what to do, I could never figure that out!!!!     Are you sure these 'brainless/no conscience' CI clergies should be a Catholic clergy at all?????????
Stewards of the earth - LOL, fake Christians IMO.
The problem Evangelicals have is that they've painted themselves into a political and theological corner. They take the stance that in order to be an effective leader one must also be a strong moral leader. So, if they support a president whose political agenda matches their own (more or less), they have no choice but to pretend that that president is also a devout Christian.  Trump pushes that notion to it's absurd conclusion, and it reveals the Evangelicals who support him as hypocrites, opportunists, fools -- or all of the above.
This is ridiculous, hiding Hilary behind her sex. I will attack anyone who has done what Trump did (which I didn't need to because he got chewed out earlier), and I will attack Hillary for what she has done. I don't care if they are a girl, Muslim, black, Christian, Mexican, gay, or anything in-between; I will never withhold criticism of actions. I was pointing out the hypocrisy of the statement Trump is bad role model so we should elect Hilary. I believe Hillary is worse, you can disagree and that's ok. But both are terrible role models, and her being a woman doesn't change that.
Yeah, all that bullying done as a direct result of the bullies studying and acting out about Catholic teaching on homosexuality.  \sarc  Few if any adolescents are committing suicide because the Church teaches that homosexual acts are sinful.  Most of the men I know who are homosexual are Jewish.  If there's a common reason for boys with same-sex attraction killing themselves, it's from the realization that they are out of sync with what is an inherent understanding, along with biological and anatomical fact, that boys are supposed to be sexually attracted to girls and vice versa; and witnessing such attraction all around them.
Oh, I forgot we Catholics believe that only authoritarians know truth.  There is really no need for scientists to study it or philosophers to question it because we Catholics know that the Bishop of Rome knows The Truth and in his infallibility could never make a mistake.  The rest of us finite beings are in need of learning from mistakes but not the infallible church!  Oh we all know that to be a good Catholic we must follow like mindless sheep canon law!!!!
Was really interested to read this article after seeing headline. Then I read it. Really said nothing and covered very little. I have always admired Fr. Ruff's writings. Am surprised he linked same-sex marriage to this "movement."  Don't see connection to young priests, considering high percentage of gay priests. Music is so integral to our tradition, yet, I search in vain for a liturgy every Sunday only to be subjected to amateur pop performers. I graduated from a Catholic seminary and hold the M. Div. from the late 1980's. Many priests who are my age bracket, are mediocre litugists and homilists. Liturgy was a peripheral subject back then. I have a right to the rites but only am subjected to self-centered presiding. At least the "younger " clergy," though their clerical lording sickens me, stick to the "script."
Arab states are practicing Apartheid by de-humanizing Christians and practicing slavery of Christians in Sudan and ISIS, the model Islamic Caliphate.   Israeli Arabs and Jews have the same rights. Gaza and PA are different entities. Hamas in Gaza runs apartheid against Christians by forcing Islamic customs and forced conversions to Islam. The penalty for conversion from Islam is death.
vey sad situation and what does it prove??  No one will change their lifestyle. There will be more animosity  shown to Muslims in Germany. It is particularly offensive that terrorists choose this time of year to promote their genocide and hatred for Christians
Great! When can we start addressing polygamous and forced marriaged in the Muslim population of Canada? They pose a much a greater risk. It seems liberals are willing to punish Christians for misbehaving, but not Muslims. Time to even the score.
Larry, you and Johnny Mabry have a fixation.  But "terror" is bad, no matter the justification. Can you agree? - Sikh temple murders: religious terrorism. Shooter thought he was murdering Muslims. - Jewish center murders by a Nazi and Klan member: Thought he was murdering Jews.  Both terrorist acts based on religion of victims - that's religious terrorism.  Of course, Roof murdered 9 innocents in a church not because of their faith, but their race.  Purposeful terror based on race is no good, either.  The Planned Parenthood shooting was extremism based on faiths that demonize Planned Parenthood. Most mass shooters are unstable, but instability doesn't choose the target in a vacuum.  The Orlando shooter wasn't an Islamic extremist, he seems to have been a bisexual man tormented by that and his faith, which like many "Christian" groups, demonize homosexuality. So, unstable in part because of faith, but by what his faith did to him, not what he was supposedly doing for Allah.
The Huckabees are conservative Christian. The way I see it, Plunkett's column is using their religious values to point out the Huckabees' hypocrisy.
Biblically speaking? Please cite the chapter and verse that says human sexuality is much more important than God's ceremonial or moral law.   You cannot, of course, because there is no such verse; I just checked. This must mean...how did you phrase it? Oh, right: "you are ignorant of the true Christian position on these matters."   I have no problem with you misrepresenting Christianity, but if God actually exists, he might not look too favorably on your trying to make him fit your image when it's supposed to be the other way around.
Speaking as an ex-Catholic, I say tell the damn Church and the bishops and cardinals to keep their opinions about politics and the judiciary to themselves.  I left the church rather than to hear them preach about how I should vote when they cannot clean up pedophiles in their own house.  We need to start taxing religions that want to stick thier nose in governement business or who promote one party or candidate over another.  Render unto Caeser what is Caesar's and all that, don't ya' know..
rocky • 5 hours ago  In defense of Donald Trump: Try to keep these points in mind,  Donald Trump did not steal your money.  Donald Trump did not raise your taxes.  Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food.  Donald Trump is not starting a race war.  Donald Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims.  Donald Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda.  Donald Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East.                                                                Donald Trump did not betray Israel.Donald Trump did not let this illegal Alien in the USA,o dump@$$ an the demoRATS did. Donald Trump did not create a 20,000,000,000.000$ debt! LIBERALISM Is It Mental Illness or Demonic Oppression?
I agree with you as long as I do not know that you are Muslim or Christian, or Jew...  Keep your religion  inside your house.
It is a crime to criticize, doubt, or disagree with Islam in Islamic states.  This is blasphemy and the sentence is death. It is a crime and a sin to leave Islam. A Muslim who rejects Islam is an “apostate” and the punishment for apostasy is death (and eternal damnation in hell thereafter). Under sharia, it is forbidden for anyone to try to convert a Muslim to another religion.  When Islam is doubted or defamed in any way, Muslims should violently defend it.  Muslims consider all non-Muslims and non-Muslim culture useless and see their goal to make the whole world Muslim. Everything before Islam is jahiliyya or ignorance, of no value and should be destroyed.   Under Islam, non-Muslims must pay a large tax. Once Muslims conquer a country and convert the government to Islamic law, non-Muslims have the choice to convert or die. However, Christians, Jews, and some Zoroastrians have the choice between becoming Muslim or becoming a dhimmi.   Read Bat Ye'or's publication Eurabia.
I'm all for that, as long as we ban Christianity and all other sky fairy daddy religions too.
(Qur'an 9:5) aka Kill infidels So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.”   So tell me why I shouldn't be fearful of Islam? Muslims near a school yelled at catholic students that they would kill them. Muslims spray painted ISIS on churches, and even last week a Muslim rammed a vehicle into people. Islam is a cult. If M103 goes into affect Trudeau will lose 2019 and a conservative will remove that anti free speech bill.
The Bishops need to hear the truth. To keep raising the doctrinal issue where the legal one aspects are totally ignored is as pathetic as claiming that pluralism is the reason to not act on one’s Catholic beliefs. The result is exactly the same (except that if you elect someone who lied about what they can do about abortion, the movement feels betrayed - which explains the failed personhood movement).
" I don't see the death of Western Christianity as a bad thing " .  It doesn't get much more pathetic than that.
Abortion most certainly IS fundamental.  If you don't get that, you don't get Catholicism or the pro-life position.    Criminals---criminals---have more rights than innocent, unborn babies. If someone was robbing my home and I shot the person---I would have to prove that I shot them because they were a lethal threat.  The act of being in my house and robbing me would not give me the right to shoot them--or even attack them!  In fact in some states, there are laws that allow you to defend yourself--only IF you cannot run away!    When it comes to an innocent, unborn baby, however, all bets are off--huh? That is the one time where a human being can be killed without any due process needing to be followed.  You don't think there is something wrong with that?   And abortion supporters have the audacity and unmitigated gall to condemn the death penalty! At least a cold blooded killer got due process!
Ordination of women is bad enough  but women as bishops is and will always be a deal breaker in the eyes of the RC church.  (Bishops can ordain priests you see - a double whammy).  My husband is Anglican and I am RC.  His bishop is a delightful woman, full of wit and humour, who has shaken up her diocese from top to bottom, reassigned old hangers-on and put the lait in charge of the direction they wanted to go, re: the church.  My bishop, on the other hand, hardly ever goes out of the city limits, refuses to follow the more liberal of the pope's commands, in almost 10 years has yet to visit his more rural parishes, is only concerned about having photo ops in the diocesan newspaper,  requires the common folk to come to him, etc., etc.  If everything else were agreed to except ordination of women, there would be no agreement - ever!  It is the dealbreaker, ergo of primo importance.
As a Christian, think we both agree radical religious terrorists are a blight at best and our world would be a much better place if they didn't exist.  Sadly for any people of faith (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, etc), our hearts are heavy when people justify horrific actions in the name of their faith, twisting the beliefs as they act counter to what mainstream believers hold as most important.  There will always be those who are on the fringe or have crossed over into mental illness.
The best, most Catholic response? Resist this garbage, vocally and prayerfully. Fight that urge to obey that has been bred deeply in each of us. Act as Jesus would.
Card. Wuerl, who squashes priests like bugs. That's the "Catholic Center"?
I guess you are talking about the beheadings of infidels in the Koran?  Or maybe how raping women who aren't muslin isn't rape it is 'war spoils'?  Or maybe you are talking about how if you leave Islam you should be killed.  This isn't radical Islam, this is straight out of the Koran.  How the left thinks they can demonize Christianity and defend Islam at every turn is hypocritical and dangerous.
If they are engaging in same-sex sexual relations then they are gravely sinful acts. You can argue from a secular or non-Catholic position, however, from Scripture and 2000 years of Church teaching your statement above is false. And since this article is within the context of a Catholic Bishop upholding Church teaching and Canon Law, to simply state that "married homosexual relations are not sinful", as though that statement is a Christian truth is deceitful and naive.
I had two boys go through the Ontario school system these past 20 years and there was no attack on Christianity or war on Christmas. Indeed, the school board renting out the school on Sundays to a fundamentalist church.  The Muslim kids aren't being given prayer rooms. They're being given a room to pray in for about 15 minutes each Friday. It's not a dedicated space.  I think it's really about Haters who failed to banish LGBTQ rights and Gay-Straight Alliances and so have moved on to the Muslims as their Two-Minutes of Hate project. Why? Because it masks what they're really up to, which is promoting their own sectarian religious beliefs.
un - friggen - believable... this has all the hallmarks of the Catholic Church ignoring it's problems and thinking just by switching locations makes the problem go away.  ABSOLUTELY CRIMINAL the incompetence of Torres and especially of PPS!  - surviving Beach Elem. family
Boo-hoo...a bunch of left-wing radical feminist nuns who are/were a CANCER were brought on the carpet.  The nuns are why the Catholic Church must divorce herself from social justice baloney.  It's an "attractive nuisance" that is like human feces:  it attracts flies.  Get rid of the social justice garbage, and liberals will be less likely to join the Catholic Church as it resembles more of a fundamentalist Protestant Church in theology and politics.  Liberalism is a fungus.
Shut down the shelter? The soup kitchen? Why not shut down WIC, catholic social services, Salvation Army and the Red Cross while were at it? Your idea is the pinnacle of stupidity and apathy. You villanize and stereotype the homeless, despite the fact that many are vetrans, villagers who came from remote villages and couldnt make a go of it, and whole families with kids in school whos parents lost jobs. Think again hemorrhoid, before we shut down the facilities that keep people from freezing to death or starving.
No doubt this crowd of pious "Christian" hypocrites will attend church services today. If the preacher preaches a sermon on Jesus' words about, "That which you do unto the least of my brethren you also do unto Me.", they will come with sharpened lances to inflicting more wounds on is body as it hangs on the cross. Decent Americans should recoil in anger at the actions of this bunch of Pharisees.
And where were you when the thousands of cases of sexual abuse by Scout leaders surfaced? So does your holier than thou hypocrisy categorize pedophiles and the "gay agenda" as one in the same?  And you have the gall to use the Latter-Day Saints and the Catholic Church starting their own programs as support for your position??????...yeah, we all know how safe kids are in the Catholic Church!  Here is one excerpt from an article on a lawsuit regarding the BSA and Mormon church....  "Schmidt was one of a group of Boy Scouts leaders in Idaho troops sponsored by the Mormon church who were accused of sexually abusing children in the 1970s and ’80s. Recently unsealed files from the Boy Scouts of America reveal that the organization was aware of allegations against these leaders for years, but allowed them to continue working with children."  Apparently your wrath meant looking the other way and supporting the BSA for decades while adults raped children. Wonderful "religious convictions."
I think the comment was excellent.  As we all know, the proper response to any criticism of Trump is "Obama!"  Some might say Trump never demonstrates any of the virtues prized by Christians, but OBAMA!  Multiple divorces?  Obama!  Racist, Obama!  Ad infinitum...
Ken, it was inevitable that you would re-post your already rejected post of your tired, hoary old homophobic chestnut.   We all know that "[T]he [John Jay] researchers found no statistical evidence that gay priests were more likely than straight priests to abuse minors—a finding that undermines a favorite talking point of many conservative Catholics. The disproportionate number of adolescent male victims was about opportunity, not preference or pathology, the report states." https://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/john-jay-report-not-blaming-homosexual-priests
And made fools of themselves and the Church:  Q. Why censure Hans Kung? A. Because the ordinary catholic is a simple person and it is the role of bishops to protect these simple people (simpletons?) fromthe power of the intellectuals Q. Why did God create women? A. Because Adam (the universal man) experienced a loneliness which the presence of the animals could not satisfy,  so that Adam (the universal man) would not descend into a baneful (?) and sterile "encounter with himself"(?!) Q. Did God really, really speak to Eve?  A. Yes,  Q. Surely, that is metaphor? A. His words were "definitive": (and I quote) "...he shall rule over you") Q. Surely you just mean for catholic women? A. No, arn't you listening to me. The church is "expert in humanity" not just in churchiness,.I applies for all women forever "..in the church and in the world".  Didn't you read the title of my "epistle"? Q. I don't think that a reasonable person can buy all that... A. Then you are a "radical feminist", begone.
Quran (7:80-84) - "...For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)".  So the most intolerant and easily influenced followers of Islam feel that they have a duty to make that happen.  And the others ... are not sure.   Of course the Bible has a similar verse, but the New Testament then has a better message to love your neighbor and to love God.  And that helps considerably, for most people. Muslims are a greater danger to gay people than Christians are.  I stand with our gay brothers and sister in solidarity against Muslim terrorists.
When a Christian performs a terrorist act, do you label it a Christian act of terrorism?  People of all religions engage in terrorist acts, most North American terrorist acts are perpetrated by Christians, because they're the majority of terrorists in North America.
Hey Jack Phillips, show me where in the Bible Jesus ever said anything about gay people.  Too many Christians don't seem to have ever actually read the Bible.  It takes a lot of convoluted logic that has been debated as to actual meaning over and over again for the past, at least, 40 years to find any support for the current USA Christian anti-gay bigotry.   The Bible is ambiguous on gay people.  It is not ambiguous about Jesus who it describes as the most saintly person to ever live and seems to have loved everyone purely and defended those downtrodden against hate mongers.  Likewise, there is little ambiguity in the Bible about other rules that homophobic Christians don't seem to care about one hoot:  does Mr. Phillips make cakes for people who violate the sabbath, eat pork, use the Lord's name in vain?  Please stop trying to hide behind religion doctrine that is made up.  Let's call a homophobe a homophobe not a Christian.
Scratch a Obama critic and Racism become evident. Obama is terrorist? Where is the proof? Obama is a Christian.  Pro debt. Obama wasn't allowed by the racist republicans to present a budget to Congress that they would consider. It is republicans who drove the debt higher. and so on.... Total nonsense! Your head is up your derriere.
Christian traitor? Sig Heil much?
You can't make it about Trump without making it about Hillary. If you bash Trump as an "idiot," etc., then you are saying Catholics ought to have voted for an abortion fanatic who was going to persecute Christians every which way imaginable. I.e., the "Catholic" Left is pro-abortion.
If he keeps this up, he might be elevated to Cardinal, but San Diego Bishop Robert McElroy is ignorant and will have people leaving the Catholic Church!  Apparently he forgot that he cannot serve both Caesar and God!  He wants to serve the Caesar of chaos and disunity!
Dammit, if the Natives have casinos, they'll make money and won't be subservient anymore. That'll put a crimp in the centuries of resource and land theft by good godfearing christians. Why, if the Natives start making money, they'll get uppity and start demanding reparations for the centuries of resource and land theft. Ha ha go ahead and erase this, there's more!
Evangelicals support T rump because his values ARE their values. Racism, greed, misogyny, ignorance, homophobia, lust, lying, adultery, hatred of the poor, hypocrisy, bigotry, etc, ad nausem, etc.!  Most of these so called "Religious leaders" have been caught with their pants down in one way or another! But the sheep welcome them back, empty their wallets into the collection plates, and leave their intelligence and self respect at the door of the church. Religion for these hypocrites is a handy disguise, like a wolf in sheep's clothing. They talk out of both sides of their mouths. Like seeks like! President Obama was and is the finest example of a President, husband, and father! Yet they hated him, supposedly because he was pro-choice. No, that hatred was because of the President's race and grace. Abortion just provided handy cover for their racism.
To get to the heart of the matter:  abortion is the issue which galvanizes support among these hypocrites as their rallying cry and justification for electing Trump and the conservative agenda generally.      I have seen staff writers for the NCR opine on this subject in ways that would justify a Trump victory before the election results were in.     A majority (60% according to latest stats) of white Catholics voted for Trump.     I  stop short of saying it is a mortal sin to vote for Trump, but then I don't wish to revert to the enemy.     Personally I am shocked and dismayed by the gullibility, stupidity and general moral malfeasance and hypocrisy of this majority of Catholics and Evangelical right-wing Christians generally. I read the Bible and Catholic teaching differently and see a lot of card-carrying self-justifying Christians refused at the Pearly Gates. Perhaps an "examen" of conscience is in order. Self-justifying religious fraud is the issue, and ignorance is no excuse.
At one time the majority of immigrants were Protestant, Caucasian, and from England and Scotland!  Why oh why did we ever start by  letting  those damn  Irish Catholics into the country during the great potato famine, or the Dutch protestants who built their own schools.  I jest. .  We are richer for our diversity. BTW, I have seen some complaints about immigrants receiving welfare.  Welfare support payments are meant to be short term, ideally 3 months or less, and is never enough to cover basic living expenses for the long term.  The honest recipients are forced to spend all they receive.  Just as an example that benefit is spent on groceries, clothing and other basics.  Looking at  grocery expenses only, that helps support the grocer, his employees, his landlord and the food processors or growers++ all of whom pay taxes to the governments, and their own living expenses, (generating more tax revenue).  All government benefits are "Transfer Payments."
Anyone voting for this bill has no sense of decency. Jesus Christ, think about what you are doing vs. just fulfilling a lame 'political promise'! How can you live with yourself. This is not just about giving tax breaks to the rich, that's bad enough, this bill will truly KILL people. Disgusting.
Please! One yardstick. One set of rules. Puta si! Puto NO! How is she an "ex-adulteress"? And her serial adulterer "husband"? This appointment is a slap in the face to Catholics. Neither of those two have ever exhibited any Catholic values. Singing in the choir only gave her some cover to be the mistress of a right wing Baptist. And, Mr. Brewster has more Christian/Catholic values in his little finger than the Gingrich's have combined.
What about an open letter to the double the number of blacks and Hispanic Christians who voted for Trump?  This article is trying to double down on the false idea that it was the mad white men who put Trump into office.  In that sense this article is racist, because it fails to factor in the actual voting patterns among ALL Christians.
It's mainly a Fox thing because the Christian Right is the last bastion of the Male Chauvinist Pig...
I see your still trying to pit one Christian group against another. Race baiting and now denomination baiting  between Catholic Christians and Baptist Christians and Jews as well. Jesus was a Jew.  Not working.  All Christians, Catholics and Baptists have been the victims of persecution and still are by hate groups here and  all over the world.  Isis executes Christians almost as fast as the old Roman empire did. In many countries throughout the world, to be a Christian is to be marked   for certain death. .   Race baiting is   racism. A very subtle but ugly form.
Are Christian students allowed to attend their religion's prayer meetings at state schools in Muslim states? Probably not. Yet, Muslims demand their children get special treatment in our public schools, Now, that chutzpah.
No, Tridentinus.  I come here for reasonable discussion of the issues both ecclesiastic and non-eclessiastic.   If your idea for a reasonable discussion is that someone has to leave the Catholic Church if they don't agree with you, then you are a troll.
It's ironic that a Catholic bishop is asking the legislators for so-called protection from being forced to marry same-sex couples when the Catholic priests across the world are sexually assaulting children.  Take the beam out of thine own eye bishop  before you try and take a sliver out of a homosexual's eye.  There must  be laughter in Heaven and Hell.
Repeating what I wrote yesterday in response to  Federal court rejects suit to block Liberals’ Saudi arms deal:  In a previous life, before I decided to abandon a thriving consultancy to apply my training and experience to a systematic review of the Koran, http://boreal.ca/Koran/PPPContent.htm I was asked by a senior government official to include in a cost benefit analysis an estimate of the value of the life of an aboriginal http://boreal.ca/Canadian/WhoKilledCAMS.htm .  I imagine that during the discussions the Honourable Stephen Dion had with his officials, before he signed off on the sale of 15 billion dollars' worth of mobile gun platforms to serial abusers of human rights, it was mentioned that they would be used by Muslims to kill Muslims. Did this factor in their cost benefit analysis of the deal?  I doubt very much had this been a sale of weaponry to a despotic Christian regime to be used against Christians, that it would have been approved.
And the Catholic Christians and the non-Catholic Christians killed six million of each other during the "30-Years War" to establish which group was the 'True Church'.  Something they are still arguing about but not killing each other as often about today.  Today most of the religious killing is between the two groups of 'Peaceful' Muslims as to who are the 'True Faith'.  Although some of the 'Peaceful' Muslims want to re-invent the religious fight between the Christians and the Muslims.    And both the Christians and the Muslims both trace their 'Faith' back to a guy named Abraham.
While Jesus replaces the Sun God.  Of course Mary is the "whore of Babylon".  You do realize that these statements have origins among anti-Catholics like Jack Chick, right?
Step 1. Ban Muslims -- omit Jews.  Step 2. Recognize Christianity as the state religion.  Step 3. Ban certain sects of Christianity.   Ladies and gentlemen, in the not-so-long term the Papists are going to be on the condemned list.  We best speak up for our non-Christian brothers and sisters now. The cardinals, bishops, and priests need to be way out in front of this. The Catholic laity needs be close behind.  Unfortunately, I don't have much faith in the clerics.
Craig Stevaux - You've got it all wrong like the rest of your sad ilk.  Even Christians, Jews and atheists from those countries would be temporarily banned just like the Muslims.  Try reading the regulation and quite promoting a lie.  Typical!
"I have seen the political cartoons decades later of the Irish portrayed as apes (very similar to those of Negroes at a different time)" That time would be now. The Obamas have been portrayed as apes for the last 8 years. The KKK is a Christian organization. Islam doesn't have a monopoly on rape, robbery, torture, or murder. Christians thought race based slavery was God's will. Today many still believe being white means being superior. They just elected Trump. They have not been shy about this.
Forced patriotism at a university is kinda like the NFL being paid millions to put the players on the field for the anthem starting in 2009. I am pretty sure an academic institution can not legally mandate patriotsim.   They are non denominational. Are they going to force all Christians to stand for the anthem? Jehova's Witnesses do not salute the flag or pledge allegiance. The Amish may not either. I am sure there are more Christain denominations that do not salute the flag.   Hmm.
Nothing was more important to Jesus Christ than treating disfavored minorities like s**t.
No true Christian would support this soulless, greedy, racist excuse of a human. Trump's cult consists of only faux Christians, who share his lack of morals, ethics, and compassion for our nation's most vulnerable.
As a one more, Where do the souls of McConnells and his ilk's supporters, go when they die? Do they go to their white mans heaven? Or hell? I recall that their white mans jesus was a refugee fleeing a guaranteed death from a propped up Roman Empire despot, who was no different than the double digit despots we prop up worldwide, for the same colonial reasons the Imperial Roman Empire did. I recall that the Jewish priests had the Romans kill the jesus, for messing up their corruption, no different than the Vatican being built off the backs of hundreds of millions slaughtered Natives through the centuries. Yah,I would say that McConnell, his ilk,and their supporters are on a one way ticket to their Christian hell, no different than the Islamic terrorists created by McConnell and his republican and democrat cronies, are on their ways to their Islamic hells, without their 72 virgins, for slaughtering so many thousands of innocents
Several of the comments below are absolutely right on target!  How disingenuous can these men get??  But why are we surprised?   I was unaware of the depth of the Roman Catholic effort on behalf of Donald Trump until several random events brought the sad reality home to me.  First, during an Italian language class, an attendee arrogantly asked our professor, "how can a person call himself a Catholic and vote Democratic?" It became quite apparent in the ensuing discussion that this man had been TAUGHT this position by his parish! Secondly, my 90 year-old, Catholic but socially liberal-minded mother was ready to vote for Trump because she feared committing a sin! The third and final nail in this cross was the report by a recent Vietnamese immigrant, the father of a Catholic priest,  that the only person in his family eligible to vote voted for Trump.  SHAME on this "church!"  The disgraceful, unchristian, reprehensible campaign against Hillary Clinton will cause more pain and suffering!
You're saying your god doesn't believe in abortion? Really? Read the old testament. He orders his minions to kill every man, woman (including pregnant ones) and child (except for the virgin girls!) so many times. He's a psycho. He made homosexuality because to christians he made us all.  In the new testament Jesus does not follow the old rules. Remember an eye for an eye? He changed it to turn the other cheek. Jews stoned people but Jesus didn't. He actually stopped a stoning. Telling them those without sin can continue to stone her.  I'd suggest you read how the bible was put together and when. I did that after Prevo start thumping his bible to keep gay discrimination going. I keep meaning to thank him for helping me become an athiest.
That was exactly what the Australian bishops were talking to the sex abuse victims that RCI (Roman Catholic Institution) is shutting their mouth and will wait 50 years or so until all the outraged Catholics die and they can start over like nothing happened and sex abuse children fresh! LOLOLOLOLOLOL!  :-(  :-( ;-(
LOL, Pot meet kettle.  If anything resembles a "faith", it's "The Church of Climate Blame" of which you are clearly member.   As with any religion, it has its sins (carbon footprint), saints (saint Gore & saint Suzuki), gospels (the legend of the 97%), and unbelievers (deniers of the "true faith" like Trump).  BTW, as for being getting more isolated, it’s the other way around after with Trumps election gave your "religion" a big kick in the junk.
Funny, you don't seem like a rogue Catholic to me.  The church is filled with men who hate feminists and minorities and love BLOTUS.
My apologies rimrock! "This is all about racial injustice and white resentment that minorities no longer know their place in society. "  I didn't know it was said by DT, originally.  what an all around embarrassing trash of men,  DT is! Is DT makes all Americans the trash people since we elected trash for the president of this country? Great I Am a double trash, since I am Catholic beside! What the hell is wrong with 'men'! I hate to admit it, however, I never met a man who I can respect in my entire life in 70years. Why on earth, men can't rise above their Penis? I think the requirment for being a priest should not be a single but cas·trated!  well that is a sure way to solve clergy rape of children scandals!
This is yet another pathetic column by Charles Wohlforth .   He exposed his agenda by telling readers Prevo , in his opinion , hurt a family friend . There was no doubt which way the story would go from there . Just because Wohlforth claims Prevo's day has passed doesn't make it true. Any more than claiming a pastor in Fairview  with a tiny following after only living here a year is an Anchorage Christian leader .    Because of his personal grudge against Prevo he fails to list anything positive Prevo has done for Anchorage over all these years . How fair is that ? Anchorage is a better place for Prevo having been here.  What Wohllforth fails to understand is that basic teachings in the Bible don't change with time.  Anchorage's current most favorite liberal pastor not only doesn't condemn sin , he tells all who will listen basic sins in the Bible are wrong .  Perhaps worst of all is that Wohlforth knows who committed a crime , but won't report it to police.  How honest is that ?
i dont need to see your tax return but i want to see every connection you have to any business, non-profit, association or other institution that might sway your voting one way or another. we know there isn't a person on this planet that is un-corruptible, for the right price. i just dont want to wast time, and cut through the bs and focus on where you will go with your influence. the entire republican party is down on their knees, waiting in line, for their turn to blow trump. that's how much they want to impose christian (the bible) rule on the country.
The bishops long ago hitched their wagon to the RNC to keep the attention of the one-percent and their largesse. If the past election taught us anything it is that many 'Christians' are hypocrites. One can add the USCCB to that cabal. Abortion rates drop under Democrats and rise under Republicans. Why? Because the latter create a toxic social environment. We are seeing more evidence of that with the increase in IUDs provided through Planned Parenthood since Trump's election . The bishops, like their evangelical brethren, ignore the evidence but 'facts' are hard to dispute. As long as we have bishops who 'smell like the 1%' rather than 'smell like the sheep' we will see decreasing influence of the bishops on mainstream Catholics social attitudes and teachings will be completely ignored. We all have 'Religious Freedom" and many of us may express it by ignoring the bishops.
The author was referring to young men in general, not young Muslim men only.  Nice try at setting up a straw man to easily blow down.  Most of the data the author quoted came from the USA, where Muslim young men make up an insignificant fraction of the overall population of young men.  Huge portions of urban USA have problems of violence, drug use, unemployment, you name it.  None of it is related in any way to Islam; in fact right wing Christianity has more influence in these areas.  Read the article again; the point is that young men in general throughout western society are growing up without the influence of a father figure and they end up easily radicalized as a result.  That means gangs in inner cities and peddling drugs, etc., and of course a small proportion also get involved in radical Islam.  Roughly half of the Canadian young men who joined ISIS, were not raised as Muslims and had absolutely no Muslim influence until finding ISIS on the internet.
She supports abortion, reason enough to reject her. Trump gave up control of his assets and isn't accepting a salary as president so exactly how does that make him greedy? And gee, when did you become anointed of God to proclaim a man an atheist  and judge him as a cheating liar when he himself proclaims to be Christian. Leviticus 19:16 "You shall not go around as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not stand up against the life of your neighbor: I am the Lord". I'll pray for you even if you aren't a Christian yourself, which I suspect otherwise you wouldn't have put up such an idiotic post.
Why would it?  Why would the Pell matter force Francis to do anything?  He didn't do anything about Card. O'Brien, nothing to change his status as a cardinal of the Church.  He just let him retire.  Is the standard of the Holy Roman Catholic Church no more than civil law standards?  Maybe, if Pell is found guilty in a civil court of actual child sexual abuse, Francis may act.  My concern is that Francis already has tons of reasons to have acted against Pell for all that was revealed about how he covered-up abuse and how he treated victims - there is enough there already for Francis to have retired Pell.   And he didn't.  Admittedly, he got him out of Australia and into a place where he couldn't keep on treating victims like trash.  He removed Pell from the environment in which Pell was doing great damage to the Church and actually put him in a job for which he might have some useful skills - guarding money.    This Church has no standards better than - greater than - civil law.  Sad.
The little girl with the sign also believes that homosexuals must be killed, Israel and Jews  must be  eradicated, Christians can have their heads cut off, and women including herself are the property of men who may  beat them.  Ain't she sweet?
We used to hang slaves.  We used to burn non-Christians.  We used to slaughter American Indians.  Ahhh...the good ol' days.... /s
Glad you feel that way......  Here is a video clip of Ted Nugent...who has been to the White House to visit Trump, as well as jammed out with that "Good Christian", Mike Huckabee, on Fox News.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q37iySV5KEE  To my knowledge, he has never apologized.  I'm not a fan of Kathy Griffin, and what she did was absolutely disgusting and tasteless, but at least she did apologize.
Yes, and the Church today embraces what is good and true in those other religions, while carefully critiquing "errors and distortions" in them [Paul VI] (as well of course as recognizing the 99% it shares with other Christian churches, while seeking a deeper understanding of what the residual differences signify). You make the Vatican II church seem very stupid, and perhaps you are really reacting to bad theology such as floats about in sites like this?
They are more desperate than "stupid." What they wish would happen (a social and spiritual reawakening -- according to their particular scriptural  tradition and faith), isn't going to be. So they are forlorn,  desponding. They are also experiencing losses. According to the WALL STREET JOURNAL last week, the Southern Baptist Convention (the largest evangelical community), is slipping in numbers. It has dropped a couple of percentage points.   Most Evangelicals voted for Trump because they believed he was the candidate closest, most attuned to their biblical agenda, their church mission, especially regarding gay marriage, abortion, and other issues. No other candidate was so "evangelical." So they voted for Trump believing a thing or two must happen because he said it would happen when he got into the White House. So far, he has appointed a conservative to the Supreme Court and they are hopeful he will do more to bring the country nearer and nearer to their moral aim.
He was talking about how he was molested by a priest at 13.  But that is taken out of context by his enemies who would otherwise proclaim him a victim of the Catholic Church. When he mentioned 'boys' having sex, he was talking as gay men talk about gay men, as in "The Boys are hot tonight".
A total failure as a Texas governor destroying Voting Rights and demanding installing Fundamentalist Christian religion as the law of the land.  By edict dismantling all services for women for reproductive health issues wherever in violation of pseudo-christian dogma.  One more religious fanatic dedicated to the dismantling and eradication of the Constitutional Bill of Rights except the 2nd amendment.  One more ideological Republican fascist nitwit feeding at the government trough which he proclaims to hate so much.  Disgusting.
Yes.  Your comment appeared in support of the comments of utilitas.   I probably should have written: When one supports statements attacking or criticizing a holy book of a certain religion for certain content, the it makes sense to check out if the holy books of other religions have similar content. Sharia law is a term used to refer to the way one ought to arrange one's relationship to God.  The Bible contains such instruction, as well.  Just as the Q'uran directs believers to violent action in certain circumstances, so does the Bible.  John Hobson pointed out one such passage; he could point you to many more.  To suggest that Muslims are more violent than Christians, on the basis of scriptural writing is no only unfair, but disingenuous.
Oh noes, I spoke the truth!  He falsely accuses me of being a troll with 113 shill accounts, and you condemn ME.  He flies the homosexual flag as his avatar, representing an ideology contrary to 2000 years of Catholic Christian doctrine, and you condemn ME.
You wrote:  <<Steven Bannon, who allegedly has some ties to unsavory KKK types...>>  You're not grasping the argument. I doubt Bannon has "some ties" to the KKK. The point is he actively and aggressively promoted an ideology congenial to the white supremacist mission of the KKK.  You wrote:  <<The Confederate Army has been dead for centuries as well, but apparently we still face issues with the simple appearance of it's flag.>>  Typical conservative hand-waving.  Note the Confederate flag represents a treasonous rebellion to defend slavery and its legacy of Jim Crow, systematic terrorism against African Americans, and social and institutional racism.  I have got to wonder how you reconcile Christianity with the ideology of Donald Trump and the alt-right. Hypocrites!
95 percent of Christians are going to hell because they worship on the wrong day.  Saturday is the sabbath day, not Sunday.  Ask any 7th Day Adventist.  Also, if you don't give 10 percent of your gross income to the church before taxes you will go to hell.  Ask any 7th Day Adventist.
The Old Catholics, Polish National Catholics, American Catholic Church, the Womenpriest groups are all schisms on the left.
rangerMC, here is just one paragraph from one article in the american thinker.   'Therefore, at the risk of sounding brutal and cruel, here is my message to transgender people, as if I were speaking to my son. I’m sorry to have to be the one to tell you this, but you are not a girl. It pains me to say so, but you are a boy who thinks you are a girl. It’s not your fault, no more so than it is the fault of sufferers of BIID or other uncured disorders. But you have never been /a girl, and will never become one, no matter how extreme is the pretense. Not even surgery will change that fact.' this is one of the 10 main articles. even the blogs are stupid; read blog on 'no such thing as a free lunch'. the writer compares a free lunch program to the mess in venezuela.   articles i read in american thinker seem to be written by evangelical christians,  liberal haters or they are just plain nuts.   http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2017/07
The fact that soooooo many 'christians' exist to be able to elect this waste of human skin is really a verdict on all org religions.  There were plenty of NY/east coast Jews that voted for this criminal.  Spread that blame around ...   My Atheism stands tall in these modern times.  Morally, there would be NO WAY i'd vote for such a horrible human being.
BROohthor, could it be a deliberate step by Pope Francis to encourage +Muller et alia worry their heads over this kind of stuff so they aren't being ridiculous over other things that make much more difference?  This will throw some people into a tizzy - but most will ignore it.  It will be a burden to those who don't have much money or where the Catholic norms don't fit cultural practices - when will Pope Francis and people like Muller realize this is another form of cultural indoctrination.    Just blows my mind how the Church diminishes God's power and His grace with this kind of nonsense.
I'll name you a hundred Muslim terrorists for one Christian terrorist and it's probably more like a thousand. by the way you sound like a teacher.
Ah yes, the four sins that cry out to heaven. One of which is  "the cry of the people oppressed in Egypt, the cry of the foreigner, the widow, and the orphan. So, if you feel so strongly about it, you must strive for foreigners to be admitted to the United States. Or is your citation selective?  No, you are being a bigot. You want to discriminate against your homosexual brothers and sisters. You are another who says "You shall love your neighbor as yourself; unless your neighbor is gay. That neighbor you shall hate and refuse to have anything to do with." Your "traditional Catholicism" rejects love of God and love of neighbor. That is not being Christ-like.  Your bleat that I am a bigot because I refuse to practice bigotry is typical of the nonsense that Catholic traditionalists spew.
One wishes that those who support "Anti-Muslim hatred has no place in my Canada"  also support and speak up "Anti-CHRISTIAN and JEWISH  hatred has no place in my MIDDLE EAST"  just to be fair
Surprise, surprise. Another case of an accused pedophile in the high ranks of the Roman Catholic Church! Can't believe people still follow this institution.
John Paul II was a jerk.  Plain and simple.  He had no interest in trying to follow the example Jesus gave as we read the gospels. And he tried to set the Church back 100 years.  He was only accurate setting it back 25 years.   I guess the "Vatican boys" finally got to Pope Francis.  Such a legacy John Paul left--mostly all negative.  I can speak with a priest for five minutes and tell whether he is a "John Paul" priest.  Hopefully, Francis is leaving a legacy to be proud of.  Perhaps, ordained women Deacons.
The well-known statistic is that ~3% of any given national population is homosexual.  Worldwide, clerical homosexuality is 2x to 3x higher at ~5-10% of a corps of 450,000+ priests with the Vatican well over ~50%.     Just to show how the intrinsically disordered acts darken the intellect and harden the heart to create a slippery slope that leads to more destructive sins, ~90% of clerical pedophilia is committed by homosexuals compared to ~80% of general population pedophilia.  Satan has always targeted the Church that Jesus Christ built, going all the way back to Judas Iscariot.  The lust of the flesh appears to be Satan's most popular method of temptation for priests.
This proposal by the orange Pillsbury boy to our south is offensive, yes, also so ridiculous as to be unworkable.  How, precisely, is any security screening to determine who is Muslim and who is Christian?  He's not offering refuge to Jews under persecution?  What's with that?  It is not possible to tell if someone is Christian or Muslim by simply looking at them. There are many Lebanese Christians (Danny Thomas and Jamie Farr are two of many examples of Christian Lebanese Americans).  One can't even tell within North America who is a Christian and who is not.  Many sincere Christians do not attend an organized church because they find many to be businesses more interested in securing their financial bottom line than in helping people to connect with God.  Perhaps Trump and some of his fellow Republicans in the Senate and in the House consider themselves to be Christians? Actively seeking to withhold access to quality healthcare based on income is NOT consistent with Jesus' teachings.
I'm imagining two evangelical Christian law graduates, each holding the same views on sex and marriage. The first grad comes from the U of T, the second comes from TWU. Their qualifications to be lawyers are equally shining. However, LSUC might accept the first but would automatically reject the second. Why would LSUC engage in such discrimination? Because it disapproves of a discriminatory rule at TWU.  I get it that a portion of LSUC's membership wished to make a political statement on TWU's policy. And had it just been a statement, no harm would've been done. But now harm is being done. It will be up to the Supreme Court of Canada to determine which harm, TWU's or LSUC's, is the greater.  LSUC has tied itself to a position that is legally and ethically questionable, if not hypocritical. They'll be lucky if the Supreme Court bails them out of the mess by ruling against them.
White liberals are teaching Native American youth to be ashamed of our traditions, just like white Christians used to teach us our gods are evil. It takes a shameless arrogance to lecture to Native American tribes that our mascots of tradition created by Native Americans for Native American's are racist stereotyping of us Injuns. It takes a shameless arrogance to lecture we must do away with our traditions and culture because white liberals find them offensive, just like Christians find our gods offensive. Long before whitey showed up us Red Skins have had mascots but why let facts get in the way when you're teaching a culture we are racist and need to abandon our traditions and culture to adopt the traditions and culture of Political Correct EMOTIONAL CRIPPLES
Exactly what stories did they get wrong? Comey did not call them out on any article. Why lie? It seems that Trump has effectively brainwashed a large segment of the population, including you, to believe that only Fox has real news, when they provably lie constantly.  The fact that Trump still has sixty million supporters means only that many people do not understand the extent of his lies and incompetence and vote based on narrow ideology, often based on evangelical Christian beliefs. Stupid people in large numbers have a lot of power unfortunately.
At issue in some of these comments is whether there are any Canadians  left who are Creationists - i.e. who take the BiBle descripion of creation literally and who would be offended by the GG's derogatory remarks about their intelligence. In fact , recent polls show that over 20% are firmly in this category and another 20% are not sure. WHile, as a Catholic I am free,  as two popes have asserted, to believe as most scientists do in the Big Bang (formulated by a Jesuit priest in 1920s), I firmly support the constitutional right of  more fundamentalist Christians and other Bible users - up to 40% of Canadians -  to practise their faith, or speculate on the process of Creation, without the Head of State, supported  by the Prime Minister, treating them as stupid idiots .
What associations does "white violence" have with Christianity?  What associations does "Muslim violence" have with Islam?  Didn't mean to destroy your argument.  Maybe I did.
radicalized christian terrorists
Check your Constitution and Supreme Court rulings.  "..founded based on Judeo-Christian principles..." is just the continuous lie thrown out in every forum by the fundamentalist christian horde.
It doesn't really matter.  People who are Liberals, even if they are Christians, will have no problem with what she said.  That's because today, it ONLY matters if "your team" is in power.  Even if the policies "your team" implements actually is destructive, it does not matter.  I find it funny that our dear leader will run around with a turban on, or a native headdress, or head to a mosque while his wife is shuffled upstairs,  claiming to support said groups, only to rush to the defense of his chosen pick after she blasts those who may in fact believe something different.  I find this fascinating. It's about science Mr. Trudeau states, shortly after he kneels in front of a grave of a soldier, then "crosses" himself, as most catholics do.  Why, if it's about science would he do that since only idiots believe in something else?   he is a hypocrite, and he would do anything for a picture, while having his peeps plan the destruction of the country right in front of our eyes.
The Church does not teach that Mary "never died'. Projecting your sexual issues, much?
Surely it must be one of those disenfranchised Catholics.
Gee, it's the Christians that at prosecuting the twisted people that are killing the abortion providers. Further, I don't see those twisted people indiscriminately targeting the entire population if they have an issue with a particular part of it.
If and when the U.S.A. and it allies ever get rid of Daesh (ISIS/IL), will they then go after and eliminate all the Muslim groups, like Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, the Taliban, al Qaeda, Abu Sayyaf, Boko Haram, al Shabaab, etc. and all the other groups of Muslims in many countries around the world , that want to destroy Jews, Christians and non believers?
We all know the jew'ish' people are NOT the Hebrew or even Hebrew-Israelites.  They are Yiddish speakers and european decent.  Its all over the internet.  Why are we still talking about these imposters?  The state-of-israel was created back in 1947-48 and we have been dealing with their soul-less extermination of Palestinian's of all ages.  Being Jew'ish' is the same as being a christian these days:  the rest of us know its a sham-religion-man-made for a certain reason to present LIES TO THE WORLD and cover up who the REAL ISRAELITES ARE!
So therefore you will refuse to actually research verifiable sources and confirm or disprove the true and real FACTS behind the argument.   Dude.  Corporations pay little or no taxes.  I know it doesn't fit your made up little alternative fact reality that reinforces your selfish little world view, an that's your right.  Just know that it makes you someone that can't be trusted, is inherently corrupt, and someone Jesus himself finds abhorrent.  Good luck with that.  May God have Mercy on your soul.
The evangelicals argue they can effect change if they have a seat at the table. While so seated they appear to have become drunk with power. These self-identified 'religious' are doing more to increase the numbers of the 'nones' than any preaching of irrelevant dogma could possibly effect. People look at what people do, not what they say. This applies to all clerics; christian or non-christian. Hypocrisy is an indelible paint and these folks are using it in buckets.
The Catholic Church knows first hand what happens when you allow homosexual males to have close contact with young boys.
At best, these potential slaves were bound for factory work (with low pay and poor conditions), as likely, work in fields and at worst work in the drug trade or prostitution (likely catering to undocumented migrants). My bet is that the person who is buying these people likes immigration law exactly the way it is, with a compliant workforce that can be deported if it demands humanity and a local sheriff that will track down runaways (undocumented migrants don’t get cars). At the heart, the problem is not immigration. It is capitalism. The driver knows who he was delivering to and who hired him. Getting the information from him should be no problem.  The Texas Catholic Conference is pathetic. To sell out immigrants for school cholice and abortion provisions (that likely will be overtruned) shows how much they are in the pocket of the Republican Party. The USCCB is as pathetic, but that is because Archbishop Kurtz is an arch-Republican. That is outrageous.
Yes, yes, yes.  He is slandering his confreres and fellow Christians to build himself up.  "*I* am not like *those people*.  They criticize; I think you're good just the way you are..."  The age-old patter of chatlatans and womanizing cads, but applied to a different problem.
What happened to separation of church and state?  Who cares what the catholics think.
It is odd how the bad things about a person get so glossed over, and we look at them through rose-colored glasses after death.   Ali was a bigot.  He looked down on white people and Christians.  The radical Malcolm X himself converted him to follow the Nation of Islam, which is a well recognized hate group with strong antisemitism, and gave him his name of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.  And he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: "I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough"  And he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam "a white man's war", and said that "My enemy is the white people!"    Other quotes from Ali: "All Jews and gentiles are devils",  "The sins of drinking, smoking, prostitution, homosexuality, stealing, gambling: It all comes from white people."
I'm already stocking up on pop-corn. It's gonna be a bloodbath; a spectacle the likes of which hasn't been seen since colosseum days.  By the way, the whole "romans feeding Christians to the lions" thing is a lie.  Fake history, begun by Christians.
The only thing that is embarrassing is the omnipotence of your replies.  For a man that says he is Christian, you might try a little Buddhist humility.
Stupid as saying all Christians are responsible for paving the middle east over the years when it has been mostly the US and Britain
It would be plagiarism if Sid took credit for Tom Burke's writing  What was Sid writing about? He was calling the President a big fat liar. He listed his sources and almost dared you to prove him wrong. All you could say was  "this man hates others". I can fill this comment with all the lies and hate spewed forth by Donald Trump. So is Donald Trump a liar? . Is Donald Trump an unrepentant sinner. I believe you are a serious Christian and a Christian supporting Trump. Is Donald Trump a repentant sinner? He lies again and again and is unapologetic, he has committed adultery at least twice that we know of and shows no remorse, molested women and is shameless, demeans women over and over again with no apologies, is he unrepentant; remorseless, unashamed,shameless, unapologetic! I side with Sid. . A repentant sinner would go and sin no more, “See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you”  . Donald Trump is a liar and a unrepentant sinner. or prove him wrong.
This is far from being a "gratuitous smear". Trump's angry, racist remarks about Mexicans and Muslims have emboldened the alt-right and other white supremacist groups who now feel it's acceptable to attack anyone who doesn't meet their white, Christian American standards.
Regarding fake news, you said: "A sense exists across the spectrum of political inclinations that the recent presidential campaign was, above all, an unremitting and damaging assault on valued traditions and decorum. Perhaps no departure from the norm was so dangerous as the ugly attacks on standard journalism and the concomitant and utter disregard for facts that, sadly, won the day." Please, this fake news began with Ronald Reagan and his buddy Pope John Paul II. Today's GOP and Religious Right lies and endless viciousness and endless fake news (outright lying) really began with Teflon man Reagan. Their desire to get Reagan elected was borne of lies, racism, inuenndo, etc,etc. Let us recall the character assassination and innuendo of SE. Joe McCarthy ( R-Wis, Catholic, alcoholic) and the anti-communism witch trials.
You might be Catholic but "those guys" are sanctimonious "holy" ROMAN Catholics.
Your build your argument with fallacious logic and manipulative rhetoric.      More Americans have been terrorized bombed and murder by white Christian extremists  since 9/11  than by  Muslim extremists.    What about all those Christian Militia compounds in ID, MT, TX and other states around the nation?     What about those religious and polygamist compounds of the FLDS church  which range from Canada to Mexico from UT to ND.  MT to TX. ?      You can use all the glittering generalities, intangible nouns, and emotion triggering words you want.   You can use your passive aggressive  innuendoes to spark suspicions and fear.    But as you see they don't work well when your spun dumb propagandist rhetoric.
"What a silly and short sighted post. God is genderless. It's our own inability to understand His Fatherhood that makes us think in the little categories you think the Church teaches in."  What a silly and short sighted post. God is female. It's our own inability to understand Her Motherhood that makes us think in the little categories  you think the Church teaches in.
They should ignore and dismiss the poor and sick just as Jesus did.  I just don't get how Republicans can claim to be Christian with their greedy, uncaring behavior.
It is unlikely that there will be any change in the culture of the Church until women and men are treated as equals before God and are allowed to study together for the priesthood, whether they are gay or straight, married or single. The hierarchical structure needs to change to a horizontal structure that honors the majority viewpoints. The early Church relied very much on the "sense of the faithful". This means that the lay people were the voice of the Church and it was their common sense that determined the horizontal structures of the Church. The head of the Church was Jesus, not the pope, and that made all the difference. What are we doing honoring a human being as the head of the Church, especially when popes are ignoring the commands of Jesus and worshiping an institution instead? It has been many years since I have heard a bishop talk about living the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. All we hear are bishops interfering in the sexual lives of the lay people. Very sad.
"Only the light of Christ can quench the torches of hatred and violence. Let us pray for peace," said Bishop DiLorenzo in his statement. "I pray that those men and women on both sides can talk and seek solutions to their differences respectfully."  DiLorenzo goes the Trump route and blames everyone.  What a profile in cowardice!
What happened to "just say no? " Illegal immigration, NAFTA, greed, white privilege, deep, pervasive prevalence of intense self-absorption, selfies and electronic age w/less actual/genuine communication and real intimacy, increase in no personal relationship w/anything bigger than self and the SUV, political correctness in the Christian Churches (so they don't offend anyone) illegal immigration, vast corruption w/in U.S. government and rampant corruption w/in Federal government in bed w/cartels and drug companies-Big Pharma,illegal immigration.....
False equivalence. Here's a hint: The Bible doesn't command pedophile priests...   Please stop defending a religion you've obviously never studied with trendy cliches. You're making an ass of yourself.
No - you are NOT right. Debate about abortion is fine when it is rational and compassionate. Under those terms solutions may actually be found. Our societal problems do need to be addressed and discussed, but what you and other "holier than thou"  one-issue obsessed Catholics do concerning abortion is not argument- it is bullying and demonizing the pathetic women who find themselves in a crisis situation.  It's not Christian behavior towards those we need to have compassion for. There is no "pro-abortion" stance. No woman could possibly want to have an abortion!  As soon as your nasty inflammatory language comes out - you lose any pretense of rational debate. You just end up looking like sadistic, sexist, insecure, schoolyard bullies.
NUKE the Rothschild-Bauer FORCED occupation of Israel. Talmudic infant killing blood drinking Jews created the Democrat, Socialist, Communist, and Liberal all to destabilise nations. Now we have Jew funded factions like Antifa'g popping up all over America. The Jews primary enemy has become the Moslem! Jews demoralised America over the last 100 years with Satanic Qabalist Hollywood. They RAPE our children. Their music "industry" screams modern slavery. Besides this TRUTH.... Why fight JEW Battles? Whites and Blacks usually get along... The Crypto-Jews ran the transatlantic slave trade. So why are White non-slave owner Americans in 2017 under attack? One answer.... Devious Evil JEWS.  Don't be fooled.... I am a Jewish anti-semite. I like being an anti-semite. When you study Jewish history for 47 years like I have you KNOW damn well who the enemy of humanity is. I am Judeo-Christian. I am on the right side. All blessings be to Jesus Christ and G🕍d!! #AmericaFirst #SimonOfTrentsRevenge
None of Catholic clergies are close to Holy Mary then! Her out of this world beauty and her power to stand on the serpent's head is from her purity.   All the children on earth are her children, and you clergies raped her children!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Our spiritual journey is a process of purifying our soul!   What Pope F. is doing protecting & condoning the rapist clergies for what?  Is Pope wish to send his clergies especially to 'Hell'?  Protect Catholic Church's name and all of your clergies end up in 'Hell'???   What kind of infantile idea was that!
Your racist bigotry against all religions except christian and all government except pure conservative Republican no matter the topic spews forth again.  Obama is to blame for everything being a black man daring to hold the highest office in the land.  If only more Bush, Trump, Cruz, ad nauseum were in charge, the nation would be just hunky dory.  Stupid.
RichardCory> you nailed your fellow hypocrite Democrats down perfectly! Care to tell us what happened to the CBS lawyer whom had no sympathy for Republicans? LOL  "CBS has fired a corporate lawyer who said on social media about the Las Vegas mass shooting that she wasn’t sympathetic because “country music fans often are Republican gun-toters.” http://www.staradvertiser.com/2017/10/02/breaking-news/cbs-fires-lawyer-for-social-media-comment-on-las-vegas/  Also, let's not forget... The 5 Worst/Recent Mass Murders in the USA (with a Firearm) Came from Democrats  * Ft Hood: Registered Democrat/Muslim. * Columbine: Too young to vote; both families were registered Democrats and progressive liberals. * Virginia Tech: Wrote hate mail to President Bush and to his staff. * Colorado Theater: Registered Democrat; staff worker on the Obama campaign; Occupy Wall Street participant; progressive liberal. * Connecticut School Shooter: Registered Democrat; hated Christians.
SNAP neither confirms nor denies accusations. The do however give victims a voice.  Odd, why don't priests stand up alongside the victims? It's a brotherhood, that's why.  And those abused and denied a childhood and adulthood are denied by the catholic church's lobby efforts again,,, horrid
Women do not do anything better than men except get pregnant and give birth.  They don't raise children better or nurture better, we are not better parents.  This is more nonsense designed to justify sexism in our church.  Men don't represent Jesus Christ better, therefore there is no reason to keep women from ordination as priests, bishops, cardinals or popes period.  To insist upon highlighting every flesh difference one group has verses another in hopes of making others see that group as more different and therefore in need of restrictions is  a form of hatred.  Whites have done this to blacks and so has our church done this to blacks.   People do this to justify ethnic disparity of treatment as well.  Any discrimination done against a group of people based on flesh is an attack against that group's human dignity and all Christians must stand against the individual who purports this hatred no matter who they are and critique that person's behavior for the sake of that person's soul.
Do you not think pedophilia is a crime?   How many Catholic priests have to rape kids before we start arresting them?   Do the priests have to murder our children  after raping them before we get concerned?  There are 6,528/116,153 (5.6% ) of priests who have been  subjects of *credible* sexual abuse allegations in North America alone.  17, 651 victims.  http://www.bishop-accountability.org/AtAGlance/USCCB_Yearly_Data_on_Accused_Priests.htm  How many Muslims in the US have killed people for jihad?  Less than 2 dozen.  Include 9/11 hijackers and it's 3 dozen.   That's far less  than 1% of all Muslims in the US.    Only 48 people have been killed by Islamic terrorists on US soil.    If you include 9/11 there are still far fewer murderers representing Mecca than child Rapists from Rome. http://securitydata.newamerica.net/extremists/deadly-attacks.html   For the record,  I think raping children for decades and then hiding the evidence is criminal conduct.
"as a human being and as a roman catholic" Scaramouche says.  He is an embarrassment to both, just like his nutzo boss.
Quite so, and the really sad part is that Trump plays up to his Evangelical advisors but values their counsel about the same as he values everybody else's, which is not at all.   To surrender self respect for the sake of politics is bad enough, but to do it and come up empty is pathetic.
MSW posts a compassionate and important article calling Catholics to action against Trump's immigration orders, and you strain to find one sentence with which you disagree and lob an ad hominem suggesting he is insane. Classy.
That was a joke, and a jab at your comment. You made reference to Christian women being fridgid. Your insane if you even think I'd meet with you.
You are absolutely correct. You know that religious freedom garbage we were force fed in school about that being the reason for the pilgrims? Those fanatics were being hung and imprisoned in England for practicing their version of Christianity, so the came to these shores and set up theocracies, killing those who opposed them. In modern times, they would go to prison here too, so they get the government to implement their violence for them, thus they can walk away and say: see, we have no blood on our hands!
Well, Islam, Christianity and Hinduism all believe in invisible beings who never, ever show themselves and who apparently have super powers used to direct some sort of a petri dish experiment here on earth. Try raising that idea in any arena other than religion and 'lunatic' is precisely the word that gets applied. I don't see why religion gets a pass, but it does. In terms of 'infringement' I again go to the simple question...when was the last time an atheist was knocking at your door trying to convert you?
There are bad people in ALL religions, look at this week's arrest of a long-time teacher/ child  molester at a Bellevue, WA Christian school, the Warren Jeffs who have sex with 11-12 year old "wives" in the name of religion, and the multitude of Catholic priests who molest and rape boys.
John, basically your claim is that the Catholic Church is homophobic, that orthodox Jews are homophobic, and that Muslims are homophobic.  That seems to support a couple of conclusions:  you're intolerant, you're a heterophobe.  If the shoe fits, wear it.
Y'know, I find all this hubbub somewhat hypocritical.  Polygynous marriages of up to four wives have been legal in my faith since its beginnings.  Yet most Masajid ('mosques') in the US don't dare perform them, to the point of issuing written warnings to their congregations that they cannot do so on pain of secular legal sanction.  I don't hear anyone protesting this clear denial of our religious freedom.  Yet secular authorities threaten to coerce Catholic churches to act contrary to THEIR tenets and 'conservative Christians' throw a fit.  Why the double-standard?  I'd really like to know.  If Christian churches can stand up to secular mandate to defend their congregants' beliefs, I don't see why we can't defend our rights against secular authority to abrogate our beliefs and practices concerning marriage.  And unlike 'same-sex' marriages, polygyny was recognized in both the Old and New Testaments.  Yet another 'Christian' double-standard rears its ugly head.  Halleleujah.
I wonder, if bishops, prelates  and Pope F. realize how this RCI shameful treatment of clergy sex abuse scandals also chasing the God called young men away from this corrupt CI (Catholic Institution!
We accommodate Mennonites and Hutterites  in Western Canada. Public school Teachers have to go to the colonies to teach. Mennonite men will not serve in the Canadian military even if drafted due to their religious beliefs. What message does that send to society?  Violent Christians such as Timothy McVeigh bomb government buildings in the US killing children, and Christian activists threaten and occasionally do shoot doctors performing abortions. No apologies from the Christian community for these nut bars... Zionist settler extremists in Israel assassinated Yitzak Rabine for pursuing peace on the West Bank.  Point is Islam is certainly not the only Abrahamic religion with violent and extreme members who twist faith into something awful.   It would seem to an outside observer that the "guise of religious freedom" in Canada  is somehow only to be applied to accommodate Christians and Jews and not others.
Exactly, your examples of Christian misdeeds are IN THE PAST. Crusades? McKinley? Lol Please! How about Charlie Hebdo? Nice? Istanbul? 9/11? The Taliban? Genital mutilation? Child brides? Arranged marriages with under age girls? Slavery? All things that are happening TO DAY in the muslim world. Backwardsness. Uncertainty. Schism. That is what you offer? No thank you. Your examples of Islamic schism are proof of its instability and violence. We don't want that rubbish here. People still killing each other over a centuries' old dispute over who should acsend Mohammed. Islam requires governmental despotism in order to thrive. Why else would all those Islamic nations be ruled by dictators? Too often all one sees is senseless murder, pestilence, apathy and despotism in those countries. Oh whitey's fault again?! Oh but the British, the French...It gets old. Quite clearly any sensible person would decide not to invite the common thread of all that violence into their community: Islam.
Again with the hateful, dishonest and cowardly comment, from a real hater!!  You're either a complete moron, Islamist in disguise, as many of these terrorist cowards are-hiding in populated areas, hiding behind women/children, hiding in Mosques, hiding in burkas, etc.  It's radical Muslims gunning down everyone, not Christians, Jews, Hindus, etc, FACT!  And too many, possibly ones like you, are quick to challenge others for being at fault; knowing all to well for you to stand as an honorable man and openly denounce these radical atrocities would "surely"  get your little liberal snowflake butt in a whole world of trouble!!  Stand up and be counted and see who really shoots you in the back!!!   And all you do is rattle off your in-tolerant and dishonest opinion; you have to because, while you may shout down my comments you're not able to refute my statements. Because all you have, is how you lived there, so what!!
Christians shooting christians is something I’m willing to live with.  Jesus will protect me. Now if the shooter was a muslim that’s where I draw the line.
The Pope is called far worse by regular Catholic bloggers on here for his teachings on women, gender theory, homosexuality and abortion.
Donald Trump is the lead character in Being There, Chauncey the Gardener who likes to watch television.  In this case, FoxNews.  He seems to only watch Fox if he wants his truth.  If he watches any other news program or hears quotes, it is so he can argue with them.  As long as his fellow Fox viewers still like him, he considers himself a success.  As long as the pastors of those viewers endorse him, he feels holy, and sadly, there are such. More sadly, some are Catholic priests and bishops. They are the ones who should know better.  I don't expect it of Trump, who is simply a pathetic character.
You forgot gettingvthe sisters back into habits, getting sent to hell for a hot dog on Friday and all Catholics wearing at least one scapular 24/7.  Oh, and getting rid of girl altar boys.
Arrogant and presumptuous to say conservative Catholics don't care about "the common good."  Who is donating those millions  of dollars to Catholic charities?   Just progressive Catholics who ladle out soup?
More of that judicial activism so hated by the fascists in the hands of anyone except themselves.  This judge should be removed from any legal activity immediately.  Every decision is tainted by his religious fascism in violation of the national and state constitutions.  Texas judicial systems are infested with the same traitors to the Constitution and all human rights contained therein.  Texas is home to the greatest quantity of fascists existing in the nation joined with the entire Old South Confederacy finding all human rights abhorrent to the ruling fundamentalist christian fascists of the Oil Monopoly.  Sadly, Alaska has been and continues to be infected with the same diseases.
Isn't it time for all progressive Catholics to refuse to stand for the Nation Anthem?   Or some other form of contempt for the United States for its treatment of Catholic Americans?  Your Jesus wanted anarchy, right?
Were I a Catholic, I would worry more about someone going from mouth to mouth and sticking their  fingers inside.  How disgusting.
The suspect, 35-year-old Jeremy Joseph Christian, has a history of making bigoted comments online and was photographed giving a Nazi salute at a recent protest organized by the group behind the “Trump Free Speech Rally.”  Haha, knew they had to try and weasel in Trump here when in fact the killer hated Trump and was a big Bernie supporter.   http://dailycaller.com/2017/05/28/portland-killer-is-an-anti-circumcision-bernie-sanders-supporter/  Also F this mayor....what a moron.
Iran's morality police, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan's "blasphemy" laws... the left believes it's "Islamaphobic" to bring up issues staring everyone else in the face like a fat man in a diaper. When Iranian women were beaten by regime thugs and thrown in jail for dancing to Pharrell's "Happy", crickets from the perpetually offended activists. When Iranian men led a peaceful protest against forcing women to wear head coverings by donning their own, crickets from the perpetually offended activists... the same goes for the Christian woman facing the death penalty in Pakistan for "blaspheming" at work, of course her word is irrelevant... As for the Saudis, Saudi Arabia certainly has it's issues but without the ruling Monarchy, it would likely descend into chaos, anarchy, and perpetual war. Robert Lacey's "Inside the Kingdom" is an interesting read...
Liberals daily and for years have shown their superiority over others.  You believe blacks are too stupid to achieve a college degree unless you help them with affirmative action.  And do try to follow the news.  I doubt it got by you that some parents won't let the gender be put on the birth certificate because they haven't decided on the gender.  Being a former Jewish agnostic, it doesn't bother you that Christianity is under assault.  And even though neither you nor I feel under assault, you can't deny that we are accused for all the world's ills.  Gays should be treated like everyone else because it's right.  Gays can purchase any pre made cake they want at Masterpiece Bakery because it's right.
It is astonishing that a Catholic bishop can leave it up to locals, members of his flock, 'the sheep', entrusted to him by Our Lord in his diocese, to decide for themselves upon the issue of same-sex 'marriage'. Not only Catholics but the whole human race is prohibited from indulging in homosexual activity by the Divine and Natural Laws. If people can make up their own minds about what is good and what is evil, what is the point of Christ and His Church; what is the point of this bishop and those like him?
If I call you a liar, then it is because you lied. As I said, I have one and only one criterion for saying that someone is a liar: Has that person lied?  You said that the magisterium never changed a teaching. This is a lie. I gave you the specific example of Pius IX saying that freedom of religion was an insanity, while Vatican II said it was a basic right of all people -- you lied when you said that these statements did not contradict each other.  I called you unchristian when you condemned that official of the Knights of Malta to hell for working to distribute condoms to sex slaves to prevent them getting sexually transmitted diseases. (And you lied when you say that you have not said that anyone was going to hell.) The unloving, unmerciful and unjust God you have created in your own image and likeness might condemn such a man to hell, the God that actual Christians worship would not. I am not "casting aspersions on your character", I and describing your lack of Christian love.
You are completely wrong. Only one person died and was resurrected . He was the first and last.  You know we are sinking when a pastor of all people spews garbage like this. Real people of faith mourn the thought of the decline of Christianity---are not happy about it.
No "good" Catholics support Martin, who supports soddomy.
I was actually responding to Tom Z's thinking: "I suggest you find someone who has accepted the Church's teaching and has married and raised a family to better understand the Church's position on the matter."  If the uber Catholic anti gay folks are down to demanding sacrilegious marriages as the cure for 'the gay' they are on a very stupid path.
"I don't think it's based on Catholic women's perception that Trump is a "predator," because, frankly, if these women are at all informed, they know on the issue of sexual predation, the track record of both candidates is at best a wash."  So Hillary has been repeatedly accused of sexual assault, including the underaged!  Where did you hear that?
well, they are brown, they speak Arabic and call God "Allah" so they are probably Muslims in disguise, claiming to be Christians to get our sympathy.   everyone knows "real" Christians are white and speak English.    funny, I notice none of our regular righties are expressing any anger over their Catholic compatriots despair and danger.    they pay lip service to protecting the Christians in the Middle East, but heaven forbid they should actually help them.
Walker just stole $1000 dollars from every person in the state today.   He stole families food, heating oil, medical supplies all of which provide our kids with their future.  To deny a child a future in such a way is to molest that child. So I think we can say that Bill Walker is now effectively the most prominent child molester in the state history short of the Catholic Church.
What a disgrace this Archbishop Chapult is to the Church and to decency of human beings...  He considers himself to be more catholic than God, and God is not even Catholic
The Catholic Church has never needed permission to pick and choose for whom it would perform any ceremony.  That has not changed because the *states* are now required to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples.  There is no relationship between the two.  Obergefell does not require any church to do a single damn thing.  And everyone with an IQ above room temperature knows that or is capable of reading the decision and figuring that out.   The Catholics used to be focused on things like orphanages and priceless artifacts and poisoning each other at the Vatican.  They should stick to that, and stop trying to gin up more false grist for the propaganda machine that is rapidly destroying our democracy and turning the U.S. into ungovernable factions where every problem has to be solved in federal court. Sorry, boys (and it is boys, because the nuns *do not care*) we aren't going back to any of the centuries you would like to return to.  Go back to arguing about angels and pinheads.
T.S., well said, but you're being too kind when you never once mention the word 'Catholic.' The church in 2016 was supposed to pay 25 million to help survivors but it got off on a technicality. The gang is still at it: some bishops ask Catholic girls not to get the HPV vaccine; many still anti-gay; women can never be priests--and it all gets pretty toxic this stuff in poorer countries. The worldwide sexual assaulting priest scandals...sigh.
The hell we learned about in Catholic childhood, like burning in fire forever without relief hell--that is there for us if we screw up? Something worse than anyone on earth could do to us?  Some people believe in this.  And if this is so, God is not stern?  Come on.  God cannot be loving and kind and burn us forever.  That hell is made up by the church to frighten people into control.  And many people believe in it.  It is still the official church teaching I think.
Pope is the anti-christ.  Roman Catholics welcome all of you to "Team Satan."  The devil and his demons said keep feeding me your  children. "Feed me more."  The devil and his demons are the angels of light who masquerades as the servant of righteousness.  RC flock are either very, very, stupid or very, very, smart.  Just like a dog who keeps returning to his own vomit and a washed pig that returns to the mud, they never learn.
People where burnt at the stake by Christians for saying the world was round, and are still put to death today for being atheists in Islamic countries. Religion is the curse on humanity. That is why I'm agnostic...because I can't have a relationship with God when it's interfered with by, hardliners that take a 2000 year old fairytale literally, that goes for Christianity and Islam. One can have a relationship with God without all that ballony.
Get a life, people like you with no proof at all just parroting stupid stuff make me sick. Get the facts and post all the proven Radical Christian attacks and horror stories going on in the Country. That's right ... NONE.
I love how Dobson thinks trump is a baby christian but believes Obama is a Muslim. The hypocrisy is yuuuuge!
I have yet to see a Christian or Jewish terrorist strap a bomb to himself and blow up innocent children.  I agree not all Muslims are terrorists. But almost all the terrorists do seem to be Muslim. Coincidence? I don't think so. It is clearly religiously inspired terrorism.
BLM are anarchist anti Christian! There chaotic rioters
Please BEWARE of this site. It is not a Catholic site and is likely funded by George Soros.  If you are Catholic then you know the horrid atrocities the DNC and Clinton's engaged in, attempting to infiltrate the Catholic Church and cause a "revolution" within the church by pretending to be catholic and misleading the faithful.... This is unprecedented!  Never before in American History has any political entity shown such distain for our sacred church...  All Catholics must work together to elect Trump and keep Hillary out of the White House. Trump is not perfect, but Hillary is doing the devils work!
That is how early Christians destroyed the ancient Roman civilization,: by smashing one statue at a time.
They remember it 'cause it was named after the real General Robert E Lee.   BTW You confused "Dukes" with "Smoky and the Bandit", another classic from the 80's. Hollowood  already did a politically correct  remake of the "Dukes" and "removed" the Confederate flag that had been on the top of the "original"  Gen. Lee.  They did not, however change it's name   Do at least a little bit of   research before posting next time.  Burt Reynolds doesn't act anymore and Jerry Reed is dead.   . Your hatred of Christianity certainly does show.   Baptists go back  long before America was even a nation.   You are as   misinformed as you are  spiteful.
Kurgan, like myself is a failed seminarian. I have noticed that many former seminarians turn against the Church when they leave. Kurgan or Nic as he used to call himself and whatever other names he goes under spends most of his time here mocking Catholicism and Catholics of all descriptions. What you perceive to be satire is in fact nothing but ridicule and contempt. Unlike Kurgan I do not harbour a grudge, I accept that I did not become a priest and my desire is to work to prevent the Church I was baptised into becoming just another Protestant sect.
Morlino certainly has treated his gay priests that way in the past, at least in terms of not attending their funerals.... I think especially of one who worked closely with a Catholic gay community in Morlino's previous diocesan assignment as a bishop.  Morlino is an interesting person.  Funerals seem to be where his ultra orthodoxy becomes prevalent. It's the line he will not cross, dead being dead and all.
The Roman church is toast.  The writing is on the wall.
Oh, “BIGOTRY!” Homosexual acts are sinful, and, according to Sacred Scripture, one of the four sins “crying to heaven for vengeance.”  A gay marriage is (un)naturally going to involve said acts.  Are you capable of comprehending this?  The baker doesn’t want to participate in a wedding that promotes this sin.  Now, a bigot is “a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; [you certainly fit that description to a tee] especially :one who regards or treats the members of a group (such as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance.” The question boils down to obstinacy and intolerance.  Well, when bases his opinion or belief of something as crystal clear as”homosexual behavior is sinful”, is it obstinacy or principled dissent?  And why do you think we should be tolerant of sin?  That certainly isn’t Christ-like, being as that Christ admonished everyone to “sin no more.”  You are the obstinate bigot here, clearly.
But the Christ as supernatural entity believers also tend to believe in Reincarnation and Astrology.   Pick one and stick to it please.  Once you are ignorant enough to believe one brand of superstition it seems that you have little trouble believe contradictory brands. The human mind is amazing in what it can rationalise, against all evidence.
Wow... what a stupid response. The challenge was to find examples of Christians committing the same amount of attacks as Muslims, you mainly posted about white people.. not only is your comment far reaching but also slightly racist against white people. For example- you pointed to Sandy Hook. Was he white- yes. Christian? No... that is equivalent to me saying that a black man shooting someone is a Muslim attack. And shall we compare death tolls to your examples vs the daily attacks in the name of Islam? While I was writing this post, several people were probably murdered in the name of Islam for offenses such as apostasy or homosexuality. Do yourself a favor and start paying attention to the REAL concern of Islamic terrorism. Also, read the Quran a bit.. then study the history of Muhammed, a man who beheaded many, many people and also married a 6 year old girl. Then ask yourself why you are defending this religion.
Kayden, religion has nothing to do with this. Hinduphobia- no it's cult and self seeking power hungry crooks like your man Butler that jump on the religious wagon who have no qualms about lying and cheating their way up the political ladder.  In Tulsi Gabbard's case, her guru has taken advantage of her cult beliefs she was born into and abused the fact that she is beholden to him. As he says when he initiates his disciples, you are now mine and I will instruct you how you can serve ME. Fanaticism not religion.  Cry yourself silly with all your talk on religious bigotry, homophobic backed support, Hillary Clinton money, and whatever else you can lash out with.  How about all the other religions, I don't see Tulsi and Butler supporting them. In fact she down right degrades the Muslims. Butler has always spoken very unkindly of Gays, Blacks, Muslims Christians and Jews.  Beware Hawaii, Tulsi and anyone who adheres to him, has no place in our democratic system.
[CLIP OF SEAN SPICER PRESS CONFERENCE IN JANUARY 2017]  SPICER: Carter Page is an individual that the president-elect does not know..         In March of 2016, Trump was asked who would be advising him on foreign policy.  TRUMP: Well, I hadn’t thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names… Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and counter-terrorism expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, he’s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg;  Jeff Sessions was named as Trump's chief foreign policy advisor later that same day.  March 2017:  Did you meet Sergey Kislyak?  PAGE: I'm not going to deny that I talked to him.  Extra credit:  Joe Schmitz, jumped out at me. Extreme Christian fascist white supremacist tied to Blackwater.  http://tinyurl.com/hq48ekk  One happy family, of fascist traitors.
There has never been a Catholic prelate who has spewed as much venom at LGBT people as Pell, and now we know why; he was desperate to cover secrets of his own.
When neighbors write stupid, arrogant or unchristian things, then I will criticize them. For example, when you say that the magisterium must be followed without question, I simply point out that this is the attitude that Adolf Eichmann took, and question if you want him as your role model -- a question which you have NEVER given a coherent response to. Or when you take the silly attitude that to disagree with the magisterium on anything is the same as disagreeing on everything, which says that you apparently cannot distinguish between what is essential and what is less important. Or when Pandora says that Barack Obama, America's version of Tony Blair, is an extreme leftist -- which would have any actual leftist howl with laughter. Or when RD preaches humility, but refuses to practice it. Or when I am told that having gays lose their jobs for marrying is just.  Yes, I do not suffer fools or hypocrites gladly. I am often not kind or humble. But I do care about my Christian faith.
Dylan roof was a mentally ill little scum bag and McVey was likely a cointelpro patsy...it's remarkable that the left's love affair with Islam considering the things Islam stands for are in such stark contrast to liberal western thinking. I think because the left and Islam both oppose Christianity and Americanism it an enemy or their enemies type of thing.
Muslims and liberals excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of Christianity, Europe and America, destructive iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal wars between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects, ISIS , Taliban and Al Quada are the root causes of most of the wars and social chaos happening around the world today. They are not here to share in what we have built in Canada, but to take it.
"If Donald Trump is the Next Hitler then I am joining his SS to put an end to Monotheist Question. All Zionist Jews, All Christians who do not follow Christ's teaching of Love, Charity, and Forgiveness And All Jihadi Muslims are going to Madagascar or the Ovens/FEMA Camps!!! Does this make me a fascist!!!" --Jeremy Christian
you are hating on Amy like she is a feral cat owner. what she said was what was already being said in the media, so bfd. so many lame cowards who lost to trump and can't attack him so they go for soft target like Amy.  you live and breed hate for all Caucasians  christians and especially white males.
"That's a warped version of Christianity."  Religious authoritarians everywhere are a menace to democracy and peaceful co-existence. ISIS is but the most extreme manifestation.  In the wake of Charlottesville not one member of Trump's Evangelical Council has resigned. Corporate fat cats acted with more moral principle, however calculated, than Christians. Good luck to the 400 dissociating authoritarianism and racial animus from white American Christianity. We need look no further than the conservatives on this forum, so offended by any suggestion that racism is a persistent evil in the United States, to get a sense of how how tough that row is to hoe.  White Christians put Trump in power and despite Trump's appalling tenure thus far continue to support him.  It's striking evidence that the prerogatives of the religious right are first and foremost theocratic. And if white supremacy is part of the bargain, apparently for Trump supporters that's a feature, not a bug.
So who called out Notley when she said Catholics don’t have consensual sex. Is that coded language for male Catholics are rapists?  The fact that she wouldn’t aknowledge what she says puts her as a bigot and racist?
Rarely do I agree with Jamie Manson, but I agree with many of her points today. To me, a conservative Republican and practicing Catholic with a gay son,   Father Martin appears to be very unorthodox in his theological and moral views. I've been somewhat successful as a businessman,  and I've been lucky enough to give generously to the Catholic Church.   I would never give to a bishop who was not clearly and unambiguously anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage.   Jamie is right about that aspect of this situation.   By the way, my son and I get along very well.   He knows not to force me to accept his views about homosexuality,  and he doesn't have to accept mine.   Though on many issues,  we see eye to eye,  especially on abortion and economic issues.
I am now talking like most church-going Alaska Natives, mostly wayward Republicans, in the year of our Lord 2016, but I am speaking in jest. Donald Trump is a hopeless sinner who must now come to Jesus and get saved for he is a despicable liar, a danger to society, a menace to the country, and a bent-for-hell loser. President Obama was and continues to be a saint compared to this sin-infested Judas. We must condemn him to hell.
"We have to choose to stop invasion of fake news"  Completely agree, of course, but as we witnessed the past year in these comment threads and beyond, parsing fact from fiction has zero effect on partisans. If people are convinced that Hillary is a corrupt baby killer BENGHAZI emails! and (my favorite, often accompanied by the wistful asides of the wise) that "both candidates are the worst ever," as if there were not orders of magnitudes of difference between them, no volume of reality-based data matters. There have been far worse candidates than Hillary Clinton, but Trump is the worst of them all.  Every charge against Hillary made by Trump and his supporters appear to have been sheer projection. Trump's chief advisors are a sortof-neo-Nazi (Steve Bannon) and a professional spinmeister (Kellyanne Conway). They are both conservative Catholics. Conservative Catholics were instrumental in the production and dissemination of fake news and the election of Donald Trump.
Sorry Jonah--the straw man fails the smell test, he's rotten to the core. I dislike Pence because he's a 'Sunday go to meeting' Christian who has lost any sense of the god of love. His policies are aweful--he left the state for the VP because he was likely to lose reelection because the folks of his states knew and felt what he really believed...it's not the Christian God but the old Testament vengeful god he follows. So his cute and a bit strange bio wasn't the issue...although he wants to do things to Women;s right I think are a crime, he can act however he wants in private. Isn't that the real point Jonah? That he should be asked to be judged by the content of his actions, of how he chooses to love others, and the policies he uses to make life for all better. In this test he's a loser!
Still ignorant Qbcoach15 must be all those Traumatic Brain Injuries.  Muslim Culture (do not prove your ignorance by saying "Religion") is a Culture of War.    Mohammad unified the Waring Tribes that were killing themselves, into Large Armies, his Armies were conquering "the Known World".  His large Armies had a Severe Logistics Problem, Mohammad then wrote the Holy Koran making it Law for All Nations to provide Food, Clothing, Support, Money to the Armies, and that All Must Join the Jihad without any excuses.  109 Suras of the 114 Suras of the Holy Koran are the Declared War Against Christians, Jews, Unbelievers.  The 5 Suras state that Peace will be achieved when all Christians, Jews, Unbelievers are Subjugated to Islam.  The Holy Celebration of Ramadan is the Muslim Celebration of the Defeats and Massacres of the Christians, Jews, Unbelievers.  Ramadan Fasting represents the Muslims getting up before dawn eating and drinking then going into Combat without food and water.  continued
OK, so-called Last Patriot, what about Catholic priests that hide behind their collar as they're raping children and they just get moved from parish to parish.  Isn't this the height of hypocrisy?  And what about the Catholic gay or lesbian church member.  Don't they have rights too?  This issue will wind back up in the US Supreme Court where it needs to be.
Poor people in third world countries are under attack by "christians" every day---maybe it's time you get your head out of the sand and start paying attention...
Strange to see white catholics defending white supremacists attacking hispanic catholics.  I guess some feel they gotta stand with their race, rather than their religion?
Oh you mean directly opposed to the teachings of the sexist male hierarchy of the church who blatantly and sinfully discriminate against women? Catholics most certainly do support a women's right to bodily autonomy and reproductive choice. I am a proud member of Catholics for Choice. All of you self-righteous busybodies should mind your own business!
So glad to see we have a spokesman for all Christianity!!  It's about time all Christians were told who, what, when, where and how to practice their particular religion.  The ONLY error I see in Mr. Brule's argument is with respect to a President wanting to have a bad law repealed (one that violates the First Amendment, and basically blackmails those who would practice religious free speech!), is Christ's admonition to "render unto Caesar..." etc.  Those wanting to keep the Johnson Amendment as law, seem to have something to fear, to have their "brand" of secular "morality" and "ethics" called into question, from the pulpit. (And for someone on the left to be concerned with someone being a "sexual predator" and a "liar"  smacks of their complete blindness to their own former presidents, candidates, etc....those attributes are what their party is built on!!)
Bravo ! Old white males just need to.learn to "STFD" (Sit Tha Fuck Down).  this type of unjust inequality which pervades all throughout western society is in reality the contemporary version of the white supremacist ideology which has fueled white christian genocide, slavery, domination, oppression and imperialism throughout the world for centuries.  the world is changing and diversity and equality are rising up everywhere so old white men just need to "STFD" !
Susie, you pathetic moron, show us proof that you and your uneducated rural ilk are "paying for their, and all other illegal aliens healthcare, food, education, etc..."  You can't, because "illegals" are a net positive in US society. Check out the AFB American Farm Bureau data sometime. And get an education, you poor, pathetic kook. You're an ugly person inside and out (and probably claim to be Christian as well, what a laugh).
Trump's boasting of grabbing a woman's pussy without her permission is not locker room bragging. To call it that is to denigrate women, men, and locker room talk. He was the presidential candidate,. but given the alternative of Hillary, people minimized his behavior and the women who confirmed his sexual assaults. As Meleana said, "boy talk" from a presidential candidate.  You second assertion that we assume Christians agree with everything a politician does is not correct. We know Christians are generally not single issue voters, but many ARE Right to Life Voters. When Trump said a woman who gets an abortion must be punished, he got the Right to Life vote.  And no, they should not have voted for Hillary either. All I would ask is that they admit they are not so pious as they profess (but then deny because they are "humble before God). Trump is a narcissist who even complained that he got Person of the Year instead of Man of the Year. Winning for him is empty because he beat losers.
The hypocrisy of the Christian 'right' is front and center in this election. They support a serial adulterer, misogynist, racist, xenophobe, and nativist who will divide our country more than at any time since the Civil War all in the name of 'pro-life'. Yet he stated he wants Roe vs Wade overturned to hand the issue back to the states. That will not end abortion since at least 26 states will permit abortion in any and most circumstances. We need to come together as a people and address the causes for abortion since this is a symptom not the disease. Only through a paradigm shift in our culture which recognizes that women have full agency as citizens can we address their needs so they can choose life.
What a bunch of nonsense. Perhaps Catholic universities should "focus" on....teaching Catholicism. "We have to find the theological resources that give us the ground to stand on"? The catechism, Holy Scripture, the Magisterium, or the Summa are "[in]sufficient theological resources" {As an aside, Aquinas addressed the issue of immigration and his thoughts are VERY similar to the president's}. As for the 'LGBTQ community", or anyone who violates the Sixth or Ninth Commandments, the way to "minister effectively" to them is to call their attention that such acts are mortally sinful, and that perdition is not a "safe space".
I have not asked for "tolerance" to MY religion. You are wrong about the spelling of mo. It has been rendered in English in several ways. Insulting Christianity with "fairy tales" and false interpretations of what Christianity consists of is insulting Christianity. You insulted Christianity. I just pointed out the flaws in your history and interpretations. If you are muslim, and are "consistent" with the core beliefs as expressed in the Qu'ran, YOU hate Christians and Jews and atheists and esp homosexuals and condemn them to death. Otherwise, you have no scholarship with which to insult Christianity and support islam.
"Tell the Democrats that. They love to tell you how to ..." The Republicans have a lot to say as they guide schoolkids into Christian prayer and keep car dealerships closed on Sundays and even convince you they're serious about cutting taxes. Come on, try to admit that some Republicans are just as nutty as some Democrats.
How many Catholic bishops will make a deal with the devil in exchange for an anti-abortion Supreme court nominee? What deal? Supporting racist and anti-Muslim policies by Trump! The Pro-life movement associated with the Susan B Anthony group have already doused themselves in the Trump Swamp. They have forever weakened and dirtied their message by glorifying the Pussy Grabber in Chief. Many people who may have been supportive of their work will turn away because of their mindless support of the GOP and a man like T rump.
In the lake of fire, the fire don't quench and maggots (Catholics priests)(cowards)  don't die.
And some point at Islam as an inhumane religion.  Christianity has its own warts to acknowledge.
Unless said baker is very stupid and is looking to be put out of business then the baker would of course decorate a silly cake with the inscription, "The Catholic Church is the One, True Church of Christ on Earth," take the person's money, and then cry themselves all the way to the bank. Every minute of every day of every year business people do business with people whose personal ideologies may offend them if only they knew their innermost thoughts. It is the selective moralizing evident in these particular cases that is at issue, and everyone knows it.
John, basically your claim is that Catholics are homophobic, that orthodox Jews are homophobic, and that Muslims are homophobic.  That seems to support a couple of conclusions: you're intolerant, you're a heterophobe.
You are joking right? Historically Christianity has been far more oppressive and done far more damage. And today the Buddhists in Myanmar are showing that even that religion can house violent thugs. If you actually look at the daily media space you see far more of it taken up by 'Christian' issues, like homophobia, right to choice, etc. You are blind to your own biases.
That's what's always bothered me the most about the Catholic Mass--all the blood and brains on the floor!  I guess you can't tell when you are hallucinating.
Why are you being such a Christian phobe racist and bigot? Canada already has enough superstitious fundamentalist teachers indoctrinating kids about religion and Stone Age thinking: just go to your nearest Canadian Muslim school or Canadian public school whose kids learn about Sharia law and readings from Islamist superstitious books
I'm sure Obama has a database on ISIL members, and they're ALL Muslim.  If it were a Christian database, libwingers would be all for it.
What we have here is a baker who wishes to practice discrimination against gays, and he wants to claim that his "Christian" religion supports him. He is doing EXACTLY the same thing that racists in the days of Jim Crow did in refusing to serve blacks.   I am vehement on this subject because I have a personal interest. My brother is gay, as are some of my closest friends. My mother's parents and other members of my family were killed by the Nazis because they were Jews. My daughter-in-law is African-American, and her grandfather was telling me about life under Jim Crow, stories that I believe explicitly. I have been raised to hate discrimination with all my strength, and I know what happens if it is allowed to go unchecked. It starts with "No Dogs Or Jews" and ends with Treblinka.  In places like Chechnya, gays are imprisoned and killed. The Republican US Senate nominee from Alabama, Roy Moore, wants to do the same thing here. At least some people here seem to have no problem with it.
Thousands are murdered in this country every year.  The overwhelming majority of those murders grew up in Christian households.  By your "logic" we should ban Christians.
My personal take on religions as a whole, at least the basic message is, "Don't be a jerk".  You can argue about the definition of what being a jerk is, but ultimately, that is the basic message.  If you do good in the world, to take your quote above, your soul will prosper, but ultimately, you are doing good to make the world a better place.  At least that is my take on it.    Glad to see a Minister speak out against the whole prosperity gospel, which as a non-Christian offends me, I think as a Christian, I would be a whole lot more upset by it.
The United Church is no longer a church. They teach no real Christian history to their young; they're too fearful to make a pronouncement about culture, ritual, or morality. My parents were United Church. Most are such cloistered wasps with a guilt complex, you could blow them over with a gust of wind.   I had the opportunity to visit an evangelical church (filled with kids) for a secular meeting. In the basement, I saw lessons on the wall for kids about Christians being the most persecuted religion on earth. Finally, here I see a sense of community.   Why not turn all the churches into Bingo halls? Jesus would love that one.
Catholic priests wants all of you to "feed their penis."  The priests has a message:  trust in us is to trust in God.  Ha Ha Ha
Over and over in the Muslim bible it tells them to kill all people who will not convert. This is not islamophobia people. This is the right to life! I have a right to live knowing if one of their people will kill me as I am a Christian. A Muslim student in the school I work at was screaming "I'll kill all Christian 's". So tell us again why we shouldn't be afraid??? Please? Tell me???
The left's pro-Islamic stance is merely a reflection of the "enemy of my enemies". They hate Christians, Christianity, and all things they see as "traditional" America, and because Islam is the antithesis of these things it is to be propped up, defended, and legitimized at every turn. It's a form of Stockholm syndrome. Just look at how Germany and Sweden are dealing within the destruction of their cultures...being in more Muslims who aren't assimilating to replace the native population in the name of "diversity" at all costs.
"I had relatives killed by fellow Christians in Ireland during 'the Troubles""  Liar.
Crux is an independent publication. DUH.  And  by what ridiculous stretch do you fancy that Crux is favored in any way by the faithful Catholic remnant.  Truth, please.
The article says "At least 44 people were killed in Egypt in bomb attacks at the cathedral of the Coptic Pope and another church on Palm Sunday, prompting anger and fear among Christians and leading to troop deployments and the declaration of a three-month state of emergency".  Muslims in Egypt have attacked Christians and their churches before.  And Muslims have attacked Christians and burned their churches in Pakistan.  I don't think the Christians in Egypt and Pakistan are attacking Muslims in Iraq or Syria and I don't think they are attacking Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslims so why would Muslims attack Christians in Egypt and Pakistan? That doesn't seem very tolerant.   If Muslims aren't following the verses in the Qur'an that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers, why are Muslims attacking Coptic Christians in Egypt and why are Muslims attacking Christians and burning their churches in Pakistan?  Please explain the reason.
You should have one of your child raped and try to kill him/herself, and see if you could worry about the possible mis use of money by SNAP!—yjin117  My sins crucified my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  In the United States the accused, in this case SNAP, is considered innocent until proven guilty.   Do you know these clergies raped Christ/God when they raped children?—yjin117 Worse, but who am I to complain about what is in the eyes of others, when there is such a beam in my own eye, particularly below the level of consciousness.
Unsurprising how DFL is adverse to science and progressive principles. Unsurprising how they are hypocritically willing to subvert justice and fairness in order to achieve their goals. Unsurprising, because Christians have, throughout history, always been antiscience, always anti-progression, always been hypocritical, and always been willing to do despicable things to protect the status quo. They have always been on the wring side of history.  As an atheist, I'm tired of this. I'm supposed to leave them to their superstitions, but they think its fine to dictate to everyone about who we date,  whether we can have premarital sex, what a woman must do with her body, what substances we can ingest, what day of the week we can buy alcohol, etc, etc, etc (etc for days...I could go for days). If Christians think I'm being unfair, then they need to take an active stand against the interference of their faith in the lives of those who don't subscribe to their belief system. Enough!
You think this only happens in Australia?  The Catholic church has paid out over $3 billion for covering up sexual abuse in the US alone... https://www.ncronline.org/news/accountability/ncr-research-costs-sex-abuse-crisis-us-church-underestimated
Don't forget the Armenia holocaust of 1 million Christians by peaceful muslims and that six million number has been officially revised by the Holocaust authorities themselves. Let's talk about the Jihad against Indians shall we, Koenard Elst in Negationism in India gives an estimate of 80 million Hindus killed in the total jihad against India and let's not forget why the Crusades happened! It was because of 400 years of islamic barbarism, Can we forget how Mohammed thanked the Jews who helped him in Medina? He killed them, chopped off their heads. Some prophet, killing God's chosen and those Nazi's weren't Christians! It is also estimated that Over 110 Million Blacks were killed by Islam. So Christians can hardly be considered the biggest mass murderers, it isn't any surprise who really are the biggest mass murderers in history, estimated at a whopping 250 million and that is muslims.
Doesn't matter, Trump and his Christian Terrorist will be happy being reunited in Heaven when the world ends...That's why they're willing to take us out and the world...Sad, not to different from those Muslim Terrorist they're afraid of...#MAGA
I like that you separated Muslims into a specific subset, the ones that believe  the fundamentalist values you mentions.   You know that not all Muslims agree with those specific values.     I know that not All Christians think of murdering their son, beating children with a rod, offering their daughters for sex, believe that a woman worked with a snake to corrupt the origin perfect human - a single male made from dirt, or that women were createed from the rib of a man.    ================== It seems part of our human nature is  to 'rank' ourselves in comparison to others, in our personal life, our work life, even our spiritual lives.   It's impossible for a diverse culture to completely eliminate that conflict of human ego's.     When people must be 'ranked',  you can believe it creates anger and hostility.  LOL, look at this room!
Sorry Alexandea, any group that denies science and wants to trample over the constitution's freedom of religion- for all religions- is wrong. There are many beliefs in evangelicals "faith" as well as Catholics "faith" that are plain stupid!
Bishop Thomas Paprocki, to replace Pope Francis. The Catholic Church is not a club, either you follow it or you are not a Catholic. Also please don't engage on my monologue, you unhinged crazy liberals .
2/ Now we know around 52% of Catholic Christians voted for...Tiberius (without the brains).  Since the election we've been offered plenty of pious talk on unity and dialoguing and healing that seems utterly divorced from reality. Sorry, I don't play with white supremacist thugs and misogynists. From my perspective, the US Catholic bishops were willing to sacrifice the well-being of millions and millions of people worldwide over their stifling obsessions with abortion and same-sex marriage. This is how the majestic Catholic Church has come to be defined in the US: a hostile, morbid cult that values fetuses above all other forms of human life.  So I'm done.
You were the one who wrote "liberal NCR Catholics think the kind of public witness the Mormons do, if done by Catholics is a bad thing". Unless you perform public witness, your statement is nothing more than a whinge.
If what you say is true, it's pretty pathetic that the millenials main understanding about the Catholic church is its teachings on sexuality.  And ironic that the only ones talking about the Church's teachings on sexuality are secular homosexuals and feminists in the media, not the Church.  Meanwhile, countless young women are being pressured into being sexual objects by a culture that equates recreational sex with freedom and equality.  And the guys LOVE it:  No more having to take a girl out to dinner a few times to get into her pants!
The "seal of Confession" is/was supposed to be a protection for the penitent, not a wall of silence to shelter criminal predator priests with impunity.  Priests who weaponize the confessional as an opportunity to rape and sodomize children and vulnerable adults should not be able to use "the seal" to dodge and conceal their criminal assaults - ever.  Part of any reform and renewal of the priesthood Catholics should restrict the faculties for confessors to those men and women who have received special training in psychology and certification of their probity.   Priests have been abusing the confessional since the early centuries of the church.  The sacrament of Reconciliation is suppose to be a source of mercy and peace - not an occasion of rape for sexual perverts:  Time for reform!
Asexual Catholic Bureaucrats, who think their peculiar sexuality is universal, so that they can speak for ua all.  This is just not the case. Anyone who accepts their marital advice is divorced.
Maybe it's not so much that Trump evangelicals reject Christ as they really know very little about the historical Jesus, his example, or what he stood for. It could be a situation where the Trump evangelicals, habituated to being overindulged by the Republican party, would embrace any candidate, however perverted and degenerate, that massaged them just right.  I enjoy imagining evangelicals on election day, casting their vote for the candidate that appeared on a Playboy magazine cover with a scantily clad Playboy bunny, her hand reaching down through the back of her dress and peeking out of the bottom of her dress only inches from Trump's genital area. It gives me satisfaction knowing that there is no limit beyond which evangelicals will not debase themselves in their quest for worldly power.
John it sounds like you are mocking Christians, now that is hate speech!
If a bunch of christian crazies were doing this and people protested it, they would not be called hate or whatever, it would be just what it is - people who want a SECULAR school system. ENOUGH, NO MORE PROPAGANDA! No religion in school. None, zero. IT IS NOT HATE TO DEMAND THAT!
Uplifting stories: 1) Residents of Mountain View are proud of their community and working hard to make it a better place, 2) life is still pretty great for white, Christian, heterosexual males, despite their whining to the contrary. Those two are just off the top of my head!
So ... is Milwaukee gonna deny church funerals to abusing priests and bishops who covered up for them, and who played shell games with money?  After all, we wouldn't want scandal and confusion.  Hypocrites.  And then to complain about the directive being made public.  What did they think was going to happen?  Their priests were going to secretly refuse funerals for LGBT people?
This is comparing apples and oranges.  GLBT Catholics first start at a severe disadvantage the minute they come out of the closet.  Secondly, you are describing heterosexual adultery which harms a married spouse, always and every time.  Monogamous gay relationships do not harm in other adults.
The gun didn't choose to massacre a church full of Christians. A maggot chose to do that, whose mind was filled with hate, perhaps by swimming in a cultural sewer created by the left over the past several decades. The interesting angle, which you're ignoring, is that the leftwing media will ignore or severely downplay this creep's hatred of Christians. Now, if he had attacked a mosque, that would be an entirely different story, wouldn't it? Or if he had yelled "Allawah Akbar." C'mon, be honest.
Funny.  I have heard it said that Salome may have been Mary's sister...which makes more sense than your scenario if Salome was the mother of James and John...considering James and John were close to Jesus in age.  I've not seen any credible or respected source that claims she was his sister.  And I guess the ever-desperate effort to argue Mary was not perpetually virgin goes along with the need to justify the sexual mores of today.   Talk about vincible ignorance!!  *lol*
so this writer is pro abortion, pro homosexuality and pro hillary clinton who consorts with openly satanic people? wow what a real catholic you are... disgusting.
Catholic schools should be abolished. They are the remnants of a corrupt and outdated way of thought.
Nope, your bible verses don't apply to illegal aliens.    Out they go!
Islam still holds grudges going back 1000 years.  The Crusades were  actually an attempt to get back for Europe the Christian lands of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and most importantly Jerusalem  stolen by Muslims in bloody thirsty conquest.  Islam was determined to exterminate  Christianity, and still is.
"If the idea that Jesus had two natures makes sense to you, you need to have both your heads examined."  It is Christian dogma that Christ had two natures, he was fully human and fully divine.  I wish that idiotic 1000 character limit was removed, so I could post on the christological fights of the early Church in proper detail.
So what if muslims become the majority?  Anybody who knows any muslims knows they are little different from any other religion or culture.     How often have you heard the muslim community balk at usury?  Almost never, and its too bad.  Personally I think we ought to subscribe to that jewish and christian notion of forgiving debts every seven years.  But what can you do?      It practically goes without saying that in a century Canada won't be predominantly white.  So what?  I lived in Waterloo where some streets by the university are in chinese. So what?
Fr. Martin will probably not lose hope. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for countless gay Catholic youth who, upon realizing where the church really stands with regard to their lives, will simply walk away because of this controversy, as have so many countless others before them, never to be seen or heard from again. Sadly, that's just the way some "faithful Catholics" want it.
No, Kurgan, We need more modernism in the Church so that everyone can be happy and gay, at least we can pretend can't we? People will flock to the church when we will pretend that the destruction of Sodom and Gormorah was a mistake by our omniscient God and that he really accepts sodomy now. What a wonderful church we will become. We had better start building mega churches!
Egypt used to be a majority Christian country. Now  a minority, Christians   are persecuted and  fleeing. History repeating itself in so many countries.  Given the healthy demography of Muslim population, same will happen to countries such as France, (more than 10% Muslim), Great Britain (more Muslim than Christian babies born in Birmingham) or Germany.  It has already started: a non Muslim can no longer walk safely in some areas of France.  The police is scared to go there.   In the meantime our dear Canadian leader continues focusing on "Islamophobia' laws, and 'diversity is our strength' nonsense.
"DiNardo said Catholic teaching clearly "supports the right of a sovereign nation to ensure the integrity of its borders and to enforce its laws. We object, however, when laws and policies fail to respect human rights or fail to ensure due process in its justice system. Often the U.S. immigration system does not meet this test.""  And you feel the same way about laws that protect children from pedophile priests -- because they interfere with the "human rights" of religious freedom and separation of church and state.  Prog and Trad Catholic clerics are equal masters when it comes to double-talk and hypocrisy.
Anyone who votes for Clinton is NOT Catholic...period.   You are condoning abortion which is an abomination in the eyes of our Lord. Hypocrites all of you!
Cheetolini truly a sick ****.  When do we get to outlaw super fakey 'christians' from gov't jobs??!!
Its pretty easy to figure it out, FC, if you apply your mind to it. Abortion is one issue among many. Donald Trump was pro-abortion until he realised that there were a lot of votes to be had among the Catholic stoopid, if he did a U-turn. And of course there is the fact that the Republicans have had plenty of time in office to do something about abortion but didn't. There is also the inconvenient fact that abortions actually rise in number during Republican presidencies. Critically aware Catholics could not possibly vote for Trump.  48% of Catholics were astute enough to realise this and took other important issues into account, especially issues which are core to Christ's teachings. 52% of Catholics ignored their own Pope, the gospel and principles which contribute to healthy society and voted for a horse's ass for president.  Such people justify their decision by appealing to Church teaching while completely ignoring specific teachings of Christ.
Christian, Jew and Muslims are always fighting. Canada should have no part in it or them.
Hahahaha I made a STATEMENT!!!!  Not a threat, I'm no Christian either. Stopping a predator is not a crime nor illegal. Keep in mind 90% of conservatives own weapons, legally. And I'll add I'm a airborne, light infantry fighter. Your active response will dealt with quickly.. and swiftly.  Take your grade school threats to the playground. Don't mess with the professionals.  You're as dumb as they come.
Jesus was a Jew, followed Jewish law, was called Rabbi (teacher), and founded Christianity. He didn't have to say anything about homosexuality or abortion, because He was a practicing Jew. Neither were acceptable, and anyone that has spent any time reading the Bible would know so. Please, read before you write your nonsense and confuse the foolish.
So has Christianity. This is one man, one case. There are a few boneheads but this is not "widely abused".
Thousands of years ago, men who wrote the Bible warned of people like you that would eventually claim bad to be good, right to be wrong, and who would denounce Jesus Christ.  Sucks to be you.
If I hear one more time that "the nuns were being forced to provide birth control" I'm going to scream. It was very simple: sign and file the piece of paper stating it would violate your conscience to provide it, and the government will remove that burden by arranging with third parties to extend the coverage. That was the religious accommodation. To say that they were compromised because OTHER parties were not prevented from dealing with each other, and extending or receiving contraceptive coverage (bear in mind that not all Little Sisters employees are even Catholic) is absolutely ludicrous.   Well, one thing is for certain: you can't reduce the abortion rate without contraception. More burning stupid. Welcome to another day.
The support for Trump by white evangelicals says more about their Christian faith than it does about Trump. He knows and likes being a con man. He also loves the "poorly educated" white folks that elected him. The Trump voters care much more about being white than being Christians, Americans, or being human beings. This works for them, since they don't believe in facts. They have faith, ideology, fear, hate, and racism to inform them about how the world works. Too bad that the "poorly educated" white folks that elected Trump will suffer the most during his administration. When has he ever cared about any of  them? Trump is a tall, rich, lazy, fat, white man that has not respect for anyone that he doesn't agree with him. That goes double if those folks aren't white males. Too bad Trump cares about his voters less than he cares about the contractors he has stiffed. Trump voters will deserve what happens to them. Maybe some bleeding heart white liberals will care about them in 2020.
Just goes to show the real republican view of sanctity of life.  Life begins at conception but ends at birth.  After that you are on your own with no help or assistance from a republican government.  Be proud republicans of your hypocrisy.  How do you live with yourselves?  Good thing you aren't Christians.
Those fundamentalists Christians should NOT be accommodated. That is ridiculous!
@Micheal Morrow   "..Mormon minority membership remains miniscule" I think you mean minuscule. However the Mormon church is quite successful recruiting non-whites. They have hundreds of thousands of members in Mexico, Brazil, the Pacific in particular.  Ironically, while you might be slightly more open to a progressive form of Christianity, 91% of those types - mainline churches - are white. That's a problem, for them.
This is just a sickening spectacle. Ignorant Christian Extremists who believe that a mentally ill man who in no way represents the teachings of Christ is on their side. I suppose if you're ignorant enough to fall for religions extremism, you're ignorant enough to fall for a con man as a president.
Christian or not, they did not murder in the name of God. They were certainly evil and radical extremist but were anti-government and many believe they were reacting to the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents.  The Muslim radical extremists are doing their deeds in the name of God.
Some men "who took a vow" raped little children.  Then celebrated mass.  And kept on celebrating masses for years.  And raping children.  The pontifical secret means that anyone in the church reporting "men who took a vow" to the civil authorities for this crime, i.e. Police, are to be excommunicated. This still stands today, and Francis could wipe it out with a stroke of his pen today.  But he has not.  Look up 'Pontifical Secret'.  Further, why should a man not take more than one vow?  What is wrong with the married state?  What is wrong with sex in a committed relationship? What is sinful enough to suggest death of the soul?  Forever.  The priestly vow of celibacy is only a church discipline.  Like not eating meat on a Friday.  That discipline has been abolished, so why not the celibacy one?   God/Jesus never suggested  that "mortal sin" exists.  It is a construct by the church, made to instill fear into its subjects so as to have power over them.
"Concern for those suffering persecution and even genocide in the Middle East cannot be exclusive to Christians, said the U.S. Catholic bishops, but must take in concern for all in that region “who suffer persecution, both minorities and majorities,” including Muslims."  The US Catholic bishops are the ones at the forefront of this entire destructive mess that has now engulfed much of the world. Do they EVER get it???They are both schizoid and schizogenic.
You obviously missed my point which is if we hold all Muslims responsible for the violence of the radicals, shouldn't we do the same to Christians that spew hatred and violence?
Sorry, you are NOT an "orthodox believer," and you are NOT a reliable source of Catholic dogma or doctrine.  There is NO need for you to repeat Catholic teachings here.  Enough of your bootless lectures on Faith and Morals, we do NOT need another Cardinal Ray Burke from the ultra-right wing of the Catholic bird to tell us what must be corrected in our Catholic Faith!  Your sole purpose in coming aboard here is TO DISRUPT!  Even "Fr.Z." won't have that!
Let admit the truth   Koran verses  1.“Kill the unbelievers wherever you find them.” Koran2:191  2.“Make war on the infidels(nonbelieversof Islam) living in your neighbourhood.”Koran9:123  3.“When opportunity arises, kill theinfidels(non believers of Islam) wherever you catch them.” Koran 9:5  4.“Any religion other than Islam is not acceptable.” Koran3:85  5.“TheJews and the Christians areperverts;fight them.”… Koran 9:30  6.“Kill people who criticizeallah or do mischief ( wage war against allah )” Koran 5:33  7.“Allah will Punish the unbelievers withgarments of fire,hooked iron rods, boiling water;melt their skin and bellies.”Koran 22: 19 to 21  8.“The unbelievers are stupid; urge theMuslims to fight them.” Koran 8:65  9.“Muslims must not take the infidels(non-believers of Islam) as friends.” Koran3:28  10.“Terrorize and behead those whobelieve in scriptures other than the Qur’an.” Koran 8:12&13
My grandfather made his fortune selling women for sex and my father was a prominent member of the KKK.    This makes me highly qualified to be President of the United States of Christians.  Hatred is my name.  Fear is my game.  DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT!!!
There's something that needs to happen before we start talking about removing contraception from the "sin list." The Catholic teaching magisterium must finally acknowledge that sex isn't only about conceiving a child. This is almost acknowledged every time old infertile people marry in the church. I once asked a priest why the church would marry people who are clearly beyond their child-bearing years and do you know what he said, "to allow for a miracle." I kid you not. Seems to me if God can create a miracle and suddenly make an old woman fertile again s/he should be able to make a lesbian pregnant from, I don't know, the Holy Spirit? Or perhaps a gay man will miraculously be able to bear a child in a womb that God could suddenly create in him. But no, that would be foolish so we can't allow gay sex. Getting past that barrier would also remove masturbation from the sin list and also allow every straight couple to enjoy sex without worry. But I'm not holding my breath waiting for that.
Right. Having an "exorcism" because the state allowed CIVIL same-sex marriage is not homophobic. Nor is cancelling the contract that Catholic Social Services of Springfield had with the State of Illinois because the state said they couldn't automatically reject gay couples as adoptive parents. Nor is excommunicating gays. He did not say explicitly that gays should be "hated, feared, shunned, and rejected". However, it should be blindingly obvious, even to you (but only if you had even a scintilla of honesty in your makeup), that is his message.  No, Paprocki is a thorough-going homophobe, and you support him in his homophobia, just as you supported Burke in his homophobia.  Yes, I have little love for Paprocki, because I oppose bigotry, and the man is a bigot. And my love for you is scant, also because you support bigotry (as well as your general dishonesty and knee-jerk support for conservatives who should not be supported).
Don't forget obliviously hypocritical, Paul Conte. Douglas Card, my take on your question: Sadly religion, from the cave to the internet, is more about social and economic control in opposition to spiritual comfort.  Evangelical Christians seek converts (read tithing) and manage to insult everyone who lives decent lives without whatever brand of brainwashing their particular sect is selling.  When their evangelical efforts fail they pervert the political process in direct violation of law to force us all to behave as if we believe.  They refuse to accept realities that conflict with their dogmas so that, for instance, Trumps' obvious antithesis to their professed values goes unnoticed as long as he pretends to care about their interests.  Without their "blinded by the light" approach to the world there would be no conditions a Trump could rise in, no nation on the brink of corporate oligarchy and no underpinnings for the racism and bigotry that subsumes justice and human progress.
" maybe you or someone can help explain evangelicals for me" -- Douglas Card  My explanation: Ignorant, self-righteous fanatics who feel they have every right to mess with other folks lives.  -- Paul
You forgot to mention a few other differences. American Christians don't force women to undergo genital mutilation; they don't stone people to death; they don't behead 'infidels'; they don't hang gays from construction cranes;they don't engage in "honour" killings; leaving Christianity is not punishable by death.....
But the vast majority of Christians also recognize the demonstrated fact of evolution. Certainly the Roman Catholic Church does. The number who are creationists are a tiny (and resolutely stupid) minority.  We have for the first time a GG who is a professional scientist. She is not expected to check her brain at the door of Rideau Hall in assuming office.  If she had to decide in a hung Parliament between someone who respects science and someone who rejects it to pander to the narrowest-minded citizens in the country, I don't think it would be partisan to choose the science party. It would be good for the country.  We just came from nearly 10 years of a government that had no use for science that did not support its ideology. We don't need another.
Catholics in Madison have a very dramatic way to respond to this nonsense.  Keep your wallets in your pockets until this is reversed and an apology is issued.
A timely and well-written article.  Fundamentalist Christianity has always been a factor in right wing politics in the US, and while the creep factor is not as high as it is with a man like Bannon, is still something those not blindly aligned with the faith should be concerned about.  It strikes me as somewhat hypocritical that the far right rails against Islam as a force that could destroy the fabric of Western society.  While true that our society is largely founded on Judeo-Christian tradition, the views of Mr Graham are repugnant to many and pose a threat to our way of living.  In many cases, they should also be repugnant to those that embrace our spiritual heritage.  Love of enemies?    Forgiveness? Curiously absent.  When radical Muslims twist the teachings of their faith to justify abhorrent words and deeds, we vilify them.  Graham may not be guilty of abhorrent deeds but his words to the more tolerant among us are anathema.
I am totally disgusted with this article.  Sarah is comparing not letting transgender people serve in the military to the Nazi roundup and murder to millions of Jews (along with Roma, communists, the challenged and some Catholics). Man, she is a disgusting d.b.
Any religion or nation to prosper, it is always, a nation who encourage and support young people's spirit wins the future.  Here Catholic church clergies raped young children!  One thing that is fair can be consider that Catholic church is in just about every countries and Catholic clergies raped young children everywhere!  I wonder how Catholic religion plan to survive without the young people?
And the next time a Christian (Dylann Roof, Robert Dear (the Planned Parenthood shooter) and so forth) decides to commit a terrorist act against innocent individuals lets not sugar coat it by claiming that they were simply "deranged individuals" but lets call it what it is - terrorism
"People don't burn other people alive" You need to acquaint yourself with autos da fe in Middle Ages Europe. Christians did precisely that to women accused of witchcraft, Jews who refused to convert, Christians who were accused of heresy (that is, they held beliefs the authorities didn't approve of), and others. After some Jews rejected Martin Luther's protestant Christianity as not being their cup of tea, Martin Luther suggested locking Jews in synagogues and setting the synagogues on fire. If that's too ancient for you, only 30 years ago, Christians were raping and slaughtering Muslims in the former country of Yugoslavia. Last year, Jews living in the West Bank burned down Arabs' houses and mosques, and in at least one house, the occupants were in it. Terrorists are brutal. A lot of terrorists are Muslim. That does NOT make all Muslims dogs. If a man from Arvada gets angry at his ex-wife and burns down her home with her in it, are all Arvadans to be considered dogs?
Ugh..... check the morning paper Father, some two dozen theologians/clergy have just released a statement in support of the Cardinals. God willing, this will be the groundswell that retires or converts Pope Francis, and puts Vatican II in history's waste bin.
Where all the deport people at. This guy isn't hispanic or Muslim. Most likely a white Christian male and its crickets in here but if you listen to Trump band of can't think for themselves morons you would think crime is only done by Hispanic and Muslim people. This guy stole a lot of money. Still 2 million he has not paid back. So many wanted the guy who justbgot pardoned for the video store robbery to be in jail for life but this guy stole alot more dinero. They are such hippocrits
And Catholics on this site are quick to opine on the invalidity of non-Roman Catholic orders, their churches, etc.  Goose and gander here.
You think talking about romantic relationships are synonymous with sex and oral sex? So I'm assuming that Christians that wait to have sex until they are married aren't in a romantic relationship until they're married? Your ignorance is truly undeniable.
Anti-abortionists--I refuse to refer to them as 'right-to-lifers' because they're anything but that--are overly selective about which children merit that right.  Seven year-old black kids playing with toy water pistols don't.  And these white 'conservative' so-called Christians leap to defend any cop who shoots a black child, regardless of the circumstances.  And of course Iraqi, Afghani, Pakistani, Sudanese, Lebanese, Palestinian and Libyan children are excluded from that right on two counts--they're the wrong color AND the wrong religion.  I think the next time these clowns show up to protest at the Planned Parenthood clinic, I'll show up with my own photos of murdered children: like a particularly horrible one of a Palestinian toddler with the top of his head taken off by an IDF rifle-bullet.  Or another of the remains of a little girl in Fallujah who died screaming as she dissolved in a toxic, super-heated cloud of white phosphorus.  Where was their right-to-life, O "Christians?"
"The priest represents the Bridegroom Christ to his Bride the Church" "Represents"? So Jesus is not in the Church? Heresy.  If Jesus is intrinsic to church, then S/He is either sexually polymorphic, hermaphrodyte, transgender (and engaged in a sexual act - symbolic or otherwise that is anathema in thought let alone in deed) If not, there is no "Mystical Body", or is there?  Joseph Card.Ratzinger "taught" that the sexual description - as per Bride/Bridegroom, is "more than metaphor". So you call it "analogous"! You also deviate from authoritative teaching.  Any sensible person with a modicum of intelligence would eschew the muddle of mixed metaphors, intrinsically contradictory analogies let alone accuse anyone else of being devoid of any "meaningful" theological knowledge or perspective.  All these analogies (and metaphors) do not a faith support.  Who ever said that faith is built upon reason?
There you go again. Everyone who disagrees with is called a fool, a hypocrite, a liar and is subjected to a torrent of abuse from you and you call that Christian. You liken orthodox Catholics who try to follow the magisterial teaching of the Church to Nazi war-criminals obeying the orders of Hitler. In doing this you are likening the Church, the Magisterium to the Nazi dictator and mass murderer. Only recently you hurled a stream of verbal abuse against Pandora17 and not for the first time. Such behaviour one does not expect from someone who claims to care about his/her Christian faith.
The Crusades?  You find it "intolerant" that Christians fought back against Christian lands invaded by Muslims???  Ignorance is bliss!  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
Trump is more like the anti-Christ. He literally checks off all the boxes that the Bible warned us about.
What would happen if a person stood with a sign saying"WHITE CHRISTIAN GUN NUTS OUT OF POLITICS"? Think Trump voters wouldn't get off on harming that person?
You remind me of my mom - "The one who Overcomes" (all the stupid choices she made in life and raises the flag proudly every chance she gets) who has experienced all and knows all...Hogwash - There is no need to experience debauchery and defilement to be wiser. And please don't claim to be an "evangelical" turned atheist - Biblically speaking there is no such thing, once one  has been made new, one does not become old again, that is clear in the Bible. This is just another example of your wisdom through experience, any time anybody tells me they "used to be a Christian" I immediately write everything they say off as nonsense, because there is no such thing. I Christian has been given eternal life through the spirit of God dwelling within them, not because of their wise choices.
Please enlighten me how, in your opinion, is Mayor Khan responsible for the terrorist acts committed by a bunch of lunatics who call themselves "Muslims". Blaming Mr. Khan would be as silly as blaming all Christians for the atrocities committed by the Ku Klux Klan.
Peggy! You're back! How was the Christmas market? Did you meet lots of refugees there?   I'm glad that you're here to remind everyone that whatever may be true of some communities (and let's face it, exaggerations abound), Christians are always a million times worse.
The only way out of this mess is for Canada to become more secular. Canada should set an example for the world and push secular values as the highest and push down Christian, Islam, Jew and other book religions.  > The first step is stop government funding of religion. Second step is to protect child from indoctrination. 3rd step is remove all religion people from government posts. 4th step is remove all religions people from position of power such as doctors, judges, lawyers, cops etc. >  This the way forward, a secular society based on logic, reason and Socrates debates. There is no accommodating fairy tales, witch hunts, virtue signaling and tribalism.
The fact is that the Trump regime is white supremacist Christian Republican extremists who hate everything our country stands for.
Better to brainwash them about Jesus Christ, the evils of s-e-x, the need to keep guns, the horrible things Obama has done, the damage illegal Mexicans cause, etc etc etc?
"The call to live with Christ-like integrity" Well, why the entire Catholic Institution clergies starting with Pope F. and all his clergies except a few hide behind Vatican like 'The Tower of Babel' being silent about the clergy sex abuse of children!   Where are their 'Christ-like integrity'?  Can any of you religious preach who keep their mouth shut at the clergy raped children's suffering, this 'Christ-like integrity'? Even the cats & dogs will laugh at your religious hypocrisy!!!!!!!!  You CI clergies and religious really do not believe in the LIVING God, Christ, Holy Mary, Saints & Angels to ignore the suffering clergy raped children!!!  LOLOLOLOLOL!
Not just Mike but all good Catholics consider homosexual activity to be mortally sinful including oral sex. All sex outside of marriage is mortally sinful.
Learn to vet your sources clown. lol. There is no evidence. Period. Jesus was never mentioned in any Roman sources and there is no archeological evidence that Jesus ever existed. Even Christian sources are problematic – the Gospels come long after Jesus' death, written by people who never saw the man. Get back to reality man. Quoting some moron's blog is NOT proof. Google the word evidence man. sheesh.
That's nice sky, but it completely ignores the modern world where people are much more selective about what tenets of their religion they follow. Or do you believe that no Catholic would ever use birth control or no Jew would ever eat bacon? People adhere to their religion to greatly varying degrees. To attack Muslims in general by using a strict interpretation of the Koran is wilful ignorance and just as fundamentalist in its own way as the jihadi's themelves.
-No, never. -No,  of course not,  silly ! You are speaking of CHRISTIANS here. -This would employ too many people,  and minimum wage is already too high... -See above ^ -No,  never. -Yes !    Good questions however.
Insulting me does nothing for meaningful discourse and if anything, makes my claims of Christians killing many others with religious justification more legitimate than your false claims of Muslims doing the same, as you clearly don't have anything meaningful to contribute, nor research to prove yourself right and myself wrong.  It's understood that children resort to name calling when they don't have a valid or meaningful response.  But back to the issue, WHEN ARE WE GOING TO RECOGNIZE RADICAL CHRISTIAN EXTREMISM?
You get to keep your affluent white comfort, the poor and Christian values be damned. By the way, France is a secular nation; the United Sates is religiously neutral. Your self serving,(probably racist, certainly classist)) "values" offer nothing to the dialogue among people of faith who gather at this site.
Written very gracefully and with respect. I imagine if this was a story about Christians dating, specifically those in the west, this article would have been written in a sneering and ridiculing tone.
The Germans today are the same blind brainless follow-the-leader sheep they were in 1933 and throughout their history.   The self-destructive insanity of Merkel's immigration policies is just as insane as Hitler's policies. The only difference is that Hitler sought genocidal extermination of the Jews and others while Merkel and her German sycophants seek to exterminate themselves (and the rest of native Christian Europe).
What about all those Catholics who do not believe that women should be allowed to become priests, oppose gay marriage and a woman's right to choose when it comes to abortion? All of those beliefs are not in keeping with Canadian values. I bet the author of this simplistic article would never dare to oppose immigration to Canada by Catholics. His is a cowardly, racist argument.
All you can comment is this garbage? And you're a practicing Catholic? I've been part of the Catholic community since I was baptized over 50 yrs ago. " just flag all the alt-reich commentators". Yea, as if that isn't calling the kettle black.
Sure, Wheeler visits the house of the milktoast christians on Sunday, but he worships at the tit of corporate profit the rest of the week.   Are we really going to ignore their policy and base the election on their level of sky-god delusion? As far as that goes, they both seem like cafeteria christians to me.
You seem to ignore the facts. There were 32,000 terrorist attacks by muslims against the rest of the world in the last 15 years.  And even the Quebec mosque murders was not a terrorist attack.  How many buddhist attacks have you seen? Or even christian attacks?  To my knowledge the number is 0.  With such a high number of attacks by one single religion,  you really expect that muslims will be perceived in a good light?  Many times we deal with people, we dont even know their religion. It's never written on their foreheads.  So people like you instead of playing the offended should concede that there is a huge problem with islam.  And you should sympathize with anyone who is against this violence, and this hate against the rest of the world by muslims.  We need protection from muslims since they have showed how dangerous they are.
The sad truth is that the current GOP base cares much more about being white than being Americans. The Democrats might have done more for those "poorly educated" white folks if the Republicans in Congress had not decided to obstruct anything that might help Americans for fear that Obama would get the credit. They are willing to sacrifice their poor relations for political gain. There is nothing Christian about that. I would pity those "poorly educated" white folks if they didn't think killing black folks would solve their problems. They are so ignorant that they can't follow the money. They think minorities and poor folks get more free stuff from the government than the 1%. Trump loves the "poorly educated". They are easier to con than the educated.
Another way the Catholic Church can distract from the fact that they condone child rape.
The Middle East now isn't 1930s Europe, substantially different historically, culturally, religiously. The ME was 'broken' by western powers (who thought they were exceptional and superior) meddling in the Great Game long before our time. Iraq is an artificial country, like an MMA octagon with several oppositional fighters in a free for all. The 'shambles' has long been there, in great part because we egoistical, civilized westerners think we have the Christian right to 'do good', just as we've mistakenly thought we were the bulwark against communist hordes in SE Asia. You assume that by staying in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East, we can 'fix it' and bring western style democracy there. Good luck with our being an occupational force. Once again, it's that haughty, condescending, falsely superior Christian attitude of thinking you/we know better than those 'Muslim savages.' We are reaping what we have sown, more so because of that ignorant racist buffoon in the White House.
There's nothing fishy. Nineteen religious fanatics deliberately flew four planes into three buildings and one field. Thousands of people saw the planes fly into the WTC and despite the stupid pronouncements of silly people that was what was responsible for their collapse. An ordained Roman Catholic priest, who administered the last rites to victims on the lawns surrounding the Pentagon saw the plane fly into the building. That's right, eyewitness testimony as to the events of the day. No conspiracy unless you count the Saudi's.
Your lack of Christian charity always amazes me.
According to liberal dementia, a social disease void of intelligence, logic, and shame, it is criminally wrong for a Christian baker to refuse to cater a homosexual wedding because this is discrimination...however, a political correct organic baker can refuse service to events promoting GMO agriculture, Indian Mascots, or a Christian event supporting pro life. This shameless hypocrisy is staggering. There they go again.
The Christian terrorism fueled by the nationwide televangelist tax scofflaws continues.  More threat from priests and preachers in their churches than any transgendered individual relieving him/her self.  Disgusting.
No, because Christians do don't say to stone a person to death or to throw them off buildings, like the muslims do.  Christians respect people who are different while praying based on their beliefs.
..................Your self titled "quite right and reasonable" hypothesis shows extreme arrogance.  If arrogance was holiness you would be next to Saint John Paul. Your posts demonstrate the kind of ignorance and cowardice of people whose words seem to intentionally cause pain to others who have been spiritually violated.  It is obvious to me that you are afraid of gaining real insight about those who are the wreckage left behind from the clergy sexual assault scandal. You know better than those who have been violated by clergy.   In my experience the more traditional Catholics seem to make comments that disregard Catholic values and seem farthest from the teachings of Christ.
Catholic concern for health care  seems so hypocritical to me after all they church did to undermine and roll back ACA.
Oh dear Wavemaker.  I am feeling a little bit uncertain right now.  Do you believe in the Bible?  Uh-oh.  This whole time I thought we were mutually scoffing at those silly evangelicals, and worshiping the Goddess with our commentary and here you are quoting the Bible!?  I feel so betrayed & triggered right now.
Look ED, the old testament was for Jews.  Christians are of the NEW testament that teaches to love one another as one loves themselves. There is no call, AT ALL, for violence by Christians.  The Qu'ran preaches over and over again that infidels are worthy only of death.  Yo ED, YOU are an infidel. There will always be miscreants in any group but main the bastion of Islam is world domination through the killing of ALL infidels.
There is nothing more disgusting than a bible-quoting hypocrite who runs around acting holier than thou in public, but who, behind closed doors, schemes how to best the least among them so they can get the majority of their small cut. Thank you, Shannyn.
"Why is it that so many people who claim to be the most faithful Catholics see Christ in gold vessels and silk vestments but can't see Christ and his Mother in the face of the poor?  Because they are liars, they aren't Catholic. They only pretend being Catholic while trolling the internet.
I think NCR actually self flagellates Catholicism more than the fictitious "Opus Dei monk"from that silly Dan Brown book.
52 percent of registered white Catholics are voting for Donald Trump? That is a disgrace.
They do kill Christians just for being Christians.  In ISIS' words: Christians are their "favorite prey".
Ridiculous ...most of those claims can be debunked just from the top of my head ... The cell phone was invented by Martin Cooper, born in Chicago Illinois to Ukranian, NOT JEWISH parents. He was working for the US company Motorola.   Dennis Gabor (holography) was an agnostic lutheran    Most Israeli "inventions" are financed with American taxpayer money and are only possible because US corporations actually share their trade secrets with Israeli ones...  Here are some other notable Jewish inventions:  Holocausts (Jewish Bolsheviks ...60 million dead Christians and Russian Orthodox)  Hate Crime Laws Holocaust Revisionism Laws Usury Communism fractional-reserve banking  Federal Reserve system. anti-white racism and their worst contrivance ....Zionism because make no mistake, the issues of Israel are not "Jewish" issues, they are Zionist issues. No one should confuse Zionism and Judaism,  The issue is 100% with Zionism, an areligious cover for White supremacy .
Yes the language is unclear, but the message is very clear - the Vatican hierarchs do not want gay men in the priesthood period.   This is the proverbial nail in the coffin on vocations for an organization that does not ordain women or generally allow married men.    When I walked out the door of the Roman Catholic Church, I have never looked back.    I love many Catholics, but the Roman Catholic Church is a misogynist and homophobic institution that has oppressed different groups for centuries.   It is dying out in the west, and will eventually only exist in developing countries.   Gay Christians  will find a home in the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and the United Church of Christ where they are generally welcomed in the ministry.
Rally, People! Vote out the Democrat's Anti American pro Muslim One World agenda. I'll go for one world when Jesus says, not the Traitor Hillary.
A "fundamentalist" Catholic will have Mass said for you and pray a rosary for you, a fundamentalist Muslim will blow you up.
You offered me your support of bigotry. The second great commandment Christ gave us was to love our neighbor. When Christ was asked who his neighbor was, he gave as an example a member of a despised minority. Try reading the parable of the Good Samaritan, substituting "married gay man" for "Samaritan". The hatred that Paprocki has for gays is the opposite of Christ's commandment, so don't tell me "he's following Church teaching". He is perverting Church teaching.  You support him in this perversion, which is why I don't believe you when you say you aren't homophobic. If you actually weren't, you would reject Paprocki and all his works and all his empty promises.  If you respond, I shall ignore you. I have said my piece, and all the whingeing you do won't change the fact that you support bigots in their bigotry.
And where did they run into Burke's brand of fundamentalist? Do you think most American parishes are run by these fundamentalists? Is that why I've never heard a sermon on adultery, divorce, homosexuality or any other sexual sin in my 15 years since entering the Church: because of the iron grip of fundamentalists?  I'm sure there are many reasons why the young leave the Church, and several of those would be troubling to traditionalists. But it's not just some conservative talking point that liberal Christianity is bleeding members, regardless of denomination. Tell people that it doesn't really matter if they're in or out, and many will choose to be out.  And I return to a question I asked above: do you know any of these monster priests?
Obviously, god wanted him to be miserable.  He should have accepted his misery, offered it to god, and maybe joined opus dei or some other cult.
"Israel" is a state so utterly 'race'/identity-obsessed it murders its own CHILDREN for being the wrong "color", that treats Arab and Ethiopian JEWS as 2nd-class citizens (don't ask about Muslims and Christians), and that dumped blood donated by the Falashas because it wasn't considered 'pure' enough to be used to treat Ashkenaziim, and that openly and unapologetically practices housing and education discrimination--except when the TV cameras come around. In that last it does resemble its hypocritical white-supremacist 'patron', the United States. Further it is a non-theocratic yet self-proclaimed "Jewish" state in which full privileges are reserved exclusively for European--Ashkenazi--Jews; and concerning the Arabs it treads on, it is no more and no less than an APARTHEID state so oppressive and tyrannical that Bishop Desmond Tutu and the late Nelson Mandela both said it was worse than the apartheid they themselves endured. Khalas.
Unfortunately what is stupid is to not know what the Church teaches, or its discipline, or the why and wherefore, and then conclude it is the Church that is stupid.  The Church legislates for Catholics on marriage and can require that Catholics have their marriage witnessed by a priest. Thus a Catholic who attempts to contract marriage otherwise is impeded from a valid marriage. Since this is legislation it can be dispensed and I have attended marriages of Catholics in a variety of non-Catholic settings.  The continued reference to “paper” indicates an entrenched refusal to accept the reality of the situation.  If a policeman shows up at your home with a warrant, do indicate to him that it is a magic piece of paper and let us know how that works out.
The biggest mass murderers of history were Christians who killed six million Jews. We also had Christians who killed tens of thousands of Muslims in Bosnia. Are we now to stereotype all Christians on that basis? The purveyors of anti-Muslim hate are insidious disgusting propagandists.
This is a day of miracles.  For the first time, I agree with you about something. Aside from being a total sleaze bag and hypocrite, Joel Osteen is a faux Christian. He disgusts me.
You're right about Pope Francis being effectively complicit protecting the 'honor' of the priesthood at the expense of the dignity of children raped by the clergy. He is capable of turning this around by one dramatic gesture: expunging the Pontifical Secret from Canon Law. Kieran Tapsell and others have argued this at length, persuasively and repeatedly here on the pages of NCR. Bishops can say sorry till they are blue in the face. The apologies will take on congruence and credibility when the Pope backs up his calls for sorry days by getting rid of the source of the even more scandalous dimension of the problem which is that the hierarchy of the Catholic Church is Canonically forbidden to report paedophile clergy except in those very few civil jurisdictions in the world that require mandatory reporting.  I think Pope Francis still holds the arrogant view that it is all an 'Anglo' problem. There will be an education when the paedophilia lid blows off Asia, Latin America and Africa
FUNNY, ALL ADN POLLS reflect THE LEFTIST IDEALISM of the NEWSPAPERS RICH ELITEST OWNERS who actually LIVE outside of the State of ALASKA... Which of course, was their reason for buying the ALASKA DAILY NEWS in the first place, TO RESHAPE STATE POLICY TO MIRROR THOSE of FAR LEFT STATES like CALIFORNIA... DON'T BE FOOLED!! The only people beside a few CONSERVATIVE JOURNALISTIC WATCH DOGS like me, that are paying any attention to THEIR POLLS are the same OUTSIDER RESPONDENTS paid to do so by the DNC!!    TAKE YOUR LEFTIST IDEALISM AND START SWIMMING SOUTH!! You can pick up a couple of LEFTIST HOLLYWOOD MOVIE STARS to carry under EACH ARM as you pass CALIFORNIA!!! ALASKA HAS THE LARGEST CATHOLIC POPULATION per capita of ANY STATE in the NATION!!! WE DO NOT SUPPORT SAME SEX MARRIAGE!!! WE DO NOT SUPPORT LEFTIST IDEALS!! WE SUPPORT THE POPE!!!  What part of the 2016 ELECTION DIDN'T YOU IDIOTS UNDERSTAND!!
and just how is he "foisting" by not decorating a wedding cake according to the desires of the gay couple? And who are you to decide/judge his in your opinion hypocritical and non Christian teachings? He is not a hypocrite if he acts on his beliefs, whether you agree with his understanding of Christ's teachings or not. Logic is failing you. BTW, his business preexisted "public accommodation" interpretation to include a privately owned bakery, not engaged in interstate commerce....
You make a lot of assumptions, Steve, but can you point to any acts taken by this administration that were taken with any intent but to make the country better?  Trump tries to improve the country, and you want to divide it and attack it.  I don't know who organized what in Charlottesville, but what were there a couple hundred of them?  Wow, sounds like 1968 all over again.  Please.  Those liberal halcyon days of having something real to protest about are long gone, Steven.  Those evil, straight, White Christians vote for Black, homosexual and non-Christians  all the time.  You're protesting a myth.
Christians offer no tolerance, yet demand it in return. You get none from me.   Oh, you're one of the progressive Christians that doesn't actually follow the teachings of their church? Yea, I respect those people less than the "true believers".
The genocide against Christians in the Middle East continues.  These are the refugees we should be taking, not Syrian or Iraqi muslims.  They have countries. Middle Eastern Christians do not.
Nice snarling Christian attitude.
The Catholic Church is not and never has been obsessed with genitals and sex.  It is the liberal secular American society that is obsessed with sex and genitals necessitating that the Church speak out on those issues.
How many times do we need to tell people like you, that there is no place for stone age, Fundamentalist and Evangelical Christian bans to interfere with government? People who oppress families with those cruel bans do not support Democracy as they should. What they want is for their God to rule us all with the Constitution to be replaced with their literal interpretation of the Bible. That spells Theocracy under Fundamentalist and Evangelical Christian HUMAN leaders.
No, it was saying that a "thinking person" -- and you specifically exclude liberals from that group -- would deny Catholic burial to gays. It certainly came across to me as homophobic.
OregonBorn: Look at what the Catholic Priests have accomplished over the last how many centuries, AND, the Boy Scouts of America. They have been raping boys, FOREVER.  Read the Sign: FOREVER................
I have no hope left for America.  I have witnessed the 'scorched earth' strategy of Trump and Republicans to feed their endless neediness for power and might and the rest be damned.  I have watched as woman have been continuously humiliated and now will be robbed of their birth right to govern their own bodies.  I have been dismayed and sickened to witness the un-Christian turning their backs on desperate refugees and Mexicans.  I have been disgusted to see how Trump has used his candidacy to enrich himself at all cost.  My patriotism has withered as I saw the head of the FBI put his personal career ahead of this nation's best interest and rules of governance.  It is time to secede.  Leave the red states to close themselves off from the world, protected from immigrants, gays and lesbians and liberals, but no rule of law.  I am happy and proud to be a part of a new nation that holds dear freedom, liberty. sound governance and democratic principles.
When it comes to sex and sex ed, the progressives also want to tell you who you can have sex with though; isn't that what the Rainbow flag is all about? The want to teach the kids about gay sex in school, how sexual diversity should be celebrated, etc. If "conservatives" meant the same thing as "Christian Right" you would have a point, but then you also have libertarians flying under the conservative banner who don't want that. Maybe they're part of the alt-right or something.... another label which represents views more diverse than the media will usually portray.
Only in your Fox News/Limbaug/Spicer mindset as millions peacebly hit the streets while Rent-A-Cops assault same peace protestors and illegally round up those not involved in any violence or vandalism just like Nazi Germany.  Your usual attempt to redefine the very term fascist to divert from the evil of the Republican tried-and-true lifetime fascists.  Canadian White Supremacist slaughters Islamic prayers while Fox News tries to put the blame on a bystander.  The same lies and deceit found throughout the White Supremacist, Fundamentalist Christian/Catholic government of Der Neo-Fuhrer Trump.  The rights of the people to peaceably assemble will not be denied by any law.  This fascist administration and Congress has already violated all of their oaths of office to defend all of the U.S. Constitution.  Crawl back into the bunker, dolt.
ISIS has killed far more Muslims than Christians. --- Not that makes things better but ISIS did not kill Muslims for being Muslims. They do kill Christians just for being Christians.  In ISIS' words: Christians are their "favorite prey".
I would suggest that REAL Libertarians, and anarchists too, would run these "foul mouthed Christians" right out of  our town.   Those folks from Texas and their friends prove how much religion sucks.  Dogma and belief clouds the compassion they are supposed to have for other humans.  They are an example of how some have screwed up the world.   Power to the people!
This "Islamophobia" label is as tired as it is wrong.  Religious prejudice being what it is, Islamic peoples have a strong leaning towards anti-Semitism, and when they blow things up or persecute minorities from the ancient churches, anti-Christianism. Then, of course, there's the terrible history that followed Mountbatten's Partition and the millions of lives that were lost in the conflicts between India and Pakistan. So Islamic peoples also have a history of Hinduphobia that most people in the West are ignorant of.   So let's say that if you're an Islamophile, you could well be a Judeo-Christian-o-phobe and a Hinduphobe.  If you want to throw the Islamophobia label around, you can't suck and blow at the same time.  The Liberal motion M103 privileges Islamic peoples over Hindus, Christians, and Jews who have been subject to persecution by Islamic groups.     Justin Trudeau is very ignorant and very wrong.
Racism against white Republicans is in full throttle here in progressive Catholic land.
Thanks Barack Obama for strengthening the Muslim Brotherhood, your favourites, in Egypt.  More Christian deaths are the result. Go away already, you creep.
Yes! I, a deplorable, basement-dwelling, bucket of idiot, b@st@rdized Catholic, needy Latino, everyday American Black super predator, Muslim ne’er-do-well sand Negro, shall vote for Clinton. She shall unite us all — just like she promised at the convention! I know that the Russians are trying to rig our elections by telling everyone how we tried to rig our elections. It does not matter that Bill turned the White House into a brothel, lied to Congress, and was disbarred for perjury, then had to make a nearly $1,000,000 settlement. Bill is not running for president; his enabler is. There is no story here!
Evangelicals???? Oh yeah. The holier than thou's who somehow think they are Christians living gods words? To me, they are amongst the most prejudiced and self serving idiots around. They think they are going to their white mans heaven after their actions that are 180 degrees opposite of what their jesus lived and breathed. They defund, and support the defunding of programs that help the less fortunate, and give the same funds to the well monied the rich and the politicians corporate sponsors, the same kind their jesus punted out of the temples. The evangelicals thinking and expecting to go to their white mans heaven, makes as much sense as the Mideast terrorists going to their Islamic heaven with their 72 virgins after the wholesale slaughter of so many thousands of innocents. Washington is built on corruption, which is why we are sending all the taxpayer dollars overseas, unaccounted for with no accountability
Just another evangelical Christian extremist being a bigot based on what he thinks his imaginary god tells him to think. I wouldn't step foot in his bakery.
The Christian god, as described in the Bible, is cruel, vengeful, sadistic, vain, jealous, unfair, and generally nasty. Hardly lovable!
Plenty of white anglo saxon born again narrow-minded judgemental bigoted Christians have had their educations paid for by the same over-privileged white people. Stop whining and learn to be the tolerant civic-minded person this country is so proud of.
Probably when it becomes a radical christian extremist event. 1 nut job does making empty threats not quite measure up to the millions of nutjobs killing people all over the globe. The radical Muslims are murdering people in dozens of nations aroung the world. Anyone with any intellectual honesty would not try and draw a comparison here.
And this is a problem for those of us who are monogamous heterosexual males or females because???  I am reminded of a couple of the early Christian sects who believed that Jesus would return in their lifetimes--you know by 70-100 A.D. at the latest.  Accordingly, they declined to participate in sex because everyone would be in the Kingdom of Heaven so kids were just a distraction.    That Christian sect disappeared.     And here we are a couple thousand years later still waiting for the return.    If the homosexuals are killing themselves with their lifestyle, they won't reproduce and so 'the problem' will just go away!
LOL so a hardcore catholic believer says we banned muslim cemeteries. Not even close to the case BUT if we get rid of divisive religious nonsense then hallelujah. The catholic church received 600 million dollars in last budget for 'immigration services" one 500 million and another 100 million chunk. Look it up. They are greedy pigs helping corporations reduce our quality of life while attempting to force a more violently enforced abrahamic religion on to us. For a peak at immigration reality in Canada: http://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/douglas-todd-why-canadians-need-to-debate-immigration-economics  The man who wrote this column in the G&M is the enemy of all Canadians and North Americans. His words and actions are clear. He is a traitor, loyal to a foreign religious head, not us.
Hypocrisy, thy name is Christian America -- a group of which more than 80%  turned completely against the teachings of Jesus to support a lying, womanizing, racist, tax evading, ignorant, thrice married egomaniac who puts himself above all others, let alone the law.  You own this horror, Xtians.  What would Jesus do?
It is ridiculous that catholic priests can't marry. This has really narrowed the scope of their clergy personnel, and Alaska (especially rural Alaska) has been gravely damaged as a consequence of Catholicism's systemic abuse. There is no reason why clergy shouldn't be allowed to marry. "Chastity" is hypocrisy and ridiculous, and denial of the reality of humanity, and sadistic. The church's position here is especially ironic considering the sexuality of many of their own.
People own these beliefs. People hate. People discriminate. They can do that, as long as it doesn't hurt others. But...churches are part of the community. Their religious doctrine does not give them the right to change our laws to allow discrimination against a group of people based on nothing more than who they choose to love. Christians, Catholics and most all that worship with the good book, are taught to follow the Lords example. We are told to love our neighbors as ourselves. We are taught that God is Love and God created every single one of us. Why would the church ever think it is ok to pick and choose which of God's children they will accept and which ones don't make the grade? Not only will they not invite them in to worship, the churches want to make the hate towards lgbt the law. People hate, God does not. I respect the freedom of religion until it tramples on the freedom of others. If they weren't doing anything wrong, there'd be no need for suing or prosecuting.
So are you suggesting that the global child abuse scandal that the Catholic church is still dealing with was because non-believers chose to become priests, in order to gain access to children? That is patently ridiculous. These were men (supposedly of god) who leveraged their positions of trust to abuse kids all over the world - there's never been a scandal of this size in any other institution. And to top it off, the church covered it up for years - which makes it even more offensive.  What about the Magdalene Laundries in Ireland? Yet another horrible abuse scandal conducted in the name of catholicism. Moreover, non-believers don't blow themselves up in the name of anything, in order to further an agenda of any kind, if only because we know we only have one life to live.  And I didn't even raise the issue of the horrible crimes committed in the name of Christ by the Crusades and the Inquisition.
Have you checked out who the Australian Christian Lobby are? Maybe those Australian politicians are right. There's no question ACL has an anti-gay agenda. Not that such an agenda would justify a violent response, and at this point its not exactly clear that it did. Though the ACL leader is going to great lengths to gain sympathy for this horrific "attack."  My original comment was aimed at people yesterday who suggested this incident was a terror attack by Muslims on Christians. They did so without waiting to see what the facts were.
RD wants "faithful Christians" to act like jerks as ways of  showing their fear and loathing of gays.
Pathetic to hear you think Christ died to end poverty; pathetic to hear you mock the idea that he came to save souls.
Trudeau doesn't say Canada is a Christian state - hence there is no hypocrisy accepting homosexuality. It is the hard core Christians (or fundamentalists of any religion) that are the most hypocritical!
OH yes - Were those evil Christian Missionaries (many of whom were slaughtered by the Indians, or lost their lives due to disease, starvation etc.) lumped in with those "genocidists" you mention ? (yes I did make up a word, just as you make up stories).
Unless the "Bishops" stand clearly against racism, sexual predation, misogyny, callous disregard for fundamental values - ensconced in Catholic social doctrine, torture, vengeance and retribution, disrespect for the law, etc., then their stance against abortion highlights them as utter hypocrites. Unless the act publicly to demonstrate their stand against all of what identifies Mr Trump they "are not worthy of us or their "calling".
Westboro Baptist Church members - they show nothing but arrogent disrespect for others, blind hatred, and ignorance only masks their own fear.  Jesus would weep.
So, Christians can discriminate against gay folks, but gay folks cannot discriminate against Christians. Nice imbalance of power there.
LOL.  I am not remarried but I hate the hypocrisy of conservative Catholics on this and I am tired of seeing people shunned.  And you are darn right people should use the internal forum to decide their worthiness for Communion.  I think that most remarried people will receive Communion on this one (as they should.)
Many Catholic priests are gay. In the 2000 book "The Changing Face of the Priesthood," Rev. Donald B. Cozzens suggested that the priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession. Cozzens estimated that as much as 58 percent of priests were gay, and that percentages were even higher for younger priests. His numbers matched previous estimates by sociologists who put the numbers of gay priests between 10 and 60 percent.  One must go to the source to address the problem of priests abusing young boys.  The source isn't the bishops, its the men under the bishops charge.  But let's pretend it's all about the bishops, for the sake of political correctness.
Naah, Trudeau does not care for Ïsrael. He feels much more comfortable sitting on the floor with Múslims and celebrating eid while wearing Múslim garb. He is not even a Chrïstian, but some amorphous creature, trying to be different things to please different people. That's my JustÏn.
Republican party FILTHY w super fakey 'christians'.  They'll stab in you in the back for a buck, wave a flag, then kick you in the face ...
Another NCR Catholic saying that those who sided with Trump are Nazis.  More and more every day.
... if super fakey sexist racist bigot 'christians' had their way all those they condemn would be outlawed n burned at the stake ... like the good ol' days.  You guys have lost your grasp on MOST seats of power and ability to do serious harm ... but you are TRYING to keep the old days going w the likes of Cheetolini.   I'll celebrate when your ilk all die.
Obama was tracking and jailing terrorists .............. even the Christian ones
Ray, Christians like you have slaughtered millions. Read a book.
....if only they could, but why would they when welfare (aka dumb canuck christians paying their $$!)
Look in the mirror!   Type "Study links low intelligence to conservatism and prejudice"..  As one who shakes my head every time situations bring up the fact the mindset of evangelicals is that you all are determined to get your rapture and you will make sure all of us are with you lemmings as you go throw yourselves off the cliff of stupidity Move over to Israel and maybe your rapture will come about without including the rest of America
We have not degraded the church as a moral guide, the church historically has degraded itself in horrific demented behavior. This is an excellent example; while white European Christians called us savages because of our gods, white PC liberals are calling us uncivil savages because of our mascots.
Catholics elected Trump with the complicit silence of the USCCB. I am embarrassed to be an American Catholic. Thank God for Francis.
I would ask these questions of Catholic of fundamentalist Christians.  But there is one big difference between these two religions and Islam.  Islam actively promotes misogyny and homophobia.  Women in Saudi Arabia are treated as second class citizens, having to cover themselves, not being allowed to drive, etc.  And gays are being thrown off buildings because they are homosexual.  I mean, by God, this is 2017.    So there is a difference in having a different view (I cannot condone the homosexual lifestyle so I am not going to bake you a cake) versus violence toward that person (yeah, I will bake you a cake, with something nasty inside it).  Christianity doesn't throw gays off buildings or force women to cover themselves head to toe.  For the record, I am gay, so this issue is important.  And for the record, I am deeply sorry that someone would shout out things to people would appear to be very nice folks!
Who cares what the Eastern Schismatics think or how they refer to the Liturgy?   They aren't part of the Church of Christ, and reject the papacy established by Christ.    It's amazing to me that many "liberals" look to the "Orthodox" for guidance.   The "Orthodox" wear ornate vestments, would never allow "guitar masses", or jokes during the Mass, or a casual attitude toward the Mass, etc.   Even though the Eastern Schismatics are in tremendous error.... they have by and large retained traditional liturgies... the antithesis of what most "liberal Catholics" want in a Mass.  It's ironic.
And the history of the world is in large part a history of religions.  Refusing to expose your child to any religious information is stupid.    How can you understand the 30-years war if you don't even know the difference between a Catholic and the varieties of non-Catholics which resulted in 6 million deaths.  Or the Crusades.    Or the Inquisition.    Or the Holocaust.  Or why most of South America speaks Spanish but Brazil speaks Portuguese.
Because of idiots like him the number of Catholics who attend church on Sunday drops off.  I say we support the Catholic Church on Sunday with black buttons in the collection basket till this crap stops.  Doesn't Catholic Charities accept enough federal money taking in all those illegals?
They'd be singing a different tune if the baker were a non-Christian who refused to sell the cake to Christians.
Well, at least these worst element Christians didn't go there and shoot a bunch of people or plant a bomb like the worst element Muslims would have, eh, James?
Going after people based on their religion is classic behaviour of a fascist. Ruling by decree instead of going to your elected officials is again a reflex of someone who doesn’t respect the fundamental nature of a democratic society.”  ROFLOL, This is a simplistic ton of BS.  Yes in every reasonable case your correct.  However I seriously beg to differ here.  Were talking about a religion that wants to chop off all Christian heads and you and others side with these idiots.  Keep them the heck out of here or your going to end up like Sweden and Germany.  Is that the K-os you want?  Go back to DAVOS you and all the rest of the NWO 's
Islam is at it's very core incompatible with our culture which is also traditionally Christian (which the muslims oppose). the shit will hit the fan at some point. I see all this as the beginning of great pains for Canada.
ah, another angry 'christian'.  lol
Can't really argue against anything you wrote above.  Trump is not a Catholic coincidence - he was intentionally promoted by our leaders over the yucky lady candidate.
Christians today are like Thor Johnson.  They like to beat up on  non-Christians.
We have to pay for the French, the Catholic, the Jews, the Muslims, the Feminists, the Natives, the Welfare Class, the millions of government workers, the baby boomers pensions, the new immigrants and refugees....   what more could go wrong ???
Rubbish. Many of us fought long and hard to have Christianity thrown out of our schools. I was punished repeatedly for refusing to say the Lord's Prayer when I was a schoolboy.
Ah, the tolerance of good "Christians" down-voting/disagreeing with your simple statement of what you believe.  Mark my word, you let these intolerant religious nutbags twist the law to persecute Muslims and they will eventually get around to using their corrupt power to persecute Mormons.  It is who/what these intolerant religious scorpions are.
John 3:16 proclaimed as a guilt-enhancing reminder that God sent Jesus to suffer for human sin?  I always heard that verse as just how much God loves us. Liberal Catholics can be such downers.
Excellent. The editorial writer invokes the Bible and Christianity as if they were relevant. Ludicrous. Donald Trump is an old, fat, hate-filled bigot. Just because Sarah Huckabee became a temporary, stand-in press secretary hardly means a thing. If there is a betrayal of American values it's not Trump's fault. He can barely read and is well despised. He grandstands. He promotes his own interests and had the audacity to suck up to Russia and its tiny dictator, Vladimir Putin. That's the real issue. If America refuses to resolve the issue it has with Trump's evil influence then it has no one to blame but itself.
I suppose you think that we should also give every military technological secret we have to Iran.  Oh crap, I hope I didn't give Justin another idea to make the Mullahs love Judaism and Christianity.
Do you actually want the media to ignore what the President says?  Do you also want the media to ignore criminal wrong-doing by Presidents?  Why do you find ignorant and hate-filled messages, whether in tweets or speeches, to be a media-created problem rather than something to be reported and exposed to the 'light of day'?   Would you say that the real problem with the lynching of blacks in America during the 20th century was simply the media reporting those crimes?  It appears you simply want to turn a blind-eye to repulsive, and often anti-Christian, rhetoric by politicians you support.
Cardinal Sarah for pope at the next conclave!  That will raise the profile of Catholics of color and make liberal Catholic heads explode!
Governor Otter's attempt to make a distinction between "preference" and "discrimination" is nothing but a silly parsing of words by a politician. When preferences become policy, discrimination is the inevitable result.  Besides being unjust, establishing religious preferences for refugees is bad public policy. The fact that no committed terrorist would hesitate for a moment to pledge allegiance to a particular creed for his own insidious purposes aside, the consequence of this sort of thing will be the dumbing-down of religious faith to a set of simple criteria that might fit on an index card.  I don't want any government official -- least of all the Trump administration -- deciding what defines an adherent of any religion, let alone a Christian. Faith is too rich and too personal and, frankly, none of their damned business.
All the terrorists that have threatened to kill me have been white Christians born and raised in the USA. Heck, some states even let the KKK, a Christian terrorist organization, adopt highways. Most of the Founding Fathers were slave owning rapists. This country was born in violence and racism and we have yet to correct those sins. See Trump and his minions. Sunday morning is still the most segregated time of the week in this country. As a nation we have no moral superiority over any other nation. Most Americans have no idea of how much rape, robbery, torture, and murder that they benefit from. They don't want to know. If we really fear Sharia law, why do we give so many weapons to Saudi Arabia where it is law. Trump recently crowed about the latest arms deal. Why arm the people so many of his voters fear? The truth is all lives don't matter here. They never have.
OregonBorn: Look at what the Catholic Priests have accomplished over the last how many centuries, AND, the Boy Scouts of America. They have been raping boys, FOREVER.  Read the Sign: FOREVER................
Because Christians don't strap bombs to kids and women and blow themselves up.  Look at all the mass killings and the one thing in common...Muslims.
Metooist:  You raise the key questions relating to religions.  Is god (or God), if he,she, it or they exist, loving or vengeful,  kind or rather nasty?  How about folks who pray to god (God) for rather petty things....victory in a football game for example.....would a god(God) really be interested in such matters?  As we look around us at the harm being done in the name of various gods(Gods), would any supreme being really want such actions?  The list of rather depressing questions could go on for pages.  I've met very loving, wonderful people of all religions.  I've met very loving, wonderful people who are athiests or agnostics.  I've met really nasty, hateful people who are self-avowed Christians, and, again, I've met nasty, hateful people who are agnostics or athiests.  How about radical Muslim zealots.....not really nice folks.  Yet, the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful individuals.  Good is done in the name of religion...so is evil.   I share your skepticism re: religion.
Pawnshops. Start there, perhaps? So very sorry, Christian! I hate hearing of fools like this out there, being grubby little thieves....
Super fakey bigot racist sexist 'christians' dont like to think too hard or deep ...
There are literally thousands of cemeteries across Canada that are exclusive to Catholics, Protestants and Jews.  This is ridiculous.  Let them have their own cemetery.  You can't have it both ways.  This is Canada and this "referendum" is a pathetic joke.
What rights of Muslims are being violated--that they need Christians to come to their defense? If anything, I think our country and government are quite favorable to Muslims, while being hostile to Christianity.  For example: putting a statue of Mary in urine is considered art, yet the person who wanted to burn Korans was called out and strongly condemned.  A professor who requested people to send him consecrated hosts was not strongly condemned, but those who desecrate Muslim sacred things are.  A professor has his students draw a picture of Jesus and tells them to stomp on it and nothing happens to him.  What would happen to a professor who tells his students to draw the prophet Mohammad and stomp on that?  Oh, and when have the Muslims been called out for their moral teachings and their teachings on women?   I don't think the Muslim community is having their rights trampled that Christians need to defend them.  I do think the rights of Christians are being trampled.
Christians are not tolerant. They are disgusted by non-believers just like Muslims. The only difference they put people in prison for 20 years, it is why Canada and the USA have such high prison populations. Prison is just a slow death, that's all.
Muslim fanatical beliefs must be eliminated if we are to have even a modicum of peace in the world. The clearly proven depravity of muslim beliefs need to be eradicated not encouraged and endorsed especially in Canada.   Did you know that at Toronto International Airport there is a MUSLIMS ONLY prayer chapel replete with dirty feet washing machines....yet ZERO CHRISTIAN or JEWISH Chapels are permitted....whats up with that? Did you know that Peel Region Schools must now accommodate muslim prayer times in a special location but NO OTHER RELIGIOUS prayer is permitted.....what's up with that B.S?  This is not the Canada I once knew and loved.  Breeding like rabbits mulsims will overtake populations in many Countries and spread their vileness and hatred of traditional normalcy.  Time for the 2018 CRUSADES to begin worldwide to rid the world of these fanatical maniacs that super stupid lefty gov't support.. THERE IS no other way. Trump is right on this point if not on anything else!
It's fascinating to read how Jules and other progressive Christians practice their religion. It sounds like they plug their ears and cover their eyes when the "yucky" "scary" parts come on screen but still like the movie.
Good try.  Try harder. WORLDNET DAILY IS MOSTLY libertarian with a strong Judeo-Christian influence. It's why they often flipped GW Bush for some of his policies. A much more thorough job of ripping than the standard "Bush lied, people died" horse crap. Unlike the talking heads on PMSNBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, etc., Worldnet daily used logical arguments and factual events to go after Bush (North American Union, freeway from Juarez to Alberta, illegal immigration, etc.). Tell me FRZMAO when did the mainstream media ever go after Obama or HRC? Name two incidents.....  Personally I'm surprised you had the guts to try an throw anything from Salon magazine at.me. Talk about biased! Why not list the Huffington post while you're at it.
don't forget cats and dogs living together.  You sound like all previous anti immigrant jerks from those anti Irish Catholics, to the Jews, to the Hungarians (all Commies remember), to the Italians (all Mafia, remember).
Here is how stupid the Catholic Church is on this.  A marriage between a Catholic and a Lutheran in a Lutheran church is somehow a sin if the Catholic doesn't get the "correct" paperwork.  But a piece of paper from the bishop makes it not a sin.  Because God is a gov't bureaucrat.
What Mr. Gehring saw, although he will never admit it, were people who disagree with him (and me) on the interpretation of Catholic teaching and its implementation. It has been the constant position of NCR that people who disagree are entitled to a place at the table without being demonized -- a precedent set rather early by the decision to include not one, but four gospels that portray Jesus' life and teaching in different lights. The idea that people who disagree with us are hypocrites is one of the most sophomoric ideas possible.
Spot on! They want evangelical Christians to be able to discriminate against gay people, but not gay people to be able to discriminate against evangelical Christians.
Yes we all know those darn Coptic Christians should continue to pay, I bet it put a big smile on your face knowing they deserved it..
"Black Catholics must work harder to bridge the racial divide in communities, the nation and within the church"...Wow.  The victims must right the ship?!  Talk about "Right church, wrong pew"!
Jeremy Christian is not the only anti-Muslim ranter that police need to be worried about ...............
A rather foolish comment, TomQuinn, but FYI the Obama's were completely open and consistent in what their beliefs were.  The Trumps are deceptive and erratic and say what they think their audience - even the Pope - wants to hear.  Neither the Obamas nor the Trumps are Catholic, so it is of no consequence.  But in truth, the Obamas are far more Christian than the current president or his wife.  And Spicer is no better than his former employer.
You are the one who is lost here.  No President or congress has [or will] change that law.    Secondly, I was not referring to Charles Curran----Brian Johnstone wrote that essay.  Johnstone demonstrated that during the pontificates of JP II and Benedict---a profound shift moved from Gaudiem et spes which saw the consciences of Christians as often ignorant, but it was an inculpable ignorance.  Ratzinger saw Christians as often ignorant, but culpably so.  Johnstone, "Conscience in Error," in CONSCIENCE: READINGS IN MORAL THEOLOGY 14, ed. Charles Curran [Mahwah, NJ: Paulist Press, 2004], p. 169.  Ratzinger's critique of conscience fails to distinguish between the primary and secondary precepts of moral law.  It fails to recognize or entertain the complexity of markedly different cultural contexts.  Ratzinger, who had a limited pastoral experience as young priest---assumed far too quickly that people are guilty for not knowing the moral law, when in fact, they may be inculpably unaware.
‘I assure you, as often as you did it for one of my least brothers, you did it for me.’ (Mat 25:40)   God weeps because the Catholic clergies rape him in Children!!!!!!!!!!! I can't understand how on earth clergies do not know this!
No, republicans are far more likely to cheat, lie and persecute others who aren't white Christian heterosexuals.  Republicans through years of lies are turning this country into a fascist theocracy.
They're not Christians, they're ChristianISTS. They wish to spread their religious beliefs by force.  They're religious radicals in the same vein as the radicalized Islamists who bomb everything.  It's just unfortunate that you rarely hear Christians condemn the radicals in their midst...
“You voted for Trump and you are Christians?” He sneered. “You will get what you deserve!”  Unless the gentleman is from another country (Even then the President of the United States and the US cast a long shadow.)  He to will get what he deserves as we all will.
I wonder, if it is possible to fix current Catholic hierarchy??? Just look at them, they acting like the robots move on commend! None of them speak about the fifty some clergy sex abused children who committed suicide.  That show they have no compassion for the children they murdered.   Even an ordinary lay person have more compassion then what these RC clergies collectively show!  That means they are spiritually dead person.
It provably too late now, however, if you CI clergies & religious all speak up with 'Christ-like integrity' against clergy sex abuses of children, this problem will end in no time! Yet you unethical, pompous attitude of believe in religious superiority as a clergies/religious decide to support the rapes of children by your silence till your soul will 'burn in hell'. You clergies/religious do not believe there is a living God who is immanent in children, do you? You don't believe in Holy Mary who is the mother of all souls on earth, do you?  If you do not believe in these spiritual realities on earth, just give up being a clergy/religious!  I think we can do all better without you spiritual hypocrites!
''What has your pointing and illuminating accomplished so far?'' it's got us a spotlight on an international disgrace, disaster, and a very likely future despot who screams at ''fake news'' TV sets in the White House when he's not screaming at his justice obstructing AG and anybody else kneeling in front of him as he incriminates himself further with every irrepressible tweet. ...sad. ''Has it produced more jobs'' probably more than the guy with all the promises has so far '' Has it won special elections in Georgia and South Carolina?'' closer than ever before ''Has it reduced violence in Chicago?'' your guy flew over Chicago a few times Has it reduced illegal immigrants on our southern border?'' has it forced out intellectuals? professionals? mothers? children? mid-E. Christians? heroic war interpreters? btw, where is that wall which will cost US $BILLIONS$? or that 30 day plan to defeat ISIS, now he's joining ISIS? but, you're more concerned with peace loving pussy hats? oh, COVFEFE!
Why don't Christians apologize for and explain Timothy McVeigh who bombed a federal building killing over a hundred innocent children and people?
ah yes, the inevitable mixing of pedophiles and homosexuals in an effort to say they're all the same.  It's every bit as insulting as claiming all heterosexual men are girl fondlers.  But hey, whatever it takes to do the Christian thing and smear others, right?
Donald Trump is on the record for bragging about being a sexual predator.  U.S. Catholic Bishops have a long well-documented history of protecting sexual predators that otherwise conform with their positions.  No surprise that the bishops would overlook Trumps major character flaw.
You obviously have no problem listening to--and DEFENDING--"Amy the Talking Mule" when she reviles and slanders innocent people because of their Faith, seeks to deny others aid programs she herself took advantage of, and gets all self-righteous despite foisting another guy's bass-turd on her then-husband.  "Thou shalt not commit adultery."  Right.  Think what you want.  I already KNOW those ethically-challenged, sanctimonious hypocrites calling themselves "Christians" while defending the indefensible aren't good people.  Hypocrisy (fasiq) is the second-worst spiritual crime, exceeded only by idolatry itself.  Your Book records that the Messiah (alayhis-Salaam more harshly denounced hypocrites than anyone else:  "WOE unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, HYPOCRITES!  Ye REFUSE to enter the Kingdom of God and would hold the door against those who would enter!"  My favorite of Jesus' speeches--and English translators 'toned it down'.  He actually said, "D@MN you Scribes and Pharisees..." etc.
CKS says: "soldiers have never fought for Kaep's rights" & " have never had to defend their country from invasion". Here's some history lessons for you: 1) WWII - we'd all be speaking German now if the USA had not entered that war 1941. If they'd waited for the actual invasion this would be German North America 2) 911 - not an invasion? Al Qaeda & ISIS intend to take over all Christian countries. This war is already being waged on European & North American soil Get your head out of your arse
"Women are not all of the same affinity any more than all men."    I never said "all" women had the exactly same interests. Is that really what you thought I meant? Really? To say there's a natural affinity among women is self-evident. If it were otherwise, there'd be no basis for Women's Studies, or "Women's Rights." Women, in general, have similar interests. As do men, in general. Your resort to arguing about a hetero man going to a gay rights parade and proclaiming his affinity to the men there is pathetic, precisely because gay men have so little affinity with men in general, the vast majority of whom are hetero. Your hypo intentionally overlooks that I was talking about men and women in general.  As to you other pathetic hypo, the Church requiring private sex acts to be ordained.  Somewhere, there IS such a church. Does it oppress you?  Your DOJ hypo doesn't work, either. I have a civil right, protected by law, not to be discriminated against for such a job.  Like priesthood?  No.
Would it help you to know the broader definition of the word amoris in Latin in order to understand Amoris Laetitia better?  The homosexuals in the Vatican are still laughing at the inside joke they publicly foisted on the sheep, many of whom remain completely oblivious to the "Joy of Sodomy", which is one translation of the title of this notorius document.   amor, amoris noun declension: 3rd declension gender: masculine  Definitions:  affair affection Cupid love sexual/illicit/homosexual passion the beloved  Age: In use throughout the ages/unknown Area: All or none Geography: All or none Frequency: Very frequent, in all Elementry Latin books, top 1000+ words Source: “Oxford Latin Dictionary”, 1982 (OLD)
An absolute  ridiculous article and how appropriate for NCR to publish such nonsense on this special day of the March for Life. Time at last for NCR to take Catholic out of their name.
Er.  Gods control everything is anamolous?   Wow.  All those years of christian education down the tubes, and me, a village idiot all these years, wandering about in the forest, bumping into trees....
JPII still should have abdicated when he became enfeebled.  His Trad cardinals ran amok and many, like the leader of the congregation for priests, made it harder to deal with pedophiles in the clergy.  I worry more about the asexual mafia than the homosexual one.
Being carried on the back of an elephant or turtle, or made out of nothing in 7 days does not seem to be a viable explanation. Keep trying. Once Religious Victims admit that the history of the world spans Geologic time and that life has evolved they are on the path to knowledge. Creationists are simply pathetic and must be respected or taken seriously. Modern Geology was the beginning of the end for Christianity and related brands of superstition.
Muslims and liberals excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of Christianity, Europe. Israel, and America. Islam's destructive iconoclasm is destroying historic treasures across the ME: in just one year Notre Dame in Paris has had three close call bomb threats. They even have Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal wars between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects, ISIS , Taliban and Al Qaeda are the root causes of most of the wars and social chaos happening around the world today. It is worse than anything expressed in the west,

I have never failed to find that the Catholic ideal of "faith seeking understanding" is truncated in favor of legalistic argumentation. Furthermore, any attempt at nobility and grace is met with derision.      Rather than attempt to dialogue with the brainwashed and mental midgets I will avoid the occasion of sin (go to hell, you bloody m@#$%^f$^%!@#s) and not attempt this again.      If you want to send Carole King to hell because she is Jewish and has been married more than once, screw you. If you want to send Amy Grant, whose Gospel singing has only matured over time to hell for the same reason, screw you.     And screw the dumbass MF who wrote this article for ending it calling for absolute obedience to the Pope, without resort to conscience.      As for anyone who like my posts, thank you for your support. Give me leave to avoid this cesspool of religious ignorance and damnable superstition once and for all.
Imago Dei does not treat people with respect.  That is the problem.   You are an apologist for Imago Dei.  What else have you been doing on this thread? You apologize for Imago Dei, insult me and other posters, and  brag about your moral & intellectual superiority. Whoopdedo.  I have read extensively about fundy Christianity and share my bed with an ex-fundy.  Oh yes, Imago Dei says that our relationship is meaningless  because we aren't married.  Of course I am going to tell them to go kiss my grits.
So basically all people from Muslim countries can stay, while ones from Christian countries are sent away.  What a screwed up country we've become.
White Catholic voters were instrumental in electing violence, hate, bigotry, racism, misogyny as a quid pro quo for a conservative judge, the remote possibility of rendering abortion illegal, and the exclusion of Catholic "businesses" from supposed intrusion of the Obamacare - a minor element.  White Catholic voters were heavily influenced by US Bishops and clergy. And then these same have the gall to decry racist violence?  Something, no, some people and their stuff, stinks....
Yes!  God yes!  Someone finally called out those damn evangelicals!  I hate how they are always running around trying to help the poor, when we KNOW that is the government's job.  LOL
GBA, do you realize how ridiculous you sound? While Trump may be doing what he promised, he is doing so while driving America into the ground. For all you who think that a sectionalist United States -- which is terribly hypocritical -- is the way America becomes great again, you are wrong. Trump has made America a laughing stock in just a week of Presidency because he is doing what he promised.   You are a terribly uneducated, narrow-minded, hypocritical citizen. If you so purport to be a follower of Christianity and Christ, you must welcome all others just as Christ did. Be welcoming to the downtrodden, the sick, and the needy. Do not shun others because they are different from you.   Oh and, by the way, let's not forget Christ and the entire foundation of Christianity was built in...where again? Oh yeah that's right THE MIDDLE EAST.
you accept christian sharia law while screaming how you don't want sharia law.  Amy is the equivalent of a radicalized imam spouting hate for jews and the west.   how do you not see this?
"Fanatics"?  "Lunatics who hate Christians and conservatives"?  Rather strong words to describe those who believe that personal freedoms as long as they do no harm to others should be preserved and that corporations should not have equal standing with citizens.
You are entitled to your opinion, but you are not entitled to claim that your opinion is Catholic, or that the Catholic Church must employ people in gay civil marriages.
Don't imply even via rhetorical "question" that I said "all Jews committed war crimes".  I referred to ZIONISTS.  I oppose Zionism for the same reasons I oppose Nazism and Apartheid--doesn't mean I hate Jews, Germans or Boers.  The Zionist entity isn't a theocracy.  It's a secular, openly ANTI-SEMITIC apartheid state.  I AM a Semite--descended from a Syrian Sephardic Jewish immigrant.  The REAL anti-Semites are the Zionist Ashkenaziim, who are NOT Semites but derive from the Turk-related Khazars, originating in the Black Sea region, who converted to the Jewish faith in the 8th century; they rule "Ersatz Isra'el", and they've persecuted not only Semitic Muslims and Christians, but Arab and African Jews.  Research the Zionists' DELIBERATE irradiation of over 100,000 Sephardic Jewish CHILDREN with US Army X-ray machines giving 35,000 times the maximum dose! Killed THOUSANDS of them!  They're still dying of cancer and leukemia today.  The Zionists learned their lessons from the Nazis WELL!
So John, you're saying that the prosecution of any of those "twisted people" was only done a Christian judiciary? That there were no Jews, Muslims, atheists, Buddhists, or followers of other religions involved, only Christians? That's a bit hard to believe isn't it?  However your post actually proves my point. No doubt many of the prosecutors had some affiliation to the Christian faith. Therefore no one could claim that Christians are "twisted people" who murder abortion providers. Islam is no different, there is no basis to assert that all Muslims are terrorists just because of the actions of a small fundamentalist subset.
Sigh...my question is simple: What practicle purpose would a so-called "papal visit" serve, really? He'll show up,smile and wave to the crowds, kiss a few babies, deliver one of his interminably boring homilies, and so what? After he leaves, South Sudan will...What? If the Roman Catholic Church is so keen on helping, send aid and money, NOT useless,idolatrous figureheads.
Your ignorant and borderline bigoted blast at Catholics is EXACTLY why the Founders' decision to make America secular was the correct one. It's almost as if they had lived in a time when a ruinous war launched by Protestants against Catholics in the U.K. left tens of thousands needlessly dead on both sides.
So brown racism,  black racism are better?  Ever see another race or ethnicity working on a farm,  other than Hispanic?  Ever manage a farm in white racist Oregon? Where did the fruit tramps,  the Okies and Arkies go?  What became of them?   Ever  have to physically separate the Mexicans from the Laos people,   who the Mexicans call "Chinitos" ,  their slang for any Asian.   Dare you practice free speech in Dearborne,  Michigan,  and set up a curbside Christian soap box?  You tough enough to keep the muslims from beating you senseless in Dearborne,  you infidel!   Washington DC's city council is passing a regulation to make sure that African Americans own most of the weed outlets,  because right now,  whites have put  up the money,  made the investment,  to sell weed to  Americans in Washington DC. and only one outlet is African American owned.    That's racism by government in our Nation's Capitol.   "Diversity" is the code word, dog whistle,   for reverse racism,  sexism by the left.
As an EDCATED Gay Catholic Texan, Catholic School from 1st grade to degree in Math & Computer Science from the University of Dallas, cannot express the disgust at the unhinged rant of Paprocki ! I'm embarrassed at the clear VILE and UNCHRISTIAN attitude of his bigoted words !!!  He needs to be drug into a Psych Ward.  I suppose he thinks Trump is acceptable too ?? a VILE sexual predator Russian Conspirator just because he's a Republican? Shame on Paprocki, I wouldn't want my children exposed to HIM !!
Because as you know I suspect you of being a Catholic fascist. But maybe you are simply pedantic and tone deaf, "Croesus." Whatever happened to Lydia? (Don't answer that. I'm JOKING.)
The KKK members have long been "equal opportunity" bigots......Catholics....Jews...Blacks.... "let's hate them all!"
I bet the Catholic School Boards are real happy that they took public funds now. I remember a Catholic Priest telling me that it was the stupidest move they could have made, just when the Miller government brought this out in the 1980s. He predicted this sort of thing would happen and he was right.
Yeah this has become the hypocrisy of our religion! 3000 INNOCENT lives are being murdered EVERYDAY but let's make our first priority ILLEGAL immigration! There are several avenues to come into this country, and if you are illegal there are ways to "fix/resolve" that problem with the government! These are people that have come here and can support/defend themselves BUT let's ignore the ones that cannot! The Catholic Church continues to move away from the teachings of Christ and move into the political correctness arena, which is disheartening! We finally have a candidate who, has been chastised, ridiculed, and given many opportunities by the media, etc., to backtrack off his pro-life stance and he hasn't! Bishops stated nothing about the death penalty items up for votes, the list goes on and on! It is clear MONEY and INFLUENCE means more to my religion and I am disheartened!
These people so destroyed their own orders that they can't get any new postulants, and then they have the temerity to beg the average Catholic in the pew for financial help.  Pathetic!
Christianity, Judaism and Islam, the three Abrahamic Religions are the root of all evil in this world.   We are being held hostage by an out dated Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is ridiculous that in this day and age we must be held hostage with religious accommodation based on cultural values from 2000 years ago.  What a joke.
As I have said before, anyone who calls Pope Francis a Marxist is either a fool or a liar. Same for Obama or Hillary Clinton. Do any of you rightists have a clue about what Marxism is?  And anyone who calls for a missile strike clearly is no Christian.
Heh.  WTG, Shannon.  Although many Christians seem to think we Muslims believe only in the Old Testament, we do believe in Jesus (alayhis-Salaam).  IMHO his very best speech was the one denouncing the politicians and lawyers of his day: "WOE be on you, Scribes and Pharisees, HYPOCRITES!  You REFUSE to enter the Kingdom of God and would hold the door against those who would enter!"  Hey Pete, are your ears burning?  Perhaps you should be thankful it's only your ears.  For now.
Awe! That you would stoop so low as to trivialize the death of people in Manchester and by default then, it's disgusting to think that you don't care about the thousands of young boys and girls who were raped and abused under Christian clerics in residential schools, or the lateral violence and toxic stress that resulted in this horrible chapter of Canadian history.
What an absurd comment, "J. NEVER asked Roman..." He couldn't.  He wasn't a Roman citizen. He called his Jewish religion to live up to its care of the poor. Republicans largely are Calvinists.  You are poor because you are not right w. god. Jesus upended this view when he said how difficult for the rich to enter the KofG. The disciples were amazed because common interpretation was the rich were right w. god. For Jesus, they were rich because of exploitation. If Christians took J. literally there be no need for government but because Christians here don't, secular government do what Christian don't.  Same for government's 14th amendment, equality & due process of every citizens because the dominant Christians didn't treat native Americans & blacks as equal, providing due process.  Rather, Indian removal, lynchings, etc, largely by Christians here!  Who were the savages, civilized?
Thank you for your reply, Fred.  I'm sure you mean evangelical bigot, not "racist."  I also am saddened by the need for abortions, and thank you for putting it that way.   It is beyond sad.  The wars and capital punishment, also.  I have known a few fundamentalists who were as close to angels as you will find on earth.     However, if you believe that Trump is a dangerous, narcissistic cult leader in the making, but not a sociopathic rapist and thief, then I still question your ability to distinguish form from substance.  Who is his cult? Remember the article we are responding to? Who stands by him even now?  Evangelicals!  I don't hold hatred for people who don't believe the way I do. I do, however, tend to get put out at people's behaviors and destruction.  A lot of Christians, especially southern fundamentalists in this country, have been a psychopathic horror for Native and African Americans.  I'm over respecting people for their ideals/motives, but not the fruits of their actions.
Celibacy?!?! You do realize that the majority of pedophiles are -married- men with seemingly normal families, do you? You do realize that the professional child welfare investigators that root out pedophiles for a living, to them the Roman collar is hardly even a blip on their radar, do you?  Affront to survivors?!?! You DO realize that -this- survivor, along with the vast majority of other survivors, were NOT abused by a Catholic priest, but by someone from probably your very own own demographic, and WE view your myopic tunnel vision towards priests as not only stupid, but even dangerous....do you?
The baker makes custom cakes. He refused to make any custom cake for this couple solely because they were gay. That is discrimination. Are you also okay with bakers refusing to bake cakes for Christian couples or for disabled couples? And, if so, were you libertarian before or after gay people were included in civil rights laws?
No, the GOP in Colorado clear back then was headed towards the conservative side.  And KKK in Colorado, was NOT about racism , but about being against Catholics and Jews, not blacks.  Sadly, Conservatives likes yourself, have a LONG history of hate and going after others. Look at how your leader trump is going after muslim refugees even though 100% of evidence is that he will not pick up a SINGLE terrorists.   As to the klan in the south, it was almost always about blacks.
Hillary Clinton is no "Savior" and it is blasphemy to place Hillary on the same level as Jesus Christ, Son of God!  Hillary is a lying, evil, corrupt individual who deserved to lose her bid for the White House.
Who are you to decide that the baker's actions are "inconsistent" with Christianity?The 1st amendment does NOT determine what beliefs are, just that the government does not get to make laws restricting the free expression of the religion (with the caveat of course that no "religion" can deny others their life or their religion-that is a given). muslims ARE consistent with their religious belief that homosexuality is a death sentence. So, you are saying that as long as muslims are consistent and kill/discriminate against homosexuals they are free to do so, in your mind, because they are "consistent" but you single out YOUR definition of Christian and determine that no "Christian" is allowed the same right to refuse service to, approve of or associate with gays? What an illogical, irrational, intolerant position!
Those 3 individuals are a cancer.  They need to be removed from the Catholic Church ASAP.    If I wanted to join a church that welcomed liberal cesspools, I would have become a Democrat.
Your defense is off  the mark I didn't call him a terrorist  I said he's pro Muslim terrorist immigration  His debt with congress doubled under Obama  Both at fault  Obama was leader  Pro partial birth abortion  Anti traditional marriage  Your a racist toward Christian values Scratch a democrate and find not racist but satanic principles
Andrew Sullivan, "Every pillar of Trump's essential character is a cardinal sin for Christians: lust, gluttony, greed, envy, anger, and pride." Sullivan left out impulsiveness. I only hope we can survive Trump's term of office and he does not get us all killed...
You're doing a better job than I am of making my point. I also agree that the Rebublicans have been obstructing. Yes and Rupert Murdoch is rich and so are O'Reilly and Hannity. I can't believe how they are able to go to communion. Catholics, right. They lie, look down on the people they serve, and destroy their country but they can be proud of their rating. I'm on the verge of despair. When O'Reilly says he's watching our the folks and is fair and balanced I feel like throwing up. That guy knows what he's doing. It's as noxious as pornography.
THAT WAS MY POINT, DICK. Holy hell. Christians=Muslims. It's all the same.
And when over 80% of evangelicals vote for tRump they show their stupidity.
Yes Marty E, we can agree.  We both are glad I quit a Catholic seminary full of so much hypocrisy about sexuality.
Christians were the murderers for centuries during the period of colonialism and imperialism.  I guess no one likes to have the tables turned on them.
Wow!  You liberal Catholics sure are hateful!  Apparently you'd rather have baby murdering, anti-Christian, lbgtxyz-loving Hillary for president.
Spare me the pathetically transparent commercials.  "Israel" is a state so utterly 'race'/identity-obsessed it murders its own CHILDREN for being the wrong "color", that treats Arab and Ethiopian JEWS as 2nd-class citizens (don't ask about Muslims and Christians), and that dumped blood donated by the Falashas because it wasn't considered 'pure' enough to be used to treat Ashkenaziim, and that openly practices housing and educational discrimination--except when the TV cameras come round.  In that last it does somewhat resemble its hypocritical white-supremacist 'patron', the USA.  Further it is a non-theocratic yet self-proclaimed JEWISH state that in which full privileges are reserved for European--Ashkenazi--Jews; and concerning the Arabs it treads upon, it is no more and no less than an APARTHEID state so oppressive and tyrannical that Bishop Desmond Tutu and the late Nelson Mandela both said it was worse than the apartheid they themselves endured.  Khalas.
I hate to tell you this but ALL mainstream Christian churches, including The RCC, are losing members.  Hand over fist.  The only two countries where is it gaining members is Africa and South America, in that order.  Also remember that lots of people call themselves Catholic, but do not participate in The RCC in any way.  Also remember that the number of atheists, agnostics and simply 'unchurched' are growing at a pretty good pace.  (Perhaps a surprise to you, the vast majority of atheists, agnostics and 'unchurched' are not immoral.)  Considering that an estimated 10% of the RC priests are homosexual (and most are celibate) and that around 10% are/have been pedophiles, church affiliation or no church affiliation does not have a lot to do with sinning and being virtuous.
To say "evangelicals are stupid" is no different from saying "Catholics (or put in any other religious group) are stupid."
Wow, Tinky Winky, you are comparing the conservative Catholics to ISIS and the Taliban.  Thank you for providing evidence of the anti-Catholic hatred ironically found on this forum.
How do you know who is actually a Christian based off of statistics like this ? Jesus said 1 in 4 who show signs of belief actually are, so so can divide your percentages by 3, the visible church is filled with apostates - the Bible is clear about that, so your statistics are meaninglessness, contrived, unbiblical and irrelevant.    I go to a Church with about 200 people and know one person who has been divorced and that was 30 years ago, you need to dispense with your blatant bigotry. As far as education goes, Bill Gates doesn't have degree either and he is the worlds richest man. I do not have a degree (have some college), work from home for a fortune 200 (11 years now) company, make 6 figures+, own my home outright and will be able to retire in 10 years at 60 should the world not collapse before then. Why do I need to plunk down 100k for a degree ? A person can do fine without one, and does not need to subject themselves to the brainwashing you, no doubt, went through. Sorry Icon.
No!  We need more frilly duds made from Irish grandmothers' lace curtains!  By golly, they were what definitely filled the seminaries in the bad old daze!  Isn’t it odd that Catholic clergy have to dress like mother in order to act like father?   Seminarism:  trying to make a priest out of a man by dressing him like a girl and treating him like a boy.
Bottom line:  Priests aren't trusted, therefore by your logic, all Catholics should be assumed pedophiles and treated as such.  Sounds reasonable.
Not a Christian? I get that. Not a hypocrite? Whole other matter.
The problem with the Catholic faith, other religions, government, the military, law enforcement, and criminal justice is this; they are all dominated by men, and mostly by white authoritarian men! Sorry guys, but most men aren't known for their empathy for others or planning for the long term versus short term pleasure. In Trump we see these negative qualities magnified a thousand times. Frankly, I'm sick of it! All the institutions that make countries a good place where their citizens can thrive would be much improved if at least half the people wielding power and making decisions were women! More than half would be even BETTER! Now we see what the world is coming to. Short term greed takes precedence over the environment. Short term greed is more important than people and communities. Make no mistake, we are killing ourselves. But the authoritarian white men causing this genocide will be long dead before their grandchildren start paying the price.
Sorry, does me talking about the Bible upset you? Or is this another "you can't know what you're talking about because you were never a real Christian you're just a deadbeat drug addict who needs saving" thing?
Christians who have kiled are not acting in accordance with their faith and the teachings of our Lord. They are actually going against the commands of the faith and are committing grave sins. However, Muslims who commit murder and terror  are doing so in accordance with their faith and following the commands of their prophet. That's the difference. You should get your head out of the sand and educate yourself.
This guy is a lunatic. Progressives have infiltrated the Catholic Church and need to be purged as they are a cancer. Bearing false witness is a sin, Padre and let he who has no sin cast the first stone, Padre...he reminds me of the Priest in Dirty Harry realizing how wrong he was after it was too late...Bishop McElroy, your willful mischaracterization of everything is shameful. Hating your neighbors (which all progressives do) is a sin. This nut job is an example of what is killing the Catholic Church...get the progressives out of here...stop promoting violence...and lawlessness...and riots...and hate...
No, when white men act like terrorists, they're called mentally disabled. But they do seem to have a brand of christianity in common. Your last sentence though is pretty funny and ironic.
Local troll GBA has submitted acidic letters to the editor for decades as an admitted racist, misogynist, xenophobe, fast food handler, tax preparation insider, and established authority on quasi delusional, and self serving Christian behaviors. Did I leave anything out?
If people wanting to commit depraved sexual acts is a reason to re-think the Church's teaching on sexuality, isn't people telling lies a reason to re-think the Church's teaching on truth-telling? Especially in these enlightened times, after fifty years of loosening up of those fusty old neuroses about lying in court, in the media, in the White House. And those ridiculous old principles of good sportsmanship should be re-thought too. In the latter half of the twentieth century we all discovered that people just like to cheat: professional athletes cheat, Olympic teams cheat, even dogs cheat at flyball. Isn't it obvious that Jesus would want us to affirm and welcome and flatter cheaters?
Let's take this absurdity one step further: Stop allowing Christians into Canada who have been overtly persecuted by Muslims because they are likely to harbour Islamophobic thoughts.
So much for centrism.  Did not know he was a Clintonite.  He should have attacked Trump more.  It would be stupid for the Democrats to base their leadership decisions on the propaganda against them by non-Democrats.  Whether she retains or not depends on whether Sanders candidates challenge in safe seats and who wins the contested seats in 2018.  Whether large numbers of seats change hands depends on whether the Special Prosecutor finds anything and how these findings are resolved. Censure is predictable, but it won's look good in swing districts.  MSW does not like Pelosi over abortion politics.  Democrats need their Catholic members to explain why Roe was decided how it was, how it won't change and how the GOP is a scam for saying it can be. So far, Pelosi has not had the courage to teach her Catholic brethren the truth.  The religious left is centrist, whereas the left is secular.  Still, as an original Christian leftist, I have not problem supporting Democrats - or Socialists.
... 80% of Trump supporters consider themselves Christian ... FAKERS!!!
There we go now......yours is the very type of thinking used by bigots of all kinds, making connection between all sorts of personal or social disorders in order to justify the oppression (religious or secular) of a singled-out group.  I would suggest you reconsider your statement of: "Should the bishop deny a Christian burial to a known and conspicuous racist?" to what Jesus taught His disciples over and over again.  You should already know there is no connection between homosexuality (an orientation on a range of possibilities) and racism (a learned hatred towards other groups of human beings based on external differences).  Perhaps your position as you expressed here is closest to that of a racist then it is to Christianity?
If all us Christians can love the "pussy grabber", you can too!  Happy Mother's Day!
Ummm, your Christianity has a bloody history as well. Any fear-based group is capable of violence -- be it by strapping a bomb to yourself or by voting for someone to do your bombing for you.
We live in a “reality challenged” country wherein even Democrats “are not real people”, where “fake news” is a political touchstone, where American’s votes in Virginia, New Hampshire, California were “fraudulent”, where millions of people “voted illegally”, where “reality TV” is obviously not, where the winner of an election is called the “loser”, and now where “real Christians” are “appalled at the LIAR IN CHIEF”. I’m sorry, George, but the flimsy excuse of “reality” cannot change the fact that Christians embrace with enthusiasm the current President because they choose to believe the “reality” that “…as you know, we’re under siege.” Trump's “we” being yet another strain on credulity. “Reality?”  We don’t need no stinkin’ reality…any more than we need more “real Christians”.
The "secular" argument in its worst definition emanates from the negativity of the pseudo Christian.
Um, how is that straw man of yours?    This isn't about me, it's about this awful pResident.    The point is that Donnie Two Scoops professes to be a Christian, at least to get the rubes to vote for him, but really worships Mammon.
"As an African-American Muslim man, 'I don't have that freedom,"  You don't say.   Oh, sorry; I forget facts often get in the way of the taqiya victim narrative.  It never ceases to amaze me how pseudoliberals who purport to be champions of women's rights and GLBT rights are so ready to enable an ideology that is FAR more anti-women and anti-GLBT than the Christians that they hate so much. And I'm saying this as an agnostic who frequently criticizes Christians for their anti-rights stance on women's and GLBT issues.
Neighbor98...You keep railing against a place you've never stepped foot in, and judging people you don't know. The irony is rich, as you continually insult Imago Dei, and try to play the part of the victim...Imago Dei is against you and your choices. I am quite certain no one in that church is overly concerned with who you share a bed with. You seem to be the only one making your lifestyle an issue.   Why are you so angry about Imago Dei? I think its because you perceive them to be a group of Christians who actually believe something...wait for it...exist in your community. What would you have them do...leave? The loaded words you keep throwing out are way over the top: "Imago Dei=Westboro Church", [Imago Dei teaches] "homophobic misogynist" doctrine, and you and Imago Dei are "not friends, [but] enemies." If you actually believe that last quote, then I'd say you're the one with the problem. Don't be a hypocrite, Neighbor.
Patrick J. Luby.  Hummm, maybe Trump mentioned Islamists because radical Islamists have chopped off American heads, kidnapped/raped/murdered Christians in their own countries, vowed "Death to America," and on and on.  Yes, some terrorists are homegrown.  Yes, some go to Muslim countries to get their terrorist training.  However, extreme vetting of immigrants/visitors from Islamic countries is a great start, not the complete solution.   In Islamic countries governed as theocracies, there is no separation between religion and state, quite the opposite.  BTW, it was Obama who devised the original list of countries, yet no one blinked at his proposal.  http://www.dailywire.com/news/11410/complete-list-radical-islamic-terror-attacks-us-james-barrett
If I recall, Republicans early on worked on versions of the bill in committee.  They supported the 'Individual Mandate', a conservative approach, but then used it to distance themselves from the act and any further involvement.  Of course, we know now that Republicans main, if not only, goal had become blocking any of Obama's initiatives, and making him a one term President.  It also seems to me that many of the 1000+ pages of the bill were changes used to appease Republicans, hoping to gather some buy-in.  Those are the things that should have been worked out by committee and compromise.  As for rushing it and pushing it through, the alternative to that was to let it die (again) and tell suffering and dying Americans without access to just go to hell.  Surely none of us baptized, Catholic, Christians would be willing to go that far.
A Christian supporting actions that defund programs that help the same kind of people the Christian jesus lived and breathed to help, and support giving the same defunded monies to the same kind of people the Christian jesus punted out of the temples. And obviously you support shipping the CIA created refugees out of America too. But the Christians following the bastardized Christian values do not have the common sense to realize the christian jesus was himself a refugee.  Where do the souls of Trumps Christian supporters go when they die. Do they get special dispensation from their hell because they did not have the common sense to realize they were following a orange headed Russian poodle, on his own hellbound train?
Muslims good.  Christians who don't want to be forcibly converted to islam bad.  Blah, blah, blah.  Another islamist dressed up as a progressive.
That is money well spent.  I'd rather all my money go to National Catholic Reporter, the best newspaper in the country, rather than some stupid wall on the Mexican border.
Many a true word is spoken in jest is an adage, aphorism or proverb. A version of this appears in The Cook's Tale by Chaucer: "Ful ofte in game a sooth I have herd saye!". Nic alias Kurgan mocks the Catholic Church to the point where his posts become predictable and boring.  Who, however, is he mocking? Orthodox Catholics who simply ignore him as they would a fly as opposed to a wasp? Or could it be that he is deliberately fuelling the prejudices of the small majority of progressive posters to this site? Either way he is holding the Catholic Church up to ridicule. Now if this what you want, Catholicism to be ridiculed in a public forum by all means give him your up-votes but remember it is you who he is actually ridiculing;  it just goes over our heads.
Either you or Hooded Claw complained about it so I changed it.  I am devotee of the Catholic Church, the Church that Christ founded and ordered to go forth to teach all the nations.  Your personal assessments of other people's inner thoughts and motivations are not appreciated by me at all.
Behind their shallow, multicultural facade, the Trudeau Liberals are and have always been a party of white privilege.  They don't care about Muslim refugees, only about taxing hard-working newcomers to support their permissive and dissolute lifestyle.        ❧   ❧   ❧   ❧   ❧  Canadians felt safe under Conservative Prime Minister Stephen J. Harper, a devout Christian who extended a warm-hearted acceptance to people of all faiths. He lived modestly at the historic PM's 24 Sussex residence.  While coming from a family of Roman Catholics, the playboy Justin Trudeau abandoned his faith to become an unbeliever,--and pose as a pro-abortionist for radical socialist votes. After hiring nannies at taxpayer expense, this former snowboard instructor embarked on extravagant renovations at 24 Sussex, whose cost soon ballooned to $10 million, and now $23 million.  Canadian newcomers don't feel secure under Trudeau, a permissive free-spending fool with no appreciation of their dawn-to-dusk hard work.
You do have some good points.  There is real religious persecution in the world.  Christians are being beheaded in Muslim countries.  And judging is wrong, which is what you are doing to me.  And even though Christianity is under attack, it really is not that bad, but it is part of the progressive agenda.  And Jesus did say we would face persecution.  And the church should welcome gay people into their churches.  But we cannot approve of sex between a man and a man.
What's your point? Democratic turnout was very weak, how does that possibly translate to evangelicals who are more likely to vote Republican anyway? Trump won big in rural/exurban counties, sure and so what? Again, doesn't translate to some stealth evangelical conspiracy to wreck the country, any more than it does those millions across the political spectrum, who declined to vote this election cycle(vs 2012). Focusing on exit polls in two states in  a lame attempt to explain why a candidate with virtually every advantage possible couldn't wipe the floor with as foul a candidate as Trump is myopic to say the least.  Your barking but you have no bite. Keep trying.
This organization has caused nothing but more pain and betrayal to victims.  The above article demonstrates that ruined lives and lifelong pain are legal inconveniences to this organization.    This organization acts like a church when it benefits them, claims moral superiority on what is right and wrong.  It preaches that we should do the right thing. When it does not benefit them to act like a church they refuse to do the right thing. They do what the law will allow them to do and hide behind arcane SOL laws.  The principles behind Reconciliation, penance, reparation, confession and truthfully coming clean are taught to Catholic children and presented as a sacred sacrament.   This sacrament is tossed in the trash when it comes to dealing with the victims of clergy rape and molestation.  For a childhood decision to be closer to Jesus by serving mass I was given a life sentence, I was repeatedly raped and caused only pain by the ruthless response of this Church. How Pathetic!
Jesus said the 2nd greatest commandment is love thy neighbor as thyself, the Golden Rule, which Mr Phillips and the rest of the fake Christians like him violate regularly.
They will prosecute the Christians and give the Muslims a pass.
Only a deranged liberal would accuse those defending the Truth as whiners. We Faithful Catholics are sick you, Francis, the faggots in clergy and every other liberal disease infecting the Church. We will hold our anger for only so long then we will get beautifully violent and purify the Church.  Effeminate and gay priests beaten and dragged from the pulpit, their protectors in the hierarchy hunted down.. It will be magnificent
"Christians are tired of being called homophobes and Islamophobes..."  I'm sure they are, Cal.  Maybe if they stopped being so homophobic and Islamophobic the name calling would stop?
... damn straight cash is king in the USA... bigot bakers can suck daddy's big ol' ... ;)  May the USA be RID of 'christian' Republican racist sexist bigots ASAP these folks are holding the USA back!!!  I'll dance on their graves when they DIE!!
To clear this up for everyone:  What the hierarchy is demanding is that men pretend not to be gay like they used to do in the 1950's, if you want to be ordained.  It really isn't very hard to read between the lines folks.  If you aren't straight and you want to be a priest - fake it!
The MSM like all Religious leaders hate criticism and support anything that can reduce criticism of themselves. This is a ridiculous editorial calling for censorship - WHERE IS THE EDITORIAL DEMANDING MUSLIMS STOP HATING JEWS, CHRISTIANS, ZOROASTRIANS, ATHEISTS, WOMEN, GAYS? It is just crazy what is going on here, a total tyranny is being put nto place and we must fight it to the death!
All Christians, Jews and other religious denominations are angered and will retaliate every time another Muslim demand is made and honoured.     This is beyond ridiculous that Muslims are allowed to force their religion down our throats.   This is a very serious situation and there will be more violent attacks when our government refuses to curb this activity.   Muslims can take time from their days at school to pray, yet our Lord's prayer has been dismissed as being controversial.    Yes, this is going to get very ugly and could easily turn into civil war. That comment is not outrageous.  Muslims have come from that very climate and they didn't leave that on the shores behind them.   This is just the beginning of a rally.
Really?  And I suppose if your child is sexually abused by a priest/clergy member/preacher then it is all fine because the abuser is 'Christian'?  Grow up and start thinking.
We live in a country founded by deists and Masons.  They wrote a series of founding documents that all are endowed by their creator with liberty no government can take away.  Freedom of religion and speech are first among these liberties.  Better still, there can be no religious test for citizenship or holding office.  The article above lists countries where being a minority can lead to imprisonment or worse.  The supposed defenders of "religious liberty" in this country, including many Catholic bishops, look ridiculous in comparison.  Much of what now passes for "religious freedom" in this country today is little more than ability to discriminate against minorities.
The archdiocese doesn't seem to want to trust its Catholics to make employment decisions by themselves, seeking, shaming them away from work that doesn't support the Mexican Government's position.   The archdiocese'appears to be in bed with the Mexican government.  They'd rather their subjects simply went on the Mexican (or US) welfare system than work on a big wall project, designed to enforce the laws of a nation.  Mexico is full of illegal activity...drugs, prostitution, you name it...no shaming from the archdiocese.   There's no "shaming" away of Mexican people from such corrupt employment...because if they did shame the Mexicans that support the drug and prostitution trade the archdiocese would immediately feel the he
the level of paranoia and delusional thinking on the catholic religious right is astonishing. forget about francis, he is lost, one of the beasts out of Revelation.
Quick question, who killed more Jews - the Christians or the Muslims?
Too many of these comments reflect limited thought, poor understanding and dogmatic rigidity. This not 2000, or 2010.  We have learned a lot since then, and more every day. We now know that the only ways to control population growth are war, disease, famine....and economic prosperity.  Today, fewer people die in war than by suicide.  Fewer people die of starvation than from over-eating. And fewer people die of disease than from living longer or better. This has never happened in 15,000 years of human history. So for you "population is too high" proponents, we can state with absolute certainty that other that the three unpalatable choices, economic prosperity is the only choice.   Individuals en masse now make procreation a second choice after economic well being.  Even religion is powerless to stop this, otherwise we would have 10 billion more Catholics, and Iran's birth rate would not have dropped below replacement levels. Further, how dumb do you have to be to ignore demographics?
Your comment is silly.  It presumes only partial, and arguably errant, aspects of an anthropologic, sociologic, and subjective view of sexuality.  The whole reason the Church persists in her teaching (..yes, she persisted and still persists...) is because she communicates the life of GRACE available to those who follow the gospel of Christ, her founder.  Grace helps us in our growth in HOLINESS, our coming to know and see Christ better, that we might one day be able and worthy to see HIM in all His glory.  If we strive for grace, them the subjective views, and first hand "knowledge" and "experience" of the laity can be properly weighed by their true worth and merit.  Then we see that the personal arguments and experience of an adulterer, pervert, pornographer, sodomite, fornicator, etc, dont really matter much.
No I am not in favour of that but unfortunately and tragically numerous women in Canada and the US are gang raped by white Christian men but we are not about to make sweeping generalizations about all white Christian men bases on the terrible behaviour of a few.
NO thanks.  I don't need to trade a sexist woman hating bishop for a racist hating bishop.  Both would be terrible popes or bishops or priests or Christians. Either bad choice should make anyone who is not misogynistic or racist explode and demand another Pope for the equal sake of human dignity of all members of our church.
Catholic sites that you don't agree with should be "removed"?  What in the world are you saying, Don in Kansas?
Give me back the Berlin wall Give me Stalin and St Paul Give me Christ or give me Hiroshima Destroy another fetus now We don't like children anyhow I've seen the future, baby: it is murder Leonard Cohen, The Future
Believing in transubstantiation "because the Pope says so" is just as stupid as believing the earth is four thousand years old "because the Bible says so." Both are simply political self-interest couched in supernatural blather.
A guy taking money out of elderly poor people's mouths to sustain share holder profits for some of the most amazingly profitable corporations in the history of the world while they have a financial hiccup isn't just ignorant of his professed Christian religion, he's an active enemy of everything Jesus of Nazareth stood for and advocated.  The devil really can quote scripture, I guess.
I have seen enough to know not to trust any one who professes Allah and adheres to the ideology of hate, pedophilia, degrading and mutilation of woman, beheading of Christians, bombing of innocents, genocide, World conquest which are all tenents of the Islamic faith. Faith in a God who is not filled with mercy and calls for the drinking of camel piss. Allah is not God and Muhammed is just an extremist pedophile baal worshipper of the moon.
I agree Mike.....and I encourage everyone to go to the SPLC  website and explore it thoroughly....there is extensive info on sites that deal with alt white, with white supremacist, with neo Nazi, with Klan et al...all the hate groups in the nation ...think it's well over 800 of them..and the Hate Map identifies the locations...and types of sites...there are sites of extreme religious right .......Catholic sites as well and literally loads of info...  Of particular interest are the sites that deal with gays....as there has been much conservative religious hostility directed to them....and lists of Hate Groups ...with Catholic leadership or involvement...  Also ...please contact Civil Comments and ask that they immediately implement a blocking function as this thread has been taken over by trolls and the data is too important to be treated with literally hundreds of distractive troll comments.

You can't name a single Christianity inspired terrorist attack. If mass shootings are tied to religion, that religion is Islam.
... so as long as the infrastructure benefits you and yours, everyone else can go pound sand ... very Republican and 'christian' of ya.
If you knew anything about the Bible you wouldn't make such a foolish statement.
Moore trashes social morality for the sake if one issue... religious liberty. He and certain Catholics hope  that Trump aligns with their dogma, but he is not a real Republican or a  true supporter of the unborn. Moore and company ignore Trump's mental state. Narcissism, bigotry, congenital liar, and the worst ailment… bipolar dysfunction. He is unfit to hold the most powerful job in the world. Wake up intellectual evangelists and be heard!
I'm confused.  Is he an atheist or a 'secular Christian'?  Frankly, I smell more than a whiff of artifice in the professor's atheism.
Free zones in their country is the answer - that way they can easily return and will not remain a burden on the ones who actually work in America , so many people whine about this don't pay any taxes ,  and sorry but I'd take Christians any day over a group of people who are taught that those in the West are Devils and need their heads cut off
Wow.  Trump is seeming more and more ridiculous - now the thrice married puzzzy grabber is the defender of Christianity?   A Christianity which is somehow under attack in the US?  And the evangelicals looked like they were basking in the rays of  this hypocrisy.   Soon we will need a new definition of Christianity - one I suspect that will be free of anything Jesus is said to have taught.  As The Donald would tweet:  Sad!
... I'm getting used to feeling disgusted by 'em.  They aren't really surprising anymore what I didn't realize is how many straight up MORONS we have that vote here in the USA.  80% of Trump voters consider themselves Christian ... lessee that must mean ..  ;)
Much like the Pharisees who conspired, colluded and crucified Jesus Christ. "Close-minded ideas." Yes, you hit the rusty nail on the head.
Yes...that explains why they are killing each other. I know if we in Canada were attacked, the firat thing I would do is kill my Catholic neighour. NOT!!!
Your narrative is a lie. Christians are victims every day- look no further than Coptic Christians living under Islamic terror every day.  No one is saying "churches just turned dangerous," they're saying despite the harassment and abuse done to them by atheists and Islamism sympathizers, they could at least be safe in church-- which has indeed changed for the worse in the last 15 years.
Sorry, Mr. Berg, Hobby Lobby was wrong.  It put us on to a slippery slope.  So now I can discriminate for those things I can use religion was my back-up.  Don't forget how many preachers (priests?) used the Bible as justification for slavery.  So now I am free to exclude anyone be they gays, Blacks, Hispanics or anyone else who doesn't appeal to my fancy.
No wonder Jesus (alayhis-Salaam) so harshly cursed hypocrites.  Here's where a lot of sanctimonious so-called "Christians" don't get it--you don't get absolved of sin until you REPENT of it.  Doesn't matter what religious 'label' you apply to yourselves.  Christian self-righteousness, hubris and hypocrisy PREVENTS them from repenting, as they see no need for it.  After all, "Jesus" (alayhis-Salaam) "paid the price" for their sins.  You clearly don't understand your Scripture (or don't want to).  In the parable I mentioned in Luke 18, NEITHER of the parties, the Pharisee nor the tax-collector/publican, were CHRISTIANS.  They were Jews.  But Jesus (alayhis-Salaam) said one--the miserable tax-collector--found justification before God and the other--the self-righteous Pharisee--did not.  Why?  Because the tax-collector REPENTED of his sins and the Pharisee did not.  Neither has Amy.  Clearly, neither have you.  Arrogance and hypocrisy are sins, and you proclaim yours with each post.
Got you.  If he's white and/or Christian he's just a disturbed individual who went off the rails.  If he's Muslim he's a terrorist.
Your examples of moral equivalency fail to hit the mark by a long shot.  First of all, the United States is not a Christian nation. European countries -- forget about it!  Secondly, no one commits atrocities in the Name of our Savior.  Islamic terrorists regularly kill and enslave in the name of Islam and even cry out "Allah Akbar" when committing their crimes against humanity.  A genocide against Christians is taking place right now in Islamic countries.  The atrocities against women and gays are unspeakable.   Christians and Muslims have a different understanding of the God of Abraham. For Muslims, this God is pure will.  For Christians, God is love.
What's the difference between a Catholic Priest and a pimple? The pimple waits until after puberty before it comes on your face.
It proves that again Christian and Muslim come from the same root, they basically act in the same way when getting angry.
The threat isn't just terrorism.  There's plenty of racism where I work and it's not the white Christians - it's mainly the Muslims that don't respect womans views, or anyone they view as subordinate to them. It's also about what kind of society do you want to live in. Preferring free, open, fair & equal isn't unreasonable.
I went by the proud fact you display an Iranian Flag, sport!!   Your right about not invading any country, but they have also, unlike America, haven't saved millions of lives in every corner of the world -FACT!!  Including the ME.  This country has sacrificed blood and treasure unlike any countries in the past and have never flown "my" flag over another country in the name of conquest.  Also, again, you're clueless about who I rely on for sources!!  And about Iran not invading other countries; BS!!  They hire despicable, cowardly radical elements to do the dirty work for them; that of killing, beheading, burning, torturing innocents of all colors, all religions, all genders, and all ages!!  Don't discuss personal knowledge and experience when you, again hold one country to one standard, another to a much lower standard.  America is want keeps the world safe and much of it free, and that's not an opinion-FACT!!  And Stonewall Jackson was a hell of a leader and Christian!!
It also shows their desire to force a theocracy on all Americans. Evangelicals are not only stupid, they are dangerous and anti-American.
See.....you are not being "rational and compassionate" - or factual.  I am NOT a "holier than thou" one-issue obsessed Catholic,' nor am I the one being a bully.  I have NEVER demonized "pathetic women" in fact, I work with them and listen to them.  Nor am I using "nasty inflammatory language" - nor is it I who now look like a "sadistic sexist, insecure, schoolyard" bully.  Did you read YOUR comment?
the ideology you describe would bother most people. seeing as this is the ideology of extremists and not the ideology of the other nearly 2 billion muslims who have similar beliefs to Christians and jews and don't wish to subjugate anybody, I think perhaps we should get rid of the extremists and get to know the other 2 billion muslims
Hello Observer,  It is fascinating that you raise the fact that the book was written about thirty years ago, because your observation actually strengthens (not weakens) my commentary.  Think about it. Another book that came out about thirty years ago (written in 1990, a few years after 1985's Handmaid's Tale) was Tom Clancy's "Sum of All Fears".  Clancy's fictional novel was about nasty, scary Islamist terrorists getting hold of an atomic bomb and turning the world upside down.  So, what did our arts community do the moment they decided to bring Clancy's novel of thirty years ago to the screen?  Answer: They removed all references to Islam and Muhammad and Muslims and, after a proper scrubbing, voila, the nasty, scary terrorists were suddenly replaced by nasty, scary Christian neo-Nazis getting their hands on an atom bomb! Yay!  Sorry, but the identification I made, of a double standard, cannot be wafted away by hand-wringing over a thirty year time scale. Nice try, though...
Bloody death and extermination are to Islam what charity and forgiveness are to Christianity.   It is the core of the religions.
Oh I don't think it will get far but it's ridiculous for people to ignore the pervasiveness of Christianity when ranting about making an allowance for Muslim prayer times in schools.
Kathleen K. Kearon, your prattle about "states' rights" reminds me that the only HONEST ‘anti-abortionist’ I ever heard speak was Tom Metzger, former Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan. When asked his position on abortion, he said: “We oppose abortion for white women. We are in favor of abortion for non-white women.”  And that is the TRUE position of these white so-called ‘conservative Christians.’ But unlike Metzger they don’t have the guts to admit it. And that includes ‘Trumpy the Clown.’
Have you ever worked for extended periods in Japan?  I have. Discrimination against the Gaijin is intense, if cleverly understated in the public domain. If you're going to make derogatory comments about a group of people, Christians for example, try not to look silly doing so.
If the shooter was a Muslim man, then Donald Trump would call him a terrorist and a ban on Muslim immigration. If the shooter was a Hispanic man, then Trump would call him a terrorist thug and a crackdown on illegal immigration. If the shooter was Asian, then he would be a criminal terrorist and a crackdown on Triads. If the shooter was black, then there would be a crackdown on gang members. If the shooter voted for Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, then he would be a political terrorist and a member of the Antifa.  Since the shooter was a white Christian male who taught bible school and an ex-member of the Air Force, he is a mentally ill man who needed help. No need for gun control.
Comical that the supposed conservative patriotic right side with a draft dodging coward Trump.  And here I thought I knew that group...turns out I was dead wrong.  They just want their racist protector of anything other than a white, "Christian" society.  Oh those evil Mexican landscaping guys are gonna take my job...I'm so scared!  LOL
Fortunately I am not catholic.
OK, but it's complicated, and (1) the official recognition by the church that our marriages can be true sacramental unions, and (2) the statement a church wedding would make to all Catholics of all kinds, that marriages between same-sex partners are as valid and as holy as those between opposite-sex partners, would mean a great deal.  My husband and I were civil-unionized in Vermont in 2000, and married by the province of Québec in 2005; and while we don't actually require a church wedding, nevertheless we consider our marriage a sacramental one, and take seriously the church's traditional aspirations for the relationship between married partners.  Meanwhile, with regard to the many gay Catholics who have consulted their conscience and decided to leave the church, I understand their decision. Not only that, but I understand their expressions of bitterness toward many in the hierarchy, though conservative Catholics tend to be put off by it. To those Catholics: Tough.
CHRISTIAN Century Magazine...from God's lips to your ears.  Assuming of course that you are a xenophobic, ethnocentric, bible thumper.
That includes the CBC ,Star, and most Canadian media who will never admit  knowing precisely what the problem is,  despite it being stated plainly by the perpetrators.  As nations fall to Islam in bloody civil war, the op-eds innocently ask, "How could this happen?" and then blame Trump, or Bush  or Christians,
So, only YOUR way is the right way? So by accident of birth had you been born in say India, you are automatically going to go to hell? Because in India the faith is Hindu correct? So by just chance, just because you happen to be born in the US which is predominantly Christian, you get to go to heaven?   Doesn't that sound just a little bit like full retard to you??
This is the kind of hate crime that Donald Trump has given rise to.   In fact, shortly after this occurred a member of the mosque was taped saying that this was because of Trump, but this was not mentioned in this article.  Hate crimes against Muslims, blacks and other visible minorities have skyrocketed throughout North America because the man in the White House has given them license to do so. The very day the world is sent into chaos because of Trump's Muslim ban from 7 countries that the Cato Inst. says are responsible for 0 American deaths (but excludes Egypt, UAE. and Saudi Arabia, who are responsible for hundreds/thousands of American deaths because  Trump  has businesses there),  this tragedy occurs. Trump and Bannon this is on you.  You fan the flames of racism and hatred against our brothers and sisters of colour. You said on TV you favoured Christian over Muslim immigrants!  Canadians don't want your condolences.  Keep them and lift the travel ban against Muslims NOW!
John, basically your claim is that Catholics are homophobic, that orthodox Jews are homophobic, and that Muslims are homophobic.  That seems to support a couple of conclusions:  you're intolerant, you're a heterophobe.  If the shoe fits, wear it.
Just like Jesus would do right man of god?  Bomb them back to the stoneage, what are you a thirteen year old boy?  I love the warhawk crowd that are well beyond the age to serve in the military. They seem to be very flippant with the lives of our young men and women.
Before reading this post, I read the post with the theme that God's ways are not our ways.  Jesus was going to be killed, and he stopped Peter's attempts to change that.  I think Benedict's forced resignation and placing Francis as Pope was the sort of act that Jesus spoke against to Peter.  So the problematic acts of Francis are just the fruit of the initial bad act of driving Benedict out (likely by the homosexual mafia that apparently has great power and is using communion for divorced Catholics as a wedge to allow communion without repentance for homosexuals who commit sinful sex acts).  But, alas, I think we just have to sit back and let it all happen.  Perhaps the destruction of the Church through the infiltration of Satan is precisely God's plan.  The question is whether we should follow the fake Pope or reject him.
Why single out Muslims? The guys who blew up the Murrah Bldg. in Oklahoma City were Christians. Most religions have their violent extremists. Christians have killed far more innocent people, especially Muslims, than vice-versa. Sanctions alone, before we began bombing Iraq, caused the premature deaths of a million & a half Iraqis. Clinton's Sec'y of state, Madeleine Albright, when asked if the deaths of half a million Iraqi kids had been worth it, said "We think it was worth it, because it showed sanctions were working." George W. Bush, phony Christian, waged "Shock & Awe"bombing on Iraq that killed or caused the premature death of up to another million & a half, & forced 4 million to flee their homes to suffering & poverty in refugee camps. "Born-again Christian" W later admitted freely that Saddam had NOTHING to do with 9/11. This "Christian" nation is the only country that's used nuclear weapons, on civilians yet, killing over 100,000 of them, & even a bunch of American P.O.W.s.
"The annulment process is available to see if a valid marriage ever existed."  No, Pamela, that's what the prenuptial enquiry which every Catholic and their partners must fill out - before the wedding takes place - are there to do. The fact that a wedding takes place at all is the Church stating that this marriage is valid.   And before you come back with - ah, but the couple, or one of them, may have lied - well that applies equally to the annulment.  "Oh, you can't write that because that will prove that your marriage WAS valid. Let's just put this instead...."  It's a complete joke. People make mistakes, some relationships don't work and break down. It's time the Church grew up and realised this and stopped making a fool of itself with this 'valid/invalid' stupidity.
Why does the G&M always turn to  this wind bag when it wants a story that involves the Catholic Church.  He is about the worst "Catholic" you could recommend.  He is not a real Catholic.  He is all for wild, unfounded interpretations of Church teaching and only follows  that  his narrow view agrees with.  .  Hardly a real Catholic in any way.  The G&M can do better.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.
Hmmmm, your take on Christianity is limited, WA.  In the one I'm familiar with, Jesus invites anyone who is "burdened and heavy-laden" to come to Him, and He will give them rest.  My take on radical Islam is, "become a Muslim, or we will kill you."  i.e., a loving invitation, vs. a demand on threat of death.  I would agree that many who claim to be Christians often demonstrate quite un-Christlike behavior.  Look to the person of Jesus himself, and ignore the hypocrites, who Jesus himself warned about.
Once agin you have help enlighten me to a new level of consciousness. Thank God i now know about the Holley Wood & Liberals plans Praise Jesus I'm no longer stupide of the world around me.
This case will end up being about religious freedom, but I think it goes beyond that.  As I stated earlier, I am neither religious nor against same-sex marriage.  I see this case as a freedom of speech issue that goes beyond religious concerns or discrimination.  What I am concerned about is that we might get into a situation where a baker is required to make a personal work of art in support of a race-related, sexual orientation-related, or religion-related event.  Will he be required to make a cake for all religious events if he makes them for Christian holidays?  Will he be required to make a cake for race-related organizations, potentially putting him into a political situation? (ex:  Black Lives Matter or White Nation groups/events/rallies/etc.) The baker clearly stated that he would serve anyone the same thing.  He will create a cake for a heterosexual wedding for any customer -- straight or gay.  What he will not do is create a cake for a same-sex wedding, regardless of customer
This is what happens when you treat women as less than human and don't ordain them the same as men.    Nothing says, I hate you, in Christianity, more than watching a parish needlessly close because the women God called to be ordained and lead those parishes are deemed obviously too unworthy and unsacred to be allowed to keep them alive, or even cause them to grow and gain more Christian souls to the fold and to God.    Married priests are not a bad idea, as long as they only come, after women being ordained priests, without any restriction to becoming Bishops, Cardinals and Popes.    Ordaining only married men to priesthood would be an extreme sin against Justice who is God and the Human Dignity of all women, as it would represent outright Gender Segregation in our church, giving all authority and sacred powers to all men over all women.  These suggestions are the problem with our church not the answer.   Sexism is hate in all of its forms and Jesus condemns it in all Gospels.
Anyone who denies this terror attack is anything but Radical ISLAMIC Terrorism  is a Huff Po, Yahoo, CNN and Obama Islamic Terrorist appeaser and coddler! Enough with the appeasement and excuses! These ISLAMIC TERRORISTS want to kill innocent Christians whom they call CRUSADERS and Jews. If you deny this, you are an Islamic Terrorist APPEASER!
If a non-Christian shoots someone for political reason, they're terrorists. If a Christian shoots someone for political reasons, they're insane.
Law put the reputation of the Church before its soul and his lawyers and curia helped. For assisting those who let those little ones astray, the Christ prescribed punishment is that he be thrown into the sea with a milstone around his neck.
Right.  You mean the Wahabbi movement armed and financed by the good Christian British?  Those Wahabbis?  Our fault was not fighting hard enough to extricate ourselves from the 'bed' made by you western and Soviet social-imperialists.  Chickens are coming home to roost indeed.  Remember you said that.  Your demonic Wahabbi, Salafi, Da'esh, Baathist, Ottoman, Pah'lavi, Boko Hara'am and Taliban Frankensteins are nothing if not reflections of their creators.
yada, yada, yada, its like men deciding womens issues, straight people deciding lgbtq issues, christians deciding religious issues and healthy people deciding ill peoples issues. if it doesn't directly affect you, its none of your business, no matter what that invisible guy in the sky or the horned devil tells you.
If do-gooders try to force abortions on muslim countries they'll get their heads cut off. All of the abortions propaganda is aimed at Christian countries.
I am a staunch Catholic. However, I do not believe that people should be compelled, by law, to be Catholic. That is just horrific and certainly comparable to Nazi Germany. Deciding that someone would be good for SCOTUS because they will decide based on Catholic morality is the very same as requiring them to be Catholic. How horrible!
One should not be surprised when one sees what slithers out of the moral cesspool of a God rejecting society. Having said that, there are sadly, many Christians who remain shallow and ignorant of the deeper things in the Bible and have no interest in actually abiding by it's precepts.
If Bannon and Stephen Miller and their toadies were fired from the Trump administration and replaced by other mainstream Republicans, I believe that the policies would moderate.  Trump is basically a dumb demagogue who apparently agrees with the last thing that someone tells him.  So if the last person who tells him something is McMaster, then perhaps we don't get the Muslim ban.    And I think Burke is a fool but Bannon is using him for his own purposes.  Burke and his toadies were behind some of the dumb stunts against the pope over the last few weeks like the posters.  I don't think that Burke will be effective nor do I think that Bannon thinks he will (although Bannon wouldn't mind being rid of that meddlesome priest.)  Bannon wants Francis distracted by internal enemies so that Francis cannot do things like speak out against Trump policies or condemn the alt-right as anti-Christian.
You seem to be forgetting that a deranged individual took a rifle into a Maryland pizza joint because he believed the story from Alex Jones about a Hillary Clinton-run child prostitution ring existing in the restaurant's basement (even though the place doesn't have a basement).  Ted Nugent also "encouraged" Obama to "suck on his machine gun" (while holding a rifle) at a concert.  He also held up said rifle and told Hillary Clinton to "ride of into the sunset on one of these, you worthless b-".  Nugent has since jammed out with Mike Huckabee (that "good Christian") on his old show on Fox, and has been to the White House this year.  Not saying liberals are innocent, but don't try and tell me conservatives are.
The article mentions that the bomb was placed on the side of the church used by women.  Mighty brave of these Islamic terrorists to target Christian women. Mighty brave of them.
If we should blame all Muslims for the acts of a few, as many on the right feel we should be doing, then yes, we should blame all Christians for the actions of this one guy.
Disgusting. Three thoughts: 1) Donald Trump will throw GLBT people under the bus at any time to keep conservative Christians supporting him. It has nothing to do with political philosophy. It has everything to do with political expediency. 2) It is amazing the number of born-again libertarians who have come out ever since gay people started getting equal rights. 3) If a gay or atheistic person refused to offer conservative Christians goods or services and claimed artistic freedom or freedom of conscience, conservative Christians would explode. Such Christians want to be able to discriminate while being protected from being discriminated against.
What a beautiful message. Any Christian should be ashamed of what has happened to our country. I hope Sunday will come soon. Until then, we've been overrun by a thrice-married, cheating, lying, sociopathic, greedy atheist that only worships the almighty dollar. God save us.
I'm one since I don't believe in your fairy tale christianity.
This is quite a mouthful Rob. I've been a feminist for most of my 82 years . I can't count my early childhood!  I have to tell you that it would be difficult for a practicing catholic to be a true feminist. Such a person would have to support no abortion rights, a ban on contraception, no women priests & a ban on there ever being a female pope. To say that women who support free market capitalism would not be welcome in feminist ranks is untrue &  that the same is true for women who work in the energy industry is ridiculous. Many feminists feel aggrieved at times but 'resentful'? Not the ones I know. If you really believe the world is not run by a patriarchy, you should think again. Third world countries are overwhelmingly anti- women - how else do you explain honour killings?, the niqab? We`ve made progress in the west but not enough. As is stated in the article & depending on Trump's pick for the next supreme court justice, American women could lose their abortion rights.
"Not surprised at not knowing about upper management." Sir, if you don't know about upper management, why pray tell would you bring it up?  You claim trump is loyal?  Only if you pledge 100 loyalty and get rid of a pesky Russian investigation for him, if not, you are fired.  You claim to be a Christian?  Trump lies with every breath.  Well known and documented sir.
Dick, you're being deliberately obtuse. Christians = Muslims. Same control over women.
white supremacists do not subjugate people for their religion and this is taking it a little too far to say that.   I believe that Islamist do not like jews or Christians because they feel inferior them.
Charles makes a point, although it leans a bit more to the extreme about the sport killing of ISIS Muslims throwing gays off the roof. Why hold one religion to a different set of standards than another? The Muslim bakers did indeed discriminate and if you look all around everyone discriminates in some way, you discriminate everyday in some form of mannerism with the choices that you make even though you may not realize it. Sometimes you just got to let things slide by instead of trying to control and judge everything that comes up because you can't fight every injustice that occurs. So why is it ok for Muslims to discriminate and no one bats and eye, it barely makes headlines on B listed news sites but when a Christian does it, it becomes a national event just because someone you don't know was slighted and is it really a big deal that someone said "Hey, can you do this for us?" and the dude replied "No."
I could not agree with you more, Hooded Claw. You can't tell me that many of these "depressed" priests didn't know about the goings on of Bishops Casey and Comiskey, but kept their mouths shut; and kept their mouths equally shut when "thousands of innocents" were being abused in their parishes. They ought to feel and be "depressed" now and saddened in their dark sanctuary of cowardliness and moral incapacity. As you say, the problem confronting their church community is a "drop in the ocean in comparison to the havoc wreaked on thousands of innocents."
You are probably joking with us but gosh darn it... YES!! (the first part, not the second  :-))  It would be a great lesson to the universal church to see Burke taste his own medicine.  Jesus was merciful to sinners, one and all, it is the bedrock of our Christian heritage... enough with the dominion theology already, the people of God deserve better and we will no longer tolerate such elitist clericalism... the pope "gets it" for crying out loud, why the heck can't many of the bishops and cardinals?
The Trump administration is also looking to deeply cut National Science Foundation research grants. Those grants go for basic research into fundamentals of mathematics, physics and the natural sciences, and are the major source of such grants, since the results of basic research aren't immediately profitable, thus little to no private funding. You ought to know this, since presumably you got your foundational science knowledge from professors who received NSF grants for basic research. Are you contemptuous of basic research? That would fit you in with 95% of Republicans, Trump and the Bushes, and 99% of evangelical Christians. Also, you fit in with almost all the ignorant people posting here. The annual budget for this crucial research needed to keep pace with China, Russia and Europe, is 7.7 billion. A single F-35 fighter jet costs 990 billion. Science is the best defense. Trump wants to cut satellite funding needed for weather observation. Anti-science is for stupid people.
Just be ignorant there Deadsmoke907.   Obama has been trying to get Syrian terrorists in this country for several years.   It wasn't Christians that shot up San Bernadino either. It wasn't Christians that hijacked four airplanes and flew them into buildings 15 years ago. It wasn't Christians that set off a bomb in the world trade center in 1994.  Now not all of those happened on Obama's watch, but his hasn't done anything buy guarantee the next event in the future both through his immigration policies that allow those followers of the child molester Muhammad into the US and allow their groups like ISIS to fester and grow overseas. That is his legacy.
A Christian kid, a Muslim kid and an atheist kid are all sitting in the Principle's office for fighting. What's the Jewish kid say when he walks in?  "Hey, is that a quarter on the floor."
Only angry fools would tear up Korans or believe that doing something like that is helpful.  And most people know that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and just trying to earn a living like everyone else. Still, our self described "thought leaders" need to dial back the tolerance shaming when perfectly reasonable people ask such questions as: * Why is an inordinate amount of violence in the world associated with Islamic societies? * Why are western progressives silent on the incongruities between women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and religious and cultural relativism? * Why do certain parliamentary motions imply that some religions are more worthy of protection than others? * Why are requests for religious accommodation in schools and other places made by Muslims often treated more solicitously than similar requests made by Christians, Jews, Hindus et al?   The answers are rooted in politics and cowardice.  Muslims are the biggest losers when such questions go unanswered.
There's a little secret incentive in Trump's tax bill.  It was inserted to make self-styled christian hypocrites vote for the bill.  It abolishes the Johnson Amendment.  The Johnson Amendment prohibits preachers from politicizing from the pulpit if they want to keep their tax avoidance scheme of claiming they run a 'church'.
Sorry Robin. If we're going to judge Muslims by the worst element then we're going to do the same for Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Scientologists.
A third term for Obama?  Yeah!  More Muslim prayer rugs and transgender dressing in the military, more national debt--let's go for $50T.  Fewer to no Christian crosses and crèches anywhere.   More inedible school lunches,.  More unemployed and underemployed.  More bypassing the U.S. Constitution.  More freebies for the masses supported by more taxes for working people.  More tribes--class tribes, racial tribes, generation tribes, gender tribes, gender identity tribes.  More big government control of everything because we, the people, are too stupid to decide what's best for us in our own towns and states.  More hypocrisy--"do what I say but the rules don't apply to me and my political kind."  More straw men, so many we will think we are a nation of scarecrows.  I am so weary of having my intelligence insulted virtually every time Obama opens his mouth.  It's incredibly sad that so many people don't realize when they being called stupid.
As I mentioned, I've read "The Pope and Mussolini." I've not read the ""The Popes Against the Jews" and never claimed otherwise. You've obviously read neither.  Where's the citations from my "inexhaustible supply of anti-Catholic authors"? Or are you just a trash talker who can't walk the walk?
Please stop beeing arrogant. At least in his homecountry it works better than the catholic colleagues with their mysogyny, their problems with sexuality and their sexual abuse cases...
Post the scripture troll.   Show where Jesus said to hate. I am waiting.
Be that as it may, Islam is a false religion so it's law is not from God. It would seem that you place Islam on a par with Christianity.
A non-Christian president? Will never happen in our current political climate.  Obama set us back decades by enraging the angry racist bigots by winning the presidency.  So the  socially conservative theorcrats and the angry racist bigots that took their nation back and made America great again will make sure tulsi is never elected and trump or who whatever GOP wacko they select in the mold of pence/sessions/de vos etc. that is so popular right now will defeat her.  Bad idea.
The Christian terrorism fueled by the nationwide televangelist tax scofflaws continues. More threat from priests and preachers in their churches than any transgendered individual relieving him/her self. Disgusting.
I was born Catholic, left for 8 years in my 20's and came back begrudgingly although Mary would have it no other way.  Explored almost all the main stream protestant faiths and had to humbly embrace the Church as it was most in tune to the Bible.  That was 21 years ago.  I teach Catechism, I prepare those preparing for Confirmation and am very active in a Catholic school for 20 years.  SO I am very Catholic, and Pope Ratzinger is my guy.  Francis has great teachings on helping the poor and servitude, but he has lost it.  He has become a Puppet for the globalist and the global warming folks.  "WHom am I to judge a gay priest.",  Divorced Catholics who remarry can recieve Holy Communion, and all the global warming nonsense is getting ridiculous.  His latest statement saying their are no Muslim Terrorist was just the nail in the coffin for this Politician.  Did not work the last time our Popes decided to be political.  Praying for a new Pope every day
"Is everyone here really that ignorant about the kind of fanatical extremist religious sect the Nation of islam is?" No, they just choose to ignore it and rail on Christians for things that happened a thousand years ago because it's the hip thing to do.  (Btw I'm not a Christian.)
White evangelical Christians worship the Pussy Grabber In Chief. Gee, I wonder why so many people are checking the None box these days? We just had eight years of a President who was a loyal husband and wonderful father to two daughters. And he never called either one of his daughters and I quote, "A piece of a**" while talking live on the air with Howard Stern. Unlike Trump who has consistently lied, cheated, and disrespected his daughters and three wives FOREVER! Guess Barack Obama's skin was the wrong color to get any respect from evangelicals. If the lying, adulterous, vulgar, tax cheating, racist, misogynist, bigoted, narcissistic, ignorant, draft dodging, boy-man Trump is the new Christian hero, just what kind of Christianity is being practiced in the US nowadays?
What a joke...as a Catholic I understand anti Hilary... I don't understand pro-Trump at all.  A public and unrepentant adulterer... a serial liar.... a misogynist... a racist...a bully... hopefully not a war monger.     I pray that he is not granted the opportunity to speak at ND and promote the myth that he speaks for Christians
"Jeremy Christian allegedly stabbed two men to death and seriously injured a third amid what witnesses called an anti-Muslim tirade on a commuter train."  What's the difference between this guy and the guy that shouts "Allahu Akbar" as 4 ISIS inspired terrorists (pro-Muslim group) drive a truck over pedestrians killing 7 (some by stabbing) and put 48 more in hospital, 28 in critical condition?   The difference is Christian is insane & London is not Portland.
Seems like the Catholic church and sexual assault of minors go hand in hand, probably from their self imposed vow of celibacy for their priests that go against nature that their god imposed on them in the first place, leaving them to give in to temptation.  A lot of them probably were abused too as kids.
Married priests are a no brainer, these men are already educated, ordained and ready to go. The deranged hierarchs that run the Catholic Church are amazing.....if you rape dozens of 8 year old kids you can say mass for the rest of your life.....if you marry a woman you are banned from celebrating the Eucharist. How many more parishes will have to be closed before the laity stand up to these ignorant leaders.
It's just a continuation of them agitating and promoting their trendy lives: denying without repentance the Church's teaching, then demanding to be served and praised in death.  It's like the homosexuals showing up at the Christian bakery.  It's an attack.
Truth. Lying cheating power-hungry religious fanatics: Harper Legacy I never received ballot, supported Bernier. Others as well. We need conservatives that do not see race, religion, ethnicity, instead a bunch of crazy evangelicals who want to FORCE their insanity on others. Cheating is 'god's will' according to the goons running the  now defunct CPC. Do you want cheating liars, tyranny running the country? No way no how CPC!
They will make the fatherland great again, they say,    by weeding out the non-Christians and "dangerous" ethnic people,    by slashing aid to the elderly and care for the poor, and by building the greatest military the world has ever seen.    They will publicize government-sponsored lists intended to demonstrate the "criminality" of the ethnic other.    They condemn revelation of inconvenient facts as merely the continued plotting of the Lügenpresse.    And they brag to their admirers about the inspiration for all those plans, not being the least bit shy about doing so.  Call it what it is—and call Republican support for their plans what it is, as well.   Trumpism = Fascism = Republicanism.  The right adopted Trump and his agenda, all of it.  The Fascism, the Racism, the Nazism.  That's what winning looks like.  You're a winnner.
I was simply pointing out that there are passages in the Bible, regularly used by Christian fundamentalists to discriminate against homosexuality. And that it's myopic to single out Muslims for this. I'm not defending Islam's fundamentalist attacks on homosexuality.   And Doc, isn't it a bit disingenuous to list Chechnya without also pointing out Russia's ongoing attacks on homosexuals. It's a good Orthodox Christian Country after all.  Including references to Islamic State atrocities is a bit desperate don't you think? They've pretty much cornered the market on extremist thinking of all kinds and as extremists, they are hardly an example of the average or moderate Muslim.
Bernie is not supported by the socially conservative theocrats that seek to make Christianity the national religion like Iran has Islam as it national religion and guiding force.  The angry racist bigots who spent 8 years constantly attacking obama and watching their Fox News and listening to their talking heads like rush, hannity etc, for their prescribed rhetoric are the people I'm referring to.  You honestly think these people were Bernie supporters and would have voted Bernie over trump?  I'm not sure if your post was serious or meant to be jokingly
Might as well have one for the Protestants, Jehova Witnesses, Seven-Day Adventists,  the Baptists,  the Hindus, the Sikhs, Taoism, Wicca, Druze, Buddhism, Judaism, Gnostic, Hellenistic, oh I forgot... Orthodox, Amish,  Mennonites, etc. This way, the town will be for dead people only.
staunch religion hating atheist here; remove the sarcasm from your comment and I'm with you.  Christians are indeed hypocrites, but they use the voting booth to further their backward agenda not AK-47's and machetes.   I hate Christianity.  I hate Islam and fear it immensely.
Homosexuality is not one of my hobby horses, I  believe the practice is wrong and goes against nature, but we do live in a few country, so in a strange way I defend their rights to their freedom, but I still believe it is wrong. Her argument is not reflective of Christian reasoning, that is the only reason I responded. Theologically one is not condemned for sins (even though many would differ with this), they are condemned for unbelief. And yes, homosexuals do not "reproduce" so they have a limited shelf life.
There is no place for a bunch of Ku-Ku-Klowns in Canada. In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century an English  three Canadians was a member of the white supremacist organization Anglo-Saxon, WASP equivalent to the United States ("White Anglo-Saxon Protestants").  Four members have been Prime Ministers of Canada; Sir John A. Macdonald (father of « Canadian Federation » of 1867 but not « Father of Canada » which is Sir Samuel de Champlain in 1608 ),  Sir John Abbott,  Sir Mackenzie Bowell (a past « Grand Master » (?)),  and John Diefenbaker.   In 1927 the “Orange” movement gave birth to a more intolerant and racist group, the Canadian Ku Klux Klan, which had its deepest roots in small towns in Saskatchewan because of the "yellow peril", but also because of the blacks...Jews...Catholics... The “Ku Ku Nest” in the province campaigned against= teaching French + wearing the religious habit + the presence of crucifixes in schools (more to come)
Awesome, Colorado was already filthy with super fakey surface level 'christians', now were even more so ... GO HOME!!
Stealing to support his evangelical habit?
OMG, are you serious?! Focus on the Family, Oregon Citizens Alliance, Christian Coalition, Moral Majority, Eagle Forum, and any number of other Evangelical Christian political organizations have been at war against the LGBTQ community for over 30 years. Wow. It's scary that you appear to have zero awareness of the hate-fueled history of Evangelical political activism of.
The Catholic Church is officially part of #radicalbolshevikterrorism communist organizers  As a Catholic I'm disgusted by the indoctrination of what is becoming a cult  The pope and this moron McElroy ignore mass genocide while propping up the cult of Mohammed bent on the genocide of Christians
well said,  as christians although not being threatend,  are being systematically eliminated from the muslim world
That seems to be the theme of the "Christian" Republicans.  I sure do wish the hypocrites would try reading the words of Jesus.  Jesus said nothing about gays or abortions, and only got really pissed off when people were using religion to make money.  For example, the Republican party uses religion to get people to vote for them but they really only care about making more war and money, as evidenced by every one of their policies.  They count on the stupidity of blind followers and the power of propaganda to keep getting elected.  And it works.  Sad.
Islam.  The root of every one of these terrorist murders against the West, Christians,  Christianity, freedom, and Jesus Christ.
And what of all the conservatives who have killed Muslims or people of color in mass shooting incidents?  It has no bearing on the average person what political leaning or belief system the person held. It doesn't represent the majority.  A helpful narrative would be finding ways for atheists and Christians to come together respectfully and strengthen our shared values, rather than assume that our fellow citizens are complicit in carnage and violence. That's how hate is bred.
Old school Christian dogmatists must be thrilled about officially getting the anti-anyone-except-heteros hatred going again in America. Ramping it back up. Hope they're happy--any misery, depressions, suicides, and sad hidden lives is on them (as it always was on this file, today and for the last 2,000 years).   All because this faith (and others) embrace fanciful myths that envision a cosmic creator who is neurotically upset about genitals, human sexuality, and fluid gender categories.  Diminished human rights courtesy of tall tales. Un...be...lievable.
South Africa: Zuma rapes Kwezi...ANC -  response? USA: Trumps grabbing of the p****y.... Republican - response? UK: Fallon touches journalists knee.... Tory response?  Truth is, females do make things ambiguous, it is part of the mystery and males do misinterpret messages with testosterone in full swing and emancipated females are going full kink in the Grey areas of weak society.  The weaving blurred lines (intended) of acceptability are going to get more confusing for both males and females, set by "leaders" of society, pornography and the church leaders, not only Catholics where Parental leadership is being stripped by political correctness.   Feminism  is good, but when.
yes, I think that the baker who is sole owner, has the right to say that he will not decorate the cake the way that they want.  This is true for when KKK, NAZIs, Muslims, Christians, Disabled, White, Pink, Red, Blue, etc. Heck, even a Zombi.  I will not be using this baker because I disagree with what he is doing.  Look, the constitution gives us rights and freedoms. And a big part of that is the right to be jerks.
Hypocrites maybe, but not trolls.  We don't go over to Fr Z's blog or any of the other right wing play grounds to have some fun at their regulars' expense.  You know,  stir some shite, make off the wall comments, or derail topics.  In point of fact, a person from the left gets banned, and usually in 24 hours or less.  I think the sameness of all the comments on these uber Catholic sites is why some of them come over here.  They are bored being perfect Catholics.
Cruelty. In the name of God.Yes, let's give our ordained sexual predators a decent and honorable burial, but not THOSE people. And let's publicly humiliate the surviving spouse or partner while we're at it. Pre-meditated cruelty. It's likely that the authors of such a cruel policy are themselves self-loathing, dysfunctional gay men. This is why I no longer belong to a Catholic congregation.
there is a difference between anti-Muslim hate and concern regarding the spread of Islamic thought.   Considering that there are large numbers of Catholic and Jewish cemeteries in Canada, if you would deny someone the simple comfort of the burial custom of their religious affiliation, you seem simply filled with animus.   Being wary regarding the spread of Islam however is another matter. The Islamic world, after reaching it's competitive cultural and technological peak 800 years ago, has stagnated since. Islam itself has never undergone a Renaissance or Enlightenment and it has never been forced to confront its theocratic assumptions as Christianity was forced to do under the West's expansion of pure science, philosophy, political theory technological innovation, and secularization... where are the Islamic world's da Vinci, Galileo, Kant, Voltaire, Smith, Marx, or Watt, its Oxfords or MITs, or even its defenders of the simple concept of the separation of church and state ?
Everything Will Be Fine: Michigan Congressman Assures Us God Will Fix Climate Change  God gave us science and the brains to employ science.  These fake 'Christians' don't take advantage of what God gave them.  It takes a special kind of stupid not to use what God gave us,  …but this Congressman proves there's no shortage of that stupidity.
Michael T, Most people accept and ask for forgiveness without blaming  someone else for their wrong doing. Don't you think it is so untruthful/cowardice of Catholic clergies and their aids always blame someone else for their sins or point to others wrong doing instead?     "Let us hope that a reorganized SNAP or some new org of another name emerges that will work for the good of victims and be helpful to the Church in addressing the problems. Must not be angry all the time."   Sure what to be angry all the time for, it just the clergies raped children, ruins children's/their families' lives or children kill themselves! Every parent knows instantly what to do with the rapist! Why is it that CI clergy claim that they do not know what to do?  Is it really a sane person to pass the rapist around and around for thirty years to you?
This is typical anti-Israel bias at the UN - Saudi Arabia is on the human rights council, a country where having a vagina disqualifies you from driving and people are killed for "blasphemy" - what amounts to your average Family Guy joke. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation or OIC represents one of the strongest power brokers in the UN due to their size, 57 members with a particular fondness of Islamism. They often put forward resolutions making it "illegal" to criticize Islam  - no one is able to dispute the fact a blind illiterate mystic was "enlightened" by the archangel Gabriel to create a book that seems to share uncanny similarities with Christianity and Judaism (pardon my blasphemous digression but you get the point). The UN has no credibility - it is an exercise in futility and hypocrisy that accomplishes nothing beyond strongly worded statements. Zimbabwe, North Korea, Iran, China, Russia, Syria, Yemen  - who are we kidding?.
The same Republican gridlock activity they have been performing for 8 years.  Refuse to do their jobs and excuse it all as the fault of everyone else.  Instead of fixing elements of an existing law, they waste more time, first, trying to destroy it all and create an idiotic bill unrelated to fixing anything and adding the massive tax breaks for the Billionaire Barons - Their true constituency.  Anyone who works for wages is considered just pond scum to the entire Republican Terrorist Traitor Party.  All to be dumped by the wayside as they loot the nation.  Fundamentalist christian theocrats with insane beliefs unrelated to science or history;  Disdain all human rights except for immunity for Billionaire Baron criminals;  Hatred for Democracy and freedoms for all.  An entire CONgress, and now an Executive and Supreme Court devoted to anti-American ideology identical to the Old South Confederacy and Hitler's Germany.  The worst traitors since Benedict Arnold.
These Christians in Canada have done so much damage and continue to do so much damage. And the university is for adults! Let's consider what they do to teenager and children. It is REPRESSION. - According to Sigmund Freud, the father of psychology, sexual repression was the chief psychological problem ailing mankind. ... Sexual repression can be defined as an inability to express one's sexuality. It is often associated with feelings of shame and guilt being attached with expressing sexual impulses. - Most Canadians have been sexually represses due to the Christian government which continues to implement laws and policies that repress young people. The result is when they get older they become riddled with psychological disorders leading to criminal activity, homelessness, perversions and alienation.
When was the last time a Christian burst into a Christmas party and shot 14 people? When was the last time a Christian ran down people in a market place with a truck?  Sure Christians are 2 faced but if your going to use a broad brush stroke then so will I
The shame is not so much that an ignorant person is laughed at, but rather that people outside the faith believe that we hold such opinions, and thus our teachings are rejected as ignorant and unlearned. If they find a Christian mistaken in a subject that they know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions as based on our teachings, how are they going to believe these teachings in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think these teachings are filled with fallacies about facts which they have learnt from experience and reason. (continued below)
What a load of CRAP! Stop making excuses for the Church. The decline in numbers is due the liberal agenda spreading its venom into the Catholic doctrine with "social justice" and "global warming" nonsense. Where is the message about our Savior? The Church is losing touch with its congregation and if it wasn't for the rich Catholics funding all the Catholic projects, the Church would have been washed up years ago. They need immigrants because whites are not reproducing at the same rate as non whites! Ouch!   Why should the Church care where a person is from? Isn't Jesus the same in Latin America as in the USA? Why is this an issue with the Catholic Church? If it is not economics, than the DACA kids should be fine in their home country if they find a church where they can practice their religion. They don't need to come to the US to express their faith, unless the Church is helping those illegal immigrants obtain Federal assistance that can be used as contributions to the Church. Hmmm?
Judge Gorsuch might be a man who thinks for himself and who cares about protecting his children from sexual abuse by Catholic clergy. Even though his mother was a strong Irish-American Catholic, from what I read about her, she was also very concerned that children be protected from sexual abuse. The fact that the judge was raised Catholic, and now has chosen to be a member of the Episcopal Church, makes me hope that he has learned of the ruthless tactics of the Catholic bishops in hiring lawyers that will do their bidding, so that they can continue to protect their predator clergy, and demoralize victims and their lawyers. Sincerely,   Dr Rosemary Eileen McHugh, MD, MSpir
I don't converse with Pandy because he/she is pandering to the reactionary elements in the church.  She eschews important facts and asks others to "Prove it."   Well as a seminarian, I disappointed other seminarians and priests by not agreeing to have sex with them.  Three college girls told me of their affairs with seminarians and priests.  In one of my Parishes, an assistant pastor committed consensual statutory rape on a 16 year old girl that got pregnant.  He then arranged for her abortion.  When the young girl sued him a few years later and obtained a multimillion dollar out of court settlement, The chancellor of the Orange County California Diocese  had the egotistic nerve to say to the local newspaper that this girl was evil and probably going to hell because of all the scandal that SHE caused the church.  The priest, later defrocked, had gone on to become a pastor of a rather well to do parish.  Yes, many of us have seen it all first hand D. Whitewolf and I are only 2....
OregonBorn: Look at what the Catholic Priests have accomplished over the last how many centuries, AND, the  Adult Supervisors of Boy Scouts of America. They have been raping boys, FOREVER.  Read the Sign: FOREVER................
Why worry about homosexuality?    Like the early Christian Churches who expected Jesus to come back in their lifetime and therefore decided not to have children, homosexuals don't breed.  They just are.    If some people prefer to practice homosexuality or bestiality or any other non-procreative sex, they ultimately are not a problem for those who do.  If some of them are child rapists, as some are, we can treat them the same no matter the gender of their victims.  Other than that, who cares?
I guess next bill will be anti -christian phobia. .
So you dont think the Vikings, Celtics,   Picts,  Irish Christians,  Early Russians  or Goths had civilizations or cultures  of value ? You f***ing racist.
Show your facts.   No screening would be going backward from today's screening, you're delusional.       I'm not concerned that Hillary would make homosexulaity a crime, or allow American Muslims to discriminate against women or gays.   If they live in this country then they follow American Civil law, she has never suggested otherwise.  You on the other hand supported businesses that discriminate against gay people based on their Christian religion.     http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hypocrite
No need wearing a white sheet over your head if you're as brazen of a white, Christian supremacist as Amy Demboski is.  The ethical standards that go along with being an elected official apparently mean absolutely nothing to her.  What position is she after next, Queen of the 4th Reich?
Entering into a same-sex marriage IS to reject the Catholic Faith. Engaging in perverted sex acts is a distinct, additional sin.  Paprocki's norms require NO inquiry into what people are doing in private.
What a j**k**s that priest was!  (Jesus, beam me up! I wanna go to heaven right now.)
I laugh when the ignorant tell me: "America is a Christian nation." Not just because Hebrews 11:13-16 KJV plainly states all Christians confess plainly they have no nationality, but also because the 1st amendment legalized devil worship. I have the right to worship your Satan.  PC liberals are the 21st century version of the 16th century Puritan. They want to burn witches. Anyone who disagrees with them is a witch.
You cannot compare miscegenation with same-sex unions. Marriage between couples of different races, man and woman, cannot possibly be compared to the parody of marriage which takes place between people of the same sex. The civil law may have forbidden interracial marriages between a man and a woman, God, however, does not. To equate African-Americans with active homosexuals is disgraceful, it is actually worse than racial discrimination as it implies that they are in a similar spiritual state. I'm not an African-American, I am English but were I an orthodox, African-American, Catholic, I would be appalled that the liberal intelligentsia considered me to be even remotely similar to an active homosexual. African-Americans unfortunately may well suffer discrimination because of their race or colour but not because their being African-American was intrinsically immoral.
Has there never been a high-ranking Imam,  Rabbi or Buddhist Monk charged with a crime?  Why single out the Catholic Church?  Sounds like another sorry attack on organized religion.  Apparently, you can't judge an institution by a few wrongdoers -- except in the case of the Catholic Church.
People who were closely associated with both Cruz and Rubio have offered us glimpses of what type of people they are, as they hypocritically claim Christianity unto themselves.  It is known that Cruz consorts with prostitutes.
You do not decide when a sentient being becomes from the quickening. You know not when self awareness begins. You do not have the right to determine God's conscience. You do not have the right to tell a woman she must carry an embryo to fetal stage and then birth, even when she knows the embryo is drug/alcohol effected and she cannot afford to raise it, deal with it emotionally or medically, or was raped or used while unconscious. Where is your pious :Christianess" (because that's what Is) .......when you talk about the lessons of Jesus, yet won't live amongst the prostitutes, alcoholics and criminals. Jesus doesn't save hypocrites.
Gosh, what a nice-looking young fellow. Small homeless camp. I wonder if mommy is still around to see his picture in the paper. Suppose things had ended differently.  Suppose that when this christian began lashing out, an independently-minded and armed citizen put three hollow points right above the psycho's fatty liver.  Would we be weeping about the harsh treatment of the mentally ill today by a vigilante? Would a DA be coerced to arraign the armed citizen by squeamish city mothers? Or would we just hear an uneasy silence? I know how I would have liked to have seen the whole damnable thing end.
Even though a non christian, I believe in what goes around, comes around. I believe true justice, is to have everyone of the haters of President Barak Obama's skin color, come back as blacks, to experience what happens when stupid and littleminded prejudice rage filled self rightous indignation, fills ones life with deliberate suffering, oppression and death. All of us have to stand in front of our Creator's, whatever race we are, or what we believe. If I go to the whitemans hell, so be it, but, many of you all will surely be there also.
I'm truly disgusted by the Alaskans who claim they are Americans embracing hate. I find it ironic that the term snowflake which was started by Trumpettes implying that liberals are delicate. Now they carry machine guns and dynamite? Please stop watching Fox it has totally hoodwinked you. As the founder of FOX news said. I want to start a network for over 50 to dead white males. That are scared. You played right into his brainwashing. If your a Christian, where did your principles go? All I see is money grubbing elitest hell bent on taking away every bit of democracy we have sent young men to war to defend. If you are ok with Russaian collusion, nepotism, out right money laundering, sexual harassment, and the loss of your rights. Keep on supporting the 45th. One day you will either die or regret the decision you thought you made. And no I did not vote for Clinton. I voted for Josnston.
Same-sex marriage doesn't "confound" orthodox Catholics whom you refer to disparagingly as trads, quite simply because it is an impossibility, it doesn't exist. Marriage can only be between a man and a woman so those who think otherwise are deluding themselves and deserving of our pity and God's mercy. It is the same with the priesthood, those who think women can be validly ordained are similarly deluding themselves and in like manner, deserving of our pity and God's mercy. All this will become clear on the Last Day.
so   you prefer,a  lying,money hungry   killer/ any one who  claims to  be  a christian  should be appalled at this "pastors'    remarks.  he  needs to retire.
Gutless self serving politicians are afraid of losing the Christian vote so they will not do the humane thing to stop people from dying a painful death. Get rid of the useless career politicians.
Stop allowing Christians into Canada who have been overtly persecuted by Muslims. They are likely Islamophobes.
You brought up the KKK, not me. Yikes! If White Christians killed 53 people I denounce that. Can you come to yourself and denounce the Liberal/Democrats Hate rhetoric? The Scalise shootings, Kate's murder, etc. Can you denounce the black on black crime in Chicago which is probably 10x's more than the 53 every year. Democrats runs Chicago, years upon years innocent people live with gang bang Wars! Barry did squat for them for 8 years. The Democrats did squat for Chicago!
Me today ! I was a Catholic until I read the Popes comments re Muslim refugees while he blindly refuses to acknowledge mass genocide of Christians by Muslims just like Vatican ignored holocaust  This fat pedophile McElroy is a disgrace
When a person singles out certain religious groups (Muslims) for instance and accuses them of being terrorists, disparaging Mexicans many of whom are Catholics/Christians of being rapists and murderors, then it is hatred speech - nothing kind and loving in those type of remarks. It is NOT hatred speech to push back against such.  Is everyone supposed to roll over and play dead when trumps utters such statements?
That's a wildly false equivalence.  It was never about a message on the cake, it was always about the identity of the customers.    If a bakery refused to sell a cake to a customer because he was white, that would be illegal.  If a bakery refused to sell a cake to a customer because they were Jewish or Muslim or Christian, that would be illegal.  This shouldn't be a hard concept to grasp.
This type of nonsense shows just how far the arrogant religious PC movement has gone.  The Northwest Christian University officials are no better than the Muslim extremist and how they treat women.
hilarious, no this is religious fanatics, evangelicals lying and cheating to force everyone to obey them
Of course.  But lets be clear, ignorance is not a good thing. Satan is called the prince of darkness for a reason.   We are to bring the Light to the world that is in darkness.    We are obligated to seek truth and follow it!  We are to know the teachings of the Church and spread this truth through evangelization.  Remaining willfully ignorant or allowing someone else to be ignorant of a sin to avoid culpability is in itself sinful.   Sin is always a bad thing, regardless of culpability.  If someone is contracepting when ignorant of the Church's teaching that it is wrong, they may not be culpable and will not be held liable, but it is still an offense to God and we should help those ignorant of a teaching to know the truth.
As a Native, I will say that America was tricked into Vietnam as the anglo oil companies in  America coveted the South China Sea oil, just as America coveted Iraq's oil fields where the anglo oil companies were denied contracts that they got after Saddam was conveniently killed before he could blab about the CIA. If you look at the root cause behind 9/11, you will find America is attacked because of the $trillions of dollars worth of policies of colonialism America foists on countries worldwide, so the elite leeches and parasites who own the oil and mining companies can go in for free and make their billion dollar profits with the CIAs help. As a Native I see those same policies were used to slaughter Natives, in order for civilized Christians to steal the Natives resources and lands. Colonials refuse to admit those policies are theft and murder, and rewrite the history leaving out the colonial bloodbath used for the "pioneer" colonial leeches and parasites to steal what is not theirs.
Motley:  this is an interesting topic.  Certainly, pedophiles often seek positions where they can find and groom potential victims.  Yes, scout leaders, teachers, coaches, church youth group leaders, Catholic priests, vounteers to youth assistance programs, et al.  It's also interesting that the Boy Scouts have long prohibited gay men from serving as Scout leaders.  Yet, the organization has a long history of "non-gay" leaders being pedophiles... Folllowing is a quotation from an excellent article addressing this issue.  I've also provided the link so you or anyone else can read the entire article.  regards, Gary Crum
Wouldn't it be great if Reverend Prevo would publicly denounce the  Texas activist imports and their message of religeous hate. Isn't that what the Christian right is asking Muslim Imams and Mosques to do?
Bishop, put half of this effort into catching pedophile priests before they molest and ruin the lives of children. How many do you think  you have under you?  As a Catholic, you disgust me.
Trump wasn't kidding.  In it's declaration of war against the Catholic Church in 2014, ISIS proclaimed, "We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses and enslave your women."
That's what you took from my statement?  No.  Love does not equal sex, nor does sex equal love.  The Church very definitely singles out LGBTs -- it forbids them any form of sexual intimacy by refusing the sacrament of marriage,  and by essentially denying that it can even conceive of and accept LGBTs sharing love in a sexual manner as anything but sinful.  It does not deny heterosexuals the option of marriage and right to marital sexual intimacy -- it extols it -- but denies that to LGBTs.
Rodney Howard-Browne is a heretic and an embarrassment to Christianity.
Jesus Christ, frankly speaking will not tolerate sodomy and other non-traditional elements. ( Sodom and Gomorrah ring any bell.....done in by Jesus' own Dad?) And the article is right is saying that we Americans are religious illiterates. First mistake is thinking how Jesus is loving, accepting and compassionate while forgetting that He came with rules and regulations on how to be saved. He will NOT be so loving and compassionate to those who do NOT follows His rules and regulations (and his Dad's), written haphazardly in the Bible.  Problems with Christians or those who claims to be one is that they want their comfort zone and their fantasy Jesus is someone who will accept their comfort zone no matter what. And to be honest, that is just fantasy. If faith is that simple, Hell would be an empty place indeed.  Religions make hypocrites out of all of us, eh?
http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/how-the-faithful-voted-a-preliminary-2016-analysis/.    71% of Jews for Clinton with 81% of white Evangelicals for tRump.  It is interesting how the most corrupt always wear their piousness on their sleeve, no matter their religious affiliation. They cry loud and clear for all to hear how holy holy holy they are while they violate all the religious ideals and principles.   Jews are historically Democrat and stood by people of color during civil rights and protested the Vietnam war.  They are victims of antisemitism from the right (again rearing it's ugly, dangerous head in public). They just want the Christians to leave them alone  but  Christians persist in blaming them for killing the Jewish rabbi, Jesus, when in fact it was the occupying Romans. They cultivate hate.    So please do not lump my relatives in with the white evangelical Christians, the white supremacists, the Nazis and the KKK. Those are the tRump voters.
Go back to raping young boys McElroy and stay out of American politics you fat pedophile pig  The Catholic Church has become a joke  The socialist communist pope preaching to Trump to take more Muslim murderous refugees and ms 13 drug dealing child rapists DUI sucking American taxpayers dry  While IGNORING THE MASS GENOCIDE OF COPTIC CHRISTIANS AND GAYS AND WOMEN THROUGHOUT ARAB WORLD WHILE SWEEPING THE PEDOPHILE CRIMES OF PRIEST LIKE MCELROY UNDER THE CARPET FU CATHOLIC CHURCH BTW IM CATHOLIC BUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS BECOMING A COMMUNIST VIOLENT ORGANIZATION
Yet homosexual pedophile priests that raped young boys, and were protected by the Catholic church, are never denied a funeral, despite the fact that they BRUTALLY defied Jesus in Matt 18:6-14.
Not on the same scale and not in the recent past has Christianity been misused to justify violence. Suicide bombings seem to be a peculiar characterization of Islamic inspired violence.   What if those who do violence in the name of Islam are acting in the manner their sacred texts intend them to be acting?  Is that even to be entertained as a possibility?
How is this not a radical extremist Christian event?  Christians are oppressing and killing hundreds of thousands of people around the globe in dozens and dozens of countries every day, justifying their hate through their religion and claiming that other's objection to their hate is their own persecution.  Wake up and treat this for what it is.
Don't forget the Armenia holocaust of 1 million Christians and that six million number has been officially revised by the Holocaust authorities themselves.  Let's talk about the Jihad against Indians shall we, Koenard Elst in Negationism in India gives an estimate of 80 million Hindus killed in the total jihad against India and let's not forget why the Crusades happened! It was because of 400 years of islamic barbarism,  Can we forget how Mohammed thanked the Jews who helped him in Medina? He killed them, chopped off their heads.  Some prophet, killing God's chosen and those Nazi's weren't Christians! It is also estimated that Over 110 Million Blacks were killed by Islam.  So Christians can hardly be considered the biggest mass murderers, it isn't any surprise who really are the biggest mass murderers in history, estimated at a whopping  250 million and that is muslims.
"We reserve the right to refuse service to ..." Blacks, Jews, Irish, gays, Catholics. That what you mean?  The right of the private owner to practice discrimination is a bogus "right".   The government has always defined the rights of citizens. It's one of the things that governments do.
LOL, it's also true that the right does not appreciate it when the left points out their blatant hypocrisy when it comes to putting 'me before thee' and then calling themselves Christian.
Between the porn industry and gratuitous, lighthearted sex scenes between unmarried partners, you'd think that there wasn't an STI epidemic.  For example, 80 percent of all people under 50 years of age will have a strain of the cancer-causing hpv virus at some point in their lives.  Cervical cancer is almost exclusively caused by HPV and it is the 2nd leading cancer in women. Worldwide, cervical cancer kills over 250,000 women every year.  And all that cutting-edge homosexual sodomy in TV and the movies?  Look up the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  Oh, those backward Catholics.
What bunch of losers and idiots!  I clearly heard President Trump consistently state he does not support these racist groups or their points of view since the campaign last year.  Do these people think their down right stupid and worthless statements mean anything.  They are just adding to the chorus of the ANTIFA, Resistance and other sore losers that don't have a life or don't have jobs. How stupid has the Democratic Party become to fail to realize that throwing everything under the bus leaves them with no credibility?  Working class Americans, blue collar workers, unionized workers, middle class workers, Christians, minorities, legal aliens, legal immigrants and the myriad others that were the base of the Democratic Party are now shunned and vilified by the elected and appointed Democratic politicians.  Their shill creed is becoming the white noise on the 24/7 news cycle and quickly becoming irrelevant.
Ontario's public school system was once Christian. Pierre Trudeau eliminated that. You Muslims should have to give up your religion too.
Exactly.  You think that Trump and (necessarily) everyone who voted for him is a rabid fascist who are all intent to "unleash on the world" fascism.  I don't find your opinion boring.  I find it fascination that you and other self described Catholics hold such an opinion.
Oh yes it can!  Bishops do it all the time!  The surest way to suppress dogma is to EGNORE it, as the hierarchy has long been doing in reference to the Catholic clergy sex abuse crisis.  Did they skip Catholicism 101, or what?
David Grisham, it's difficult to imagine how much hate and ignorance it must take to inspire you and your group to fly from Texas to Anchorage with the only purpose being to spread your hate and ignorance in a place where you have no business, no connection, and absolutely no concept of the community you come here to try to smear.  You and your group are reprehensible humans. Yes, you are very similar to the Westboro Baptist group.  What you represent is the opposite of what Jesus taught and lived. You, your group, and the Westboro Baptists are as opposite from Christians as possible. PLEASE, go home and NEVER return to our state.
Israel is to be the site of the second coming, specifically Jerusalem.  This is why the Evangelicals support Israel as strongly as the do.  They have to protect Jesus' landing pad until Jesus lands and they get to obliterate all Muslims....and whoever else won't bend the knee.
Your friend Jack has some serious problems.  He claims to be a Christian, he is married and I assume he will say he loves his wife.  How could Jack support a philandering liar like tRump?  And I wonder what it is about America that Jack loves?  He seems to be supporting the destruction of everything worthwhile, from public discourse, our government, our freedoms and our respect.
Nope. White men are pretty scary. Especially Christian ones. They reeeeally hate women as well as POC.
so that justifies the killing of Christians?
<<A majority of his votes were white, although he did not win the white vote.>>  Yes, thank you for that pithy formulation and for your comments.  I used to have an article bookmarked that described the byzantine politics of that Illinois bill. But what difference would it make. Right-wing so-called Christians are determined to slander a decent man as an unscrupulous monster. And voted for an unscrupulous monster in the name of virtue.
Well, what a relief this one doesn't count as terrorism... ... because if the killer had been a moslem, well then by golly we'd have to do something about it. . It's the mentality: 31,000 gun deaths/year are ok. Unless we decide the killer is a terrorist. . How was this any less terrorism, how are the victims any less dead, and how are their families less consumed in grief, just because the killer wasn't "a terrorist"? . Maybe, following their usual logic, they could solve the problem by imposing a travel ban on selected Christian countries, starting with America. . It's the mentality.
Check the FBI and CIA sites for information on the religious affiliations of terrorist groups. There are definitely Christian-affiliated (self-identified as Christians) terrorists.
Wow.  Can a comment be any more inhuman?  Whatever "christian behavior" might be, this isn't it.  So ashamed.
Narrow gene pool and low sperm count we have no energy, guts, or balls to have kids.  But economy needs the young to pay for entitlements that must continue.   So come one come all - we want rustlers, cutthroats, murderers, bounty hunters, desperadoes, mugs, pugs, thugs, nitwits, half-wits, dimwits, vipers, snipers, con men, Indian agents, Mexican bandits, muggers, buggers, bushwhackers, hornswagglers, horse thieves, bull dykes, train robbers, bank robbers, asx kickers, shxt kickers, terrorist, legionnaires, Methodists, Catholics, Muslims ... just sign here and collect your dole. Hopefully, you will end up cleaning our ducts. So what if you do not pay taxes? At least you consume and pay the embedded HST.  Economy needs 300,000+ new per year; last year's quota was not met. Who but from a forsaken land beset by turmoil would come to a piece of ice? Now Americans want to put a wall of Tariffs, lure is even less.  Not 20th century when starving Europe came here with nowhere to go.
I see this assertion a lot, but have never read why some people believe it to be indisputable truth.  It is not.  "As humans, we also need rituals"  SOME people may DESIRE to particiopate in rituals, but to say that ALL people "need" rituals is not true.    In the context of religion, some desire some rituals in certain contexts (they don't "need" ritual), others pretty much forgo ritual (for example, Quakers).    In the early church, the eucharist was a meal, presided over by someone chosen from the congregation, or by the head of household, who might have been either a man or a woman. No priests.  The rituals that have developed during the history of the RCC and christianity in general,  were developed by men, and sometimes have become a bit ludicrous. When any small change from the GIRM becomes a matter for civil war in the RCC, the notion of  the importance of 'ritual" has gone too far, becoming an end in itself that is often even at odds with true prayer and true spirituality.
There is no place for religious accommodation in my Canada. Religions of every kind are a cancer on the human race that breed intolerance, contempt and ultimately violence by those who simply take their fairy-tales way too seriously. I don't care if you're Muslim, Christian, Jewish or Rastafarian; it's all nonsense.
"the terms of the business license " So, if a gay business owner refuses to serve conservative Christians because the gay business owner is deeply offended by their anti-gay beliefs, that business owner will face a civil complaint of discrimination on the basis of religion. And the owner will lose. Because being gay isn't covered by the First Amendment's religious clauses But! Now we are going to let conservative Christians discriminate against gay people and couples because it violates the Christians' religious beliefs to serve them. An entire class of people will be able to tell another class of people, in defiance of state laws across the country, to literally go to Hell. This is about power. This is about conservative Christians restoring the old governmentally-enforced social order of conservative Christians feeling superior to gay people.
This is ALL a sad joke pushed by left wing nuts that are bored with sitting at home.. Trump has no intention of taking away anything from women or anyone else (unless you are a terrorist or criminal) - it is all a farce, a scare tactic started by the left to make up for the fiasco they had with Bernie and Clinton. The left presented a Socialist (some thought communist) and a lying FEMALE career crook that doesn't care about the murder of gays and subjugation of women or Christians. Now all these poor 'ladies' (the ones that didn't actually listen and vote FOR Trump) feel out of touch and need to 'stand up' and show just how clueless they are. So - let them make fools of themselves and fade back into their 'safe place' the left likes to promote..
Wow, real Christians taking about truth and empathy as we in our country try to heal, once again, from the pain of violence and racism. Yes there is a context. Yes there is a different in the pain a mother of an African American teen feels each day as they wonder if this could be the day he will not return...and yes we ask too much of our police. We must have teachers, ministers, social workers, we must have a fair education system, a path forward. Those whom are numb or dumb to this truth we all know must reconsider their professed faith because this is what being a followers of Christ is all about.
Surprise surprise suprise... Another Muslim Democrat committing a mass shooting.  You mean it wasn't a middle aged white Christian, Republican, NRA membership who committed this crime?? Shocking just shocking I tell you
Solid argument. LOL  Why don't you ISIS sympathizers host some somali refugees at your house then?  I see though that Christianity is the common enemy amongst left wing nuts and ISIS and that's why you defend them.  You should realize that  if they had their way, you'd be the first to die for your imbalanced progressive/moral relativistic views.
If someone is going to appeal to the masses, Catholic and non-Catholic to change church teaching, it should be the Pope.  What if Martin were challenging transubstantiation, claiming that the bread and wine were merely symbolic?  That's an easy one to get the secularists and cafeteria Catholics on board to believe.  Where would the Pope be on that?  In essence, Martin is taking on the entire Catholic Church single-handedly (with, no doubt, a strong cabal of the gay mafia backing him), appealing to the secularists and Protestants, making claims that there is some issue with the existing compassion that the Church has for people with same-sex attraction.  It is an attack on the Church, a claim that the Church has done nothing to help those with same-sex attraction.  He is like Judas, betraying the Church and appealing to the mob, and the Pope is allowing it.
Thousand of children abused by gay priests.  This cost the Church billions of dollars, and much more.  Now,  Vatican police raided a drug-fueled gay-sex party at an apartment belonging to an aide of one of Pope Francis’ key advisers.  Francesco Cardinal Coccopalmerio’s secretary.   At a house that belongs to the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith — the arm charged with tackling clerical sex abuse.  So let's build a bridge to bring in even more.   They've given us so much already.
So glad I'm not one of these "Christians."  They knowingly support a constant liar, bigot, and unrepentant sex-offender. It undermines any actual religious message they might promote.   Unlike the mainstream denominations, they seem to have little to offer except congratulating themselves on their righteuosness and damning others for the way they were born.
You are still saying that two deaths are better than one. Which is "pro-death", not "pro-life".   You claim I am not a proper Catholic, which shows your innate arrogance.
Betten then the "scheming, robotic liar with a lifelong appetite for power and an entourage riddled with anti-Catholic bigots.”  Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput used a weekly column to excoriate a “scheming” Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign for anti-Catholic bigotry on Thursday.   And what kind of person are you that voted for her!  "Enthusiasm for a cause sometimes warps judgment." 	       William Howard Taft
Are you a clown Clancy? You're comment is a bit clownish.  Anyway, don't worry about (in Canada, we call these wonderful people, the First Nations) it, because be the time that happens, you'll be dead.  In the meantime, those educated young First Nations will be at the leaders of tomorrow. I've seen it time and time again. There is something which white people don't have, which the First Nations do have and that is a  spiritual dimension way beyond your Judaeo Christian understanding of spirituality.  That makes them great.
I don't see Christians in the Islamic world, blowing themselves up, and murdering Muslims in the process.
They just murder Christians and everyone else they hate wherever they find them.
Actually, that's not true. There were a couple of mentally ill individuals that lite themselves on fire, etc. But otherwise, what you're staying is completely a lie. What does Gov Dayton not jumping to conclusions on a police shooting have to do with Trump not condemning a bombing at a Mosque? You do know that just because someone is a Muslim doesn't make them a terrorist right? Just like being a Christian doesn't make one a racist bigot that in the KKK.
Muslims and liberals excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of Christianity, Europe and America, destructive iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal wars between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects, ISIS , Taliban and Al Quada are the root causes of most of the wars and social chaos happening around the world today. It is worse than anything expressed in the west, even by trolls.
" For my part, I cannot help but fall back on what these bishops themselves teach, and ultimately, what they define as a sacrament. The church has developed a language to discuss the numinous. That language speaks of an outward sign associated with an inward change or grace..."  Forgive me, but I'm not alluding to the sexual abuse scandal, but to your  comment above.  Were not the bishops in 325 CE mandated to abide by Constantine's interpretation and promulgation of  the 4 gospels as then interpreted by Constantine in order to consolidate his empire ?  In light of this, how do you reconcile what the bishops " teach " especially since only baptism and Eucharist are contained in the 4 gospels ?  But - since the bishops have been proven to be prevaricators and filled with greed and the whole-scaled attempt to discredit those abused  is their raison d'eetre, why should any non-brainwashed person believe anything they " teach " ?
A Christian threatened to kill you ? Wow ! You of course have proof this person is a Christian ? And not someone masquerading as one ? As far as these laws the Rabbi is referring to, most of our (ever changing) laws are modeled after moral principles found in the Bible,which came first, the Chicken or the Egg ?
Can't remember the last time I met a Christian that cared all that much about 'christian' values, in that light Trump just might be the perfect hypocrite to be their champion. May he sink their credibility along with his own.
Dialog about sexual ethics?   The Catholic Church continues to re injure victims.  Church leaders continue with their legal hardball and callous response to prevent justice for those of us who were raped by priests as children.  Most of the cowards in collars and parishioners stay silent to the obvious pain caused to victims by their churches duplicitous public actions.  This organization cannot even take proper care of those whose lives were shattered by clergy rape and molestation.  Why waste time "dialoging about sexual ethics" when you could follow Christs teachings and act with sexual ethics. This organization is beyond hopeless!
I've never read a more insulting article in a Catholic publication before.  It showed the author to be very closed minded, ignorant and rude.  Yeah, go ahead and give Trump a copy of "Laudato Si" which in essence says God didn't know what He was doing when he created all life dependent on two elements - Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide.
Millions of people over the last 2000 years have been killed deciding what a "True Christian" might be.    The Thirty Years War from 1618 to 1648 caused about 8 million deaths alone.    The Inquisition, the conquistadores, and similar efforts to require others to become part of "The True Faith" or die are also the 'benefits' of Christianity.  Interjecting that issue into any political system is stupidity.  Northern Ireland is the most recent modern example of ignorance and stupidity resulting in unnecessary deaths between Catholics and Christians.
There are lots of Christians particularly evangelicals who have nasty views towards gays but most of them don't go around killing people any more than most Muslims do.
The reality is, who ran the black slave trade? The whites? Hardly.  Who owned all the boats? Who introduced abortion, crime, aids , drugs into black communities? Whites? Think again  Why did Israel deport 70K black Hebrews? Some say the real Hebrews are the black Americans.  Blacks aren't thugs, gangsters, criminals, and whites aren't against them.  In fact I would say we embrace black culture.  Blessed to have known great blacks, funny, great musicians and there is something magical about a Black Christian women, child, God's children.    But then who are the Devil's children?  Black brothers, the worst thing possible is a divide and conquer strategy.  I don't like Islam per se, but a know a lot of Muslims who are great as well and they have had their countries destroyed for the Greater Project for Zion.    9/11, the catalyst, whatever happened to the 5 dancing Israelis?  Who really hates America? USS Liberty? Who owns the Federal Reserve? The corrupt biased Media? The Devil is here
1 poster made a reference to giving mass.    That poster is obviously not catholic, at least not a practicing 1.  Mass is celebrated, not given.  The priest is the celebrant, not the giver.  Parishioners participate in the mass; they are certainly not just an audience, as that poster implies, his ignorance of how people of a certain religious persuasion choose to partake of their faith unfortunate.  He should apologize, but all we'd get is some whining 'bout he didn't mean to hurt anybody feelings, or it's not that big a deal.  Sorta like using his ignorance to justify ignorance.  It is too bad in his rush to get off a zinger, he  manages to slag/insult those who practice a certain faith.  Doubt the poster meant to do it.  It becomes something to ponder:  which does the poster know less about--hockey or Catholicism?  It is always a challenge to measure exactly how little on a subject some know, hard to get a precise # for something that tiny.
Dylan roof was a mentally ill little scum bag and McVey was likely a cointelpro patsy...it's remarkable that the left's love affair with Islam considering the things Islam stands for are in such stark contrast to liberal western thinking. I think because the left and Islam both oppose Christianity and Americanism it an enemy or their enemies type of thing.
Wow, you just can't get any more ignorant than this!  Mohammed was a child molester who married a 9-year-old girl. He had multiple wives, divorcing some of them who displeased him and left them destitute. He advocated the rape and killing of women Jewish and Christian women simply because they didn't choose to join his cult. If that's raising the status of women in his time ... well, your definition must be different than mine.  If you turn to John 3:16 and read the verses following, you would know that Jesus did not define love as accepting the immoral behavior of others as normal. But, of course, that would require actually reading the Bible.  Jesus quoted extensively from the Old Testament (every book but Ester) and made it clear that the Law was of value for knowing how to live a moral life. Before you say what he would have believed in, you might want to know what He pointed His followers to believe in. He expected them to show love without compromising morality.
Ah, when clarity reigned and ambiguity was a sin. In all seriousness, there is a growing Cult of Clarity in the Church that does long for the days of yore. In fact they insist we go there, leaving behind the evil and sinful modernity of Vatican II, altar girls, nuns on buses, contracepting couples, popes who don't judge, bishops who don't excommunicate, a Notre Dame that doesn't indoctrinate, laity thinking they have a voice, and a publication calling itself "Catholic" without an imprimatur.    Bring back the great homily: "The Twist, Gateway to Lust." Make scrupulosity a virtue again. License theologians. Make 8th grade girls stand in front of the classroom to make personal pledges of chastity. Ban Hans Kung and Gary Willls books from the church library.   CAEL--I'll bet you have some examples too. All 100% factual. If not believed.    "It's a grave sin to watch the Miss America pageant."  "Peyton Place is a condemned book." "Catholics can't go to Woodstock, but they can go to Nam."
There are some who will say that the church can never change its position on homosexuality because the church's teaching is part of divine revelation. I say it's as much a part of divine revelation as not eating shellfish or men not cutting their hair - after all, those prohibitions, like not wearing clothes made of mixed fabrics or not eating meat with dairy products, all come from the same book of the Bible: Leviticus. And yes, St. Paul did condemn homosexual acts but he also told women to be quiet in church, and yet no one observes that rule anymore. Cherry-picking the Bible has a long history that will probably never end. But the people who mention revelation never talk about the fact that Jesus himself never said a word about homosexuality. In the end, as a gay Catholic Christian, I take great comfort in that. The church has been wrong about many things in the past. It is wrong about homosexuality, and it is time the church change its position - out of charity, if nothing else.
"Parental Rights" is just extremist Christian code for their version of Sharia Law.   In Jim Minnery's perfect world, all women and girls would essentially be slaves of their fanatical fathers, just like in all extremist patriarchal religions.
I started posting here because I needed to say my horrors about the Catholic Institution clergy’s sex abuses of children.  I am one of those mothers who suffer through family member’s the devilish suffering from rape for twenty years.  For me, I am not sure if a child horrendous suffering from rape is more horrible or the CI (Catholic Institution) clergies continuing betrayal of hiding and condoning clergy sex abuse of children is more horrible.     So the most of my posts are quite negative.  My overall sentiment is ‘over my dead body any of you clergies will rape children and get away with it’!!!    Either CI will reform or it will die.  No matter what it will be better than the way it is now, since right now we are worshipping more of ‘d*vil’ with ‘d*vil’.   I sense CI is already too corrupt to reform.    God have mercy on us!!!
People from Indian National Congress are openly and blatantly racist as long as they are not muslims or chrstians.  In 1984, sikhs were slaughtered after Indira Gandhi's assassination.  Rajiv Gandhi, dear darling son of Indira said - when the banyan tree falls the earth is bound to shake.   I am completely ashamed of the Nehru family members.  They have taken the country to the dogs.  It is high time to reconcile with Ex Kalistan sympathizers and move on. If you can openly invite and smooch with a terrorist like Yazhar Arafat, you have no bones to talk.
Perhaps the Christian Nationalists should form their own party: Christian Nationalist Party or CNP.  That would permit the Republican Party to return to being reasonable centrists instead of fringe extremists.
One thing in common for these Islamic/Muslim Fanatic terrorists terrorizing the World, they do it in the name of Allah! That's not saying an American Christian won't terrorize American citizens. Stop being PC about it. It is what it is, you have to use everything at your disposal to stop any terrorist alike be it a Muslim Islamist, Christian, Antifa, BLM, etc. Wake up, it's the World of Today! You get the feeling that these pc people don't feel it like those in harms way do!  Let me add to this, Jane felt the bigotry after WW2, did she join any anti-racists groups which causes violence in any way? Does she kneel during the American Nat'l Anthem disrespecting for those who gave up their lives for her freedom? She should they way she feels it today
(Ahem) we have a president-elect and a really, really stupid Assembly person that would cast doubt on that assessment (not that the other candidate would have been any better).  Add to that the governor of MI engaging in domestic  terrorism by poisoning an entire generation of children in a fairly large town in his state, not to mention the radical Christian presidents of various sects who've orchestrated the slaughter of millions in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, Lybia etc. etc...
Liar and mentally challenged. Dead beat who can't borrow money from USA banks so he paid for his golf courses with Russian loans.  Deadbeat. Funny how redneck party has forgotten how they hated ungodly men for election. Now they have the most ungodly man in history as their "Evangelical" leader. Rednecks.  What hypocrites.
"Just before World War II, there was a similar fascination with medieval materials, and extremists today are drawn to the Middle Ages, "especially via ardent fantasies of racial purity and white origins," Cohen said."  The growing White supremacy movement has been emboldened by the Trump campaign's message of racial hatred.  It is the duty of every Christian to stand up to such nonsense.
Are you Catholic?  It seems to me a bit ridiculous to assume that most people's problems with Hillary have to do with her being a "woman".  It is far more likely that others have the same problems I do:  Lying, deceit, criminal activity, indifference, self-serving behaviors.  She supports KILLING BABIES.  That is a major disqualifier for Catholics, of much greater importance than her position on the environment or immigration.  She lied to congress.   She tampered with evidence.  She made back room deals, not to pass a political agenda but to commit crimes.  She left Americans to die in foreign countries.  She stole money with her so-called "charitable foundation".  She is everything bad and evil -- unethical politicians all wrapped up into one.  She is blatantly anti-catholic.  Anyone who supports her necessarily supports her behaviors and activities.  I would much rather support someone with a history of stupid locker room talk than someone with evil criminal/murderous intent.
You talk like someone who has no clue what public school is like, that's for sure.   I went to a lot of different public schools growing up, I went to a private Christian school, and I went to public and private higher education.   The fabrications you're touting are inaccurate (your own sources disagree with you, not to mention you're cherry picking) and show exactly the kind of closed-minded scare tactics evangelicals use to paint the world as some sort of immoral free-for-all.   If you want to opt your children out of sex education you can. But as the son of a teenage mother I can tell you that kind of biblical coddling will confuse your ignorant developing children.   And let's be clear. Nobody here, and no sane adult, would want 1st and 4th graders receiving condoms or demonstrations thereof in the classroom. I'm only arguing for age-appropriate information, which is what happens 99.99% of the time.   Your boogeymen aren't real.
The Catholic Church can not change teaching or doctrine on homosexuality  It's wrong . A sin  End of discussion  Loser  Now your bullied are you okay
According to the BBC, he ranted that Muslims must die because they've been killing Christians for years. Will this get called a terrorist attack?
Trump's alt-right constituency wants this nation purged of non-white immigrants, documented or otherwise.  It is the duty of every Christian to stand up to this new regime and its reign of error.  The problem is so many self-declared Christians voted for this guy.
How often do you see a Christian Pastor advocating terrorism in the name of Christ ? How often do you see a Muslim Cleric advocate Jihad which is a clear command in the Quran ?  The Quran contains at least 109 verses that speak of war with nonbelievers, usually on the basis of their status as non-Muslims. You can read them here: http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/violence.aspx  You tell me why we should expect the Muslim Clerics to denounce these acts (which they never do).
So a few radical Islamic terrorist are cutting off heads of Christians, and NEVER do they do that to Muslims? Whats this "we" when you refer to Christians?  Because if you think you are a Christian, you are wrong.  oh, and since I don't believe in any of that garbage, yes, I will judge you.
"Behind closed doors" "Holy Mother Church" maintains, funds and [we have to assume] condones an all-male, mostly gay, hegemony over the rest of the church.  Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmeri, an official at the Inquisition and host in his Roman salon of naked male sex orgies, apparently hasn't gotten "the memo" about just which sexual practices to encourage.  Hey Brooks, is this another example of your "behind closed doors" regime?
You are, quite simply, a nasty person with nothing but your own special brand of attempted intimidation, spin, and yes...even lies...to spew. That you may get a few smiley faces for it does not speak well of civility. Regardless of conservative or liberal, traditional or progressive....on the same page or not...your comments particularly to me are nasty, cruel, untrue, and uncivil. At some point, there should be some rebellion against such antics...not in the name of agreement, but in the name of decency, civility, and Christian charity.
"Same beliefs?" I'll take you seriously the day Christians make their own sharia police force, suicide bomb markets of children, throw homosexuals off the tops on buildings, and sentence women to die for wanting to learn to drive and read. Where do you get your info on religion in society, 'The View'?
Your hypocrisy is unbounded. Your comments on this site about our former Popes are treasonous as well.  Your anger and hatred of our Church for the previous 39 years  is very unhealthy for someone who identifies as a Catholic Priest.
So, it is not enough to refuse women ordain as a priest when you know women has more spiritual power because women hold more pureness in them. So historically, Catholic clergies used witch hunt to shut women’s mouth, I see! Fr. Reese, are you trying to shut women’s mouth by starting the old witch hunt trick? However, it is 21st century and women hold power throughout every fields in society now it won’t be successful to silence women like 15th century! Now you Catholic clergies lost trust and respect from just about all fields& level of people already! So stop your empty attempt of shutting women down with your not so holy attempt!!!   ROTFLOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fr. Reese, There are no other ways to have spiritual power except pursuing personal holiness, I am sorry to say! Try to stop raping children to start with!!!  :-) :-) :-)
In a post three days after the inauguration of Donald Trump, Christian posted: “If Donald Trump is the Next Hitler then I am joining his SS to put an end to Monotheist Question. All Zionist Jews, All Christians who do not follow Christ's teaching of Love, Charity, and Forgiveness And All Jihadi Muslims are going to Madagascar or the Ovens/FEMA Camps!!! Does this make me a fascist!!! #MonotheistHolocaust
Bernstein doesn't hate Trump as much as he hates white Christians and Trump's followers, but he's afraid to say so.  The little pip squeak's only claim to fame is his reporting on Nixon, as if that was something that took above average ability.  Actually he's a national security threat because of his rabid hatred of traditional American values and, especially his childish open borders, globalist fantasies about a one world government that is so nonsensical only a fool could ever entertain the idea, let alone work for it as if it's the most important thing in the world.  His kooky, insane ideas belong in a grade school classroom.  Personally I'd like to see him culled from the population by jailing him as a national security threat.  He's a worthless fool.
scheer needs to drop a few things...scheer was taught well by harper with his white supremacist/christian fundamentalist views from the days at the northern foundation...
Another failed attempt to discredit by the lying moron.  I’m all for foreigners being admitted to the U.S., but I fully support a common-sense procedure according to the rule of law.  That’s not bigotry you deranged mental case, it’s what every nation in the world does. God loves all of us sinners and desires that we each do what we must to cooperate with his graces, which first and foremost requires that we stop sinning.  God does not allow people into Heaven who remain obstinate in sin.  If you truly loved God and neighbor you would encourage people to stop sinning, period.  You don’t.  You want the Church and all of society to accept homosexual behavior as normal and laudable.  It isn’t and never will be.  You are bigoted and hateful toward all those who won’t follow your sick and perverted paganesque morality.  THAT is what isn’t Christ-like, you sicko.
The whole anti-white-male underpinnings of contemporary liberalism is just one of many  irrational, pseudo-intellectual pathologies that has been adopted by the Democratic Party. This pathology is a subset of the overall assault on the masculine and manhood that we find in the culture.  Any culture that has such an approach to men or the masculine is sick, sick, sick. It is this sickness that the above article advances.   We have seen what this anti-male, anti-masculine  spirit has done to the Black community and what it is now doing to American culture in general.  We see that this anti-white male view is actually a form of racism against the white race in general. This theme has infected all of Liberalism and the above article with the animosity it engenders not only lacks charity but is thoroughly anti-Christian.
Now, here is a guy who seems to be a soul mate of Trump!!! Except C. Pell grab boys by their genitals instead Trump grab girls by their genitals!  Is this a sign of human society's progress of 21st century, or is it 'BOYS are BOYS'  thing?  Are Vatican boys doing 'BOYS are BOYS'  thing & insist on this UNCHANGING slavish attachment to sex organs in ordaining priest only if one has boy's sex organs?   I am afraid people will beginning to see boy's sex organ when we see men in clergy outfit!!!     LOL, ROFL, LOLOLOLOLOLOL in tears!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lets just combine the Catholic church and the Boy Scouts organizations into one entity.    They both have been doing the same thing FOREVER,  ABUSING and having Intestinal Intercourse with young boys.
Kumbya is greek, use a Kappa. Cumbya is a term used at those Vatican gay orgies. Regardless, I am not arguing for a kumbya moment. Quite a few priests need to be be outed, not as gay, but as asexuals, and counseled on what their sexuality entails and how it has preverted Catholic sexual teaching. They need to feel as uncomforatable with that as they have made the rest of us feel for normal heterosexuality.
Why don't you interview some Milwaukee Archdiocese priests, nuns and parishioners. It would be interesting to find out why almost all were silent to the callous acts and public duplicity of their Archbishop, Listecki. Listecki announced that his decision to file bankruptcy was to fairly take care of victims. He asked us to come forward. He promised that nothing would stop him from providing healing resolution and fair compensation to those who have been hurt so deeply.  Nothing stopped him alright! Listecki immediately spent millions to have every victims claim thrown out. Listecki stated that not even one claim had merit. He put us through 5 years of hell. Turns out his promises for healing and fairness were a pre-planned bait and switch with his goal to wipe out as many victims as possible at once. Dolan secretly paid the pedo-priests that raped us 20k to quietly leave. The scum that raped us got more than many of the victims. Milwaukee Catholics and priests silently looked away.
You are one of the types of people who have ruined this once great country. Christian prayers hve been banned yet it is people like you that allow this nonsense. You are the Taliban.
When you lay down with dogs you wake up with fleas, the old saying says.  This right-wing absolutist Christian would have little appeal to thinking people.  But American isAmerica.
Sad thing is they are all waiting for and trying to bring on the same god.  Muslims, Christians, Jews all revere the same book and the same hellish daddy in heaven.  What's a pagan to do?  The bathturds have even stolen our pagan holy tree for their miserable annual ceremony.
And by fighting for the rights of gay men to join and stay in the RCC priesthood, under a cover of public secrecy about their orientation, you too are encouraging this child abuse to continue.  That too is a form of shielding.   The Church is wrong to encourage it, the priests are wrong to participate in it, and both progressive and trad laity should be against it.   It's a policy that serves no one but the abusive priest.
The rise in anti-white sentiment is a reflection of the rise of radical whites within the white community.    Christianity is a dark sinister force and for some reason the right continues to turn a blind eye to this.  Until so-called "moderate" white Christians publicly condemn and disavow the white-suprecacists' exhortation to remove all non-whites, there's nothing to talk about; except perhaps the banning of a hate organization.  Yes, of course not all Christians should be painted with he same brush, that goes without saying, however if a show of solidarity needs to happen one would expect that our Canadian Christians would perhaps show their outrage and disapproval when atrocious acts are perpetrated by white terrorists.   (amended from other posters' comments about Islam and Muslims)
Mr. Selko's bible nonsense I'm sure will entertain the haters of Christianity. However it is worth noting his  presentation is very similar to past ignorant rants by individuals with nearly no biblical or theological comprehension as well.
No, because as we all know, Christians aren't running around stabbing people or blowing themselves up to prove a point.  The idea behind our immigration policy is to first make sure the immigrants aren't a threat to American citizens. And there is no doubt that on average, people from radical Muslim nations pose a higher risk to American's safety than do immigrants from Denmark, Ireland or Spain.
Evangelicals are arrogant. Once they are "saved" or "born again" they no longer take responsibility for their actions, thoughts, or behavior. That magic, all powerful Sugar Daddy in the sky will take care of everything. They show up every Sunday to get their brain washing and marching orders. Of course they leave their brains and critical thinking skills at the door of the church before they enter. Life is so much easier when you believe you are specially blessed by GOD and don't have to take responsibility for your actions!
Druggies look for nice, weak individuals to exploit.  If you wish to be exploited, fine, but NOT  when that  exploitation exploits me and my family!   Drug abusers are among the most selfish people in society. When they're done using up friends and families for their selfishness, they turn on strangers to abuse. .  If you are a druggie, here's a suggestion...... Quit using, shape yourself up and get a job!  People may be willing to help when they see honest "results" and not more excuses that its a  disease or 'its not my fault'.  People have had it with that!   The Lord helps those who help themselves. Jesus never expected Christians to be 'chumps'.  Helping a druggie continue to use is being a chump with a capitol 'C' And it is absolutely NOT Christian to 'help' a drug abuser use drugs! In doing so, you hurt them as well as your neighbors.
To care about women is to condemn Islam. As a Christian I do not believe in slavery. A moslem finds justification for slavery in the Koran. "You can enslave for sex and work Qur’an 4:3, 4:24, 5:89, 33: 50, 58:3, 70:30". Calling people Islamophobic , only shows that the name caller is totally unfamiliar with the KORAN. I care about women so I must reject the Koran which states, "You will need 4 Muslim male witnesses to prove a rape.Qur’an 24:4".  Of course, those who chose to opine on that which they do not know, have that right in America. Or maybe Islam supporters want to own slaves and abuse women. It is understandable that many agree with the Idea that "You can beat sex slaves, work slaves and wives. Qur’an 4:34".  Personally though, find those practices abhorrent.
You know, rogue, you make Catholicism utterly unappealing. And appalling.
they only mean it for the evangelical "christians", and I am using the term christian very loosely.  once they get control, the Catholics won't be any better off than the gays and Muslims.
I see the psycho cat hating muslim is still trying to make every story about Amy.  you always manage to weave you're hatred for Caucasians, Jews and Christians into you're fanatic diatribes. The fact that you work for the federal government should be a concern for everyone. jones is not the story here. get over it. aloha snackbar.
As someone who was brought up in a religious family with two christian preachers, my life turned around for the better and I became a real productive member of society when I went to community college and gained job skills. You call me a loser but in fact you don't even know who you're talking to except someone who doesn't share your point of view. The problem with religious actions like this is people wasting all that energy and resources on something that is not even real! So that is why I say pathetic- someone trying but failing majorly to do any good.  And bronze age zombie jew- welp, those are just facts. Except zombies aren't real! (Some might say ancient desert tribe with no knowledge of how reality works, rather than bronze age, but I don't think that's what you are really attempting to dispute.) When you perceive reality as a slur, you need to examine your beliefs. I suggest doing what Descartes did- doubt all that you believe to be true, *everything*.
Clinton a scheming, robotic liar with a lifelong appetite for power and an entourage riddled with anti-Catholic bigots.”  Thousands of hacked emails by Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta have embarrassed Mrs. Clinton since last Friday and revealed her key allies talking about ways to ignite a “Catholic Spring.” Documents obtained by the nonprofit WikiLeaks show Mr. Podesta and Sandy Newman, president of the nonprofit group Voices for Progress, mulling ways to end the “middle ages dictatorship” of the Catholic church.  The Washington Times  Glad the clown won!
Sorry, the only one seeking to place limitations on God Almighty (by definition impossible) is you.  Christians exhibit an 'anthropomorphic' conception of that unimaginable, limitless, unique Being of Whom the Prophet Jeremiah (alayhis-Salaam) rightly said, "Inasmuch as there is NONE like unto Thee, O' YHWH!"  And your misconception is based on a self-absorbed, egotistical fallacy best described by the late R. A. Heinlein, which I'll adapt here for the context of our discussion: Christians seldom if ever manage to envision a 'god' superior to themselves--their version of 'deity' has the manners and morals of a spoiled child.
Oh dear, I thought everyone here knew the term.   Do a google search for "lenin useful."  Seriously....5 adult Catholics here don't know the term "useful idiot" and how it applies to anyone who's good intentions are used by an organization to further their own ends?  Did any of you go to college?
Love the Muslim terrorists and open the borders to everyone!  Got it.  Thanks Pope Francis, we'll get right on that.
This idiot conveniently lumps a whole cast of characters into the "Religious Right", It is nothing other than a hit piece on Christians, and I don't care if he was a Bush adviser.
Oh you must be right.. that's why their called CSIS??? for Christian state of Iraq? or is it BSIS? for buddhist state of Iraq? hang on, it's ISIS... ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ  Shocked by the blatent stupidity and lack of common sense here guys... please.
Islamic radicalisation is ingrained into young minds around the dinner table, as the family enjoys mom's home cooking, and children listen to their elders talk about killing Jews, stabbing infidels, beheading Christians , burning churches, and bombing Israel for Islam, for Allah. It is the same way young Christians are taught about Jesus's charity to to help the poor and sick.
When we can convince the birthers, commie lovers, neo-nazi's, conspiracy theorists, the Christian fundamentalists, and all the other wonderful people,  that the p**** grabbin' Trump is a racist and is very unprincipled, amongst his other great qualities.  imua, aloha and mahalo
Harper is/was/never will be Trump.  He was a religious zealot who tried to turn Canada into a Christian enclave.  Now if we had a trump we could turn this Communistic craphole immigrant nightmare now called Canada into something to be proud of.  You know - that place where a person with an idea creates wealth and creates jobs and keep the fruits of their labour and hard work.  Instead of this Liberal nightmare of socialism communism where wealth is stolen from those who created it to feed those who do nothing but complain about those who created the wealth and work at the Communist Broadcasting Corp making 200K a year breaking pencils.  This animal farm nightmare needs to end now.
Why are there any prayers at school?  Far as I know Christians, Sikhs, Hindus, Jews.... any other religion does not have prayers in schools so WHY THE F ARE MUSLIMS PRAYING IN SCHOOLS? WTF is going on here?
These political "Christians" have started their own  false religion - a false Christianity or false Catholicism.  These are the people we were warned about long ago.
The real travesty is why he was ever allowed to be on this program or that it lasted this long.  His massive pay and support of his insane, traitorous utterances just encouraged his persona immorality.  Of course, his bosses were doing the same in the culture created by the old foreign Nazi owner, Rupert Murdoch, one of the billionaire bosses successfully brainwashing the populace into accepting fundamentalist christian patriarchy along with plantation economics and male dictatorship.
This incident furnishes abundant proofs that the Catholic church's sex abuse crisis and cover-up are not over, and that the Catholic bishops have not even "turned the corner."  Thanks, NCR, for this article!
I think most Canadians have a fear of what Islam may do to our country . Our country was founded on Judeo/Christian values which are a direct opposite to the teaching of the Qu'ran ie; Qu'ran 5 :51 "Do not take Jews and Christians as Allies "! Can you truly tell me that Muslims will vow to follow our Christian values over Islam ? Why is it that Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia , Oman , Bahrain , Kuwait and Qatar will not take any Syrian Refugees ?
Easy. We voted against abortion & murder. We voted against the lying, illegal, immoral activities of probably the worst person to ever step into American politics. We voted against evil. I ask, how could any decent human being ever vote for Hillary? How low do you have to sink in moral character to think that woman should be our President? I can't understand what I don't respect. Until you & others who voted for her hold to a higher standard there will be no meeting of the minds. What happened in this election was an anti-establishment thing. Congress barely changed. Governorships barely changed.  What did change was the election of a non-politican who defied both parties. If you want to know why, you are going to have to recognize us... the silent majority, who are sick of Obama's devisive politics, Hillary's corruption, BLM, riots, political correctness,  and all of the other babble of the recent past. Grow up and learn your faith before you dare lecture us on being Catholic.
That's because muslims have either ethnically cleansed or killed most of the Christians in the ME and there are almost none left.
Very interesting comments so far. Most quote some facts that help their positions but the one fact is that all Religions are not compatible with Islam. One reason being there is a growing ignorance of Christianity and the truths of Jesus, but also an ignorance of the historical beginnings and teachings of Islam. People need to educate themselves. Islam in North America is called the "Religion of Peace" but their Mid East roots do not support this assumption. Islam is a Political entity that must rule not just be a Religion as we see everywhere it dominates as in many African and all Mid Eastern Countries. These Countries have blasphemy laws protecting only Islam, WHY?? They are expecting those same laws of protection as we see now being put forward by Islamic people in our political system. Once in power force becomes their means of making sure they remain in power. Research yourself, Islams god IS NOT the same God of Christians and Jews as they say. They are counting on your Ignorance
Shar, When the scandal story first broke, there was a protracted effort by the bishops to define the scandal VERY narrowly.  They zeroed in almost instantly on "ephebophilia" (I believe that was the term) in an effort to define this ONLY as being gay predators on pre-pubescent teens.  Think about that for a moment in the context of what we now know.  Sadly, I fear this strategy has served them well ever since.  But the strategy is also a bit of a bet that other scandals wont pop out...  Seems to me that not only did the bishops long know about the problem, but they likely had contingency plans depending on how the story might ultimately play out in the press!  THAT recognition is chilling.  If for no other reason, it made it clear that the bishops had no intent of truly cleaning house: only damage control.  I see little to suggest they've changed their tune since.  I think Sr. Sally did a great job of describing what so many feel about the institutional church today.
If he was my bishop, my contribution to the diocesan appeal would be zero, and I'd let him know.   If my priest started spouting such nonsense,  I'd find a new parish.   If my kids Catholic school spouted such nonsense, it would be time to home-school.  More than half of baptized Catholics in the United States have left the faith, parishes are dying, ordinations are dropping, and his biggest concern is why we are not letting more Muslims in the country.   Turkey was Christian at one time, but I'm sure they had bishops like him when the first Muslims arrived.
Mr. Hobson is mocking Burke's hypocrisy with this.  Burke is so upset that Amoris Laetitia allows a few remarried people to receive Communion without an annulment; these people tend to be the most innocent people in the divorce.  The classic case is the abused and abandoned woman who remarries and finds happiness but cannot get an annulment for a myriad of reasons.  Burke wants to deny such a hypothetical woman Communion without examining the particulars of the case, but he is totally okay with aligning himself with a thrice married Catholic who is alleged to have abused at least one ex because he serves Burke's odious political purposes.   And while I am generally against Catholic priests denying politicians Communion for political judgments, I think Bannon's case is one of the rare cases where Canon 915 does apply.  The man is clearly a racist demagogue who is using his position to spread hate.  It is scandalous for him to receive Communion.
There is no enigma, what a lie: it is allowing foreigners to have the same rights as those born in Canada which is the problem, PERIOD whether it is job opportunities or rental housing, MIGRATION HAS KILLED CANADA! The only people who benefit are the catholic and other religious organizations and banking and business OWENERSHIP sectors. The rest of us suffer. Time to end it.
Well, DC, you got me all wrong.  Iodinate hate the Muslims, I'm terrified of them.  I know that once they are in control, I will be forced to convert or die. And since I'm a born again Christian, I'll have to let them behead me.  And of course the Muslims in Lane Co. behave in a benign manner, they are practicing Taqiyya.  And if you don't know what that means, then you are just simply ignorant of the facts. So, check it out, apology not necessary, just need educating.
Your proof that Christians are murdering in the name of their God is Robert Lewis Dear?  The delusional whackadoodle declared mentally unfit to stand trial? The crazy (literal crazy) dude who believes the FBI cuts holes in his clothes and leaves feathers in his apartment?  That's your "Christian?"  Nice.
Right. A racist, sexist, bigoted, adulterous liar of a president should be supported, and those who voted for him praised.  Previous conservative presidents at least gave lip service to their Christianity. Do you really see Trump doing even that?
God is bisexual, eh? Both male and female. I guess that solves my question about sex.  As for Jesus, we're in agreement. Joseph was a cuckold and Mary was an adulteress.  Back to God's gender for a moment: Adam was created in God's likeness, not Mary. I think God was considered a "he." Certainly, but Church of Rome authority he was and that's the original font of Christian knowledge.  So, God's a guy with no woman around for eternity. That would explain a lot.
xoxo,  I suspect Rompeorazones is referring to Plan B ... the "morning after" pill.  The problem for those who believe Plan B and similar medications are abortifacients is the fact that the science (darn that pesky old science!) doesn't support the idea.  The January - February 2010 issue of Health Progress (the Journal of the Catholic Health Association of the United States) included an article by Sandra Reznik, MD, Phd.  Dr. Reznik is a professor at St. John's University.  In that article (it can still be found online), Dr. Reznik analyzed the data and concluded that Plan B is not an abortifacient.  Unfortunately, science will never convince some people.
As a non Christian, I look at the Christians and the evangelicals and wonder what kind of christianity they worship, or, how the Christian politicians who are defunding the health and social programs that help the unfortunate, sick, weak, infirm, diseased, hungry and the dying, and giving the same funding to whatever corporation or individual fatcat banker on wallstreet, bribed them, even call themselves Christians? I may end up in the white mans hell, but I will see many past administrations and congressional delegations there.. There are many bribed to allow invasions and occupations to enrich a few leeches and parasites, that end with the suffering ad slaughter of the Native inhabitants to get them out of the way of civilized theft and murder... And hallelujah... I will see many of the posters to adn.com there also. I see too many pious individuals go out of their way to cut down their fellow man, out of greed, racism,
Your ignorance is showing , diverdave, but I am glad for the opportunity to educate. Objecting to Israel's Apartheidism, racism, colonialism, is objecting to human rights violations which is what Jewish Voice for Peace does among many good human beings. I am a supporter of JVP. I follow CHRISTIAN Peacemaker reports from Hebron. They try to protect school children from Attacks by brutal Illegal Israeli settlers. ." The UN takes First Concrete Step To Hold ISRAEL Accountable for Violating Palestinian Human Rights." BDSMOVEMENT.NET Jewish Voice for Peace reports.
The only place where right is wrong, wrong is right, and boy is girl is in liberal America and other like sub-cultures.  Muslims adhering to the strict text of Islam can behead people for converting from Islam to Christianity,  but we dare not condemn.  If Catholics repeatedly, year after year, blew up buildings, restaurants, and metros in the name of Pope Francis, there'd be an outcry against Catholics.   That would be rational.   But when it's done by Muslims, any mention that these acts are done in the name of Islam is suppressed as religious discrimination.  That's irrational.
Saullie: seriously?  Again, stop making things up, if you don't understand them, as you usually do. There was no slag against Catholics, just like there was no slag about passing in a shoot-out, as you once boasted.  In fact there was a  simple  clarification about your shallow knowledge of the Holy Sacrament of Mass  to a silly a notion of your persistent  slagged  preaching  to Leafs' Nation for the sake of winning  a hollow skirmish with a different poster.  And since you can't recognize sensitive hockey issues, I am not surprise, at your persistence here, even after you were corrected by another poster and schooled by yet another on  another point, that you incredibly , yet again,  fail  to understand, on yet another post, is silly.  Again stop preaching to those who have a better understand of the game than you do. By continuing  your foolishness you simply elevate the notion of ridiculous to yet a higher level of absurdity for yourself.
Why would an "anti-gov wing nut" choose to kill country western fans who are known to be conservative and Christian?  Think.
Try flying into anyone of the 7 countries (and others in the region) listed for the ban and see what happens to you…  you’ll be turned away because you’re white and Christian and they don’t want you, you’re not welcome there.
Even attempting to use the word 'factual' in a theological discussion is ludicrous!  The Catholics will be surprised to discover that they are not Christians.  You would think that the guy buried in the Vatican would have some slight claim to be a follower of Christ, at least.  Not to mention the one supposedly buried in St. Mark's in Venice.    All the "Pieces of the True Cross" and most of the other Saints' relics scattered about Europe are most likely bogus, but there seems to be at least some contemporary history for those two.  Whether Catholics are Christian illustrates the problem.    Theology and doctrine define a 'Christian'.   Then you kill eight million people in the Thirty Years War to make sure that your definition is followed.  380 years later, you want to reopen those wounds and kill off the Catholics because they are not Christians, I guess.
Regarding gays hurting the Scouts: it's been mentioned some churches have withdrawn their support from the programs. I know... it's the elephant in the room that nobody wants to talk about, but those gay catholic priests who can't seem to keep their robes closed around  young boys is just not right. They destroyed their lives and some have even committed suicide (can you say crime of murder here?). And Mr. Barnard's "Gay agenda" hurting Scouts, 9/28 says that kids suffer because of the gay agenda? The sad thing about it is that the priests kept getting away with it and when caught, were never prosecuted; they were just transferred to another parish. Any other man would go to prison for years. Hypocrites!
Everyone construes a God in their own image.  It is a truism of theology.  Last I checked, St. Augustine was Catholic.  Anselm is too, but he is not the entire Church.  There are quite a few of us who do not believe God is an ogre.  More and more all the time and to keep those we have, a new understanding that does not compel obedience at the point of damnation is necessary.  That is not faith, it is making God a codependent.  These ideas did not originate with me although I am giving voice to what a lot of people are thinking.  So did Erasmus.  Last I checked, he was Catholic too and unlike me, very gay.
Funny thing about those "frauds:" these "Catholic" politicians who claim to be pro-life but bound by Roe--could offer suggestions about how to get around Roe or otherwise render the decision moot.  For example, they could suggest the bishops change tactics by expanding person-hood to the unborn--then support efforts to do that.  They aren't doing that.  They are frauds too.
How about calling them "white nationalist terrorists"?    I mean, Donnie was clutching his pearls that Obama didn't start WWIII by insulting all of Islam at every opportunity and now we have the Christian identity type of home-grown terrorists coming out of the woodwork and NOW he's getting all politically correct?
More treacherous than Nixon?  Yet, the outgoing tyrant called white, christian, conservative a domestic terror threat.  Hey, Berstein, GPS!
Except his statement starts with black and white law - that is not the gospel starting point; even for a bishop.  We are Christ-centric; build our church on relationships before we start *dis-inviting* people.  Sorry, a known public pronouncing racist is very different from folks in a gay marriage - your comparison alone is contemptible.
What about the cult of Islam... ?? They only kill, well everyone. Yet Christians are your problem.
Wheeler and Bailey go to vastly different cafeterias.  Jules bailey worships at the same denomination as Falwell/Huckabee/Franklin Graham/Ted Cruz.  His church preaches female submission and that gays are sinful.  He titthes to this church and also does Bible study with them.Even if his conservative fundy evangelical church pretends to be cool- they are the same homophobes as you would find at Liberty University.    Wheeler goes to a more inclusive church, and his sky god is not as scary.  Wheeler and Bailey have some similar policies, but I find Bailey untrustworthy & wishy-washy.  Note that he won't defend the church but still gives it $.  What does Bailey believe and what will he stand up for?  Why does he listen to a Pastor who preaches that Jessica Bailey should submit to Jules Bailey?  I can understand voting for David Schor- but Bailey? Bailey? What a weakling.
The Imam quoted in the article hosted last year an Egyptian "scholar" who calls for slaying of Jews, and destruction of Russians, Hindus, Shiites, Christians, Americans, Europeans.
What is it with you conservatives?   Here you advance the value of following the directions of law enforcement yet your the same type to scream that the federal government is guilty of overreach. Conservatives value freedom, yet some demand invasive peeks into vaginas if an abortion is considered. And conservatives are usually Christian. A Catholic higher up recently declared the circumstances under which sex was OK.
If you think Osteen is Christian then you probably think Trump is a good President. He is a scam artist who has made multi millions selling a false god to morons who follow like slow sheep.
Dennis, One of the most blatant hurts accorded to many men and women was when Benedict opened the door for married clergy of the Anglican Communion to come into the Catholic Church as priests. God only knows how hurtful that was to many men and women. To sit there in church while an Anglican said Mass with his wife and kids in the pews while, in many cases, a catholic priest sat in the same church and wasn't even allowed to take communion.  Someone is on here demanding to know when Benny or JPII ever changed Church teaching. Well there's a big, fat, juicy one right there. He changed it at a whim, opening the door for every homophobic, misogynistic, reactionary right wing cleric who felt that their own church wasn't hating homosexuals and women enough.  On the upside, Benny showed that you can change anything and 2000 years of tradition can be dropped like hot cakes, and I hope that Francis makes full use of the precedent set by him.
from above --  My nephew and three of his friendsa spent a year in Iraq attached toi a Striker Unit and went on daily patrols on foot. WHY should they put their lives on the line for the GOP agenda of death for profits and OIL??? Especially since Scalia and the GOP war for profits.  Scalia was Italian just like me and my family. So SAD!!!  When the USCCB stops being a super-pac for the GOP and returns to being a religion then maybe...  For the godless, soulless, money-grubbing GOP that thinks it is a gift from God but is only from Satan there is NO hope. When the CC decides that people are more important than human beings and returns to the path of Christ instead of the path of Republicanism than I will re-evaluate my position on the church.     If you still don't get it then you never will. Aren't you people just a bunch of slugs and parasites on this planet. Just continue taking from the little people and see where you end up.   When you don't know just read and learn.  'nuff said.
I am not so sure Jesus' life was as out of step... as today's hierarchy.  After all, He did not burst on the public scene till age 30.  I thought prior to that, he was a carpenter or handyman.  Since there is no mention that I know of as as to whether he was married, or not, my jury is out on that.  Where he was "out of step" was in his criticism of some of the elders of his own faith.  I don't see that in the Catholic priesthood.  Of course, he was also different in his incredible ability to heal.  One can not expect that of everyone.  As to your third sentence, "I think it boils down to a diluted understanding of what love..."  That expresses what a lot of married laity think is what is lacking in single priests.  I am pleased that you have "the sixties" in quotes as sociological research then, and now, shows that the "sex revolution" occurred in the seventies.  The change for a lot of men was that they began having sex with "the girl next door" instead of prostitutes.
Wow, just wow.  You are brutally uninformed.  Almost half the cemeteries in Toronto are for specific religions.  Mount Hope Catholic Cemetery is just one of them to answer your ludicrous question and there are many Jewish only cemeteries.  Your ignorance to this matter is astounding.  There are thousands of cemeteries across Canada that are Christian only.  Try getting an education.
Precisely. Despite both Sunni and Shiite being blood feud enemies, they both agree that  Christians and Jews and non believers,  must die . They will put aside their religious  differences so they can  to kill us together.
Look, these endless one sided stories of the poor poor Muslims is not helping. Please stop trying to portray the Muslim faith as an innocent. Muslims have been murdering Christians for a very long time. To try to rewrite reality, and push aside that fact is causing many hard feelings. Schools are not allowed to have Christmas Concerts, why is Muslim prayers being allowed? We are not a Muslim based or founded country......thank goodness.
Neo-CONservatism resurrecting and revealing the true nature of the Republican Terrorist Party in all of its forms, nationally and locally.  The Republican national nominating system offered a group of white men competing to represent the values of Old South christian fundamentalism in all of its racist, bigoted, misogynist evils.  Each trying to cater to the White Supremacists and religious patriarchy idolators still infecting the nation since the Civil War and Segregation eras.  The Trump "winning" despite the worst female hatred ever seen in a candidate released the hounds of racist bigotry, coupled with Corporate Media slavering, salacious broadcasting, to make it all acceptable not only in private, but throughout the public discourse.  Every insane White Supremacist idiocy joined with religious anti-human dogma became acceptable.  Now, the ultimate Alaskan purveyor of it all is elected and allowed to fill the media and government with traitorous actions and language.  Disgusting.
Yes of course!  Purveyors of misogyny, bigots, racists, right wing fundamentalist christians, white people, gun toting nuts, Islamophobia and Nazis are responsible for her loss. Or it could be that reasonable American voters were just sick and tired of the predictable garbage she was selling.
The lying, smiling, christian crusader didn't mention Comey's testimony....and neither Pence or Handel  mentioned Our Great Leader during their fundraising.......the rats are running.  Obstruction, Collusion, & Stupidity@#MAGA
Cardinal Law was guilty of shuffling the deck of offenders.   That's plain.  But had there been no offenders, Cardinal Law wouldn't be the villain and scapegoat of the sex abuse crisis.  So what is the real source of the scandal?   The offenders.  That is, Priests who were sexually attracted to other males.  Anyone who denies that real source is denying the actual cause of the Church's scandal.
Fortunately you are not a Christian.  Otherwise you would need to care about your fellow man (or woman).
"The GOP can get away with being a whites only party"???  “It is time to end the slavish devotion to the Democrat party. They have insulted us, used us and manipulated us. They have saturated the black community with ridiculous lies: ‘Unless we support the Democrat party, we will be returned to slavery. We will be robbed of voting rights. The Martin Luther King holiday will be repealed.’ They think we’re stupid and these lies will hold us captive while they violate everything we believe as Christians.”  Bishop E.W. Jackson
"and all the other groups of Muslims in many countries around the world , that want to destroy Jews, Christians and non believers"   that would be all of islam
God says, in the Bible, it's perfectly ok to take a life. Have you actually read the Bible? Or did you skip all the parts where your god emphatically promotes his followers to kill?   Shall I list all the verses? Your god most certainly does not prohibit mankind from killing each other. He encourages it. It's as if Christians don't read the Bible at all when they spout this nonsense.
Not that long ago that Catholics had to cover their heads at mass (remember the ridiculous hanky thing?)! Peggy -------------------- not "had to" it was optional no women got scorned, beaten, harassed, shunned for not wearing it  that ridiculous hanky thing - you show that "Anti Catholic hatred has a place in YOUR Canada you have little credibility fighting for tolerance  oh yes the hanky thing is a veil
"Trump triggers Christian hypocrisy" "Christian hypocrisy". How redundant.
Just like those ISIL scum , these "christians" hide their bigotry behind a religion .
Never Trust a Muslim! Never heard an Imam denounce Lying, denounce non-believers are Infidels! Their followers believe their faith as much as Christians do theirs. Well, I not saying "All" Muslims but I just can't tell which sect a Muslim is from. There are good and bad, that's the problem. And I'm not one to be REACTIVE but PROactive as to the Fanatic Muslim/Islam terrorists. It is what it is, Why not have the Good Muslims enlist into the Military as the American Japanese did in WW2 to fight off the Japan Imperialist?  The AJ enlisted in droves in the island chain and fought to show where their true hearts were for, AMERICA!
Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. Sucks to be a hypocrite. And to those who would defend him, shame on you as well. Or is his, Murdoch's, and Trump's behavior the new norm? Sexually abusive and lairs? So much for demonstrating Christian values.
"Our Republican friends went in to a hissy fit when someone, not a Catholic, emailed John Podesta calling for reforms in the Catholic Church." - Silliness, to call an objection to the Democrats starting phony "catholic" front groups in order to sway voters a "hissy fit", is more about ridicule than a legit objection. Perhaps it hits too close to home here at NcR, after all they have been ordered by their bishop to remove the word "catholic" from their name...Now lets look at the violent "hissy fit" our Democrat friends are engaging in on the streets of Democrat cities across the nation!
I haven't seen any beheadings, burnings or drowinings lately by Christian groups. Please link me to them. BTW, did you know that President Andrew Jackson was the first Progressive president (Democrat) that was the beginning of the KKK? Even Democratic Senator Strom Thurmond belonged to the KKK!!!! The Democrat Party used the KKK as its militant arm to "put down" blacks in the South.
Fredrick, I'm sure that by now you and I are the only ones following this comment thread. I rate all comments as "sorta ok" and "civil" also.  Anyway, I mustn't have made my point clear. I don't mean to hint that there is a pro Muslim bias. I'm implying that there is a anti Christian bias. It's no secret that Christianity is fair game, the media and contemporary culture carefully walks on egg shells whenever dealing with issues involving other religions. Don't worry, as soon as the more ignorant members (media/Hollywood/academia) of our society realize that Islam is also monotheistic and is as intolerant (theologically speaking) as is Christianity, they will then attack Islam and Muslims also.
Dialogue is great.   But the Church's teachings and the Catholic Catechism are clear:  Homosexual behavior is sinful. When the LGBTQ Catholics accept that teaching, then true dialogue is possible. The same goes for the fornicators, adulterers, abortionists, thieves, murderers, child molesters, etc.
In America anyone is allowed to opening mock something as dumb as Christianity.  But that is a waste of time. Let’s get back to mocking draft dodging cowards.
Now you're being silly.  You said that the concept of mortal sin and other "small-minded rules" should be abolished.  I showed you how the Church's hierarchy of sins is based on the word of God with a biblical reference for each of the 4 sins that cry to heaven for vengeance.  And you come back with more inanities and the insistence that you have educated yourself to such a degree that you have no more need for the word of God.  Why even call yourself Catholic?  LOL.
... isn't that what 'christians' like yourself do, "hide the perverts" within the Church all while fudging paperwork as to what is really going on ... always more money to tithe to support the efforts/paying out lawsuits!!  :)
Elagabalus, I would like to apologize to you and to all other gay posters here for the atrocious way you are singled out for disrespect by this wretched action and many others by our bishops.   Please never doubt for one second that Jesus weeps with you whenever you are subject to discrimination by any of his creatures, and that Jesus tears blind him in anguish when the discrimination is perpetrated by one of his bishops.   Words are unable to express the disgust I feel for those here who choose to insult you directly in reply. Empathy is called for; it is very difficult not to assume insults come from hardened hearts.  You speak wisely:   "The real scandal is the church's treatment of gay people, and everyone knows it. It is the church's everlasting shame, which is one of the reasons why young people are abandoning the church in droves. They know real scandal when they see it, and it's not married gay people going to communion."  Amen. Amen. Amen.
She was Newt's extra marital mistress at the time Newt was on Clinton's case about Lewinsky, wasn't she? Newt used to go and pick her up at church after choir practice. Christian Hypocrisy, nothing like it. Didn't Newt ask his wife to accept an "open marriage"?
If I were a Christian living in Syria, I would tell the US to get out of our country and let the government we have remain. Who gave you the right to decide for us what is best for us, since every intervention you have done in the ME has ended in a mess. American exceptionalism is a myth, a lie fostered on the rest of the world to serve your own interests. You are the world's bully.
Agnostic means Ignoramus - or without knowledge. There is knowledge, but you do not accept it as such. "The Heavens Declare the Glory of God" as the Psalms say. There is a good debate I think you would enjoy listening to, it is on Youtube and is called Bahnsen vs Stein, does God exist. Stein was one of the Agnostic leaders in his day in the 80's. I truly believe you would understand more about Christians and Atheists  if you listened to it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anGAazNCfdY just humor me OK ?  Sincerely - your friend the Troll.
Christians don't say you should be killed for being gay nor do they say you should be killed for leaving the religion (apostasy). Furthermore, Christianity no longer plays a major role in Canadian society and it's holy book isn't taken as the word of god, like the word of the prophet Mohammed is by Muslims.   When leftists compare Islam vs Christianity, as they always do as a means of defending Islam, they're comparing apples to oranges. Grasping at straws etc.
Nothing gets the leftist wasp nest going like Christianity and threats to abortion. 45 likes; congratulations. How many of you have ever actually been oppressed by a Christian for Christian reasons? And you do know that there are millions of anti-abortion atheists.They are simply people that want no part of a barbaric procedure of convenience in order to escape the consequences of an irresponsible decision. You are so quick to characterize all Christians by this man's actions, actually only threats, and draw some kind of moral equivalence to Muslim extremists around the world who are murdering in the most brutal ways imaginable. Most of the killing done by "Christian" countries has many different geopolitical reasons. With Muslim extremists it's all the same. Convert or die. Also you might look at the historical death toll of your fellow travelers on the left (a religion). I'll get you started: Joseph Stalin, 20 million dead; Mao, 15-45 million dead; Pol Pot 6 million dead; Hitler.....
Prophesies suggest that Jesus' return will be prompted by the rise of Satan.  Since God is all powerful, it makes sense that he would orchestrate this; at least as much sense as anything else.  I didn't coin the term "homosexual mafia."  And while some estimates of homosexual priest are as high as 60%, I'm not sure why that sounds wacko to you.
Christian extremist. When body slamming is just not enough.
I wouldn't call evangelical Christians ignorant.  What I do question is their finding common cause with Trump given his background is magnitudes more immoral than anyone could ever claim of Bill Clinton.  The cynicism really doesn't play well for those who aspire to a higher moral position.  I haven't seen much in the press about the dichotomy and any internal discussions but I don't see how many in the community could be resting easy with it.
It's ignorant to say that 40-45% of French people are bad, racist, dumb, etc., and that is about how many people are expected to vote for Le Pen in the second round. This is not North America, a melting pot, this is a country of native, Christian-origin, French-speaking people. Foreigners need to adapt themselves to French customs or go home. It's amazing how progressives like Saunders are always wrong on this stuff. "White guilt, white guilt!" Sorry. This in fact is the way you create sympathy for real racism and white supremacist ideas. Progressivism has become a nauseatingly stupid ideology.
Greetings.   Young gay and straight soul  are leaving the Catholic Church......let them dinosaur anti gay folks have this dead  Church all to themselves!  Jesus lives in a Church with compassion....not righteousness!
And 100% of Evangelical Christians and probably all Christians put their faith above the country they call home.  What is your point?  And you believe what you hear on RT (Russia Today?).  Maybe do a little thorough research before using a propaganda network to back your racist statements.  Shame on you.
You should have one of your child raped and try to kill him/herself, and see if you could worry about the possible mis use of money by SNAP!  Do you know these clergies  raped Christ/God when they raped children?    ‘I assure you, as often as you did it for one of my least brothers, you did it for me.’ (Mat 25:40)      And you are defending the child rapist Catholic organization?                                                               How on earth can you call yourself Christen?
The problem with saying "Some Muslims are terrorists. So are some Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists or even atheists" is it is taking the particular and trying to apply it as a principle. Some Muslims are terrorist because the religious structure and principles of Islam supports it. The same for atheism, the religious structure is a total reliance on person and mankind's structures as the standard. It allows for socialism and communism to also be terrorist (Stalin, Hitler) Buddhism structurally and in principle do not produce terror. The same with Christianity, there may be some calling themselves Christian who might be terrorists but the structure and principles soundly reject them as Christian. But in Islam, almost none denounced 911, the PLO lobbing bombs into residential areas, wife beating. I have Muslims from te middle East working for me, I am a Christian but in frank discussion, they tell me they can not become a Christian because their family would at best disown at worse kill them
And yet Trump is going out of his way to exempt Christian Syrians. Do tell you say. The orange wonder boy is nothing more than a racist pig.
It's ignorant to say that 40-45% of French people are bad, racist, dumb, etc.,  LIKEWISE with the 45-50% that voted for TRUMP or HARPER  . This is not North America, a melting pot, this is a country of native, Christian-origin, French-speaking people. Foreigners need to adapt themselves to French customs or go home.  LIKEWISE with Quebec - I would say CANADA too but Trudeau would disagree  It's amazing how progressives like Saunders are always wrong on this stuff. "White guilt, white guilt!"   TRUE, guilt and denial of our "core identity" as Trudeau says  Progressivism has become a nauseatingly stupid ideology.  TRUE especially when it comes from the Left
here is the thing. do your own thing, but quit demanding my acknowledgement, acceptance, and approval.quit telling our kids your filth is 'normal and progressive'. if you are a boy, use the boys' bathroom, a girl, use the girls'. all the nips and tucks in the world will not change the sex you were born. if i don't support abortion or euthanasia, don't force me to murder another person. and it matters not that a bunch of 'liberal christians (small c)' support things considered evil. we are warned about wolves dressed as sheep.
Time to start taxing the Catholic Church, these priests and bishops live off of the fat of the land and pay for none of it.  No wonder they are so skewed.
If Callista Gingrich were appointed by a democrat, I Wonder what the response of the American Bishops would have been.  Yet after all the divorces she was married in the Catholic Church.   Wow what hypocrisy.
Subtitled, "How the Catholic Church and the LBGT community can enter into a relationship of respect, compassion, and sensitivity," the book #1, refers to LBGT people (a conflated term of same-sex attraction and sex acts), whereas the Church delineates the two terms; and #2, implies that the Church does not respect, has no compassion for and sensitivity to those who have same-sex attraction and embrace it as an identity.  That's the lie that homosexual activists have been spreading since they decided that "sexual preference" wasn't working as a political tool to achieve their demands.  Martin could have written a book to educate about how the Church exhibits compassion and love for people with same-sex attraction to counter the bad reputation that homosexual activists have given the Church over the years.  Why doesn't Martin stand up for the Church that he married some 20 years ago?
Yes it means all life, starting with that of the pre- born baby. Too bad you failed to mention any concern for those lives.   I am sick and tired of the nonsense comments that all pro-life anti-abortion people don't care past the birth.  A good Catholic is concerned for all aspects of live, from conception to natural death.   I wonder if the good sister noticed her fellow marchers carrying a banner stating " If Mary had only had an abortion, we would not be in this mess" or the portraits of a Vagina representing Our Lady of Guadalupe.  I hope she had time to listen to the wonderful speeches made by Madonna or Ashley Judd.  All very uplifting.  What a disgrace if you ask me.
If western  European Christians defended their Jewish citizens, the latter would not need to flee.  The fact they must flee means  that European Christian are  stagnant  pond scum..............
Anti-homosexual, woman-hating religious fanatics are not exclusive to Islam. Christianity-inspired terrorism is something with which Americans are already quite familiar and the fanatics even have their own party: the GOP.  Violent Christian fanatics vote Republican.
Appalling!  Cory Gardner didn't mind spending time with fine champagne, and French cheeses at the Koch Brothers retreat 8 days ago.  But he spat on the suffering of the disabled, and policing of the civil people protesting as the constitution allows?   This is Un-American, and Un-Christian.  What would George Washington, or Lincoln do, and what would Jesus do.  We certainly learned what that Koch-Knob Cory Gardner would do and in fact DID - he is nothing but a tax the poor and middle class and suck the workers dry for the Koch's and company.
Mr. Minnery is either evil incarnate, a narcissist or just plain bad to want to poke into people's bathrooms.  Who cares?  He is under a great misconception that transgender people, gay people, purple people or striped people who don't look or think like him are bad. I have never heard of a gay pedophile, but I have seen and heard of lots of so called Christian pastors or other people who molest children.  He should be ashamed of himself...
You can't know how much I appreciate your comment, thanks.  After my mother accepted that I as a gay man--indeed human--and her loving son, she cringed and even shook every time DP spewed more of his radical Christian hate rhetoric. He is a radical, no doubt. Sooner or later her will go after divorced folks, blacks and on and on. His is ayatollah behavior. Be safe you and your brother.
Naive fools or strategic globalists with an agenda to destroy white culture and Christianity and who refuse to acknowledge that radical Islam is growing in my country   Do not belong in my Canada
Killing is always a good thing...just ask Jesus in prayer.
Islam seems to be busy trying to kill Christians this weekend .
Given the fact that Black Catholics are scarcer than hen's teeth, I'm almost always startled when they're mentioned on any of these sites.(I'm the Resident Protestant Gadfly on these sites; I'm African-American.)---The papal bull issued by pope Nicholas V in 1452 entitled "Dum Diversas" comes to mind; after all, it's responsible for my ancestors being on this side of the Atlantic in the first place. Mull and reflect...PEACE😐.
Gotta throw christians in there......amirite?
Your a wimp  Grow a spine All muslims come from a religion with bad start  Get realistic about Islamic terrorist and understand that the leader of Islam is the descendent of an Egyptian slave and banished by Abraham  Mohammad committed a violent action on average every 6 week for the last 8 years of life Wonderful I'll take Jesus anytime
I don't think folks would have objected, but these clowns limited invocations to Christian only. Wrong!!  Personally, I prefer they just get to work and pray at home before they come. This will only result in a massive lawsuit, which they will lose at a lot of expense to taxpayers.
If sex is truly for procreation, then why aren't Christians for outlawing and discriminating against those who have pre-marital sex, those who have sex but don't intend on having babies, and persons who are medically unable to conceive?  Oh yeah, because it's not really about the things you claim. It's about hiding behind the shield of religion to hate and discriminate. These "pick and choose" Christians are nothing more than hypocritical bigots. You don't ever hear them complaining about making a cake for someone's second marriage.
The MSM needs to stop propping up Hypocrites like the Huckabees. Does proclaiming to be a "salt of the earth Christian" excuse all sleazy,UN-Christ like behavior? If the Huckabees like MONEYCHANGER Trump...evidently so. Hypocrites, are the "fire & brimstone" of hell.  May thet reap what they sow, they have earned it!
In Canada the most acts of vandalism are still directed at the Jewish population although cases of vandalism of mosques is growing. Overt acts and words of intolerance are felt by a number of visible minorities including aboriginals, blacks, Sikhs, Muslims and Asians. Those bigoted acts however seldom reach a level which could be described as terrorism. Our white Christian majority is far from perfect but there is no comparison to attacks by Muslim extremists in Europe and the UK, attacks on Coptic Christians in Egypt or the more numerous attacks on Muslims by Muslims in the mid east and Africa. So far Muslims are much safer than blacks in the US or aboriginal women in Canada or Christians in Egypt. We should be ashamed of small acts of bigotry but let's not pretend that a single death in London totally counter balances all the deaths on 9/11 or throughout Europe in recent years.
Isn’t it so embarrassing to be a Catholic these days? Just forget everybody else for a moment, Pope F. acting as though he does not know that these clergies raping God who is immanent in all humans! Is he not in the business of worshipping God for heaven’s sake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So Pope F. basically is OK for his clergies worship God and turn around raping God!!!!!!!????? What kind of religion is he leading????? ☹ ☹ ☹ Yak, Yak, YYYYYYaaaaaaK! Pope F. haven’t experienced immanent spirit of God in himself, thus ignorant of immanent spirit in children, thus allow sex abuses. He is not a religious leader but a men seeking his kingdom on earth!
Where are the "psychotic killers" today who use the "Christian" "faith community" to justify their violence?   Where are Christians who throw gay people off of roofs, turn women into sexual slaves, stone people for adultery, blow up nightclubs, etc?   Where are they?
I'm sure Jim Minnery and Co. will have church volunteers ready and willing to check birth certificates at restroom entrances around town.   Funny thing is, most Transgenders no longer look anything like the sex found on their birth certificates - they look exactly like the sex they identify with.   Soooo, Jim and his cult will be steering big hairy guys with massive pecs over to the ladies' side simply because that's what their birth certificate says they are, and vice versa.    Amazing, the idiotic hoops fundy Christians will go through to "protect" whatever religious ideology they claim to identify with, and no matter how much it hurts good people.  Jesus must be spinning in his grave.
"Catholic priest put an aborted fetus on the altar in an appeal for Donald Trump.  That is beyond the pale! To bottle an aborted fetus and place that on the altar to persuade worshippers to vote for Trump is beyond the pale of decency and respect, not only for the Catholic people present, but also for the aborted child. What a sick priest!
Many Americans, including many who claim to be "christian," worship false idols. The golden calves they worship, are wealth, celebrity, and guns. Even the mildest suggestion that limiting civilian access to guns whose purpose is to kill as many people as possible as fast as possible is seen as a violation of the 2nd amendment.  The gun lovers have been fed a false narrative about the "dangers" they face to justify the gun culture.  The reality is that the average American is in greater danger from angry white men with semi-automatic weapons than they are from immigrants (lower crime rates than native born Americans), or from terrorists. The US rate of gun deaths is many, many times greater than all other DEVELOPED nations, on a par with some central American, African and mid-east countries.   https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/upshot/compare-these-gun-death-rates-the-us-is-in-a-different-world.html http://www.businessinsider.com/death-risk-statistics-terrorism-disease-accidents-2017-1
That would give Arab gangs a great chance to kill defenseless Jews, they do it very well and with great enthusiasm.  Sorry Malumba, your brothers finished off the Jews, now they are almost done with Christians, and Moderate Muslims will go next. You wait your turn, and don't be surprised.
Christ said to be angry but do not sin, I cannot think of anything that would anger Jesus more than killing innocent helpless babies. I have never attacked abortion clinics, but loath them just the same.  And I am sure Sekulow will be right behind you !
Well, larry, if you re-read your comment, you pretty much said that the reason millenials don't go to Church is because they think that the  Church teaches that sex is bad and millenials think sex is good.  Mind you, I don't disagree with that all that much.    My point is that the Church does NOT teach that sex is "bad."  It is those who hate the Church that report that the Church teaches that sex is bad.  So the reason that millenials don't got to Church is because some non-Church secular entity told them something that is not true.  Pathetic.
Communists !! The Catholic Church in America loves illegals because they have refilled the empty coffers and the empty pews. Sickening putting criminals before American born citizens.
Actually, in the US, most terrorists are nominally Christian.
Most comments seem to support a sexual lifestyle that is a mortally grave sin. No matter what Cardinal, priest or bishop that supports this lifestyle will not change the fact that active homosexual sexual activity is a mortal sin!  That will never change in Heaven. God will indeed pass judgment on those who lead his children away.
Not to worry, most gay people have long since fled the Roman Catholic Church, being fully aware of the way nearly all R.C. bishops, including the Bishop of Springfield, feel about them. Like most sane people, they know that only an insane person would want to sup with people who hate them, believe them to be second-class citizens worthy only of contempt, and who otherwise wish them to go away. So go away they have, taking the next generation of LGTB people with them. And the next, and the next. Soon the bishops will only be speaking in theoretical terms. Wait, come to think of it, they already are. One day the church will need gay people to come back to church so the church can "prove" that it's not homophobic and preserve what's left of its tattered reputation. But that ship has long since sailed, never to return to that particular shore. Saving the church's reputation will have to fall to some other group of people.
Didn't Jesus forgive and give mercy to everyone?  Do you think His Mother would undercut her own Son?  I think words like "lesbian porn" are just other forms of "walls" that people throw up, so that they can draw back into themselves.  We need to break down those sorts of wall, and be open to surprises.  What would Francis say and do?  Didn't he just meet with prostitutes and so forth?  Or is it the lesblian side of things that prejudice doesn't allow you to forgive?  You're forgiving about heterosexual immorality, but draw the line on homosexual immorality?  Help us sort this one out.
Ridiculous comment. Coptic Christians are the original population of Egypt---pre-Arab and pre-Muslim----and have no connection with European imperialism post 1500.  And their history of being violently suppressed goes back a long way.  So, for example, back in the 8th and 9th century, when they were still the majority in Egypt, there were many revolts by the Copts against their Arab conquerors that were brutally suppressed. Discriminatory taxation was one of the causes.  (The Coptic Church hierarchy, which was granted a position of privilege by their Arab overlords, sometimes aided the suppression. ) History is written by the conquerors, and it doesn't much matter whether the conqueror is a 19th century European or an 8th century Arab.
Especially keep your religion out of the halls of Congress. What in the world were Kelly and the other "christians" doing injecting their religious beliefs onto the floor of the state legislature? Would they have welcomed a Muslim or a Hindu or even a Jew to comment on their religious distortions on the floor of the Senate? Just do your damned jobs and get the financial mess straightened out. And Jesus ain't gonna be any help in that department either.
No, all religions don't practice slavery.  Buddhism doesn't.  Taoism doesn't.  Hinduism doesn't.  Americans need to realize there's a huge world out there, and it doesn't revolve solely around America.  The garbage middle east religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) are the ones that condone slavery, condemn sex, and have violent gods.  Not everyone practice that garbage.
Very true.  Let's blame this on the gay, pedophile/ephebophile priests and the bishops who covered for them.
Yes, according to Catholic teaching.  A truly objective and persuasive reason.  Gimme a freaking break!
I generally agree with the article but want to point out that Christians are being persecuted by Muslims in some (most/all?) Moslem majority countries.  Turkey is an example. Last year the Turkish government wanted to ban Christmas (whether it actually did, I can't remember, but it was on the agenda). The highlight of the Christian faith is banned!  Can you imagine if it was even on the agenda that Canada would ban Ramadan?
Wow. The author and editors are making a bold, divisive, and yes heretical statement in just the title of the article.  Sorry, but have we forgotten that even if we dismiss the First Commandment, the bible is abundantly clear about other gods, e.g.:  Isaiah 45:5-7 "I am the Lord, and there is none else: there is no God, besides me: I girded thee, and thou hast not known me: That they may know who are from the rising of the sun, and they who are from the west, that there is none besides me. I am the Lord, and there is none else: I form the light, and create darkness, I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord that do all these things."   The bible in fact says multiple times that other gods are demons.  They distract from the one true religion.  They are of no help at all.    Ridiculous, arrogant, completely unscientific idolatry. Phan should be excommunicated, and the author and editors should be censured.
What is it about the Christian priesthood or religion that turns men into such evil beasts? Keep your children away from them. The problem is likely much worse in developing countries where sex is a taboo topic and these sickos are molesting children there also.
Simple. The easiest way for Trump to keep conservative Christians happy is to throw GLBT people under the bus. It's why he ordered the Department of Defense is has six months to discharge every transgender servicemember. It is pure politics.
Not saying Islamic terrorism doesn't exist. Even Christian terrorism exists. But what happens in the States isn't on the up & up. The 1st world trade bombing blamed Bin Laden, turns out to been false flag. USS Cole incident, not here, but blamed Bin Laden again, another false flag.  And we're not innocent. We take part. The 2 biggest terrorists in the world are Israel & America. Israel even committed 2 massacres in Qana, Lebanon, Jesus' family village, 1996 & 2004. Now they're blaming Christians. When they're done using US to kill Muslims, Christians will be next. They're very brazen about it all. The Israeli artists left statues of gutless men in WTC as a message, "Americans are gutless cowards who won't do jack." Are they right? We covered up the Liberty incident, in the face of survivors who swore it was intentional. Israel's terrorism is very real and a huge threat to the whole world. They kill Americans so Muslims can be killed. And they call them terrorists! They're real Psychos
Just checked-out the web site: "newemangalization" the author referred to. Yes "new - MAN - gelization". This is so ridiculous, sexist and retrogressive that it would be funny if it weren't so insulting.  It is something that NCR should shun and not render a shred of dignity.  "There is a strong emphasis on Catholic men asserting leadership in their famillies...."; "sports luminaries".  "They are told there are dangerous cultural crosscurrents  out there, threats to the family that Catholic men need to oppose... (feminism???? wink, wink) Cardinal Burke would be pleased.
I think the relationship you are referencing isn't that dissimilar to when people say something stupid like "why aren't all the non-extremist xxx ratting out their family members/congregation members when they should have known". First, I'll assume they most were just as shocked as everyone else that the event in question happened. Second, it's prudent, but not required to be the secret police turning anyone and everyone in for random suspicions. Christian extremism exists, it reveals itself often under the persecution complex many have. They assume their "right" to believe what they want should translate into affecting the world around them. This is america. There is no right. You are free to believe what you want, but your rights end at my bubble. This argument has been going on for a long time and 'progressive america' has moved forward on many issues. When someone gets upset on not being able to practice their discrimination they should think of this. How do you think THEY felt?
You should maybe be worried, Marty. What Trump said he would do to Health Care may seriously affect the blind and deaf.  I'm assuming that you think Fr Pavone's stunt with an aborted foetus was actually an act of worship. And Cardinal Burke's party political broadcast was 'spiritual direction.'  Someone on here wrongly stated that Bishops threatened us with Hell if we'd voted Democrat and you have been using that erroneous statement to let the Bishops off the hook ever since. Congratulations, you won that battle. But you lost the war. The US Bishops and dozens of priests DID encourage Catholics to vote for Trump, a glib and shameless liar.
Just how do you see what girl is on her cycle?  I have been trying for years, but my wife's sneaks up on me every time until I hear about it loud and clear.         Sure it is stupid and backwards that girls prey at the back, it is stupid only men can become priests, it is stupid some Evangelicals call for the death of homosexuals.....   It is not stupid however to try and understand and get along.  Kind of irony here Chuck but I am assuming you are defending liberal Muslims :)  ...If they are shunned by their conservative Muslim's then we have their backs don't we?
"Our own political agenda must be supportive of our lay vocation, which is to become saints, and to bring souls to Christ. It's time we raised the bar a bit around this petty ante political place masquerading as a Catholic website."  Really, RD?  This is your usual comment.  You claim spiritual leadership for yourself and make an empty attack on NCR.  How is being a snide rightwing political troll bringing any souls to Christ?
Another hit piece from the resident Jew defending a self-proclaimed "victim" of revelations of abberrant human behavior of a religious fanatic feeding at the government trough while dedicated to the destruction of the same.  Dredging up the Clinton's as the latest sinners unworthy of association with the pure, white, holy, christian Trumps, Pences, and all the rest of the immoral, evil Republicans refusing to eat with women, but more than willing to assault their crotches.  Goldberg is pure evil in concert with the current nazi, Bannon, infesting the governing system and despoiling the national discourse with vile invective from a modern Judas wallowing in wealth within a traitorous, misnamed "think tank" devoted to the overthrow of all freedom and democracy wherever it may be found.
Believe it or not, Christian gangs are raping girls and Christian taxi drivers are refusing to take passengers with service dogs.  Oddly, you cite only crimes by Muslims.  Why is that?
So somebody's a hypocrite because they believe in a moral cause, but aren't proactively supporting that cause? (Again, not doing otherwise, but not proactively fighting for that cause). That's being passive, but not hypocrisy.. You're against sex trafficking (I hope); so what anti-sex-trafficking organizations are you supporting? You're against global hunger (I hope), so what international food programs are you supporting? You're against, and for, a number of other things too that you aren't proactively fighting against/for, so are you a hypocrite? By your definition you are, unless you only apply that standard to positions you don't like. At least the passive Christians aren't for the right to kill hundreds of thousands of their fellow unborn human beings, as you are, and for those Christians who are actively involved in the pro-life movement but aren't picketing IVF clinics, and least they're involved in the bigger fight for a moral good, whatever else their failings may be.
Call me and many that thinks how I tink, Islamophobists. But the radical Islamist/Muslims are Real, deny it if you must but it's Real in my mind, they are spreading Terror and now Islamophobists are fighting back. Allahu Akbar! Yikes!  Americans are sleeping while Islam/Muslim brings with them Sharia. Those that create Religious Wars in the MidEast are planting Sharia's seeds with the flow of migrant Refugees into America. You know the Hate these people have and hold within that's taught to their offsprings. The Mosque's don't fool me, they have a hidden Agenda, the Spread of Sharia. Women's Rights Groups and the Snow Flakes jaws will Drop!  Jesus, couldn't teach them 2000+ years ago, What makes Americans or for that matter any Christian denomination tink they can change Islam/Muslim's Religion followers to assimilate into the Western World? A Religion that needs to be updated, times changed the World never ceases to Spin the game
You liberal Catholics are hateful. The reason the Catholic Church is dying. You want to change the church to look like a Protestant one. Why not just leave us and join them? We truly won’t miss you.
The Pope does not subscribe to a consistent life ethic when he continues to allow child rapists to administer sacraments to children and their families all over the globe.  He is responsible for the failure of the Vatican's commission to prevent child sex abuse and for the resignation of Marie Collins.  Pro-Life beliefs do include justice for children already here, even those who experience sexual violence by catholic priests and bishops.  AW
And the reason this is a decades-old story is that neither the world's Catholic bishops nor any pope in history has dared tp apply Catholic moral teachings to its clergy!  Neither do they accept responsibility for their clergy sex abuse crisis!  That's why we have SECULAR media and plaintiffs-Victims attorneys leading the way, and doing what bishops should have been doing, for decades if not centuries!  Blessedly, readers can spot your untruths here from miles away, and smell them from farther still!
"Then logically you should be afraid of Christians as well."  Well, except it takes seconds to find recent news reports (past 5 months) of Muslim executioners killing gay folks en masse.  Please show us similar numbers for Christians killing them en masse recently!  Orlando gay nighclub shooting: 49 killed, shooter pledged ISIS allegiance  Chechen Authorities Arresting and Killing Gay Men  Russian newspaper says it has evidence that at least three gay men have been killed in ‘prophylactic sweep’ in Chechnya  The Islamic State Executes Nine Men and a Boy for Being Gay  Egypt has taken a leading role at the United Nations in opposing gay rights. It was one of 13 countries to vote last week against a U.N. resolution condemning the death penalty for having gay sex.  Islamic State group judge read out the sentence against the two men convicted of homosexuality: They would be thrown to their deaths from the roof of the nearby Wael Hotel.  12 Muslim Countries That Kill You for Being Gay
Agree absolutely. Drawing an analogy between the peccatum non nominandum and the religion practiced by St. Joseph, St. John the Baptist and St. Anne is exactly an instance of the sort of diabolic Catholic antisemitism the modern Church condemns.
Oh so Oklahoma City was the government's fault? Lol! When Muslims commit terrorism they're terrorists. When Christians commit terrorism they're mentally ill. You're a joke.
Yes, people forget the bigotries of the past - even those who were the target of the bigotry. It wouldn't surprise me if some of the bitter old men in these comments were Italian or Polish Catholics, who the WASP stock of Canada was once horrified of, bringing their illiteracy, papist ways, and families of 6 and 8 children each to decent Anglo-Protestant Canada.
"I’m going to be OK. And if you’re are a white heterosexual male with a decent job, you’ll probably be OK too." Do we need any more proof that 'Luke' is a bigot and who knows what else? Hit tirate is just that - garbage being spewed because his feelings are hurt, the career crook that he supported - that accepts money from countries that Murder GAYS, treats their dogs better than their women and thinks nothing of murdering Christians.... THIS is who HE thinks should be our President... His 'whole belief system lost' I'm crying for him....   NOT  AND Not getting my business any time soon...
Oh my God, man. You want to give the state the authority to execute sociopaths? First, as a Catholic state-sanctioned execution is off the table (no matter what Catholic death penalty enthusiasts say). Second, it's dangerous to give the state that power. Third, neuroscience may yet develop treatment for dangerous sociopaths.  I'm genuinely shocked you proposed such a thing.
Those killed for being Muslim or for being Christian?  Its not even a CLOSE comparison.  Murders of Christians because they are Christians is far and away higher than the other way around.  Deaths by wars or for reasons OTHER than religion then maybe you have a case.  But that isn't the argument being made so you shouldn't bother trying to use that to support the lie you are spreading.
I realize that people who are crazy enough to kill lots of other people seem to pick up some rationale for it. But you are intent on focusing on a small subset. "Gee, the -white- nutjobs never claim religion" except the anti-abortion murderers, and all the guys who killed people they thought were the "wrong" faith, like Jewish or Muslim. "Pledged to ISIS". ISIS isn't Islam, and pledging online isn't theology.  Others said it in this thread - white guys do mass murder and "gee, mabye they're not well" but somehow if someone's imbalance shows up as a twisting of a different faith, suddenly that person is a deep theologian, nothing crazy about them.  Right.  Read the Bible, here's Jesus: "19:27 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me. 19:28 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem."  Seems clear Jesus wants to kill non-Christians if you just read it, right? Explain otherwise.
The one thing DEMS had in common is they didn't care THEIR candidate was a lying career criminal with obligations to countries that murder gays and Christians AND treat their women worse than their dogs... Guess that tells us a LOT about the LEFT and THEIR lack of values.
Children are being abused by priests right now.  These children see how these priests are revered by their parents and the community. These children have been taught that a priest is Gods representative on earth and they have special powers because priests are ordained.  The spiritual power of the priests creates issues and fears that prevent children from coming forward,  for many it takes a long time. I doubt that you are capable of understanding this. I am making this comment for others to read. Please do not respond to me as I am going to mute you after I post this comment.  I am muting you because... It gives me great pleasure. I do not have to read your skewed views followed by your accusations to people that disagree with you as" hate poisoning their mind" Your Catholicism seems to be based on the man made institution and seems to disregard the teachings of Christ. Muting you was a perfect end to this day.  Tomorrow I may un-mute you for 6 seconds, just so I can mute you again!
Only sociopathic charismatic "Christian" cult leaders get a free pass to proclaim that there's a hateful cosmic cause of affronted morality behind some loss, harm, or disaster, e.g. these guys: (https://mobile.twitter.com/WBCSaysRepent/status/902598139605082112?p=v) who blame it on Houston's "mayoral sodomy."
Looks like a bunch of rich, conservative "Catholics", are willing to make a deal with the devil to get what they want. I'm pretty sure the German citizens that went along with Hitler's  war and genocide looked the other way when he promised them everything they wanted also. Can such people even be called Christian much less Catholic anymore? I think not! Such titles such as I'm a Christian are meaningless now. I'd probably find a better class of human being hanging out at the nearest homeless shelter than the rich vicious hyocrits that attended that dinner at the Trump Hotel!
Richard Corbeil: Our US military and CIA are killing thousands of innocent people, destroying sovereign nations, destabilizing regions...just to steal their resources and keep the Russians from getting them. The low-tech reactions occurring here in America are called "terrorism." This story is about domestic terrorism. "Radical Muslim extremism" is token self-defense against the US military and US agents and US-armed nut groups destroying their lives and their nations in business wars. This story is, of course, about a "radical Christian extremist terrorist." Just got caught is all.,,
You have demonstrated your ignorance of the Catechism.   Canon 915 certainly applied to Tim Kaine due to the fact abortion is intrinsically evil verses the issues of prudential judgement.  It's too bad there are uneducated Catholics like you and Bishop McElroy destroying this Church.
There are about 100 verses in the Qur'an, the holy book of the religion of Islam, that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers (infidels).  There are dozens of groups of Muslims, including Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, the Taliban, al Qaeda, al Shabaab,  Boko Haram, Abu Sayyaf,  Daesh (ISIS/IL), etc. etc. etc., that follow Islam and the many verses in the Qur'an that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers.  I hope Wente and the Muslims in Canada think Muslims who follow the violent verses in the Qur'an have no place in Canada.
Scammers gotta scam!   And folks like that never seem to lack for suckers willing to hand over their hard earned money to support their expensive tastes and desires.  So very christian.
... super fakey bigot racist sexist 'christians' stick together of course...
None of the articles have said anything about what they wanted the cake to say.  Hell, I can't remember ever seeing writing on a wedding cake, usually flowers and maybe a topper at best.  Ultimately Phillips like most of these self righteous fools is picking and choosing which of the religious laws to follow and which ones to try and use as a club to beat people over the head with.  It is people like him that give Christians a bad name.  I'm pretty sure that one of Jesus' bigger things was not judging others, and treating others the way you want to be treated, not this guy's behavior.
First of all, I think your priest friend (if he really exists) is all wet. I've never heard from any credible source that the fund isn't used for what it's intended for. I need more than hearsay to convince me otherwise.  Secondly, the idea that the promotional materials represent deceptive advertising is ludicrous. Click that link in the second paragraph of the article and it'll take you to the fund campaign website. It features many photos of actual nuns and priests, some wearing habits and some in civies. There's no bait-and-switch going on.   There's plenty more I could say about the unkind notion that sisters in civies aren't faithful Catholics, but I need to move on. Suffice it to say your ridiculous sentiment speaks for itself.
Oz  Islamists kill more Muslims, homosexuals, repress and genitally mutilate  more women than do all other peoples put together. Islamists terrorize and for the purpose of media & internet coverage behead, burn and torture other Muslims who are considered to 'liberal', Jews and 'Westerners'. Is it 'phobic' to be afraid of these people? Is it irrational fear 'radical' mullahs in Canada, the USA, the UK and continental Europe who preach and encourage this form of hate? How many Jews in Canada or Israel  behead and burn, are homophobic, etc?  German so-called 'Christians' killed 6 million Jews in WWII - or are you a Holocaust denier? Where's the parallel? Or are you also an "anti-Zionist" (code for anti-Jew). I say anti-Jew rather than anti-Semitic because Arabs are Semites. Or are you a naive pup like Trudeau or worse, a willing fellow-traveller like one of the other more active SJW apologists who posts regularly on this forum?
Abortion makes up 3% of the Planned Parenthood budget. So, either you are willfully ignorant or deliberately lying. Neither is a Christian thing to do. Your remark that abstinence (from sexual intercourse) has health benefits is nothing short of insane.  Here's the breakdown on the Planned Parenthood budget: Contraception - 35% STD testing and treatment - 35% Cancer screening and prevention - 16% Other women's health services - 10% Abortion services - 3% Other - 1%   Having seen the truth, you no longer have any excuse for spreading your malicious lies, no doubt inspired by Satan. At this point, if you believe in a just God, you need to fall on your knees, admit to your malicious lies, and ask His forgiveness. It also would be appropriate for you to apologize to all the gullible people whom you misled with your malicious lies. That may include your children.
--The floor of hell is paved with the skulls of Bishops.  St. John Chrysostom  A  Bishop never more resembles Jesus Christ than when he has his mouth shut.  Attributed to St. Ignatius of Antioch.--
Mr. Sherman... Quoted from Patrick J. Buchanan, We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude? What more opportunity is it that the White people need to give to help the Blacks? If the poor white got this much opportunity there would be no poor white or lower class of white trash people!! The main problem why black people are not progressing is the, "They owe me factor"!! Get it in your head! No Body Owes You Any Thing!  Talk about new 'ladders of opportunity' for blacks. Go to Altoona? And Johnstown, and ask the white kids in Catholic schools how many were visited lately by Ivy League recruiters handing out scholarships for 'deserving' white kids? Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America?
She's a cheat  She's anti catholic  She threatens her husband sexual accusers  She sold state department  She pro partial birth abortion  Go to confession soon
Hmm...I don't wear an earring (I did as a teenager).  I oppose gun control, abortion on demand and state accommodation of "gay" marriage.  I'm not a "vegan".  I have a beard, but it's for religious reasons, not because I'm a hippie.  I believe in God.  And I think the Messiah (alayhis-Salaam) would agree more with what Shannyn wrote than with what you did.  He reserved his harshest condemnation for hypocrites:  "WOE on you, Scribes and Pharisees, HYPOCRITES!  You refuse to enter the Kingdom of God, and would hold the door against the children of men who would enter!" (Matthew 23:14).  It's fitting in this context to mention that other translations (mine is based on the Aramaic bible in plain English) include the denunciation: "You devour widows' homes and say long prayers as pious posturing"!  That's our oily senators to a 'T'.  Perhaps substitute "pioneers' homes" for "widows' homes".  BTW--Rudy is a buddy of mine.  I don't appreciate you taking his name in vain.
If the "precedent" [sic] is a "perfectionist", he's a lousy one.  Sarah is about the same caliber of liar as Spicer is. It's only worse because she's supposed to be a Christian and bearing false witness is a sin.
To say he is simply not doing his job gives him too much credit. He is  deliberately, with malice aforethought, trying to destroy  Catholic marriage.  Why? Because he thinks he can.
When one's ideological opponents are neck-deep in hypocrisy, and chin-deep in irony, the pleasure is almost unspeakable.  Here, NCR --- where the core of its Catholicism is to challenge the Pope and the magisterium --- publishes a full-bore defense of AL, based on the premise that to reject the Pope on matters of faith and morals is profoundly anti-Catholic.  If NCR were to accept Walford's contention, it would have to fire its entire staff, including the one who was previously fired from America Magazine.
"Rural folks want to "take back America" ... from whom? Gay people? Non-Christians? Non-conservatives?" People who want to burn and walk all over the flag of our country. People who refuse to accept the results of our elections. People who are okay with handing our nation over to foreigners who have no intentions on joining into our society but create their own within our borders.
Have the black kids been murdering anyone who is not their religion for eons?   Muslims have been murdering Christians, quite a different scenario.
"I also teach them how to honor the ladies they are attracted to by respecting them enough not to want to violate them physically and waiting until they are ready to make a lifelong commitment."  So once you and your "lady" made a lifelong commitment did you physically violate her? Now I see why evangelical Christians like you AlwaysThere, have so wholeheartedly embraced Trump--you have similar values--you wait to "physically violate" until after marriage while Trump doesn't. "Grab ’em by the p***y. You can do anything." Donald Trump
Well, when you bible freaks bring them up to believe there is someplace better, then what do you expect? Religion is the root of all evil.
Tell that to the more than 100,000 Iraqis we killed when George W Bush, the Christian Crusader, unilaterally invaded a sovereign country on the pretext of WMD.
Liberalism is a cancer and that cancer must be excised from the Catholic Church.
Rita , the US bishops, for the most part, are not really Christians or Catholics- they are Right Wing GOPers masking as such. The fact that only two guys had the guts to say something  about what just happened this weekend speaks volumes. They are only interested in PELVIC issues, money intake and living lavishly - nothing else really matters. So don't look for guidance or kindness coming out of the mouths of these boyos. Shame, shame, shame on them. Same sort of thing happened back in the days of Hitler - nothing new and see what happened.
In Vatican code, "a stubborn animal" refers to a donkey, burro, or ass.  "Does not see" refers to a gap in ones visual field, or a hole.  One has to properly combine the two meanings to determine the term that best describes what the Pope, and most of the world, really thinks of Trump.
What a hateful, judgemental rant.  And you loudly profess what a good Christian you are too.   Good thing God is the judge right?
i know cayjaybird, you'd rather have a p**** grabber, who is vindictive, a racist, a thin skinned,, untrustworthy liar.  You are so forgiving, an evangelical perhaps?  lol
Too late Gerson, they're already the parody of their orange, pu**y grabbing prophet. Now when I think of white Christians I think of Donny telling his joke about 2 Corinthians (who walk into a bar?) or those hilarious photos of Christians laying hands on Trump while his former call-girl wife looks on (hey, their relationship is no doubt kinky but at least it's authoritarian, right?). Whatever model of ideal Christianity one would choose, there could be no person whose life is more an example of the opposite of that ideal than Donald Trump. This is what I find so riotously funny about the predicament of white Christians and all of their sympathizers. In Trump the finishing touches have been added to their two-bit, cartoon version of Christianity. Now every one can point and laugh heartily at the grotesque hypocrisy of this spectacle before it tumbles under the weight of its own crapulence.
Palestinians have been oppressing Jews for centuries.  In 1839, the British consul, William Young, said that the poor Jew in Jerusalem...lives from day to day in terror of his life....Young attributed the plight of the Jew in Jerusalem to “the blind hatred and ignorant prejudice of a fanatical populace,”  JEWS IN JERUSALEM. New York Times	December 29, 1878 Crowded together in the worst lodgings, or in the dark cellars under a synagogue building, without food, fuel, or water –even water at Jerusalem being a commodity of price – numbers died of starvation and various diseases, while others went raving mad.  Those who could labor were denied employment by the bigotry of the Mussulmans and of the Oriental Christians.  Notice the date.  This was before the first Zionists arrived in Palestine.  Notice the word bigotry.
If it had been a christian or jewish cemetery none of these talking heads would say a word.  There is a word for their kind hypocrite
"Because they are non-Catholic....contraception and abortion are joined at the hip logically."  Ergo, non-Catholic religious leaders are ignorant of logic and reason.  The Pope's January call is for unification of Christians--it would be hard to see Catholicism as welcoming when we think so little of other Christians at their very core.
The article says "Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, the latest directed at Egypt’s increasingly embattled Christian minority following two church bombings last month that killed more than 45, also claimed by the group".  Apparently, that's the fourth time since January 2017 that Muslims have attacked, killed and injured innocent Coptic Christians in Egypt.  The Coptic Christians are peaceful and aren't fighting against Muslims so I guess the Muslims must be attacking the Coptic Christians just to follow the many verses in the Qur'an that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers.  Why else would Muslims be attacking poor, peaceful, innocent Coptic Christians?
Deplorable that so much money is wasted on regalia for prelates to prance around in when there so many poor people in the world.   The church needs to get out of the monarchical mode and do away with all the silly costumes. It has absolutely nothing to do with Jesus. He didn't Run around dressed up like a clown to talk to people.
Some of your classic Christian charity, Michael? For the record, I'm not a Democrat, I had nothing to do with Clinton's nomination and I didn't vote for her.  Ignorance, it seems, is your go-to pitch in more than just religion.
I read something recently on this subject.  The writer, whom I unfortunately cannot remember, reminded us that Jesus said his kingdom was not of this world.  If that is the case then what do we care what the government, or retail stores, or society at large says or doesn't say about Christmas.  It's irrelevant that the society at large does not acknowledge Advent because we do.  It's irrelevant that retail store have Christmas merchandise out after Halloween, or that they greet us with "Happy Holidays."  They are in the business of sales, that's what they do.  We do not need them or the government or those who for whom Christmas is a secular holiday to affirm our celebration of Christmas.  We are more than capable of celebrating it on our own.  The War on Christmas just makes us look pathetic, and lacking in faith.
I can understand why clergy fight so hard on this issue. Conceding to real natural law means that papally-approved natural law assured to be error free would fall. In this case, the natural order would be shredded as well as a concept (no more Catholic relativism). Finally, it would lead to the rethinking of everything sexual from masturbation to pre-marital sex, to continence and celibacy (both) to what they fear most - female ordination and parish elections for deacon administrators and elected bishops. They have finessed Masturbation and turn mostly a blind eye to cohabitation, but unless they start quietly blessing gay marriages (which Catholic hospitals now honor), they are about to eat a big bite of humble pie regarding the state of doctrinal formation. What are all the weak of faith who mistake certainty for trust in God to do?
Typical clown trying to moralize the slaughter of an unborn child. There is a huge difference between an abortion and a miscarrage, it goes to intent. If the Catholic Church didn't support life at all stages, their existence would be mute.   Didn't know you were such a big Dr. Gosnell fan?  MSNBC and CNN are the very definition of Fake News. CNN's commercial "Facts First" is pathetic. I watched CNN since its inception until a couple of your ago when they went off the rails. They can barely draw a million viewers during prime time.Ted Turner is about politically left as you get, but at least he wasn't scared of diverse thought.  Keep using Dandy Don Lemon and Anderson Cooper as a news source, no agenda there. CNN doesn't even pretend to be objective. Thankfully no one watches them. I'm an independent voter that uses independent news sources.
WARDOGOO:   Just askin, per Michael Binder's observation about being anti-sex....Would it also be more truthful for pro-life marchers this weekend to carry signs:   "MAKE LOVE, NOT ABORTION"?  "CONDOMS NOT CONDEMNS"?  "MOST EVANGELICALS ARE ANTI-ABORTION & PRO-CONTRACEPTION"?  "IT'S MY BODY...UNTIL IT'S ALSO SOMEBODY ELSE'S"?   "CATHOLIC SPOUSES FOR MORE SEX AND LESS ABORTION"?  "FEWER ABORTIONS: WHATEVER IT TAKES!!!"
Harper was no Catholic.  He was a member of the Alliance Church which professed "Resisting the Green Dragon:"  https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2012/03/26/Harper-Evangelical-Mission/  Quote :  "The Green Dragon must die... [There] is no excuse to become befuddled by the noxious Green odors and doctrines emanating from the foul beast..."
Yes, extremism. Within Christianity, plenty of denominations have no issue with gay people (Episcopals, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists, UCC, MCC, even some non-denominational these days). If your church is bigoted toward certain people, it's extreme. Nothing more than using religion to spread hatred and bigotry.
What the parish bullies and gossips who "use religion as a weapon against others" don't realize is that they're putting their immortal souls in serious peril with their their cruelty, arrogance, and judgmental disposition towards people they regard as "inferior" and want kicked out of the church.   I remember reading in C.S. Lewis' "Mere Christianity" a passage stating that a cold, self-righteous prig with a superior attitude is far closer to hell than a prostitute; this same thing holds true today.  An arrogant, gossipy parish bully who plays God is far closer to Hell than any LGBT individual.
Well said, Elise, outlining the absurdity of the argument of transgender bathroom enforcement---Of well meaning "christians"  posting themselves at bathroom entrances to do genital-checks before entry:  Anyone that looks suspicious, 'Excuse me, "Ma'am", I'm going to have to make sure you really do have the equipment to go with those heels...'  Ridiculous fear-mongering with one source:  The desire of one small sector of society to enforce the tenets of their religion into law, by picking on an even tinier minority, one they mistakenly believe to be vulnerable to their manipulations.  I've got news for the religious "right"---Kids these days are a lot smarter than you think, and recognize the real danger to society for what it is:  The bigotry and intolerance you peddle as your wares.
I'm Stella's age.  I remember being able to afford a health insurance policy and a country that led the world in scientific discovery.  During the last three decades, private health insurance became outrageously unaffordable, a big chunk of our population lost it's critical thinking skills and now it's an actual "thing" to not believe in science.  I blame the Republican Party.  They cozied up to the crazy evangelicals, and the idiocy became contagious.  I left the Republicans about 25 years ago, and have watched in dismay as they have sunk deeper and deeper into the abyss.  Hatred and division under Obama?  Yes, sadly it turns out that the racism never completely went away, and a lot of white people just could not handle having a black man as their president.  And the people who voted for Trump feeling a bit forgotten?  I wonder how forgotten they'll feel after he continues the Republican assault against the middle class in favor of the ridiculously wealthy.
Utter NONSENSE.  Why isn't Trudeau forced to denounce the FLQ, the guy that murdered all those women engineers, the guy that murdered Muslims in the mosque??? They were WHITE CHRISTIAN MALES...   You are just a racist  with nothing else to show for yourself. SHAME ON YOU spreading such FILTH.
How wrong art thou?  Let me count the ways:  (1) I'm an 'Ahmed', not a 'Judah'  (2) And you offer yet another example of what my dear friend, returned to his Lord eight years now, once observed--no people make a greater show of their 'humility' than so-called 'Christians'  (3) And none so frequently--and falsely--claim 'persecution'  (4) One who admonishes keeping God's Law while failing to do so is not only a hypocrite, he embraces arrogance--"Anna khairum min'hum; I'm BETTER than him".  Satan first uttered that blasphemous fallacy before God Himself  (5) I'm a staunch critic of both the Zionist entity and Da'esh (wrongly called 'Islamic State'--there's nothing Islamic about them).  I've denounced the Sa'ud family--their ideological and financial backers--in Minah, Saudi Arabia, and was threatened with death for it.  Can you say the same?  (6) To paraphrase Sidney Portier: "ASSUME" makes an A$$ of U, not ME  (7) eindama yunaqish rajul maequl, fazt--eindama yunaqish al'ahmaq, afqad
First, any Breitbart article should be deemed suspect. Second, the author clearly misunderstood what Francis was saying. He was not saying that there are no Muslim terrorists, he was saying that there is no such thing as "Muslim terrorism", any more than there is "Christian terrorism".
We should have the fight then. The BNA and the constituton includes the he rights to allow catholics to have their own schools. Every left wing weasel quotes the constituton and the charter when it suits them but don't want to adhere to it when it does not. I can honestly say that there should NOT be any religion taught in schools. The human rights tribunals however are merely the enforcement arm of the SJW's in this province. All important matters need to go to real courts, period. If as some folks have posted that the church is akin to Hogswort witchcraft, then our human rights tribunals surely are comparable to the Salem witchcraft trials.  They twist and turn facts so it fits the social agenda and impose unfair fines. In other words unless you are a left wing liberal you are a witch. Stop enforcing the laws through these biased kangaroo courts and do it right.
He says it HELPS the healing, not that it does healing all by itself. As ATF said, healing is a process.  Your posts in this thread show that you don't give a shirt about the victims of sexual abuse.  I would question your claim to be a Christian.
It is sad when such a large number of people (who read the Globe, not the Sun!) find justified the killing of a Muslim woman by a bigot, and find hatred towards Muslims acceptable. (No, I am not Muslim, I am very Christian, but I know quite a few Muslims and none of them is a criminal or a jerk.)
Catholicism spawned its own demons. It didn't need any help.
Sure, because such medieval nonsense has absolutely no bearing on having faith in Christ and following his teachings. Why dabble in this extra-biblical nonsense which, as we have seen, so easily lends itself to abuse, corruption and distraction?
Ridiculous.  The next thing you know other religions in Quebec will want their own cemeteries like  Jewish and Roman Catholic faiths... oh wait.
I used to wonder about the hate that I found here and on other "catholic" web sites. I don't wonder anymore. There are trolls everywhere now, hiding in the cloak of web based anonymity and (sadly it seems) in the rectories and chancellery of Madison Wisconsin.  "You Pharisees! You hypocrites!"  "Judge not, lest ye be judged, for the full measure that ye mete out shall be meted unto to you!"
"I have criticisms of this pope, but I never doubted his Catholicism." I agree with you.  He won't make conservatives or liberals truly happy.  He's a mixed bag.
There they go again. When I came to Eugene in 1985 living on the streets, you could buy a 400 square foot 1 bedroom home for $10K-$13K. Oregon liberals outlawed this housing to raise property tax revenue through market manipulation called high density planning. Today liberals will not remotely tolerate starter homes being built, as they lift the working poor to middle class home ownership standards, and are further chaining the poor to poverty, creating a needless dependence on the welfare state. it is disgusting and despicable how these pseudo-Christians are shamelessly exploiting the poor.
Good plan!  We need to stop letting all those (non white) foreigners steal homes from (white) Canadians.  Only (white, 3rd generation or longer) Canadians should be able to buy homes.  We need to BAN the purchase of detached houses in Canada by all (non white) foreign slanty eyes.  It's not fair to (white, Christian, Anglo) Canadians!    I say go one further and have Ottawa immediate DEPORT any (non white) foreign slanty eye from Canada!  The (slanty eye) foreigners are destroying our (white, homogeneous, sloth ridden) country!
Arguably, based on the Catholic definition of sin, the answer is that voting for a particular politician could be a sin.  II. THE DEFINITION OF SIN 1849 Sin is an offense against reason, truth, and right conscience; it is failure in genuine love for God and neighbor caused by a perverse attachment to certain goods. It wounds the nature of man and injures human solidarity. It has been defined as "an utterance, a deed, or a desire contrary to the eternal law."121  Equally arguably, depending on your own values and beliefs on reason, truth and right conscience,  voting for Mr Trump, Secretary Clinton or Mr Duke, could be a sin.  The decision this year is between a boorish undisciplined man with frat house language, and a lying woman  whose documented actions are far worse than anything anyone has said.  Which vote is actually a mortal sin won't be known by us until we are discussing with St Peter what we did on Earth to justify getting into Heaven.
This is a tired dialogue that serves no purpose except for providing soap boxes to the writers. A winging atheist is as tiresome as a winging Christian.  Whatever you believe is a private affair, and I don't want to listen, read or be subjected to the reasons why.
... take a shower Dyrtymary, you stink of Cheetolini and Republican FILTH.  Go fake pray for a while ... you 'christians' are good at frittering away your time doing ZERO good in the world.
You agree that divorced and/or remarried Catholics should not have Catholic funerals either, lest we celebrate the divorce lifestyle?  The adultery lifestyle?  The fornicating lifestyle?  The adultery lifestyle?  The lustful lifestyle?  There will be a very, very short list of people eligible for Catholic funerals.
I surely think that women SHOULD stop teaching the gospel. I'm good with that. Let men do it all. Or even half of it!
That's the liberal response, over and over, name calling, don't like Obama, you're a racist, don't like Islam, you're a Christian hater, don't support open borders, you're a nationalist, well, I am all of those things sport.
The Republicans longest running lie is that they don't recruit white racists into the GOP. That recruitment started with Barry Goldwater. They have been very successful with their recruitment efforts. I remember when Ronald Reagan kicked off his successful run for president with a speech in Philadelphia, Mississippi. That town was famous for one thing, the murder of Swerner, Goodman, and Chaney. They were murdered for registering black folks to vote in the 1960's. The Christian KKK did the deed with the help of local law enforcement. The crowd of white folks loved his speech.
No.  You miss the whole point of our Catholic/Christian vocation.   We need more time to "go forth" out of Mass and the Parish to live out our lay vocation in our neighborhood, workplace, volunteer efforts in the ordinary world...the Optimist Clubs, the swim coach, the thrift store we volunteer at.   Emptied of ourselves..we return to the Church to receive more grace from the Sacraments.  We model our life on Jesus, not on Temple rats. Jesus didn't' hang around the Temple much at all.   We go out.
This was censored by the Globe and Mail's Islamic censorship board that overrules freedom of thought and speech for some very subjective non-journalistic crap from a very religious person that should be relegated to the Religious page, not the reality page.    During the, "Cold War", Godless Communists were the enemy. Which brings to mind something odd about the use of the word enemy. The Author used the word enemy inappropriately. Certainly, we can all agree that the communists were and are still our enemy. We spend trillions to protect against being vapourized by communist bombs.  Kindness is a Christian virtue. Maybe if those hateful Pagans actually converted to Christianity, they would be kind to the rest of us Christians, Jewish and agnostics. Until them, don't expect any kindness from the religion that denied Jesus was the true road to salvation. You know, the anti-Christ religion.  Why is the above considered to be un-civil? Just pure censorship from her friends.
Zuma is pathetic, trying to equate his situation with that of Jesus whereas he's more like Satan incarnate.
RD wants the poor not to be helped. He pretends to be a Christian.
Yes, but Catholic don't impose their crazy beliefs on others. Muslim extremists do. Charlie Hebdo, for example.
No, it is pretty simple. The baker is asking to be allowed to legally discriminate.  How is he "significantly participating" in a wedding by making a cake? The baker who made the cake for my wedding in no way participated in my wedding. Making a cake is not an endorsement of gays. Jesus knows that.  A sacred rite? 50% of Christian marriages end in divorce. Why does he make cakes for weddings that end in divorce? Divorce is mentioned in the bible too.  If he thinks that Jesus will smote him for making gay wedding cakes, he should stop making wedding cakes period.
The Americcan Catholic Church and the Pope are not the whole Church.  I agree this current Pope is a wacko doodle who is more concerned about Global Warming than preaching the truth.  But....the Eucharist and the truth of the CHurch is still there
The Evangelicals hang on to Trump and Playboy disowns him.  That about says it for the Christian integrity of this current group of Evangelical political prostitutes.
Doomed to fail? His communications director is the problem? How about our representatives? Maybe you should run and try to herd those cats.  Christ this is some horse shit.
White Imperialism is protected by the US Military/ Prison System for Profit. #DepletedUranium. White Power owns the Global Economy & is responsible for the Genocide of Thousands of Species, Deforestation, Pollution, etc. White Power controls ALL MAJOR TV Stations, Newspapers, Radio Stations, & had a monopoly on Normalized Christianity a White Power Religion. Hitler was a copy of George Washington at his worst/best
"The problem is that"........ The diocese where the abuse took place hired the attorney brother of the accused priest (who ended up dying of AIDS), and has used this attorney to handle all of the complaints against all abusive priests this diocese has received. Also, the chief of police in this small Catholic city where this now dead priest committed some of this abuse is the brother of yet a second priest who abused kids.  The second priest (whose brother is the chief of police) just happend to attend a high school that the first priest (whose brother was the diocese attorney) taught at. This is all true, you can't make this stuff up. Would anyone like some names? Several bishops in this diocese have covered these facts up for decades. I hope God has special 'rewards' for scum.
Milo is an openly gay man purports to be a Catholic and does part of his hate routine in drag.  The Cardinal Newman Foundation should have itself in vapors if such a character comes to a Catholic university.   Milo might corrupt the students and turn them gay.
Sounds reasonable....anti Muslim bigotry, anti Christian bigotry, anti Buddhist bigotry, anti Jewish bigotry....anti-belief system bigotry.
Try reading more carefully. I put the word religion in quotes. This isn't about codified religion.  Whatever the motivations,  it's deep hate that is at the core of virtually all these acts. Yep, it's small-minded to try to elevate one act of barbarity over another but some people just can't help but keep trying to do so. Heaping the ills of the world onto Muslims alone is hardly going to change anything for the better. This "Christian" nation had no qualms about going into the Middle East and igniting a firestorm but now wants to claim it is the one that is the victim. It would be laughable it if wasn't just so pathetic.
"Catholics in general voted for Trump over Clinton 52 percent to 45 percent."  This takes my breath away. 52% of my fellow Catholics decided racism, xenophobia, misogyny, meanness, bullying, bragging about sexual violence, etc., etc. are OK?????? That those characteristics should be set aside to elect Trump president?  I have no words.
Oh but they think they are enlightened, so does the media...........time for a few of them to look at a truth based, not politically corrected revisionist history book.   Muslims are still murdering Christians and other faiths just because they are not Muslim.  They still repress their women.   Not as innocent and worthy of over the top fighting for as they think.
The masses become more politically intelligent as they participate in elections for example, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a significant margin indicating that although Trump's racism, xenophobia, and misogyny were big sellers with the Christian Far-Right and aging whites, a majority of Americans did not buy the garbage he was peddling.
I have 2 volumes of the "lost books" and heck yeah!  a different take  - several different takes -  on what got edited out.    you are more a scholar than I, but weren't the "real" gospels written up to 200 years after jesus?  I thought one, perhaps 2 depending on which john (doesn't sound like the best way to put it) actually wrote that gospel.  paul was an eye witness,  and possibly a john (lol - sorry - that's why i'm a "bad" Christian). paul wrote many letters, and traveled to spread his beliefs....but actual peers....?
Yet numerous Saudi Arabian billionaires and multi-millionaires fly under the radar as they are simultaneously the primary force behind the surreptitious export of their extreme fundamentalist Wahhabi form of Sunni Islam around the world. This is the form of Sunni Islam that motivates and drives the ISIS caliphate itself. From Saudi Arabia, it comes is in the form of literature, books, school teaching and study aids, video, audio tapes, etc. used in Muslim mosques and children's schools attached to mosques, which propagate pure anti-Jewish, anti-Gay and anti-Christian hatred.
The most idiotic thing the hierarchy could do would be to try to depose Pope Francis. It would trigger an immediate schism and throw the Church into chaos at a time when it's already struggling to keep its moorings in a rapidly changing world.   If they really want that smaller, more 'purified' Church they're always clucking about, this is the perfect way to get it. But I doubt they'd think the price was worth it in the long run.
One side was Nazi flag-waving, Swastika-carrying, xenophobic thugs intimidating a college campus and city with unabashed hatred toward jews, gays, and anyone who is not white, male, straight, Christian and gun-toting.  The other side was objecting to this vile intrusion. If that's alt-Left, sign me the f*** up.
As willfully ignorant and bigoted as so-called "Christians" like Franklin Graham, Terry Jones and our own Amy Dumbitchsky are, even I'm not prepared to blame Trumpy the Clown on Christianity as a whole.  Trumpy is no more "Christian" than Abu Baqr al-Baghdadi (leader of the Da'esh aka "ISIS") is "Muslim".  Both are egregious violators of their respective faiths' tenets.
The Federal Government and the liberals in the Dept. of Education and the teaching profession already got to the millenials from the early age of 5.  They've had the kids nearly 8 hours a day, filling their head with liberal, secular propaganda.  They are brainwashed.    So now, faced with the biggest enemy of the Catholic Church, the US education system, the Church is now asking the brainwashed youth about how the Church should move forward?  Inane stupidity.
The church wants it both ways.  They encourage people to break immigration civil laws while at the same time depriving the sacraments from divorced catholics and excommunicating a lay person for breaking canon law.  Simply put they are hypocrites.
As usual Shannyn Moore puts out her annual Easter/Thanksgiving /Christmas rant about the Bible/White"Christian" Republican politicians... What a hateful, self-righteous, unimportant column.
Weird.  No mention of John Podesta's dabbling in Satanic rituals with Marina Abramovic and her "Spirit Cooking". No mention of the food code words used for human and child sex trafficking.  Lets see Hillary is OK with killing babies a day before they are born, and her campaign manager is a Satan worshipper and collects art depicting Satanic ritual abuse of children.....yet "Christians" are still going to vote for her.  No mention of any of this.  Shocking!
"Eight years ago, when Barack Obama was elected, a lot of people weren’t happy but for the most part they moved forward to give the man a chance."  Donna, is this with the fact that hate groups in the U.S grew at an alarming rate after that election, in mind or without? And, is this with the meeting of top GOP'rs at the Caucus House Restaurant in D.C. to plot to obstruct the new (black) President at every turn, on Inauguration Day 2009, in mind or without?   I'm sorry that guy was a jerk to you, but do you not see a disconnect as a Christian in supporting someone who brags about grabbing women by their privates? This is not to mention every other demagogic, xenophobic, and otherwise horrible un-Christian things Trump said during the campaign, and continues to this day. Or are you one who just blames media i.e. kill the messenger and doesn't believe a word of it?    https://www.splcenter.org/   http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/03/The-Conspiracy-to-Commit-Legislative-Constipation
This argument is nonsense - The issue of human sexuality is a much more important issue than God's ceremonial and even moral law. Biblically speaking we were created male and female for the purpose of human flourishing and even human enjoyment, and tampering with sexuality is tampering with his created purpose. You are ignorant of the true Christian position on these matters, so to avoid making yourself look so ignorant you may want to do you research before posting such nonsense
What are you talking about?  The Eucharist is Jesus himself.  We are not to worship God now?  Where do you come up with this nonsense?
That any Catholic, Christian, or American would consider voting for a racist demagogue like Trump is shameful.
This is pure evil. They are concerned about causing public scandal? I have seen priest who were convicted child molesters get a Catholic funeral Mass.  That was not scandalous? Just find an Old Catholic Priest and let him do the funeral Mass.  Shame on the diocese of Madison I am embarrassed for them.
Jim Minnery is a liar and a charlatan. Christians should be ashamed that he associates himself with them.
Yes, let's speak of double standards - when Clinton was President, radical evangelical Christian extremists were the group most likely to demand that the President adhere to the highest moral and ethical standards.  Now that Trump is President, this group of self-serving hypocrites is the least likely to demand the same.  Or the anti-family planning GOP rep in PA demanding his sidepiece get an abortion. Caldara has nothing, not an original idea in decades.
Too much of our tax money goes to religious schools already. DeVos wants to privatize schools and she is a real full-tilt religious crazy who wants more tax money to go to church schools so more myths, fables, and magic can be taught as fact.  Whatever happened to the separation of church and state? Are Christians so weak they have to have government support in the furtherance of their propaganda war?
No kidding:  "Jesus made Peter a Pope and told him to go set up an opulent royal court in Rome. I don't care what Scripture says. I know it's true because I want it to be true!"  "Through the merits of her Divine Son, Our Blessed Mother was miraculously preserved from Original Sin. I don't care if it doesn't make any sense. I know it's true because I want it to be true!"  "Mary was a virgin her whole life long. I don't care what Scripture says. I know it's true because I want it to be true! Women who have sex are yucky!"  "Laypeople owe their priests filial obedience and big wads of money. I know it's true because I want money and hate working for it!"  "Jesus says priests are too ontologically precious to be subject to secular law. I know it's true because I don't want to go to jail!"  Some religions are upwards from ninety percent truthiness.
All of the sarcastic remarks about radical Christian extremism are offered in an attempt to get people to think about the fallacy of attributing all violence by committed by Muslims or people loosely connect with Islam to Islamic terrorism.  Christians are responsible for the holocaust and Christians dropped the atom bomb and Christians have exploited people all over the world  using some the most brutal means to to accomplish their goals that the world has ever seen.  Here in Alaska Christians decimated Native populations thru disease and brutality and raped countless children all the while  forcing the Christian god on them.  Christians bombed the federal building in OK.  I am offering this up because if you want to make a case against Christians there is plenty of fodder.  I happen to believe it is a lot more complex than the things I have outlined above.  But never forget there is a strong case to be made against the white devils.  Think about it.
Taxes pay for teachers to take Christian holidays off completely.  How is accommodating Muslims during break time on Fridays worse than this?
It 's sad and so disgusting to the terrorist action against Christians especially close to Easter. However, due to M-103 passed soon becoming law the current government, I cannot use stronger words to condemn those Islamic terrorists.
An intelligent, educational review of the blight of fundamentalist christianity on this nation.  For additonal history and information on the entire mythological basis for the Jesus Christ/Christianity lie read, Man Made God by Barbara G. Walker.  An intensely researched, documented, footnoted revelation of the greatest lie and ultimate system of lies ever perpetrated on the world's humanity.  Jesus never existed and the creation of Chrisitanity was done by a 2nd Century A.D. Pope in collusion with a Roman Emperor to get rid of all of the pagan gods to bring all under better control under one god.  The miracle and tales were gleaned from previous religions to be applied to the Jesus Christ character.  None of it is true.  Everything coming out of the mouths of preachers, priests, bishops, popes is based on an absolute lie.  The patriarchal establishment of men superior to women and ruling over them isn't found in history until One God religions were created.  All by Men.
I hope Geert wins ! I for one , think we need to realize that Muslim Immigrants along with Muslim Canadians do not have our best interests at heart . An Imam in Toronto is calling for the death of all Jews ,and the Qur'an calls for all Infidels to be killed . We don't need any more people that have a Religion that promotes violence!! It is a fact that Muslims do not Assimilate  or Integrate into the culture of a country that was founded on Judeo / Christian Values . You just have to look at news from Europe to see the problems that Muslim Immigration has caused !
Oh, then was his comment just an academic exercise, or does he think that all Catholics should adopt his opinions?  I really don't see the point of having all Catholics become Episcopalians just because he thinks they should.  Much easier for him to go where he already agrees with the teaching; don't you thinks so?  The fact is, Elgabalus has adopted the homosexual identity which, by definition, means that he thinks all of his problems as a "gay" man are the result of a Catholic Church that teaches his attraction to other men is disordered and that sodomy is a sin.
I agree, utilitas, that the pro-life side cannot (and, I think, must not) win and I also agree that we need pro-life push to force us to draw lines around abortion.  We need to work on making planned pregnancies normative - doesn't sound very Catholic, I know, but it recognizes that women who work and have families need to have better control over when and how many children they have.     The wider availability of effective contraceptives is most important to what has driven down the number of abortions, but so has better sex education.  Planned Parenthood is very important to those efforts and I want government funding to them to continue.  State legislatures have been "drawing lines" around abortion, with the 20 week limits.  They screw up with "bodily probes" and artificial restrictions on doctors, required waiting periods - obvious, stupid, wasteful.  I don't want abortions driven into the back-alleys and wire coathangers.  So we need to reduce it but keep it legal.
David Grisham, why do you and your group of 'not-anti-gay' friends think it's okay for you to pass judgment on gay people?  And of course you will protest that your aren't passing judgment, you're just doing as your god would have you do, which is...well, passing judgment.  YOUR God is a hateful, ugly god. I have no idea how you fools could be a part of any religion that has so much hatred and ugliness attached to it.  Your Christian religion promotes this hatred.  It singles people out as being 'sinful' and not following YOUR god's demands.  YOUR hateful god, I will add.  Believe what you want, since all that hatefulness and and all those lies have been indoctrinated in you probably since your Sunday school days.  That's YOUR belief. Leave people alone.  Let people live as they choose.  YOU and people like you need to stay out of other folks' business.  Clean up your own dirty sins and stop worrying about everybody else. And go back to Texas.  We have enough like you up here already.
a bit tough but we're not talking of he's raided the children's trust funds and is now going in for fraud.  he molested his daughter - beans on adopted or not - and she is the victim. he is a criminal, an especially heinous one, and has been judged guilty by the law of the united states. he will serve his time the best any child rapist can. ++jesus, and the way his "justice" ultimately gets meted, is not on this earth.  "jesus", "god"...whoever as a Christian you consider to name that ultimate "authority" will sit in judgement of each and every one of us.. after we move on.  what is the "strength of jesus?"     this guy is better off hoping for strength from steroids and a weight bench at this point.
In Nigeria, Christians and animists also get killed by Muslims.
My thoughts exactly, because not only do Sharia Law and Christian Law parallel each other, Christians are bombing and terrorizing right alongside their Muslim counterparts.
I also think Mrs Gingrich will be pleasing to Trump's Evangelical supporters in spite of the fact she had Newt 'the quintessential Evangelical political hypocrite' convert to Catholicism.  Pope Francis will get a chance to practice mercy, mercy, mercy.
"Mere animal"?! The anti-animal anthropocentrism of traditional Catholicism is yet another of its false teachings.
Do you also find it "funny" that 100 Founders, 94 of which were professing Christians, spent weeks vetting the Constitution's provisions, discussing what were natural rights, "revealed rights" and determined to insure the blessings of freedom for posterity? that they discussed the necessity of "religion", by which they meant Christianity in its essence, for a free, moral, religious society? The only violence that can erupt from "cult squabbling" is from islam against anyone non muslim. Apparently, you don't know US history at all. The first war the new nation was forced to fight was against islam (known as mohamadism (sp). Jefferson and Adams learned of the determination of "mosselmen" to destroy the US because it was not muslim.
dennism, you absolutely do not have one ounce of substantive thought in your head or you are woefully incapable of translating it into words. Your "poking fun" at persons for liking their own posts is quite annoying and very uncharitable. I've found that to be true of most liberals. When they can't intelligently respond to views they disagree with, they always reach for the straw man, which in your case, is very uncharitable and un-Christ like.
I'm flabbergasted that my comment has been censored. I was quoting from the article. Jesus, DM, grow up - our country is being destroyed and I can't use the polite word for anus as used by the author?
That is tragic and attributable to  immoral priests who used their positions to take sexual advantage of underage males and occasionally females too. Such people should not be admitted to seminaries, let alone ordained. As long as they are, innocent Catholics get stuck with the bills, be it through their donations or in this case out of just compensation to employees carrying out the work of the Church. Many of the affected employees probably took on their work as a religious calling.  What a rotten way to treat them. Shame on all who bear responsibility.
The religious nutjobs and greedy pigs in the party want to increase immigration, keep pushing it all in the face of how destructive it has become to our quality of life. Insanity. That is what this is about, not white supremacy which is not a problem here, but putting foreigners first, that is what is going on - missionary christians and greedy corporate profiteers.  Not a recipe for social cohesion at all.
The Comments reflect the effectiveness of the last 40 years of brainwashing against the evils of guvmint as defined by Republicans, DINOs, Fox News, Limbaugh, Fundamentalist Christian Televangelists, corporate media, etc.  All devoted to tearing down the very fabric of the governing system to return the nation into the racist, bigoted, conservative fists of the latest Robber Barons.  Billionaire Barons washing the brains with every technological means to completely redefine the vocabulary to turn black into white and lies into truth.  Haycox wrote the best summation of historical fact in recent memory, but the blinded fascist faithful deny, deny, deny with convoluted, illogical regurgitations of their Billionaire Baron agents.  Too late for this generation.  Looks like another Great Depression is the only event that will bring them and their progeny back to reality.  Or maybe just a Nuclear Winter.  Sad and disgusting.
So far the only person who seems to be able to rid the Catholic Church of these filthy rapists is Mother Nature. Sometimes death is such a wonderful tool.
"Religious extremism," are you serious?!  Judaism, Islam, and many Christian denominations,including but not limited to Roman Catholicism and the Orthodox Churches, reject homosexuality.
This week, our Pope, in a homily stated that gay men are not fit to be priests basically because they are feminine, he made jokes about how an old cleric was making fun of a new priest because he was examining his look in his fancy clerical garb just like a woman would.    Gender segregation is a split by gender.  Most men are married in our church, so they too have no authority.  Optional celibacy will open a flood gate to married men-which is why this priest, in the article, described that thousands of married men will jump right in, the moment the pope gives the ok -thousands in Brazil alone.  So all those women who have been leading parishes as lay ministers are gone & replaced, even if they are made deacons they have no authority.  Celibacy causes no one harm so it is not wrong & no one has to be a priest.  I have no problem with optional celibacy if we are ordaining married women too but it should not be at the cost of women.  Black men have a voice in our church.  Women do not.
Murderers don’t represent islam any more than pedophile priests represent the catholic church
All Christians, Jews and other religious denominations are angered and will retaliate every time another Muslim demand is made and honoured. This is beyond ridiculous that Muslims are allowed to force their religion down our throats. This is a very serious situation and there will be more violent attacks when our government refuses to curb this activity. Muslims can take time from their days at school to pray, yet our Lord's prayer has been dismissed as being controversial. Yes, this is going to get very ugly and could easily turn into civil war. That comment is not outrageous. Muslims have come from that very climate and they didn't leave that on the shores behind them. This is just the beginning of a rally.
Yeah, Christ wants us to discriminate against gays, and to deny them any rights.   Are you for real, R&R?
Hussein  Bagdaddy Obama  is trying to hide from us the infidels, the fact that his so called " religion of peace" is actually a religion of evil ? Try as he might, Obama can not change the fact that the gay Orlando jihadi was a Islamist Democrat, & not a Christian NRA member.
Trump and Weinstein are in the same position. Both have been accused by a large number of women of patterns of sexual harassment and abuse going back decades. Weinstein rightfully has lost his career, his reputation, his power and after the lawsuits are done presumably most of his money. No one in Hollywood will work with him again. Democratic politicians are rushing to return his donations. He is a pariah. Trump, on the other hand, somehow remains more powerful, wealthy and popular than before. He is a serial adulterer, alleged sexual abuser and thrice married former casino operator, yet to conservative evangelical voters he is a hero and a rightous man of god. His election proves once and for all that American conservative Christianity is a hypocritical farce and a sham. Weinstein's supporters rightfully condemned him when they found out what kind of monster he was, Trump's just shrug their shoulders and say "who cares as long as he puts our guy on the court."
Very Sad for us as the people who died  were Disciplined Christians and were in our Church congregation................  Killed because of a persons "STUPID" Habit, Cigarettes...........DISCUSSTING............
And Christians have been killing other Christians. Give me a break! If the problem was Muslim on Muslim violence, where would the impetus to attack the West come from?

Harper also ran a candidate that would come to your home and pee in your dishes. Doesn't mean Harper was really tolerant of that - at least for his own dishes.  At one time Harper wanted a party of Theo-Cons; all the orthodox religions of the book (Jewish, Christian, Muslim) even Orthodox Buddhist holding hands and hating progressives and gays like Baird. Baird wisely never "came out" to Canadians or his constituency; he just enjoy the benefits of all the progressives who fought for his rights.  BTW, Harper specifically attacked refugee programmes and had Kenney cut health care to vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers. My MP sent me dog whistle note asking if I approved of refugees "getting better health care" than me.
That is just nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, Purgatrix Ineptiae!  For example, for every Protestant Episcopalian or Presbyterian with a college degree and post-grad degree, making over 100,000 dollars, one can find 10 Catholics of equal income and education, according to Pew Researchers. Catholics overwhelmingly outperform Protestant America, if only owing to their size and critical mass of highly educated and wealthy adherents. Even if all Episcopalians and Presbyterians together were in the upper category, as it were, they still wouldn't equal the 8 million Catholics in the said category.  Finally, I think Sean is alluding to this segment of US Catholicism when he says without immigrants, the CC could become -- quite easily -- an upper middle class rich white church.
Margaret Wente says  . What harm do they do?  Religious freedom now means freedom from religion  . "Frankly, I don’t understand why so many secular people go berserk over religious schools, even ones that are publicly funded. What harm do they do? "  . "In Ontario, the fight against Catholic schools has turned into a crusade. People seem to think they’re a threat to our common values. They seem to think our kids will be turned into superstitious, God-struck, gay-bashing little bigots.  . "In Canada, the idea of religious freedom now means freedom from religion – and damn the consequences."  .

I am always amazed that it's devout Christians who are the most sure that their infallible god made a mistake when he created this plant. Surely they should be opposed to the criminalization of His creations.
very much so and I wonder if that may have helped get rid of the jerk in KC.  I live in Kansas, but work in KCMO and work  with many Catholics there.  most of the ones  I knew said they stopped giving as long as Finn was there and I understand there were many people who did the same.  there would be a lot of things changed if more people did that.  and they can earmark donations to be used only in the parish.  I knew some who did that as well.
Mr. Barnard references  that dreaded "gay agenda"......here's a definition: "Homosexual agenda (or gay agenda) is a term introduced by sectors of the Christian religious right (primarily in the United States) as a disparaging way to describe the advocacy of cultural acceptance and normalization of non-heterosexual orientations and relationships. The term refers to efforts to change government policies and laws on LGBT rights-related issues. Additionally, it has been used by social conservatives and others to describe alleged goals of LGBT rights activists, such as recruiting heterosexuals into what they term a "homosexual lifestyle".[1]"    IMO, the "real" gay agenda is to be no longer treated as "second-class" citizens and be able to live their lives w/o being targeted with discrimination and much worse.  I don't feel that goal is unreasonable.  As used by those right-wing Christians it's a epithet designed to force homosexuals "back into the closet where they belong!!!"   Gary Crum
This clown Bishop McElroy along with quite a few others apparently, just doesn't get it:  A Muslim's primary purpose in life to to exterminate Christians, or anyone else who doesn't think like them.  Sweden is now the rape capitol of Europe and second in the world in rapes per capita, all thanks to the Muslim invaders.  They don't think like we do.  They do not share our values.  They have no respect for women, the environment, animals, or human life.  McElroy is naive and a fool.  Hopefully Darwins principle removes him from the picture because what he preaches is cultural and religious suicide.  A war is coming over the fate of the earth - Islam or Christianity.  We all need to pick which side we want to be on and quit consorting with the enemy.
Yet call out all Muslims for the acts of a few will get you pilloried.   So why is it okay to smear an entire religion over these few idiots?  Or is this because it's okay to bash Christian sects?
Well, I guess I have to cross community supported shelters off my charity list.  If they are willing to turn away the homeless based on their genitals rather than their needs, I for one, cannot support them.  St. Vincent's does not turn away non-catholics do they?
1) There are plenty of folks formed in the pre-conciliar era who do not agree with you. I go to mass with them every sunday. That invalidates that argument. 2) No one prior to vatican 2 knew how to love God? All the catholics prior to vatican 2 had it all wrong with respect to God and worship? I would suggest that that shows an awful temerity on your part, and a lack of examination of conscience. It is massively arrogant and ignorant.
While I don't care what the Islamic State says, Trump should.  The U.S. have already been run by a confirmed absolute idiot, Bush 2. His deeds in the history books. Few of Bush 2 epic achievements are to enable the rise of power of Trump. Enabled the rise of power of the Islamic State. Enabled the current war and struggle between Christian west and Islamic middle east. Enabled the decline of Europe, the refugee mess into Europe. That's a lot for an idiot and gave the world a good idea on the state of mind of the American people.   Bush 2 is one the biggest idiots of the past 500 years. (The last one being King Philip II of Spain who launched the Spanish Armada to conquer England in 1588.)   As to Trump's place in history, we shall see. I for one wait for his first war declaration. U.S. presidents always under immense pressure by the Deep State War Machine to start a war. But with so many opportunities and enemies, where?
Nobody is refusing to serve blacks, the blind, Christians, or gay people. This is what fake news is all about. The florist in this case serves gay people all the time.
The good, bad and the ugly - so what?  "Conservative catholic" includes the fundamentalist ideologue, the pious observant and the self-serving hypocrite. Right? Where do you fit?
The Christian terrorism fueled by the nationwide televangelist tax scofflaws continues. More threat from priests and preachers in their churches than any transgendered individual relieving him/her self. Disgusting.
My opinion: all the years I have lived and traveled around America I have seen more believers of CHRIST commit more blasphemies of the Laws of that belief than I ever cared to. American's and every other nations culture always feel that the other religion was demons and devil's. Each point the finger and crown themselves as GOD's chosen. But, what I can say as a citizen of this country is that Americans have become,over last 50 odd yrs, a  bunch of sanctimonious, self-stroking, self-righteous hypocrites. Fed by false prophets called preachers who have slept with the government to get rich and social gain and with that has destroyed this nation from within. Demboski/Trump/Palin/Hillary/Bush are the trash legacy this nation has been fed through lies and to me they committed the worse treason. They called it politics as usual. No I'm not afraid of foreign terrorists. These idiots spreading hate, lies and emotional and mental blackmail scare me more.Young people are listening and watching.
"everything is a protected class now a days." Except the beleaguered white, christian male, amirite?
These Antifa hooligans are worse than nazis. I even did an interview with two of these  thugs in Chicago. They are violent terrorists  and revolutionaries who want to destroy America. http://mainestategop.blogspot.com/2016/09/coffee-with-communists.html They are pure evil.  GOALS OF ANTIFA 1. Demise of The United States sovereignty 2. Demise of capitalism 3. Demise of the bill of rights and the US constitution 4. The destruction of all whites through violence, forced sterilization or interacial marriage 5. the abolitiion of banks property rights 6. One world government 7. Demise of morals, religion, Christianity in particular and human freedoms 8. Complete domination by the state of personal life, economics and education 9. Abortion, homosexuality an absolute right on demand  Just to name a few
Having grown up Evangelical and now a normal Catholic (some would call a liberal Catholic) I can witness to the fact that most Evangelicals' supposed hatred of the things you mention above are reversed projections of how they actually feel. By the time I left the Evangelicals I hated them because they taught one thing and acted completely opposite! (For example, and to be completely snarky, my buddies and I always thought that E's would make great pornographers because they knew so much about it!)  May their association with this bigot be their final action toward becoming a footnote in Christian history.
The law needs to be repealed, what a ridiculous, sadly typical load of hooey.   And if there is no room for Christmas in Schools, there is no room for Muslim prayers.....we are a country founded on the Christian faith, not a Muslim country.
