Now this is hilarious. When you have no argument and the facts aren't on your side ad hominem attacks are what you use. BTW, facts aren't racist or bigoted. Try to ease up on your obvious biases and maybe you'll open your eyes to the truth.  The following is what makes your comment beyond hilarious. I am from a multi-racial family. We are black, white, Mexican, Jewish, et al. To top all of that off I had a family member murdered by the KKK decades ago, so unlike you, I actually have valid reasons to hate racists and Nazis.   People like you just throw out personal attacks, while having no clue about anything. Pathetic.
Is this tem necessary for your discussion?  "Schmuck", or "shmuck", in American English is a pejorative term meaning one who is stupid or foolish, or an obnoxious, contemptible or detestable person."  "In The Joys of Yiddish, Leo Rosten wrote: "Never use schmuck lightly, or in the presence of women and children", which was a common view among Jewish people who felt a connection to the language, and who still viewed it as an obscene reference to a penis.
Cultural competence says Jesus would have told them to 'go and sin no more'. Homosexuality was never accepted in Jewish or Christian teaching.  It still isn't. Neither was men or women wearing the other sexes' clothing. The Church is warned about 'wolves that come dressed as sheep', a falling away in the Last Day, and people with 'itching ears'. I am sure that once again I will be 'stoned' for my thoughts. But the liberals love to kill the messenger, because they hate the Message.
I agree...."to the extent that bishops ...used pro-life and anti gay rhetoric...."  My point with Cordileone and the conservative hierarchy and the Southern Poverty Law Center is that the Church had bonded with extremist groups that condemn "whole" segments of society as worthy of hate...and hostile efforts. Specifically...the Church has linked itself to anti gay groups relative to marriage...and now, apparently... anti Semitic groups....  The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) defines hate groups as those who deny whole classes of citizens their fundamental rights based as a "whole class" that is...ALL gays, ALL JEWS, ALL BLACKS etc are to be hated and hurt....  AND some bishops AND Trump have recertified this concept each in their own appalling way...  My Dad risked his life in the Second World War  to protect ALL these folks.....  It would appear that his Church and his political party don't honor his ....And his comrades efforts...
It's funny that the religious feel it is within their right to chide or condemn an atheist yet when we say how we feel about your belief system it's "we are being ignorant or non tolerant".    Realism is just that, being realistic.  It is not a religion so don't lump me into your category.
Perhaps the slogan should read "For then many, not the Jew". His 'friends in Hamas and Hizbollah' would be so proud!!!
Sheckles....that is very anti-Semitic You know I attend Synagogue with 3/4 of ADN's reporters, and the owner. You should show more respect to us Jews, and stop using Hebrew currency as a derogatory synonym. You must be a troll from /r thedonald....that is borderline hate speech show more appreciation for the culture and religion that brings you and your community news on a daily basis!!!
I think I heard one of the white guys yelling (between his rants about the Jews and Blacks) , " leave history alone, in fact we want that history where we could lynch the Blacks back". He was so nice about it - he said "please, let us have that history back".
I presume this is a Neo-Nazi troll.  Really, Bobby Groth, you can't really believe the Holocaust didn't occur.........can you?  Gary Crum  BTW: Your use of the term "regrettably" implies that you wish Jews, gypsies, "enemies of the state", and other "inferior" Germans had been killed by the millions..........Bobby, you can relax,  they were.  Gary Crum
I am an atheist and a historian, and yes our laws are based on Judeo-Christian values.  And whoever the guy was that thought they were based on Shria... well that guy is a nut.
This is a ridiculous amplification of a splinter group of violent radicals who got their comeuppance. They in no way reflected other than a fragment of the Jewish effort, and it could still be argued that they were a reactive force not a proactive force, reprehensible as they were. On the other hand, Gaza elected Hamas to be their governing body!
I expect a lot of  pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel remarks from progressive Canadians here so we will give you some facts.  The Palestinians in Gaza and on the West Bank are ruled by Hamas who are proxy terrorists  trained, armed, and funded by Iran.  The Islamic states will never allow the Palestinians a homeland as they are are more useful as a proxy terrorists who have vowed to destroy Israel and kill every last Jew.  The Palestinians strap munitions on their own women and children and send them out into public places to kill Jewish women and children.  And for that the Iranian government has Hamas give the family $25,000 EU dollars.
Those pharisees said Jesus was a cafeteria Jew.   I don't know why, cause  Jewish food is delicious (except that gefilte fish, oy gevalt, it's shreklekh).
I'm waiting for the SCOTUS to review the case of where a gay couple or Jewish couple go into a Muslim bakery and get refused a wedding cake. So far, no one has been suicidal enough to try.
These intolerance's are about disgust. Nazi's were disgusted by the Jews. Muslims are disgusted by infidels. In Canada many Christians are disgusted by drug users, sex before marriage, gays even free speech. Religion breeds narcissism and disgust for the 'other.' Putting people in prison because they disgust you is not much different then violence against them. Of course, we should be disgusted by genuine crimes and violence and even look at the mirror we hold up for others.
Wouldn't the world be great if we had no religion at all?  Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, etc--all a collection of stupid superstitions and archaic customs and traditions that divide people and by the very fact of the division causes suspicion, superiority, hatred and violence.  Maybe we needed religion when people couldn't understand what was in dark corners and relied on others to allay their fears, but it no longer serves any useful purpose.
Tribal preservation has not been the reason for opposing homosexual conduct for a long, long time.  If it ever was.  The Jews were not stupid; they could see a universe filled with the relationship between a thing and its proper end, and could see that males, especially, were never intended by nature or the creator to be end to end.   When the OT and Paul so fiercely condemned homosexual conduct, they were not moved primarily by tribal preservation.  That much is clear from the words of scripture itself.
“You’re a Nazi, with a Jewish background, who is gay,” said Wilshaw’s interviewer, Paraic O’Brien, evidently baffled by the contradictions. ============= How does anyone come to grips with such contradictions and such confusion? And is this the last of "new revelations" as to how he self-identifies himself or what he says he believes in?
Because that's what civilized countries do they don't just take you out in the back and shoot you sorry even though this guys a jerk we still have to be civilized on our end.  But maybe not anymore TRUMPELTHINSKIN  just named a religion (Muslim) as a problem not particular people in the religion that's exactly what Adolf Hitler did he blamed a whole religion (Jewish) not just specific people in the religion ESPECIALLY when he says he is going to save Christians. That creates a religious war  I know it's hard but try to read and comprehend history   HEY IT IS THE SAME THING
"Hatred is at the root of much of the world’s horrors"  Muslims and liberals love to excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of Christianity, Europe and America, destructive iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other.  Entrenched civil  wars between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects, ISIS , Taliban and Al Quada are the root causes of most of the wars and social chaos happening around the world today. It is a purely thankless job to try to stop Muslims from killing other Muslims, or non Muslims, or gays, or women,  or Jews, or Christians, or Buddhists or Hindus..  It is worse than anything expressed in the west, even by trolls.
Ukrainians were,  and some today still are,  anti-Semitic.   In World War 2 ,  many thousands of Ukrainians helped the Germans to  kill  six million Jews.   The fact that that Ukrainians  did not like Russians then and now  is  irrelevant.    They acquiesced to and facilitated the murder of millions of Jews.
Where? Did I miss it? Damn. Besides, are you aware that Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, and one of the most important and effective people on his transition team is Jewish?
Aung Sung Suu Kyii has only a ceremonial role in the Burmese government, she is called the 'State Counselor' -- the Burmese military runs the country for the 88% Buddhist majority who want the Rohingya (4.3% of the population) and the Christians (6.2% of the population) and the Hindus (0.5% of the population) out of the country.  If they don't leave, eventually they'll all be killed.   It's just the way it is there, it will never change. (I've been there)  The level of hatred for the Rohingya by the Buddhist majority is unbelievable.  But Burma's loss is Bangladesh's gain, becuase the Rohingya are amazingly good farmers, even with the crap land they're allowed to live on, but not ever own, in Burma.  Cheers! JBS
Because it isn't about a solution. It is about the death and destruction of the Jews. Next question.
Cassandra: Now that you are mocked in the Trudeau stories, I see that you are hanging out with your second love i.e. jew bashing
Tough luck if you are Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, Pagan, or Jew.  This is a good Hypocritical Christian Nation.
Is that list in reference to the actions of president-elect Trump...or the Catholic  church?    Isn't the fact that your own religion has acted worse than Trump a matter to ponder?  Sexually assaulting.....not women, but children.  Misogyny galore.  History of vitriol to Jews and other religions.  Rapaciously greedy?  Yes -- so much so, a protestant rev started by indignation over corrupt indulgences, that's still in full force.  NOT PAYING  TAXES!    Oh my gosh...  Priests and workers and teachers make a pittance, while Bishops live like princes in mansions.  Funny that you object so to Trump (and all Catholics who voted for him), but here you are in the RCC.    Paging Dr. Freud...
filipino psycho killer!  filipino and filipina pride!  life long filipino catholics are life long atheists.
'Islamic' terrorists, 'rght wing' 'Christians', atheistic killers, anti-abortionists, the Dallas police assassin; other than the truly mentally ill (Sandy Hook), the only commonality I see is that they all are in truth and in fact 'losers' and perceive themselves in that way.    They are trying to achieve something based on how the media will portray them after they are dead.
Jews are the worst people on the planet. They lie, cheat, and destroy entire nations. They have no boundaries, moral or ethical, when it comes to dealing with the gentiles. They only thing they worship is the almighty fiat money. Those are facts.
You can afford to be in denial.  It's unlikely some drunk redneck with a grudge will come up and shoot you for looking "foreign" (as 'foreignness' is perceived by white supremacist Americans).  And that this was a case of 'mistaken identity' because--judging from the victims' names, national origins and relatives' modes of dress--they were south Asian Hindus rather than "middle eastern" Muslims doesn't really change anything for the guy this idiot murdered.  Some of us, however, can't afford the luxury of denial.  I damned sure won't turn my back on you, if I can help it...
A few strips of bacon are far less harmful than the  things said in the mosques by impassioned Imams to the attentive Muslims who believe every word about exterminating Jews,  subjugating women,  gays and infidels
you are saying that the Jews will be responsible for a future genocide that will exterminate them.  interesting that the Globe watchdogs feels this comment is within their bounds of civility.
Some of you white folks just can't handle the fact that you benefit from a lot of rape, robbery, torture, and murder. Before Pearl Harbor the US sent a cruise liner full of Jews back to Hitler. I suppose they thought that was the Christian thing to do. All lives have never mattered in this country.
Plenty of anti-Communists sided with the Nazis ===================== And? That make them good people? Sorry, but  compatriots of her grandfather killed Jews, Russians and Poles under pretense "they fight for freedom".
You make two good points. but neither excuse the fact that :  many  Ukrainians  helped the Nazi's kill Jews, and  the  Kremlin choreographed secession of the Crimea was ultra vires   and simple state thuggery
In Turkey's case, the label 'islamist' is a pejorative description, but Western Europe and North-America are 'upholding Christian values' and Israel is under the thumb of zionist religious zealots at all levels. Pretty hypocritical, if you think of it. Seems, like 'democracy' doesn't do much for secularism, but dictatorship does, like in Syria.
And YOU can't keep defending him as if he is a paragon of virtue. In fact, he is narcissistic, ignorant, lying man. That at least one of his closest advisors is a racist and antisemite does not seem to bother you. Well, as the descendant of two of the Jewish victims of Auschwitz, it bothers me.
(((they))) are the problem, nothing changes.  Its tribal.  Open your eyes.  Its the jews, they are all jews
Too bad the UN is filled with self -elected, self-indulgent, hedonistic pedophilic gang members who have enjoyed each others company since grammar school. So I'm sure they have "many American Jews" on their side; being more interested in the size of their pocketbooks, than being the protectors of modern civilization.
No biases, thank you, just a realist.  Maybe he is biased toward Jews.  The fact is, he is ignorant and has a destructive agenda.  Can you imagine the rest of the world putting sanctions on us for destruction of the atmosphere using the Trump policies?
David Thomson and Galen Weston Sr. And all along we get told by anti-Semites and their ilk that wealth is a  Jewish attribute.
Isn't Allah the Arabic word for God? Isn't it the same God that Christians and Jews worship and defile?
Everything is a money making exercise. Or let's rather say a profit making one. Even the real Mother Teresa (not this ridiculous British Tory one) did it for heavenly profit, and was more interested in converting Hindus to Christianity than getting them out of poverty!  Whether climate change eventually proves to be completely caused by carbon emissions doesn't really matter now, because renewables are so taking over thanks to both their rapidly reducing costs and job creation potential that the momentum is unstoppable. One big bonus is that oil will now be used more cost efficiently, for plastics and other derivatives.   The best thing of all though, is that the Good Ol' Boys who voted The Chump in might finally work out what a total twåt he is.
so it was a good thing that the US and Canada rejected that ship of jewish refugees back in the 1940s??
Not true! white supremacist and ultra right-wing nationalist groups in the US and world-wide have documented their assertion that Jews are an inferior "race" and should be cleansed from their respective populations.. Radical Islamists do feel similarly...they all belong under the banner of hate groups and should be rooted out.
I'm not. Ive paid up for a 2 week holiday in Maui for me, my wife and 2 kids....and I dont plan to delay or cancel any other US trips either as I have friends in Bellingham, Seattle, DC and NYC. The USA is a lot more than just the presidency. Meanwhile the question is, is it ok for the US to ban Muslims temporarily because millions of them - while not Jihadists (although thousands are) - are Islamists and/or support Islamist goals of establishing Sharia Law everywhere...including throwing gays off building tops, establishing that a woman's testimony in court is worth only 1/2 a man's, codifying blasphemy as a criminal act....need I continue?
A "fascist" has a Jewish son-in-law?  Black members of his administration?  Supports Israel?  What am I missing here?
Regarding the practice of child sacrifice in Africa -- doesn't Christianity promote this false idea that there is a god or spirit that must be appeased with a human sacrifice? According to the Book of Hebrews 7:27, 9:26, etc., Jesus is the one and only sacrifice,  a man who offers himself as a human sacrifice to Yahweh.   But the Jews have it right, and also the Muslims, as they know Yahweh did not accept Abraham's human sacrifice of Issac, and God abhors human sacrifice, and God would never accept a human sacrifice, not even the sacrifice of a Jesus. God has no need for a human sacrifice.  A human sacrifice is an abomination. I suspect that Muslims and Jews are immune to Christianity because they know this fact about human sacrifice -- God abhors it.  Islam may be the solution to this problem of child sacrifice. Either that or adequate law enforcement
Since the trolls have shown up and are are accusing everyone they disagree with of being Nazi sympathizers, while copy/pasting their comments, I'll do the same with my response.  Now this is hilarious. When you have no argument and the facts aren't on your side ad hominem attacks are what you use. BTW, facts aren't racist or bigoted. Try to ease up on your obvious biases and maybe you'll open your eyes to the truth. The following is what makes your comment beyond hilarious. I am from a multi-racial family. We are black, white, Mexican, Jewish, et al. To top all of that off I had a family member murdered by the KKK decades ago, so unlike you, I actually have valid reasons to hate racists and Nazis. People like you just throw out personal attacks, while having no clue about anything. Pathetic.  P.S. My name is a combination of matter (as in forms of it based in science) and AK as in Alaska...you know, the state I'm in.  So much fail from the trolls
The Catholic Church doesn't allow Jews in the club.
Your not playing Brett, Ruben Reyes is playing and he played you. Surely you know the meaning of the term. . No need to get defensive about it, Ruben is a pro at manipulating people. Anyway how is whining about the misspelling the name Ruben on topic? And his bigoted white people and dumb Jews comment? What aspect of the topic exactly do those slurs address?
It's not based on their opinions..any more than a "criminal" is viewed on his or her opinions.  It's based on their ACTIONS, or inactions.  Does the opinion of an all white utopian society, elimination of "human weeds" such as "Negroes and Jews", elimination or sterilization of those in mental institutions and prisons sound like someone with a mental illness?  Because those are "opinions" of the early 20th century "progressives" who not only "opined", but acted on those...and even Hitler borrowed some of their ideas.  The loons who "opined" on the evils of drink got the 18th Amendment passed, and the federal government finally resorted to putting wood alcohol in the grain alcohol, because everything else they put in to stop people drinking was distilled out.  As a result, the US Government murdered around 10,000 people.  Opinions are fine, and widely held...everyone has one.  Evil opinions put into action however, IS a mental illness.
Richard231, you are welcome to your religious beliefs. And don't kid yourself, your atheism is a religious belief. It's not scientific. Agnosticism is the scientific stand, even Bertrand Russell admitted that.  And stop pretending you know anything about other religions when what you're doing is creating a Straw Church to knock down. If you don't like the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, try Stalinism or Maoism. They were atheistic systems that did wonders for murdering millions of people.  I cherish freedom in all its messiness. I don't take religion or science dogmatically. I find Richard Dawkins as much of a buffoon as I do Franklin Graham. Atheists aren't immune from being stupid, cruel, misogynistic or just plain silly. Indeed, they're often as arrogant as those who think God speaks to them.
"The facts are most of the consumption of deep fried food occurs in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods." Where's your evidence Harvey? Are Jews stingier? Blonds dumber? Mexicans violent rapists? I have a PhD Harvey but that's no guarantee of anything. Most of the time common sense is sufficient. When's the last time you went to a minority neighborhood to "observe the shape" of the inhabitants? Common sense says never. You don't need a PhD to look up "stereotype" Harvey.
Sometimes I wish that I was not an atheist, so the thought of Janet Reno burning in hell could give me comfort. At least I have the keen anticipation of a future South Park episode.
It's also about time that you and your parents and relatives who have settled on lands belonging to the native peoples begin to evacuate and leave just as the UN resolution demands of Jews living in the West Bank. Get moving hypocrite!
Damn John the DNC emails proved no such thing. One email showed that one staffer suggested that Sanders religion needed to be questioned since it would be in a general election and he had at various times stated he was atheist and at others a member of the Jewish faith. That suggestion was never acted on as was revealed in subsequent emails. The DNC did not rig anything about the election and there was no fraud in California or anywhere else. More people voted for Clinton by the millions than voted for Sanders and more delegates committed to Clinton than Sanders by a long, long shot even without the Supers. Bernie lost. Hillary won. Fair and square. Give it up and unite as Senator Sanders has asked you to do so that Trump will not ever even get close to the presidential office. By the way why has Bernie still not released those tax forms?
Do you see any difference between the following.  1. Canadian Taliban who go to do good in Af-Pak 2. Afghan Taliban who do good in Afghanistan 3. Pak Taliban who do good in Pakistan 4. Jewish Taliban who go to Israel to do good work in "Settlements"  All are danger to civilization as we know it.
Being a Jew means you never have the luxury of wondering, "Who wants to kill me?" You always have to wonder, "Which of all the people who want to kill me is the most immediate threat?"   Five hundred nuts marching around with tiki torches in Charlottesville are nothing compared with Hezbollah. Hezbollah is fifty thousand armed militants who get about a billion dollars a year in military aid from Iran, a country that has sworn to wipe Israel off the map, and whom Obama and the Europeans decided should have nuclear weapons soon.
I guess the marchers wearing hoods, shouting expletives about Jews and Blacks, and wearing swastikas, and doing Nazi salutes learned real well. Yes, they want to live it again - hah... the smell of burning flesh and hanging of uppity Blacks, and gassing of the Jews. That's the history they long for. If you want to keep your children ignorant by feeding them that hate, that's your prerogative. Most parents teach their children about right from wrong and you don't need a history book for that.
MUSLIM AND ISLAM DOES NOT BELONG IN THE WEST BRING IN MORE JEWS ITALIANS, GREEK , FRENCH EUROPEANS FORGET THE LEACHING MUSLIMS  ARAB TYPES
Isn't that special. Tell my Irish ancestors who were discriminated that. Tell the Italians that. Tell the Jewish that. Tell the Africans who were chained up in slave boats that. What a fool you are. And speaking of foolish, I still am amazed how cons are so easily conned by the tRump who has supported nationalized healthcare and a 14.25% "Marxist" wealth tax on decamillionaires.
Nice definition. "The irrational fear of Muslims." There is nothing irrational about fearing Muslims. Nor is there anything irrational about criticizing or disliking Islam. It is a contemptible religion that has supremacist aspirations. It promotes the hatred of, killing, taxing, converting of Jews and Infidels, it supports and encourages the killing of apostates or blasphemers and it has proven itself resistant to forces of assimilation, which stable societies require. Talk to Canadians about this again when Islam reforms. Until then, all of these Globe puff pieces remain lies and propaganda.
You should be ashamed of yourself.  The shooter was a rabid atheist.
I am not supporting Zille's thoughtless remarks, but to me the author's analogy with her tweets to colonialism that "today’s Jews benefited from scientific advances made during the Holocaust" is unsustainably idiotic.
Yeah, all that bullying done as a direct result of the bullies studying and acting out about Catholic teaching on homosexuality.  \sarc  Few if any adolescents are committing suicide because the Church teaches that homosexual acts are sinful.  Most of the men I know who are homosexual are Jewish.  If there's a common reason for boys with same-sex attraction killing themselves, it's from the realization that they are out of sync with what is an inherent understanding, along with biological and anatomical fact, that boys are supposed to be sexually attracted to girls and vice versa; and witnessing such attraction all around them.
Dude so she spelled yer name wrong get over it snowflake. Bottom line I'm Jewish and I don't appreciate the dumb jew comment. Clean up yer act.
Arab states are practicing Apartheid by de-humanizing Christians and practicing slavery of Christians in Sudan and ISIS, the model Islamic Caliphate.   Israeli Arabs and Jews have the same rights. Gaza and PA are different entities. Hamas in Gaza runs apartheid against Christians by forcing Islamic customs and forced conversions to Islam. The penalty for conversion from Islam is death.
What is the point of this opinion piece?  Islamophobia is a as great a problem as Islamic extremism? The west, while professedly anti-racist, is a seething cauldron of intolerance?  While the writer rightly condemns acts of intolerance she overlooks the bigger picture. The fact of the matter is that while many intolerant people live in Europe and North America (no one has yet found a way to idiot proof a society) those regions of the world are the most tolerant in history. The fact she quotes figures released by the Lord Mayor of London, a Muslim, suggests that religious and ethnic minorities can do quite well for themselves in the racist hell hole of modern day Britain.  Moreover, Muslim immigrants, like it or not, hail from among the most intolerant countries in the world. How are the Jewish and LGBT minorities faring in the Muslim world? I suspect that they would give their eye teeth if their countries had the level of intolerance the author complains of in the UK.
Coming from someone who has demonstrated an inability to think critically, that's just rich Scott.  The parallel, which, like a 747, appears to be way over your head, addressed your silly "follow the business license you agreed to" comment.  The baker did not refuse to sell them a cake out of the display case, he refused the offer to hire him for the sole benefit of the homosexual couple.  The license the baker agreed to was to sell items that exist to the next person wanting to purchase them, not to be compelled to enter into contracts he didn't wish to be party to for the purpose of creating something solely for the benefit of the other party.  That is analogous to the Jewish restaurant owner being compelled to cater any occasion because he caters some occasions.  The restaurant comparison you attempt is fatally flawed Scott.  It fails the most basic test of logic and reason, classes you either didn't take or failed miserably based on your offerings to date.
Larry, you and Johnny Mabry have a fixation.  But "terror" is bad, no matter the justification. Can you agree? - Sikh temple murders: religious terrorism. Shooter thought he was murdering Muslims. - Jewish center murders by a Nazi and Klan member: Thought he was murdering Jews.  Both terrorist acts based on religion of victims - that's religious terrorism.  Of course, Roof murdered 9 innocents in a church not because of their faith, but their race.  Purposeful terror based on race is no good, either.  The Planned Parenthood shooting was extremism based on faiths that demonize Planned Parenthood. Most mass shooters are unstable, but instability doesn't choose the target in a vacuum.  The Orlando shooter wasn't an Islamic extremist, he seems to have been a bisexual man tormented by that and his faith, which like many "Christian" groups, demonize homosexuality. So, unstable in part because of faith, but by what his faith did to him, not what he was supposedly doing for Allah.
And what are they murdering for? It's because the terrorists want sharia law in the whole country. They want a theocratic Islamic state. Atheists and secularists are being murdered by Islamists in Pakistan on a regular basis.
I agree with you as long as I do not know that you are Muslim or Christian, or Jew...  Keep your religion  inside your house.
Donny D'Bag is an illiterate Jewish nobody who wishes he had 1/10 of Trump's money.
It is a crime to criticize, doubt, or disagree with Islam in Islamic states.  This is blasphemy and the sentence is death. It is a crime and a sin to leave Islam. A Muslim who rejects Islam is an “apostate” and the punishment for apostasy is death (and eternal damnation in hell thereafter). Under sharia, it is forbidden for anyone to try to convert a Muslim to another religion.  When Islam is doubted or defamed in any way, Muslims should violently defend it.  Muslims consider all non-Muslims and non-Muslim culture useless and see their goal to make the whole world Muslim. Everything before Islam is jahiliyya or ignorance, of no value and should be destroyed.   Under Islam, non-Muslims must pay a large tax. Once Muslims conquer a country and convert the government to Islamic law, non-Muslims have the choice to convert or die. However, Christians, Jews, and some Zoroastrians have the choice between becoming Muslim or becoming a dhimmi.   Read Bat Ye'or's publication Eurabia.
Bring some more muslim scum in so we get our people killed...Let's be integrated with sand crawlin goat humpers..Read the trashy Qu'ran, folks, for Yourselves..It says to kill jews and infidels ,,read it till ya get it.
Oh WE’RE divisive?? LOL What we’re they saying in Charlotte last month? “Jews will not replace us”??  Because they’re not into divisive identity politics.  Give your head a shake
As a Christian, think we both agree radical religious terrorists are a blight at best and our world would be a much better place if they didn't exist.  Sadly for any people of faith (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, etc), our hearts are heavy when people justify horrific actions in the name of their faith, twisting the beliefs as they act counter to what mainstream believers hold as most important.  There will always be those who are on the fringe or have crossed over into mental illness.
Anyone who uses the term "hasbara" or "hasbara town"  should be ignored as this is a traditional dog whistle call for jew haters.
So all the preaching  in the mosque about extermination of Jews doesn't bother him?
The sanctimonius Saint of the News media...the back stabbing kock sucker , Jew hating judenrat Carl Bernstein...hang him first...with all the other traitors!....
Yes, but Europeans can't spew vile garbage at Jews and Muslims.
folks    come on now-  this is bill maher- how soon we forget but only when we want too-  the same jewish man (ok half jewish which is full jewish in some books if your liberal enough tough but only when they want to be one for argument sake) who by the way used the word nigga on nitional tv only months ago-  and boy that helped create this mess-    now he is blaming everyone else-    now he's  telling us who the real nazis are- do they use the word niggers like he did (oops as poops he slit or i meany slipped as sipped and had too much to think again)  he still has his job-   not even a whimper from the far left-  hows that for fairness and we are stupposed to listen to them closely on matters of faith and truth-    hey if it works in israel against poor palestinions as onions i guess they figure wrong that they can pull this crap in americle dig
Serafim Saovskii, your hatred of Jews has evolved over time in its manifestations and disguises and one can see all three forms in abundance here. Read some history and maybe you'll understand a thing or two about reality. Your antisemitism is disgusting.
Atheists are the biggest trouble makers and murders in the world!  Around 200 million dead at the hands of atheists in the 20th century alone!
I see your still trying to pit one Christian group against another. Race baiting and now denomination baiting  between Catholic Christians and Baptist Christians and Jews as well. Jesus was a Jew.  Not working.  All Christians, Catholics and Baptists have been the victims of persecution and still are by hate groups here and  all over the world.  Isis executes Christians almost as fast as the old Roman empire did. In many countries throughout the world, to be a Christian is to be marked   for certain death. .   Race baiting is   racism. A very subtle but ugly form.
Very very easy to see through the hypocrisy of this action.   Saudi Arabia wants to limit Iran's ability to be a power while deflecting from the fact they (Saudi) are the biggest sponsors of terrorism in the Middle East.  Also the biggest human rights abusers outside of Israel.   The Muslim Brotherhood questions the hereditary royal line of Saudi Arabia and Qatar supports the Muslim Brotherhood.  Seems to me the royal line of Saudi Arabia need not be questioned but simply done away with.      What really needs to be noticed is that any country with Shia majorities (Iraq) or ones that are not hostile to Iran (Syria) seem to have wars perpetuated by the west as a way to de-stabilize the region at the behest of the house of Saud.     Egypt democratically elects the Muslim Brotherhood and the USA backs a coup to install the half Jewish/half Egyptian military leader to run the country.   Hypocrites all the way around.     Canada needs to end all involvement in the ME.
Step 1. Ban Muslims -- omit Jews.  Step 2. Recognize Christianity as the state religion.  Step 3. Ban certain sects of Christianity.   Ladies and gentlemen, in the not-so-long term the Papists are going to be on the condemned list.  We best speak up for our non-Christian brothers and sisters now. The cardinals, bishops, and priests need to be way out in front of this. The Catholic laity needs be close behind.  Unfortunately, I don't have much faith in the clerics.
Craig Stevaux - You've got it all wrong like the rest of your sad ilk.  Even Christians, Jews and atheists from those countries would be temporarily banned just like the Muslims.  Try reading the regulation and quite promoting a lie.  Typical!
Your attempt to forge moral equivalency here is repugnant. There were no decent people marching with the Nazis and Klan. It was a racist demonstration at the organizational level and in its purpose. No matter what the cause, decent people do not make common cause with swastika-bearing Nazis and white-robed Klansmen chanting "Jews will not replace us." Any cause that is joined to that radically evil demonstration is poisoned by it, and anyone who champions any respectable cause -- including motherhood and apple pie -- would run away from, not march with, the Nazis and Klan. There were no decent people marching with them. The counter demonstration was not organized by antifa. Far from welcoming the violence, the organizers of the counter demonstration repudiated it; the suggestion of moral equivalency between the two groups, their messages or their methods is disgusting. We must reject the president's moral blindness; and, overwhelmingly, most people seem to do so.
As a one more, Where do the souls of McConnells and his ilk's supporters, go when they die? Do they go to their white mans heaven? Or hell? I recall that their white mans jesus was a refugee fleeing a guaranteed death from a propped up Roman Empire despot, who was no different than the double digit despots we prop up worldwide, for the same colonial reasons the Imperial Roman Empire did. I recall that the Jewish priests had the Romans kill the jesus, for messing up their corruption, no different than the Vatican being built off the backs of hundreds of millions slaughtered Natives through the centuries. Yah,I would say that McConnell, his ilk,and their supporters are on a one way ticket to their Christian hell, no different than the Islamic terrorists created by McConnell and his republican and democrat cronies, are on their ways to their Islamic hells, without their 72 virgins, for slaughtering so many thousands of innocents
You're saying your god doesn't believe in abortion? Really? Read the old testament. He orders his minions to kill every man, woman (including pregnant ones) and child (except for the virgin girls!) so many times. He's a psycho. He made homosexuality because to christians he made us all.  In the new testament Jesus does not follow the old rules. Remember an eye for an eye? He changed it to turn the other cheek. Jews stoned people but Jesus didn't. He actually stopped a stoning. Telling them those without sin can continue to stone her.  I'd suggest you read how the bible was put together and when. I did that after Prevo start thumping his bible to keep gay discrimination going. I keep meaning to thank him for helping me become an athiest.
My optimism is based on the huge volte-face in church teaching on Judaism effected in Nostra aetate #4. Not that I expect to see the same volte-face for gays in my lifetime, -- but maybe in yours.
Let's build a theme park on Temple Mount. It will create jobs. Who cares about what jews and muslims think.
A true Atheist just looks at all religion as make believe nonsense.  That's because it is.  Why do we discuss religion at all?  Because unfortunately we have to share a planet with a bunch of lunatics that believe in sky fairies and that will even kill people because of this belief system.  These people that believe in this nonsense seem to think they have a right to disrupt all the other people on the planet with their foolishness.  I have a problem with that.  I am perfectly willing to let these people believe in their sky fairy as long as they don't infringe on me.  They haven't fulfilled their part of the bargain.
I'm not surprised. Is he even gay? I mean, we have to take his word for it. And does he have a Jewish grandmother, or is that fiction?  He is so full of hate for women, gays, Jews, Muslims, liberals, blacks, and others, that it didn't make sense that he claimed to be gay and part-Jewish. Now, pedophile makes sense.   The alt-Right often confuse pedophilia with homosexuality when they are, in fact, unrelated. Was Milo abused at 13? That would make sense. But then he should be in therapy and not lashing out.  Then again, that's the cycle of abuse. The abused becomes the abuser. Milo thinks he's being strong by spewing hatred of women, gays, Jews, Muslims, blacks and others. He's just compensating for his own lack of self-worth.
The way some of you throw around calling people racist, Nazi sympathizer a is pathetic. You have no argument so you deflect and try to falsely label people.   Again, I'm from a multi-racial family with black, white, Mexican, Jewish, et al members. And unlike you I have actually had someone in my family murdered by the KKK.   According to your logic I am racist and anti-Semitic against myself and family. Do you see how ignorant your comment is now? Probably not because you don't deal in reality, only wishful thinking and willful ignorance of said reality.
It's controversy, provoked for the purpose by Coulter.  She thrives on it.  Why else do you think she says things like this: "Last year , during a Twitter rant about Republican candidates trying to pander to Jewish voters by focusing on the topic of Israel, she asked ‘how many f***ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States?’"  Headlines keeping her speaking price high, nothing more.
She supports abortion, reason enough to reject her. Trump gave up control of his assets and isn't accepting a salary as president so exactly how does that make him greedy? And gee, when did you become anointed of God to proclaim a man an atheist  and judge him as a cheating liar when he himself proclaims to be Christian. Leviticus 19:16 "You shall not go around as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not stand up against the life of your neighbor: I am the Lord". I'll pray for you even if you aren't a Christian yourself, which I suspect otherwise you wouldn't have put up such an idiotic post.
The little girl with the sign also believes that homosexuals must be killed, Israel and Jews  must be  eradicated, Christians can have their heads cut off, and women including herself are the property of men who may  beat them.  Ain't she sweet?
The fact that soooooo many 'christians' exist to be able to elect this waste of human skin is really a verdict on all org religions.  There were plenty of NY/east coast Jews that voted for this criminal.  Spread that blame around ...   My Atheism stands tall in these modern times.  Morally, there would be NO WAY i'd vote for such a horrible human being.
One wishes that those who support "Anti-Muslim hatred has no place in my Canada"  also support and speak up "Anti-CHRISTIAN and JEWISH  hatred has no place in my MIDDLE EAST"  just to be fair
everytime i point out hate speech - my comment gets removed. and, this "Bobby Groth"  poster spews white supremacist rants and puts up white supremacists symbols for targeting Jews for harassment etc and goes unremoved.        this is a pretty special community...newspaper and commenting forum.
This proposal by the orange Pillsbury boy to our south is offensive, yes, also so ridiculous as to be unworkable.  How, precisely, is any security screening to determine who is Muslim and who is Christian?  He's not offering refuge to Jews under persecution?  What's with that?  It is not possible to tell if someone is Christian or Muslim by simply looking at them. There are many Lebanese Christians (Danny Thomas and Jamie Farr are two of many examples of Christian Lebanese Americans).  One can't even tell within North America who is a Christian and who is not.  Many sincere Christians do not attend an organized church because they find many to be businesses more interested in securing their financial bottom line than in helping people to connect with God.  Perhaps Trump and some of his fellow Republicans in the Senate and in the House consider themselves to be Christians? Actively seeking to withhold access to quality healthcare based on income is NOT consistent with Jesus' teachings.
Self-hating liberal Jew - a stain on his brethren and his country.
Check your Constitution and Supreme Court rulings.  "..founded based on Judeo-Christian principles..." is just the continuous lie thrown out in every forum by the fundamentalist christian horde.
Eloisa, is it not that the name "Reuben" is Jewish which is far different that Ruben, a Spanish name.  I believe that it is a common mistake by those who have little knowledge of people outside White society to mistake Ruben a Spanish name for "Reuben" a Jewish name. The tenor of you comment, Eloisa, that  you inserted  in my discussion with Brett seems to me comes from racial discrimination - "are you taking a class in high school" - meaning an uneducated Jew.
If and when the U.S.A. and it allies ever get rid of Daesh (ISIS/IL), will they then go after and eliminate all the Muslim groups, like Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, the Taliban, al Qaeda, Abu Sayyaf, Boko Haram, al Shabaab, etc. and all the other groups of Muslims in many countries around the world , that want to destroy Jews, Christians and non believers?
We all know the jew'ish' people are NOT the Hebrew or even Hebrew-Israelites.  They are Yiddish speakers and european decent.  Its all over the internet.  Why are we still talking about these imposters?  The state-of-israel was created back in 1947-48 and we have been dealing with their soul-less extermination of Palestinian's of all ages.  Being Jew'ish' is the same as being a christian these days:  the rest of us know its a sham-religion-man-made for a certain reason to present LIES TO THE WORLD and cover up who the REAL ISRAELITES ARE!
That's rich (as in: YUGELY hypocrite) coming from someone who's hero is a FAT dude who loves a mob shouting "Jews will not replace us!" Oh, he doesn't love them? Took him several days to denounce them, a clear signal he highly approves of them. Worked in the campaign, works now
It is odd how the bad things about a person get so glossed over, and we look at them through rose-colored glasses after death.   Ali was a bigot.  He looked down on white people and Christians.  The radical Malcolm X himself converted him to follow the Nation of Islam, which is a well recognized hate group with strong antisemitism, and gave him his name of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.  And he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: "I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough"  And he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam "a white man's war", and said that "My enemy is the white people!"    Other quotes from Ali: "All Jews and gentiles are devils",  "The sins of drinking, smoking, prostitution, homosexuality, stealing, gambling: It all comes from white people."
The only thing that is embarrassing is the omnipotence of your replies.  For a man that says he is Christian, you might try a little Buddhist humility.
Goldberg needs to take a look at what he believes. The current GOP is little more than a white identity death cult. His Jewish white privilege has always been conditional. He and the rest of Jews of all stripes can be thrown under the bus. Complaining about Democrats chasing their tails doesn't protect the Jews. The Trump voters have revenge in mind. Talk to Steve Bannon to get the details.
No but I was on the rebel media! 24.9 million views last month and growing spread the word.  Nothing wrong with calling out the G&M for what it is.  If you are Jewish, part of the LGBTQ community, a white female you have major concerns about Islam and sharia.  Rotterdam anyone? Maybe you are in favor of young girls getting gang raped but I can tell you, most of us are not!
Ummm... I think we got our wires crossed somewhere. When I referenced his private affairs I meant his home and marriage etc. If Dean doesn't want to marry a black woman, disowns a gay son, or wont let a Jew in his home that's his business. If Dean wants to block certain people from public accommodations like pools or restrooms or refuse service to someone because they belong to a minority group he dislikes then no, he no longer gets to claim a right to free association and the courts should absolutely step in.
More often it's Jews looking for more victim hood.
NUKE the Rothschild-Bauer FORCED occupation of Israel. Talmudic infant killing blood drinking Jews created the Democrat, Socialist, Communist, and Liberal all to destabilise nations. Now we have Jew funded factions like Antifa'g popping up all over America. The Jews primary enemy has become the Moslem! Jews demoralised America over the last 100 years with Satanic Qabalist Hollywood. They RAPE our children. Their music "industry" screams modern slavery. Besides this TRUTH.... Why fight JEW Battles? Whites and Blacks usually get along... The Crypto-Jews ran the transatlantic slave trade. So why are White non-slave owner Americans in 2017 under attack? One answer.... Devious Evil JEWS.  Don't be fooled.... I am a Jewish anti-semite. I like being an anti-semite. When you study Jewish history for 47 years like I have you KNOW damn well who the enemy of humanity is. I am Judeo-Christian. I am on the right side. All blessings be to Jesus Christ and G🕍d!! #AmericaFirst #SimonOfTrentsRevenge
You are aware that non religious atheist/communist leaders like hitler, stalin, lenin, Kmer rouge, castro and a slew of other alt lefties are responsible for the murder of around 200 million people in the 20th century alone right?  Yea but it's only religion that breeds hatred?
1. Jews are not Semites.  David does NOT speak against Jews, nor Semites. So the B'nai Brith is barking up the wrong tree here. 2. David refers specifically to POLITICAL ZIONISM, which is not Jewish, it just CLAIMS to be Jewish in order to ACCUSE those who point out political Zionism (criminals) as RACIST and HATE SPEECH.  Facts are NOT HATE.  They are facts. 3. He DOES NOT DENY the holocaust, period. He never has. 4. David claims REPTILIANS as he was misdirected through MIND CONTROL subjects (Arizona Wilder), Credo Mutwa (Fables and stories and legends, which are NOT FACT), and Ancient sites worldwide (reptilian artifacts were METAPHORES, and not literal physical entities).  David is incorrect in his REPTILIAN self-misdirection (too bad), and his "metaphysics" is up for grabs, but EVERYTHING ELSE is SPOT ON CORRECT (agencies and intelligencia information).  There is no Hate Speech whatsoever when it comes to David. This is just a self-interest and disinfo campaign by Aiden Fishman.
robert reich is a sawed off stubby with an inferior complex that is a mile deep he is what the DNC palms off as an intellectual reich is a pig-me-me-me as the Jews would say - unclean goes bone deep
It isn't though, you're being duped.   The alt-left is a violent anti-conservative movement. They beat people with bats who showed up to see a gay, Jewish conservative speaker speak at college campuses. You're being duped.
Hamas' founding charter calls for the annihilation of the Jewish State. Abbas has no control over them whatsoever. Negotiating with him is a fool's errand.
Well, Islam, Christianity and Hinduism all believe in invisible beings who never, ever show themselves and who apparently have super powers used to direct some sort of a petri dish experiment here on earth. Try raising that idea in any arena other than religion and 'lunatic' is precisely the word that gets applied. I don't see why religion gets a pass, but it does. In terms of 'infringement' I again go to the simple question...when was the last time an atheist was knocking at your door trying to convert you?
John, basically your claim is that the Catholic Church is homophobic, that orthodox Jews are homophobic, and that Muslims are homophobic.  That seems to support a couple of conclusions:  you're intolerant, you're a heterophobe.  If the shoe fits, wear it.
We accommodate Mennonites and Hutterites  in Western Canada. Public school Teachers have to go to the colonies to teach. Mennonite men will not serve in the Canadian military even if drafted due to their religious beliefs. What message does that send to society?  Violent Christians such as Timothy McVeigh bomb government buildings in the US killing children, and Christian activists threaten and occasionally do shoot doctors performing abortions. No apologies from the Christian community for these nut bars... Zionist settler extremists in Israel assassinated Yitzak Rabine for pursuing peace on the West Bank.  Point is Islam is certainly not the only Abrahamic religion with violent and extreme members who twist faith into something awful.   It would seem to an outside observer that the "guise of religious freedom" in Canada  is somehow only to be applied to accommodate Christians and Jews and not others.
You should be ashamed of yourself Mr. Toben. That you would say "Germans never used homicidal gas chambers during WW2--never gassed anybody".    ( Though I guess its not the gas per se that was homicidal...it was the German Facists and their allies and collaborators who were homicidal.  But I dont think that was your point. )  The evidence that millions of innocent jewish people and tens  of thousands of others were murdered by poison gas is overwhelming.  Many of the innocent victims were children and virtually all were defenceless.   The Commandant of Auchwitz Hoess, in a written deposition of hundreds of pages,  admitted to murder by gas chamber  at the Nuremberg trials..  Kurt Stangl, the Commandant of Treblinka  admitted that gas was used to murder hundreds of thousands of jews and others.   You should be ashamed of yourself. I hope  someone will sue you . You are speading untruths, you are promoting hatred.  You are clearly a fool. But a dangerous one.
could of bot the homeless jew downtown a house with that money....but he wanted to be a big shot
Agreed that they are dead wrong on settlements and I would like your post except for the implicit assumption that all Palestinians are terrorists which is absurd. There are Israeli Jewish terrorists too but that doesn't mean that Israelis are terrorists.
Again with the hateful, dishonest and cowardly comment, from a real hater!!  You're either a complete moron, Islamist in disguise, as many of these terrorist cowards are-hiding in populated areas, hiding behind women/children, hiding in Mosques, hiding in burkas, etc.  It's radical Muslims gunning down everyone, not Christians, Jews, Hindus, etc, FACT!  And too many, possibly ones like you, are quick to challenge others for being at fault; knowing all to well for you to stand as an honorable man and openly denounce these radical atrocities would "surely"  get your little liberal snowflake butt in a whole world of trouble!!  Stand up and be counted and see who really shoots you in the back!!!   And all you do is rattle off your in-tolerant and dishonest opinion; you have to because, while you may shout down my comments you're not able to refute my statements. Because all you have, is how you lived there, so what!!
Yeah. A psychotic ATHEIST attacks a church. Just a place....like a dispensary....coincidence.
To dismiss "conspiracy theories" is to assume there are no conspiracies.  This is a conspiracy, and the bankers are a part of it.  Some of them happened to be Jews, but most Jews aren't bankers.  Read "The Creature from Jeckyl Island" before you dismiss the idea.  But no, welfare moms are the useful idiots in the master plan.  They're paid well to be reliable voters.
Facebook Allowed Advertisers To Target ‘Jew Haters’.png   Today, ProPublica published a bombshell report showing how Facebook allowed advertisers to select anti-semitic categories to target certain users. Facebook apparently has ad categories such as:  *Jew Hater *How to burn Jews *History of why Jews ruin the world  Really.    Well, if you are trying to target groups of Nazis, White Nationalists or just super angry white guys who want to dress in matching polos and khakis while carrying tiki torches, you may want to select these categories. And Facebook is totally there for you!  At the end of the day, Facebook is a business and their product is YOU, the user. They will take any money they can from advertisers, because that is their business - selling access to you. So if you are a Nazi, they will market that. And to the right company/group/political candidate/hostile foreign government working on behalf of a political candidate, that is what they are looking for - Nazis.
Liberals daily and for years have shown their superiority over others.  You believe blacks are too stupid to achieve a college degree unless you help them with affirmative action.  And do try to follow the news.  I doubt it got by you that some parents won't let the gender be put on the birth certificate because they haven't decided on the gender.  Being a former Jewish agnostic, it doesn't bother you that Christianity is under assault.  And even though neither you nor I feel under assault, you can't deny that we are accused for all the world's ills.  Gays should be treated like everyone else because it's right.  Gays can purchase any pre made cake they want at Masterpiece Bakery because it's right.
Do you mean that you support Trump and Sessions knowing that they might limit or take away my rights? Wasn't that what the German people did in 1933 when they voted for Hitler and the NSDAP? Hitler used the Jews as scapegoats for all the problems that Germany had at that time and took away their rights and properties. So yes, Trump and Sessions are the faces of fascism, Sessions being a known racist. It is not the liberals and Democrats who are fascists. They prefer social democracy like what most of Europe has and it is opposite of fascism. I know that conservatives try to pin the fascist label on the liberals but they are either ignorant or disingenuous.
People where burnt at the stake by Christians for saying the world was round, and are still put to death today for being atheists in Islamic countries. Religion is the curse on humanity. That is why I'm agnostic...because I can't have a relationship with God when it's interfered with by, hardliners that take a 2000 year old fairytale literally, that goes for Christianity and Islam. One can have a relationship with God without all that ballony.
I have yet to see a Christian or Jewish terrorist strap a bomb to himself and blow up innocent children.  I agree not all Muslims are terrorists. But almost all the terrorists do seem to be Muslim. Coincidence? I don't think so. It is clearly religiously inspired terrorism.
The title says "In aftermath of Berlin Christmas market attack, Germany’s resilience tested".   That wasn't the first attack on innocent civilians by a follower of Islam in Germany. Millions of Muslims have swarmed into Germany and Muslims have attacked Germans before.  And,  in other European countries like Netherlands, Belgium, France. etc.,  there have been more attacks than ever by Muslims. It seems the more Muslims the greater the possibility of threats or attacks on innocent,  civilian non believers.  People in Europe are nervous. Security is high and police are everywhere. What a way to live.  By the way, what is it that inspires, incites and leads some Muslims to threaten or to try to attack or to attack, maim and kill innocent, civilian non believers.?  Where do some Muslims get the idea they must attack, maim and kill innocent, civilian non believers.?
Israeli press suppression behaviour should be publically denounced by all Jews. Israeli right-wing nationalist are now operating as the Fascist of old.
On Saturday we saw a car driving on 36th that had been spray painted with a huge Jewish star on the side of it.  Jew's definitely need to stop stealing Palestinian land, but that crap has no place here.  The very idea of the United States of America is one devoid of Nazi's an Terrorist's. ......  Run and die Terrorist and Nazi scum !!!!!!!!!
So you post from Breitbart a known anti-semite alt-right hang out. You tell us to not be reactionary but you are literally posting things from the an anti-semite website.  So yeah, I am not going to trust a alt-right anti-semite website to tell me that racial terrorism is a hoax.  "In December, the NYPD said it witnessed “a huge spike” in hate crimes following the election of President Donald Trump, with the majority of incidents directed at Jews."  "Also, three separate strings of bomb threats have targeted Jewish community centers across the country."  From news articles about Jewish people being targeted.   Care to refute or am I just being reactionary?
A jewish nazi?  A rare bird indeed.
Kayden, religion has nothing to do with this. Hinduphobia- no it's cult and self seeking power hungry crooks like your man Butler that jump on the religious wagon who have no qualms about lying and cheating their way up the political ladder.  In Tulsi Gabbard's case, her guru has taken advantage of her cult beliefs she was born into and abused the fact that she is beholden to him. As he says when he initiates his disciples, you are now mine and I will instruct you how you can serve ME. Fanaticism not religion.  Cry yourself silly with all your talk on religious bigotry, homophobic backed support, Hillary Clinton money, and whatever else you can lash out with.  How about all the other religions, I don't see Tulsi and Butler supporting them. In fact she down right degrades the Muslims. Butler has always spoken very unkindly of Gays, Blacks, Muslims Christians and Jews.  Beware Hawaii, Tulsi and anyone who adheres to him, has no place in our democratic system.
but, but, but...  he is a good Catholic!  he and Cardinal Burke are good friends and agree about the evil Muslims!      https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/world/europe/vatican-steve-bannon-pope-francis.html
"If Donald Trump is the Next Hitler then I am joining his SS to put an end to Monotheist Question. All Zionist Jews, All Christians who do not follow Christ's teaching of Love, Charity, and Forgiveness And All Jihadi Muslims are going to Madagascar or the Ovens/FEMA Camps!!! Does this make me a fascist!!!" --Jeremy Christian
Still ignorant Qbcoach15 must be all those Traumatic Brain Injuries.  Muslim Culture (do not prove your ignorance by saying "Religion") is a Culture of War.    Mohammad unified the Waring Tribes that were killing themselves, into Large Armies, his Armies were conquering "the Known World".  His large Armies had a Severe Logistics Problem, Mohammad then wrote the Holy Koran making it Law for All Nations to provide Food, Clothing, Support, Money to the Armies, and that All Must Join the Jihad without any excuses.  109 Suras of the 114 Suras of the Holy Koran are the Declared War Against Christians, Jews, Unbelievers.  The 5 Suras state that Peace will be achieved when all Christians, Jews, Unbelievers are Subjugated to Islam.  The Holy Celebration of Ramadan is the Muslim Celebration of the Defeats and Massacres of the Christians, Jews, Unbelievers.  Ramadan Fasting represents the Muslims getting up before dawn eating and drinking then going into Combat without food and water.  continued
How many Canadians would welcome to Canada German Nazis , who teach their children  to hate Jews and to kill homosexuals.s ?  Muslims  teach their children to hate Jews and to kill homosexuals. and we are told to accept their cultural values. because that is good.
What tribal hasbara is this?  You're either truly a "McFool" or you are intentionally spreading Zionist propaganda. The reality is democracy for Israeli Jews, discrimination for Palestinian citizens of Israel, and apartheid for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
I have not asked for "tolerance" to MY religion. You are wrong about the spelling of mo. It has been rendered in English in several ways. Insulting Christianity with "fairy tales" and false interpretations of what Christianity consists of is insulting Christianity. You insulted Christianity. I just pointed out the flaws in your history and interpretations. If you are muslim, and are "consistent" with the core beliefs as expressed in the Qu'ran, YOU hate Christians and Jews and atheists and esp homosexuals and condemn them to death. Otherwise, you have no scholarship with which to insult Christianity and support islam.
John, basically your claim is that Catholics are homophobic, that orthodox Jews are homophobic, and that Muslims are homophobic.  That seems to support a couple of conclusions: you're intolerant, you're a heterophobe.
What we have here is a baker who wishes to practice discrimination against gays, and he wants to claim that his "Christian" religion supports him. He is doing EXACTLY the same thing that racists in the days of Jim Crow did in refusing to serve blacks.   I am vehement on this subject because I have a personal interest. My brother is gay, as are some of my closest friends. My mother's parents and other members of my family were killed by the Nazis because they were Jews. My daughter-in-law is African-American, and her grandfather was telling me about life under Jim Crow, stories that I believe explicitly. I have been raised to hate discrimination with all my strength, and I know what happens if it is allowed to go unchecked. It starts with "No Dogs Or Jews" and ends with Treblinka.  In places like Chechnya, gays are imprisoned and killed. The Republican US Senate nominee from Alabama, Roy Moore, wants to do the same thing here. At least some people here seem to have no problem with it.
And, I believe Trumps condemnation also includes the blacks, the liberal students, and many conservatives who don't appreciate the angry white people outfitted in riot gear and weapons, promoting their hate for groups of people based on their color or religion.  Many American's of all race's have lost their lives fighting against this type of hate. And MAGA refers to what and when? When was America greater than today? Before blacks had the vote, or had rights? When Jews were rounded up and gassed? I would like to think America is greater now than it ever has been, but as of last November, I'm not so sure.
The article says "At least 44 people were killed in Egypt in bomb attacks at the cathedral of the Coptic Pope and another church on Palm Sunday, prompting anger and fear among Christians and leading to troop deployments and the declaration of a three-month state of emergency".  Muslims in Egypt have attacked Christians and their churches before.  And Muslims have attacked Christians and burned their churches in Pakistan.  I don't think the Christians in Egypt and Pakistan are attacking Muslims in Iraq or Syria and I don't think they are attacking Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslims so why would Muslims attack Christians in Egypt and Pakistan? That doesn't seem very tolerant.   If Muslims aren't following the verses in the Qur'an that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers, why are Muslims attacking Coptic Christians in Egypt and why are Muslims attacking Christians and burning their churches in Pakistan?  Please explain the reason.
Yep! Criticize a black, gay, Jew , male, female, immigrant, certain illegal immigrant and you are racist, sexist, homaphobic, anti Semitic, xenophobic. I apologize if I missed someone.
Unsurprising how DFL is adverse to science and progressive principles. Unsurprising how they are hypocritically willing to subvert justice and fairness in order to achieve their goals. Unsurprising, because Christians have, throughout history, always been antiscience, always anti-progression, always been hypocritical, and always been willing to do despicable things to protect the status quo. They have always been on the wring side of history.  As an atheist, I'm tired of this. I'm supposed to leave them to their superstitions, but they think its fine to dictate to everyone about who we date,  whether we can have premarital sex, what a woman must do with her body, what substances we can ingest, what day of the week we can buy alcohol, etc, etc, etc (etc for days...I could go for days). If Christians think I'm being unfair, then they need to take an active stand against the interference of their faith in the lives of those who don't subscribe to their belief system. Enough!
Don't forget the Armenia holocaust of 1 million Christians by peaceful muslims and that six million number has been officially revised by the Holocaust authorities themselves. Let's talk about the Jihad against Indians shall we, Koenard Elst in Negationism in India gives an estimate of 80 million Hindus killed in the total jihad against India and let's not forget why the Crusades happened! It was because of 400 years of islamic barbarism, Can we forget how Mohammed thanked the Jews who helped him in Medina? He killed them, chopped off their heads. Some prophet, killing God's chosen and those Nazi's weren't Christians! It is also estimated that Over 110 Million Blacks were killed by Islam. So Christians can hardly be considered the biggest mass murderers, it isn't any surprise who really are the biggest mass murderers in history, estimated at a whopping 250 million and that is muslims.
The draft dodger in chief speaking to his cracker peeps in Alabama, where his racist rants always get big applause.  What a piece of crap.  So, the Idiot Emperor says a player taking a knee is a “son of a bit*h”, but Neo-Nazis and KKK marching with torches, chanting “Jews will not replace us” are “nice guys”. Tells you all you need to know.
Yeah, socialists want to exterminate Jews, like that Jewish guy Bernie wants to do.  I'd say the level of ignorance and lack of education is comical, except it's so detrimental to our country. Read a book sometime.
I for one am sick and tired of the racist and bigot cards just because you don’t like a a person or group.  I work with Muslim’s, Jews , Hindus and just about everything in between and what they do is there own business. What I do care about is how pathetic politicians have become in the last decade jumping on any band wagon to get a few votes. For example take bill 24 that the NDP are about to pass,they hid behind the LGBTQ to justify it and yet all it does is take away parental rights. What parent or relative of a child would drop them off at a place where they would never know what is happening behind those closed doors. If your child was having thoughts about hurting themselves you would never know because the teachers are bound by an unconstitutional law that’s says they can’t tell you. When government goes after childern and bullies people at the same time they say they are trying to stop bullying.its time for Canadians to wake up and remind MLA’s who the boss.
Living thorough the Khalistan movement in Punjab , for over 15yrs, it’s not pretty when Sikh terrorists come to your neighbourhood and kill people just because It’s Hindu dominated. Mr Singh is not clarifying because it could also alienate Hindu voters in the big cities.  Long gone are the days when sunny ways could get you into office . People are getting sick of Trudeau and his unending need for taxpayer$$$ to support his spending.
Hubert writes:  "many Ukrainians helped the Nazi's kill Jews"  As did Russians:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_collaborationism_with_the_Axis_powers   http://www.feldgrau.com/WW2-German-Wehrmacht-Russian-Volunteers   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S._Sturmbrigade_R.O.N.A. .  There were collaborationists among many of the nations invaded by Nazi Germany.  In the case of Ukraine, one must remember that Ukrainians' memories, in 1939, of the rule from Moscow included the Soviet genocide against Ukrainians in 1932-33 in which millions of Ukrainians were intentionally starved to death.  Based on that experience, the Germans probably looked less dangerous than the Soviets.  .
So what if muslims become the majority?  Anybody who knows any muslims knows they are little different from any other religion or culture.     How often have you heard the muslim community balk at usury?  Almost never, and its too bad.  Personally I think we ought to subscribe to that jewish and christian notion of forgiving debts every seven years.  But what can you do?      It practically goes without saying that in a century Canada won't be predominantly white.  So what?  I lived in Waterloo where some streets by the university are in chinese. So what?
"B'nai Brith Canada spokesman Daniel Koren said in an interview the posters seek to embolden white supremacists.  "The posters included coded signs and messages to people in underground movements who espouse hatred against Jewish people and others, he said.  "When you're promoting imagery that says to people who understand what it means — Jews will not replace us — and all those connotations, especially given recent neo-Nazi rallies, yes, I would say definitely the work of white supremacists," Koren said."  All grist for Mel's "satire."
Nice try! False equivalency.   First, what is "alt-left" except a made-up term by those desperate for excuses for the alt-right.   Second, funny, but I haven't heard "lefties" suggest that segments of the population -- namely, African Americans, Jews, Muslims, oh, and women -- need to be exterminated or segregated.   The only thing that decent Americans want segregated is The Orange Creature, which needs to be caged and periodically tarred and feathered.
Christian, Jew and Muslims are always fighting. Canada should have no part in it or them.
Jesus was a Jew, followed Jewish law, was called Rabbi (teacher), and founded Christianity. He didn't have to say anything about homosexuality or abortion, because He was a practicing Jew. Neither were acceptable, and anyone that has spent any time reading the Bible would know so. Please, read before you write your nonsense and confuse the foolish.
We don't 'respect' Orthodox Jews OR Amish (or Muslims, for that matter). We respect their RIGHT to be as ridiculous as they want to be in their private lives. There are no Hasidim or Amish in American politics and precious few observant Muslims. If there were, they would not get a pass for asserting their 'morals' in the course of their public duties, and neither should Pence or any of his ilk.
And I feel you've missed an important one as well, Jeffrey. While the actions of both groups may have left something to be desired, **ONE GROUP WAS FULL OF NAZIS.**  I don't honestly care a lick if the antifa or alt-left or whatever were yelling obscenities or waving bats or whatever, because the other group literally want to put Jews and homosexuals into f******g ovens. That fact tilts the scale so far to one side that any kind of "both sides" comment is wrong from the very start.
Let admit the truth   Koran verses  1.“Kill the unbelievers wherever you find them.” Koran2:191  2.“Make war on the infidels(nonbelieversof Islam) living in your neighbourhood.”Koran9:123  3.“When opportunity arises, kill theinfidels(non believers of Islam) wherever you catch them.” Koran 9:5  4.“Any religion other than Islam is not acceptable.” Koran3:85  5.“TheJews and the Christians areperverts;fight them.”… Koran 9:30  6.“Kill people who criticizeallah or do mischief ( wage war against allah )” Koran 5:33  7.“Allah will Punish the unbelievers withgarments of fire,hooked iron rods, boiling water;melt their skin and bellies.”Koran 22: 19 to 21  8.“The unbelievers are stupid; urge theMuslims to fight them.” Koran 8:65  9.“Muslims must not take the infidels(non-believers of Islam) as friends.” Koran3:28  10.“Terrorize and behead those whobelieve in scriptures other than the Qur’an.” Koran 8:12&13
Should an atheist be able to go into a Jewish Deli and ask for, demand, and sue for the right to have them prepare a ham sandwich? Should that group from that church in Kansas that parades around with hateful anti-gay signs be able to go into a gay bar by accident and receive polite and courteous treatment and service? Those are questions that the typical Civil Rights Hypocrite avoids.
This editorial is spot on. Folks, we fought a war against white nationalists. I was curious as to what was being chanted in Charlottesville. I watched the HBO special called Race and Terror. If all I heard were the chants it would've been enough. However, the white nationalists that were interviewed claimed Jews and black people must be kicked out of the Nation. They firmly stated that our Nation was built for white people.  Only they made our Nation great. I've read portions of Mein Kampf. These people mimicked the words I read.  I guess our WWII veterans were alt-left. Ridiculous. It has nothing to do with left or right. It's simply right and wrong. Trump was horribly, horribly wrong. No good people marched with the Klan, white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville. I expect others to counter-march and not tolerate this BS. Let me tell you I'm a senior citizen and I know Nazis when I see them. We lost too many good warriors in WWII to let this disgrace go unnoticed.
I am totally disgusted with this article.  Sarah is comparing not letting transgender people serve in the military to the Nazi roundup and murder to millions of Jews (along with Roma, communists, the challenged and some Catholics). Man, she is a disgusting d.b.
"People don't burn other people alive" You need to acquaint yourself with autos da fe in Middle Ages Europe. Christians did precisely that to women accused of witchcraft, Jews who refused to convert, Christians who were accused of heresy (that is, they held beliefs the authorities didn't approve of), and others. After some Jews rejected Martin Luther's protestant Christianity as not being their cup of tea, Martin Luther suggested locking Jews in synagogues and setting the synagogues on fire. If that's too ancient for you, only 30 years ago, Christians were raping and slaughtering Muslims in the former country of Yugoslavia. Last year, Jews living in the West Bank burned down Arabs' houses and mosques, and in at least one house, the occupants were in it. Terrorists are brutal. A lot of terrorists are Muslim. That does NOT make all Muslims dogs. If a man from Arvada gets angry at his ex-wife and burns down her home with her in it, are all Arvadans to be considered dogs?
An "atheist"?, now it's even more stupid since you claim to have God and Chump on your side! IMUA!!!
I grew UP in the church, and KNOW the bible WELL! I was smart enough to get out when I did. The bible, read properly, is the best advocate FOR atheism! Full of misogyny, rape, incest, shall I go on?...just sayin'
There are no Palestinians.  There are only Jew hating Arabs that have no country because the other Arabs don't want them.  Supporting them in the west are addle minded  anti-semites like yourself.
I'm watching a report on the FN at this very moment, on RDI. "The New FN voters".  It is attracting new voters, i.e. some who used to vote Left, gays who see Martine as "a down-to-Earth  Mother" who understands them and has lots of gays around her and see Islam as more of an anti-gay threat than the FN, Jews who see antisemitism now coming from young Muslims, etc. ..  This isn't her fathers' FN.
She is in the same line like her Grandfather! Granpda news said Russians and Jews were dirty animals and she still abhorres Russian. I don't know her feelings on Jews though.
You remind me of my mom - "The one who Overcomes" (all the stupid choices she made in life and raises the flag proudly every chance she gets) who has experienced all and knows all...Hogwash - There is no need to experience debauchery and defilement to be wiser. And please don't claim to be an "evangelical" turned atheist - Biblically speaking there is no such thing, once one  has been made new, one does not become old again, that is clear in the Bible. This is just another example of your wisdom through experience, any time anybody tells me they "used to be a Christian" I immediately write everything they say off as nonsense, because there is no such thing. I Christian has been given eternal life through the spirit of God dwelling within them, not because of their wise choices.
My beliefs are based on empiracle evidence. That's not "silly" - that's logical. And you saying my beliefs (assuming you mean being atheist) are silly means yours are too, since you disbelieve just as I do in the hundreds of man made gods. I just believe in one less than you.   People who are Hindu have experienced too. Does that make their belief in holy cows not silly? No. It's silly. Just like your experiences don't make zombie Jesus belief any less silly.
"Adolf Hilter was actually left wing. The Nazi party was very socialist."  If you knew anything about the history of Nazi Germany --- persecution of Jews, intellectuals, communists, social democrats, etc -- you'd realize how ridiculous your statements are.
The only way out of this mess is for Canada to become more secular. Canada should set an example for the world and push secular values as the highest and push down Christian, Islam, Jew and other book religions.  > The first step is stop government funding of religion. Second step is to protect child from indoctrination. 3rd step is remove all religion people from government posts. 4th step is remove all religions people from position of power such as doctors, judges, lawyers, cops etc. >  This the way forward, a secular society based on logic, reason and Socrates debates. There is no accommodating fairy tales, witch hunts, virtue signaling and tribalism.
And the Germans didn't want the Jews so therefore they can just exterminate them   Pregnant women can always give their children up for adoption  Otherwise they suffer the risk if they don't go to confession of possibly going to hell
That's nice sky, but it completely ignores the modern world where people are much more selective about what tenets of their religion they follow. Or do you believe that no Catholic would ever use birth control or no Jew would ever eat bacon? People adhere to their religion to greatly varying degrees. To attack Muslims in general by using a strict interpretation of the Koran is wilful ignorance and just as fundamentalist in its own way as the jihadi's themelves.
Jewish people - and those of all religions other than Islam - definitely accept criticism of their religion.  They don't like it but they don't threaten, riot and kill others because of it. The only double-standard is yours, towards Islam.  BTW, the laws of some European countries that prohibit false claims about the Holocaust?  Those laws were enacted by governments of non-Jewish populations, filled with non-Jewish legislators, who were presumably disgusted with their predecessors' acts of complicity in the Holocaust.
The Germans today are the same blind brainless follow-the-leader sheep they were in 1933 and throughout their history.   The self-destructive insanity of Merkel's immigration policies is just as insane as Hitler's policies. The only difference is that Hitler sought genocidal extermination of the Jews and others while Merkel and her German sycophants seek to exterminate themselves (and the rest of native Christian Europe).
I don't think he would be a friend, but I'll reserve hate for later. I think he is picking a horrible cabinet... Sessions saying he wasn't sure if an atheist understands truth gave me chills. Trump giving a soap box to anti-vaxers is disgusting. I think packing a press conference with people paid to cheer is terribly insecure. If he wants to have a serious conversation about policy, then he needs to stop tweeting about Meryl Streep and boasting about his tv show ratings vs Arnold Schwarzenegger's show.  I too would like the media to focus on policy and important things. But in this case the media and Trump are both babbling about nonsense and you blame just the media.
You seem to ignore the facts. There were 32,000 terrorist attacks by muslims against the rest of the world in the last 15 years.  And even the Quebec mosque murders was not a terrorist attack.  How many buddhist attacks have you seen? Or even christian attacks?  To my knowledge the number is 0.  With such a high number of attacks by one single religion,  you really expect that muslims will be perceived in a good light?  Many times we deal with people, we dont even know their religion. It's never written on their foreheads.  So people like you instead of playing the offended should concede that there is a huge problem with islam.  And you should sympathize with anyone who is against this violence, and this hate against the rest of the world by muslims.  We need protection from muslims since they have showed how dangerous they are.
Actually it calls for the death of all Jews in the world.
Sorry Ms Maughan, as much as I respect you as a journalist, I contend that you got this one wrong. While the dire situation regarding economic transformation certainly requires urgent attention, the dire situation regarding some rather trashy journalism also needs addressing. And this was it - trashy journalism. And here I am not referring to the author, because we already know it was meant to be trash, but to Ms Pillay and Mr Hlongwane who performed none of the very basic journalistic requirements before rushing to publish this rubbish. And that alone requires a further question: Why? Was it because it supported their own views? If so, why should they be let off the hook and Joseph Goebbels not? For what was proposed for white males in this rattly little tale was not much different to introductory Nazi narratives on Jews, Gypsies, gays and other "unwanteds". We all know where that ended up. Do not defend the indefensible, rather, use your formidable journalistic skills appropriately.
Jews and Muslims are different kettles of fish.  Some Jews are hostile to Xmas because they see Jesus as a renegade Jew, or nonexistent, or his followers as heretic Jews, etc., and the source of all their troubles for the last 2000 years.  Muslims see him as a great prophet, they even venerate Mary, and recognize the Virgin birth. Some fundamentalists believe they should not recognize Xmas, but like all fundies, they should be ignored.  Here is a better model:  http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/christmas-big-hit-islamic-republic-pakistan-n270666  http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/20265/i-am-a-muslim-who-celebrates-christmas-and-you-should-too/
Look ED, the old testament was for Jews.  Christians are of the NEW testament that teaches to love one another as one loves themselves. There is no call, AT ALL, for violence by Christians.  The Qu'ran preaches over and over again that infidels are worthy only of death.  Yo ED, YOU are an infidel. There will always be miscreants in any group but main the bastion of Islam is world domination through the killing of ALL infidels.
Lefties are hilarious. You yap about democracy, yet when you lose - you go thug. Let's summarize a few things..  1. Trump is the enemy of Jews. Obama and Kerry throw Israel under a bus yesterday  2. Trump is a racist. White people can't apply for jobs in Obama's administration. White Middle class America under Obama's is destroyed and working class families lose for the sake of gang drug dealers and Black LIves Matter terrorists.  3. Obama is the defender of the West. Turkey announces it has proof Obama is funding ISIS.  4. Trump's man Steve Bannon hates Jews. Israels applauds his selection in Trump administration.  Now we have Obama trying to hurt Russia for hacks that came from inside the US infrastructure from honest Americans patriots who wanted the world to see the scumbag Clinton machine for what it was. The most corrupt Oligarch machine.  Thanks God Trump won.  The left after losing are outed for what they are Totalitarian thugs
Carl Bernstein, what a past blast.  Bob Woodward's old sidekick!   If it wasn't for Bob and his Deep Throat, Carl would still be pitching pennies behind the diner.  He still trades on his old Nixon deception days.  Trump is the only real friend Israel has in Washington these days and Carl wants use his little David slingshot to maul him.  Islamist Obama would throw the Jewish homeland under the bus to eradicate the world's true endangered minority.  The malignant presidency has come and gone.  Trump is in mid-term election mode up to his old tricks getting free publicity and directing the press's attention away from beating up on his legislative agenda.  Carl, OBTW nice facelift.
Ridiculous ...most of those claims can be debunked just from the top of my head ... The cell phone was invented by Martin Cooper, born in Chicago Illinois to Ukranian, NOT JEWISH parents. He was working for the US company Motorola.   Dennis Gabor (holography) was an agnostic lutheran    Most Israeli "inventions" are financed with American taxpayer money and are only possible because US corporations actually share their trade secrets with Israeli ones...  Here are some other notable Jewish inventions:  Holocausts (Jewish Bolsheviks ...60 million dead Christians and Russian Orthodox)  Hate Crime Laws Holocaust Revisionism Laws Usury Communism fractional-reserve banking  Federal Reserve system. anti-white racism and their worst contrivance ....Zionism because make no mistake, the issues of Israel are not "Jewish" issues, they are Zionist issues. No one should confuse Zionism and Judaism,  The issue is 100% with Zionism, an areligious cover for White supremacy .
"Israel" is a state so utterly 'race'/identity-obsessed it murders its own CHILDREN for being the wrong "color", that treats Arab and Ethiopian JEWS as 2nd-class citizens (don't ask about Muslims and Christians), and that dumped blood donated by the Falashas because it wasn't considered 'pure' enough to be used to treat Ashkenaziim, and that openly and unapologetically practices housing and education discrimination--except when the TV cameras come around. In that last it does resemble its hypocritical white-supremacist 'patron', the United States. Further it is a non-theocratic yet self-proclaimed "Jewish" state in which full privileges are reserved exclusively for European--Ashkenazi--Jews; and concerning the Arabs it treads on, it is no more and no less than an APARTHEID state so oppressive and tyrannical that Bishop Desmond Tutu and the late Nelson Mandela both said it was worse than the apartheid they themselves endured. Khalas.
Of course Trump blames the black guy.  Hurricane Maria was the fault of Puerto Ricans.  The Jews caused Nazis.   Blacks force themselves to be abused by the cops.
The biggest mass murderers of history were Christians who killed six million Jews. We also had Christians who killed tens of thousands of Muslims in Bosnia. Are we now to stereotype all Christians on that basis? The purveyors of anti-Muslim hate are insidious disgusting propagandists.
They probably did not like an expletive "A bunch of XX" in your post.   Those two states are Jordan - the Palestinian Arab state and Israel - Palestinian Jewish state.  That leaves no room for the second state of Palestinian Arabs, currently in the making.  US legislators and especially European legislators do not need to tolerate Palestinian Arabs taking them for idiots and insisting that there was no King Solomon Temple in Jerusalem and similar Islamic propaganda nonsense.
Jews only marry outside of their religion when there is money on the table. If she wasn't an heir to Trumps billions Kushner wouldn't have even kicked her tires.
.  Hitler/Nazi supporters and racist white supremacists. These people are legally allowed to march (armed) through the streets of America? Because of free speech?   If they call on their supporters (as they often do) to kill all Jews and destroy the State of Israel, is that free speech as well?  .
Nazism wants to eradicate all non-white races. This is a call to violence and an attempt to incite violence against those groups.  I do not disagree that we should allow everyone the ability to say what they want, up until it calls openly for the death of other people. That is against the law and that is what the nazis are doing. They want to kill all jews, blacks, and LGBTQ persons, oh yeah and anyone else they might have beef with that day.  So yes if you defend the words the Nazis are speaking then you are a nazi sympathizer and are equal to the nazis.  If you are defending their right to speak openly about it, then I agree, however only to the point where the start calling for the death of fellow Americans.  We(as a nation) collectively get pissed off when N. Korea kills one kid, or when ISIS says they will destroy our country, but we cannot be upset a bunch of nazi larpers want be able to openly call for ethnic cleansing the USA. That is silly. They are calling for mass murder.
Raised in Detroit. Lebanese and Chaldean classmates.  Jewish, protestant and Muslim neighbors. I would love to live in a society where your bigotry is roundly condemned. Obviously you do not believe in hell or you would realise your seat awaits you there.
Any of her items are not subject to free thought, just censorship by the Islamic hate commission.
One of Der Fuehrer Trump's loyal Deplorables created by him and his band of equally deplorable advisors and cabinet appointees blasting Nazi propaganda throughout the nation.  All immigrants and people non-white are to be fair game to be hunted down and eradicated just like the previous minority - Jews in Nazi Germany.  Der Fuehrer Trump's speech to the Klan of Konservatives clearly labeled all immigrants and Islam as worthy of eradication.  Time for a revolution.
And in other news, anti-Jewish bigotry and incitement to violence given a green light.  Now get out there and a punch a Jew!  Oh sorry, punch a Zionist!!
Try this-- politically correct statement? A leader of the protest-- Cantrell-- said he was grateful for Trump's support, but they preferred someone more racist and someone who would not give his daughter away to a Jew. He also made statements about more marches in the future, more violence and more people dying
This "Islamophobia" label is as tired as it is wrong.  Religious prejudice being what it is, Islamic peoples have a strong leaning towards anti-Semitism, and when they blow things up or persecute minorities from the ancient churches, anti-Christianism. Then, of course, there's the terrible history that followed Mountbatten's Partition and the millions of lives that were lost in the conflicts between India and Pakistan. So Islamic peoples also have a history of Hinduphobia that most people in the West are ignorant of.   So let's say that if you're an Islamophile, you could well be a Judeo-Christian-o-phobe and a Hinduphobe.  If you want to throw the Islamophobia label around, you can't suck and blow at the same time.  The Liberal motion M103 privileges Islamic peoples over Hindus, Christians, and Jews who have been subject to persecution by Islamic groups.     Justin Trudeau is very ignorant and very wrong.
How ironic that you claim to support indigenous peoples, yet Jews lived in their homeland nation of Israel long before either the Roman Empire, or the later spread of Islam, both of whom conquered the region by use of extremely brutal military force..     You are really quite the hypocrite, and clearly have a perverted view of history.
Google Mussolini for the visage and orations of the original "Trump".  Just add hair and the arrogant stance and pose is almost identical.  The Italian Mussolini was the real creator of Fascism.  Hitler's Nazism just expanded it to include full German military might and demonizing of Jews to provide a scapegoat justifying genocide and continental conquest.  Germans were just more efficient than the Italians.  Mussolini(Il Duce) is the perfect ancestor of the One-Man rule arrogantly expounded by Trump.  Every Conservative in this nation yearns for the return of Royal King or All-powerful Caesar as their preferred governing system without all of those pesky human rights restrictions.
the homeless jew knows where he can buy a house for $12,000......he would get a job but prison and jail made him to crazy to work......and there are not to meny places that will let him work becouse he is a voilent offender....so dose eney budy have $12,000..... ???
Yes, all Jews can sleep tight knowing that the new American president received endorsements from both David Duke and Louis Farrakhan. The incidents of hate crimes - with people sporting the Nazi insignia and bomb threats directed at Jewish institutions, come from Trump's base. He is the only president in our history to receive an endorsement from the KKK. Yeah, all Jews feel so much better.
Today in France, the Jews no longer have to fear the Nazis. They are being attacked by the adherents of another ideology that is just as odious and violent - one based on the teachings of a Seventh Century pedophile.
"And that’s before we consider the various incidents that have come to play a particular role in the public mind. Penny Sparrow’s Facebook rant was racist, the Spur incident was racist too; these were big issues even without the help of a group of people from a former colonial power”  Notwithstanding, ‘minor' isues arised when comments to call 'killing whites like jews', and 'killing or maiming white children' done through the social media with identifiable sources, 'under investigation’ and ‘under the carpet’ was the way to go….
dershowitz is a loud mouthed hook nosed jew scum who is loyal to israheil.  we can only hope that the brain cancer spreads quickly.
Would there be an outcry if Canada's Governor General, Julie Payette, had said something silly like "God bless Canada"?  It's about time someone called out the religious bias and stupidity in politics and society.  Just perusing the comments on Facebook, I see the vast majority of Canadians support Ms Payette.  How does Ms Payette's atheism and criticism of religion prevent her being an impartial Governor General?
Spot on, DC.  I fear bubble boy's sheep don't get this.  A follower is a vote and if they vote for their guy the end justifies the means. It took two full days for the executive branch of govt to give a generic/hedged reply to what some assume was in response to this video of these jack booters...almost with a wink wink.  Look and listen to his response to the Jewish reporter at bubble boy's scary news conference.  Shushed him, called him a liar and told him to sit down.  These jack booters will tear down this country before any Islamic terrorist group will, especially if the president sets this kind of tone.
The Jewish people SHOULD stop stealing the Palestinians land....right after YOUR family and all the European and African descendants living here give their land back to the Native Americans.    Go ahead... lead  the way, find a Native Alaskan and take them to a real estate title agent and sign your family's house over to that Native person....show us how it's done!
Jewish terrorism arose as self-defense against Arab terrorism.
Wow - you keep making my point for me.  At the risk of seeming insensitive... "There Are None So Blind As Those Who Will Not See". I'm sure 6 million Jews who were forced to wear those stars prior to being tortured to death would not have much sympathy with your situation.
Agreed. Those in the media are given undeserved adoration. They have bad breath, body odour and constipation just like everyone else but me. Hey, how come I'm not in the movies?  I coulda got babes for the ugly jewish man.
It's those darn Istanbul settlements. Time for Kerry and Obama to condemn those Muslims. Oh, I forgot. No Jews involved.
We have to pay for the French, the Catholic, the Jews, the Muslims, the Feminists, the Natives, the Welfare Class, the millions of government workers, the baby boomers pensions, the new immigrants and refugees....   what more could go wrong ???
Ah, the tolerance of good "Christians" down-voting/disagreeing with your simple statement of what you believe.  Mark my word, you let these intolerant religious nutbags twist the law to persecute Muslims and they will eventually get around to using their corrupt power to persecute Mormons.  It is who/what these intolerant religious scorpions are.
Don't white supremacists hate Jews? Trump is surrounded by Jews. His daughter is a convert and his son in law is Orthodox Jewish.
I'd hate to be the partisan who has to explain away a rally of neo-Nazi torch weilders who chanted "Jews will not replace us" with "out of context" with no further attempt at explanation. Trump refused to rent to black Americans. That's why the "alt-right" loves him.  I'd hate to be the partisan who has to explain away a contempt of court charge by arguing that the DOJ was wrong and so was the judge who found Arpaio in contempt after he violated desist order. Notably you didn't try to dispute the other sins by Arpaio, the poster boy of government overreach.  Trump was a birther. For years. Even after HI debunked birtherism. Even after Obama released his birth certificate TWICE. Trump promised to provide proof of his birther claim yet he didn't follow through as usual. Then he demanded Obama's transcripts because he thought Obama wasn't smart enough to attend Harvard. This coming from a semi-literate Trump.   I pity partisans who voted for racist sexual predator who ogles nude teenagers
I suppose you think that we should also give every military technological secret we have to Iran.  Oh crap, I hope I didn't give Justin another idea to make the Mullahs love Judaism and Christianity.
What's an atheist doing "celebrating" Christmas???  Very hypocritical!
Also, all you people out there "of color", be very, very worried and do something about it with your vote on the next go round.  Trump is a White Supremacist, obviously picking on blacks, THIS TIME.  He has no problem pandering to the racism of his "base", stirring it up in a racist frenzy.  He's used Mexicans, Middle Easterners, Jews and Blacks as his foils to do that so far.  This is getting bad.  Even NFL owners, risking offending their white customer base, are pushing back - and they have NO PROBLEM killing their employees to make money.  Very bad.
"These "white men" you speak of seem to have very limited experience of anyone other than themselves."  I agree! Not to mention that they seem to fear the "decision-making" that may "be different based on their experiences with women and Jewish people".  What the heck would be wrong with that? We need input from all our citizens, yes, including straight white males, but not only straight white males as if they were the only ones whose "decision-making" was valid or of worth!  This is a very narrow-minded way of looking at the vast diversity of the people of the United States, a country that is great because of it's diversity, not in spite of it!
There are literally thousands of cemeteries across Canada that are exclusive to Catholics, Protestants and Jews.  This is ridiculous.  Let them have their own cemetery.  You can't have it both ways.  This is Canada and this "referendum" is a pathetic joke.
Muslim fanatical beliefs must be eliminated if we are to have even a modicum of peace in the world. The clearly proven depravity of muslim beliefs need to be eradicated not encouraged and endorsed especially in Canada.   Did you know that at Toronto International Airport there is a MUSLIMS ONLY prayer chapel replete with dirty feet washing machines....yet ZERO CHRISTIAN or JEWISH Chapels are permitted....whats up with that? Did you know that Peel Region Schools must now accommodate muslim prayer times in a special location but NO OTHER RELIGIOUS prayer is permitted.....what's up with that B.S?  This is not the Canada I once knew and loved.  Breeding like rabbits mulsims will overtake populations in many Countries and spread their vileness and hatred of traditional normalcy.  Time for the 2018 CRUSADES to begin worldwide to rid the world of these fanatical maniacs that super stupid lefty gov't support.. THERE IS no other way. Trump is right on this point if not on anything else!
Agreed and unfortunately Islamism is spread by the radical sect Wabbabis of Saudi Arabia in their religious schools or Madrassas throughout the Muslim world. It is also up to moderate Muslims to break this link to the Wahhabis.  They don't seem to be doing a good job of this as evidenced by the visiting Imam to a mosque in Montreal who preached killing jews one by one; and apparently no Muslim in the mosque reported this incendiary speech to the authorities. Our government could best use their resources to combat Islamism (per example) rather than a mis-guided and wrong headed effort to combat Islamophobia by bill M-103. The sharia law of the Islamists provides for harsh penalties for criticism of the koran, Islam or Mohammed and it seems to me bill M-103 borrows from the ideology of the Islamists as it attempts to enshrine in Canada protection against criticism of Islam when in some instances, criticism should be made rather than  covered up.
Good try.  Try harder. WORLDNET DAILY IS MOSTLY libertarian with a strong Judeo-Christian influence. It's why they often flipped GW Bush for some of his policies. A much more thorough job of ripping than the standard "Bush lied, people died" horse crap. Unlike the talking heads on PMSNBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, etc., Worldnet daily used logical arguments and factual events to go after Bush (North American Union, freeway from Juarez to Alberta, illegal immigration, etc.). Tell me FRZMAO when did the mainstream media ever go after Obama or HRC? Name two incidents.....  Personally I'm surprised you had the guts to try an throw anything from Salon magazine at.me. Talk about biased! Why not list the Huffington post while you're at it.
Sorry, but when the VAST majority of terrorist activity worldwide comes from one specific group, THAT'S the group you need to bear down on and be careful about! When was the last time you heard about a terror attack by a Japanese Buddhist? If there ever was one, which I think might even be possible, is it the prevolent threat? No. Wake up and get a grip on reality. We need to stop worrying about "being nice" and "being politically correct" and get s**t done, and NOW. No more effin around. The world is laughing at our pathetic government's inability to deal with issues...
don't forget cats and dogs living together.  You sound like all previous anti immigrant jerks from those anti Irish Catholics, to the Jews, to the Hungarians (all Commies remember), to the Italians (all Mafia, remember).
No the POS just knows he is wrong but won't admit it.  It's pretty sad when our President knows what's going on out here more than the media and others in Government.  Patriots were also at that protest to protest the monuments coming down and nothing else.  They had no part of the KKK.  If the idiot knew what he was talking about he would know that the radical left now hates Jews probably more than the KKK!!!  Every time I see an anti-semetic comment on other sites it's all from the radical left.  I don't know what has happened to our country.  what's wrong is now right, now if you don't agree with someone you are racist, laws don't matter,   The corrupt Democrats now have the moral high ground????  It seriously feels like invasion of the body snatchers took over half our country!!
Aren't you one of the people who ways say deport them when someone has a Hispanic last name?  This guy isn't from Mexico is he? So I guess only people from mexico get the hate. Kinda like how the Nazis singled out the Jewish people. Trump and his cronies single out Mexicans. I bet people like you are so proud of yourself. Trump is the absolute worst thing to ever happen to this cpuntry.
Well, in case you are forgetting, when he said that, the war to destroy Israel has just began. A war where Israelis were outnumbered, out of positions and facing the second holocaust. Its sound bit more civil  then what their enemies were saying..."kill all Jews"....!! The war in 1948 was initiated by the Arabs. It was a war of extermination. Unfortunately for the Arabs, it didn't turn out that way.  But, what would have happen if Arabs embraced the Jewish nation instead of attacking it?? No one gave that any thought. My guess would be that the Jewish state would be more smaller, weaker and under some sort of protectorate of their Arab neighbors?? Too bad, eh? Palestinian Arabs, instead of sharing, lost it all to the Palestinian Jews.
This news story has generated more letters, comments, articles, etc. than any other that I can remember in my 40 years in Eugene. Most have been thoughtful, honest, insightful, and have given me a lot to think about - particularly in regards to my own biases, both the ones I know and those I don't even know that I have. No matter how much I read, talk, watch, experience, empathize with, etc, I will never know what it is like to be Black, a Woman, a Jew, Gay, etc. I will never be able to fully know what it is like to be anyone else other than myself, and no one else will ever know what it is like to be me.   I doubt we'll ever be able to fully and collectively bridge the racial divides and prejudices in this country. We don't seem to be able to learn from our collective past without being labeled by it and stuck in it. Since I can't change it, I say live in the present and treat yourself and fellow human with as much dignity, integrity, understanding, civility, etc. as you can muster.
As an American Jew it's disgusting to see someone with and Israeli flag support a fascist like Adolph Trump. Israeli media and government have been Trump apologizers for a long time. It is mind boggling to see the Jewish state align itself with such a vile white supremacist fascist pig like our imbecile-in-chief. Any Jew who stands by Donald Trump is a traitor to the Jewish people.
"Do you men Nazi Germany?"  I don't think Kurgan means that, a eugenics program. In 1933, the Nazi Reich Cabinet passed the "Laws for the Prevention of Hereditary Diseased Offspring," a eugenics program, which forced legalized sterilization. Later the Nazis built on those Laws, among others, to promote the annihilation of Jews and other "offspring undesirables" all over Europe. But "striving for purity" among the Nazis always meant racial purity, eugenics, etc. -- all of which eventually led to the holocaust.
The two groups seeking confrontation in Charlottesville are both detestable. The similarities, fascists and socialists willing and ready to commit violence, to 1930's Europe. Let's not only remember the tragedy of the holocaust committed by fascists, but the genocide of jews by socialists in Russia. Millions upon millions of jews were killed by both groups. And now they want to drag our country into their mess.
Peter Stockland would you like a cemetery adjacent to your home? I bet you wouldn't you hypocrite piece of garbage! Who cares if it's Muslim, Jew or any other kind. You are just trying to sensationalize the Muslim part of the application. Whether it's the Muslims or the Indians your garbage is getting old. Go write greeting cards for hallmark as you are nothing but a clown.
Boss Trump and his staff and supporters need to learn, and quickly, that the Holocaust was not merely about killing off large numbers of people, but mainly about exterminating all Jews from the face of the earth!  That's known as genocide, because that's what it is!  Trump is essentially in Holocaust denial!
you accept christian sharia law while screaming how you don't want sharia law.  Amy is the equivalent of a radicalized imam spouting hate for jews and the west.   how do you not see this?
Don't imply even via rhetorical "question" that I said "all Jews committed war crimes".  I referred to ZIONISTS.  I oppose Zionism for the same reasons I oppose Nazism and Apartheid--doesn't mean I hate Jews, Germans or Boers.  The Zionist entity isn't a theocracy.  It's a secular, openly ANTI-SEMITIC apartheid state.  I AM a Semite--descended from a Syrian Sephardic Jewish immigrant.  The REAL anti-Semites are the Zionist Ashkenaziim, who are NOT Semites but derive from the Turk-related Khazars, originating in the Black Sea region, who converted to the Jewish faith in the 8th century; they rule "Ersatz Isra'el", and they've persecuted not only Semitic Muslims and Christians, but Arab and African Jews.  Research the Zionists' DELIBERATE irradiation of over 100,000 Sephardic Jewish CHILDREN with US Army X-ray machines giving 35,000 times the maximum dose! Killed THOUSANDS of them!  They're still dying of cancer and leukemia today.  The Zionists learned their lessons from the Nazis WELL!
So John, you're saying that the prosecution of any of those "twisted people" was only done a Christian judiciary? That there were no Jews, Muslims, atheists, Buddhists, or followers of other religions involved, only Christians? That's a bit hard to believe isn't it?  However your post actually proves my point. No doubt many of the prosecutors had some affiliation to the Christian faith. Therefore no one could claim that Christians are "twisted people" who murder abortion providers. Islam is no different, there is no basis to assert that all Muslims are terrorists just because of the actions of a small fundamentalist subset.
You conveniently don't mention your cohorts who call for extermination of Jews and Blacks. With guys like IQ006, IQ22, and the rest in your corner, well, I wouldn't call you  loathsome or deplorable like them but I think " imbecile" has some merit for your selectivity.
The KKK members have long been "equal opportunity" bigots......Catholics....Jews...Blacks.... "let's hate them all!"
Christianity, Judaism and Islam, the three Abrahamic Religions are the root of all evil in this world.   We are being held hostage by an out dated Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is ridiculous that in this day and age we must be held hostage with religious accommodation based on cultural values from 2000 years ago.  What a joke.
Odd how after Trump was fake-elected on a platform or hate, xonophobia and similar, with white supremacist neo Nazis celebrating, installed a racist as AG, chose the racist head of Bretbart News as his closest counselor and started vigorously promoting nationalism, that hate activities have skyrocketed.  And yes, I know he has a few token Jews in his family.  Means nothing as more than a few experts have noted.
CLAIM:   "Investigators have concluded that the massacre was not racially or religiously motivated"  FACT:  "THE “deranged” gunman who killed 26 churchgoers in Texas was a militant atheist who ranted on Facebook about “stupid religious people."
Palestinians are dyed-in-the-wool Jew haters. How dare the UN or anyone defend them in their ongoing attacks on innocent Israelis.
What an absurd comment, "J. NEVER asked Roman..." He couldn't.  He wasn't a Roman citizen. He called his Jewish religion to live up to its care of the poor. Republicans largely are Calvinists.  You are poor because you are not right w. god. Jesus upended this view when he said how difficult for the rich to enter the KofG. The disciples were amazed because common interpretation was the rich were right w. god. For Jesus, they were rich because of exploitation. If Christians took J. literally there be no need for government but because Christians here don't, secular government do what Christian don't.  Same for government's 14th amendment, equality & due process of every citizens because the dominant Christians didn't treat native Americans & blacks as equal, providing due process.  Rather, Indian removal, lynchings, etc, largely by Christians here!  Who were the savages, civilized?
I find it appalling that so many Americans are so bigoted and so ignorant that they can't tell the difference between Sikhs and Muslims. I find it deeply offensive and absolutely outrageous that a fair number of Americans are so hateful they don't even CARE that there IS a difference between Sikhs and Muslims.  (The Sikh religion is NOT an Abrahamic religion, AT ALL. It owes far more in the way of ideas and outlook to Buddhism. Sikhs believe that a god created the universe, and left some important lessons about how to live in the form of holy books. However, there are no miracles, there is no hell, no devil, and no messiah. A Sikh is expected to live as a "soldier" who defends the innocent; a "scholar" who trains his mind in the holy book AND in the laws that govern the material universe; and a "saint," one who lives a moral and ethical life.  Those who fall short of those goals are reincarnated to try again. Sikhism has no hell, and Sikhs dislike the very IDEA of eternal damnation.
No, he went after EVERYONE. IN. THE. CHURCH. That is the opposite of a specific target. And yes he was an atheist and yes he was psychotic.
No, the GOP in Colorado clear back then was headed towards the conservative side.  And KKK in Colorado, was NOT about racism , but about being against Catholics and Jews, not blacks.  Sadly, Conservatives likes yourself, have a LONG history of hate and going after others. Look at how your leader trump is going after muslim refugees even though 100% of evidence is that he will not pick up a SINGLE terrorists.   As to the klan in the south, it was almost always about blacks.
Being an old black man, my first thought as I read the article was this guy must be white. He clearly is weak on African American history. The Obama years have been an improvement over the Bush years for us. For that matter, the last 7 years have been an improvement over the previous 200 years. Our future is bright. Of course, we don't have any white privilege to lose. Like most Jews, black folks are very good at identifying the source of life threatening danger. The ones that don't figure it out don't live long. The police make sure of that. I will never support the GOP as long as they are the preferred party of Klansmen and Nazis. I'm disappointed that the rest of the GOP seems unconcerned about this simple truth. The GOP has set a very low bar for Democrats to look less racist than them. At least the Democrats want us to vote. That is more than I can say for the GOP. The only thing the GOP is offering us are police bullets.
Again, the progressive MSM refuses to mention the salient facts that this "bloodthirsty gang" was a group of Islamic radicals and that Daesh took credit for yet another terrorist attack against innocent, defenseless citizens.  Amish, agnostics, atheists, Baptists, Mormons, Episcopalians, Jehovah's Witnesses, Lutherans, Hindus, Buddhists, et al religions are not committing these atrocities.  Muslims are.  Isn't it time to address the problem, radical Islam, rather than ignoring it and pretending that it doesn't exist, as the progressive, politically MSM usually do?
Wow.   This is probably one of the most (if not the most) asinine,  lefty fascist propaganda pieces I have read in a while.  Göebels would be proud of Seattle Weekly.     There are no white supremacist bands here. I love how it says "it is more common for white supremacist bands to promote their ideas subtly".  Yeah,  that way the leftist fascists can call any band or person a racist or a Nazi, and distort their words into bullshit.   Also,  Death in June is not a Nazi band.  A Jewish,  gay,  immigrant who loves black dick (Milo, of course) is not a fascist.   The adjectives listed above of what he is, is every one of the things that Nazis hate.  And Anti-Sharia March was exactly that --  an anti-Sharia march against honour killings, FGM, and killing of gays.
Jews are the least inclusive people I can think of. Try moving to Israel and see how inclusive they are.
"...For the sake of all that is good and righteous. Kill them all."  Wow. There is a certain irony to that statement, given that Hitler thought pretty much the same about Jews and other so-called "untermensch". I think the Congressman missed the real point about events like the Holocaust: one must stop such destructive thinking in its tracks before it can do massive damage. Perhaps if the world, or at least if Germans, had responded forcefully to Hitler rather than believing in his message, those ovens would not exist.   We need to look in the mirror in the USA and ask if we are capable of going down such a road ourselves. Categorizing all radicalized Islamists as worthy of death sounds an awful lot like deja vu all over again. Radicalization can be reversed. Indeed, we have less of a problem with radical Islam in the US than in Europe in part because we have not ostracized Muslims.
The fact is, the violence and bloodshed lies squarely in the hands of #BlackLivesMatter, #AntiFa as well as the #Charlottesville politicians who ordered the police to STAND DOWN when Leftist storm-troopers showed up masked and armed to initiate violence. Also responsible are the #EstablishmentMedia who did as these fascist thugs expected by presenting a fraudulent depiction of who started the violence and thus who is responsible.  40 years ago, the #KKK petitioned the Skokie IL authorities to stage a demonstration through a predominantly Jewish neighborhood. The #ACLU helped make sure that their Constitutionally protected -- no matter how repugnant -- freedom of expression was honored. There were counter-protests, but the groups were kept separate.   It is more than doubtful that the ACLU would protect even a #TeaParty rally today. And we all know that Leftists will not peaceably suffer opposing views being expressed. 99% of the hate and violence comes from the Hard Left. Period.
Spare me the pathetically transparent commercials.  "Israel" is a state so utterly 'race'/identity-obsessed it murders its own CHILDREN for being the wrong "color", that treats Arab and Ethiopian JEWS as 2nd-class citizens (don't ask about Muslims and Christians), and that dumped blood donated by the Falashas because it wasn't considered 'pure' enough to be used to treat Ashkenaziim, and that openly practices housing and educational discrimination--except when the TV cameras come round.  In that last it does somewhat resemble its hypocritical white-supremacist 'patron', the USA.  Further it is a non-theocratic yet self-proclaimed JEWISH state that in which full privileges are reserved for European--Ashkenazi--Jews; and concerning the Arabs it treads upon, it is no more and no less than an APARTHEID state so oppressive and tyrannical that Bishop Desmond Tutu and the late Nelson Mandela both said it was worse than the apartheid they themselves endured.  Khalas.
I hate to tell you this but ALL mainstream Christian churches, including The RCC, are losing members.  Hand over fist.  The only two countries where is it gaining members is Africa and South America, in that order.  Also remember that lots of people call themselves Catholic, but do not participate in The RCC in any way.  Also remember that the number of atheists, agnostics and simply 'unchurched' are growing at a pretty good pace.  (Perhaps a surprise to you, the vast majority of atheists, agnostics and 'unchurched' are not immoral.)  Considering that an estimated 10% of the RC priests are homosexual (and most are celibate) and that around 10% are/have been pedophiles, church affiliation or no church affiliation does not have a lot to do with sinning and being virtuous.
Jews who supported Trump are as loathsome as gays like Peter Thiel or transgendered people like Caitlyn Jenner who did so. I have no use for any of them.
You're confusing "cajones" with racism.  White Neo-Nazis chanting "Jews will not replace us" are "very fine people."  Black athletes quietly kneeling are "sons of bitches."  Rote patriotism is not an ideal of this country.
Jews only intermarry when there is big money on the table hence Kushner taking Trumps daughter.
Funny how the author uses Jews in this column, but he is rabidly anti-Israel and pro-flooding of Europe with Middle East migrants.  This is so transparent. His fake sympathy to Jews is sickening.
Violence may well start when someone calls another *fag.  Name calling is not meant as endearment. Calling a guy afag is not to promote positive intetaction. The fact is thatfag and a few other choice references to gay sex are intended as put-downs. Should we go along in our ignorant bliss because that's what we learned, we may as well go back to the terms of endearment for blacks, Germans, Jews, Japanese and Chinese. I find you to be a tiresome asole and I say that with the utmost admiration, obviously.
The civil war inside the White House is real, and it's nasty. The Daily Beast is reporting that the tension is so high that officials are now name-calling behind each other's backs, with Bannon escalating it to the point where he's calling Jared Kushner a "cuck" and a "globalist" behind his back.  “[Bannon] recently vented to us about Jared being a ‘globalist’ and a ‘cuck’…He actually said ‘cuck,’ as in “cuckservative,’” one official told the Daily Beast.    Interesting that "cuck" mattered more to that official than "globalist," when that term is generally used as a white nationalist sneer at Jewish people. But either way, it's quite Bannonesque. Breitbart was one of the first to amplify the whole "cuckservative" epithet, after all.  Bannon was already in trouble with Trump, according to a New York Times report published yesterday.
Racial profiling?  Since when is islam a race?  The left wing media B.S. continues!
That whenever one tries to generalize about groups of people, one might be accused of stereotyping.  He could also be accused of stereotyping in saying that black people are wasting their money in strip clubs.  While there are complaints about the line being perceived as perpetuation of an ancient stereotype, it's also clear that Jay-Z's thesis is that to overcome oppression, black people should emulate Jews in America by accumulating inter-generational wealth.  Whether you buy the capitalism as cure thesis or not, it's clear his intent is not to put people down, but to build them up.  My two cents:  MLK didn't dream that his children would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the contents of their bank accounts.
Yeah... That sounds really terrible. God forbid someone attacks the poor Jews. Or worse....   like, say... Oh I don't know.. plant bombs in civilian areas just to frame Jews. Or really disgusting, like ... attack an unarmed battle ships for 90 minutes, just to frame Jews...    Maybe bomb  a disco in Germany or a hotel in Jerusalem..., just to say... Oh I don't know... frame Jews! Or maybe something more creative like...  and I'm just guessing here...  fly planes into buildings rigged with explosives by undercover operatives posing as starving artists ...   Can you image the kind of people who would do that?  They would certainly deserve to be wiped out, don't you think? I know Jews would agree since they think it should happen to Muslims ... right?
Let's see, a cake for two gay people celebrating their love and commitment to one another, versus a cake for a group who think Hitler didn't go far enough in wiping out Jews, gays, the disabled, and anyone who wasn't Aryan enough for them.  Hmm....  Ya know, I see a difference here.
Raise the prices! No ones buying them and hunters are going out of state where the games managed and the wardens put you on game instead of waterboard you for being in the woods. The anti huntering libs in the game dept has ran it into the ground. No one will address the real reason sales are down .... Tribal massacre of the fish n game, timber co s charging to hunt (spineless sportsman buying the permits, instead of protesting it!!!!) , trapping n hound hunting gone leaving predators to unleash hell on all fawns n game!!!! Great job libs!!!! And you clowns that buy permits remind me of the Jews that worked for the nazi s .
I use anti-semitic because that is commonly used to denote racist hatred of jews. Zionist is in itself a derogatory term meant to stigmatize Jews. Since you use it I'm sure you just another jew hater.
Your premise is truly stupid. No one was removing the statue at that time, and the march of the NAZIs and KKK was through the racially integrated University of Virginia. The chants were "You won't replace us" and "Jews won't replace us." It was a white supremacy march against an America where black and brown people have equal rights. It wan't about some cheesy statue of a general who became a traitor to the nation of his birth, the United States of America.
I dont see the threat like locals maybe because of what I have witnessed in NYC where a one time the lower eastside of manhattan was predominately Jewish but not we moved out and new immigrants moved in like new chinese or dominicans. I think they should keep the architecture but it dosnt mean it must always stay chinese thats ridiculous a city is not a museum
I got banned for a couple of days for posting: "Show me an Imam who says homosexuals, women and Atheists are equal to a Muslim man, and I will show you an Imam with a Fatwa on him". Seemed rather apparent and civil to me...
That's funny, with Obama snubbing Israel? As usual, you've got it backwards. Just like the Jews who voted for Obama in 2008. When speaking today; TEL AVIV Dec 30, 2016—Israel’s political shift to the right and growing support for building settlements made it easier for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to respond sharply to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry’s parting peace-plan speech, but some here are concerned he is counting too heavily on a friendlier U.S. in a Trump presidency...Welcome to Reality, brought to you from Obama?  "The Blue Dogs are out, The Red Dogs are in. Go Dog! Go!" (c) 1961.  “You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn’t wear a veil. You know, guys like that ain’t got no manhood left anyway. So it’s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them. Actually it’s quite fun to fight them, you know. It’s a hell of a hoot. It’s fun to shoot some people. I’ll be right up there with you. I like brawling.” General "Mad Dog" Mattis
I can't stand the orange man; can't see why any of you idiots (who also voted for bush/cheney) voted for him;  but I'm thankful he started his speech tonight condemning the violence against Jews across the nation.
The MSM like all Religious leaders hate criticism and support anything that can reduce criticism of themselves. This is a ridiculous editorial calling for censorship - WHERE IS THE EDITORIAL DEMANDING MUSLIMS STOP HATING JEWS, CHRISTIANS, ZOROASTRIANS, ATHEISTS, WOMEN, GAYS? It is just crazy what is going on here, a total tyranny is being put nto place and we must fight it to the death!
All Christians, Jews and other religious denominations are angered and will retaliate every time another Muslim demand is made and honoured.     This is beyond ridiculous that Muslims are allowed to force their religion down our throats.   This is a very serious situation and there will be more violent attacks when our government refuses to curb this activity.   Muslims can take time from their days at school to pray, yet our Lord's prayer has been dismissed as being controversial.    Yes, this is going to get very ugly and could easily turn into civil war. That comment is not outrageous.  Muslims have come from that very climate and they didn't leave that on the shores behind them.   This is just the beginning of a rally.
Ben and Jerry, those humble Vermont Farmers, are now long gone. but the company is still run by people just like Ben & Jerry...who were hardly the aw-shucks Farmers they pretended to be. The CEO and most of the Brass are Liberal, elitist Jewish boys from urban backgrounds. I have boycotted them since the fraud stunt in 1989 when  B & J claimed to running an essay contest for the CEO position...that was already in place.
Quick question, who killed more Jews - the Christians or the Muslims?
"Everywhere man is born free, yet everywhere he is in chains." The ANC fought for freedom and non racialism. The fought for freedom to restrict the freedom of others.. they fought for no racialism to introduce their own brand of racialism. "Oh, How odd of God to choose a Jewish God, to spurn the Jews.
It's also about time that you and your parents and relatives who have settled on lands belonging to the native peoples begin to evacuate and leave just as the UN resolution demands of Jews living in the West Bank. Get moving, you racist hypocrite!
Muhammad's youngest wife was between 16 and 19, which was standard marrying age for girls at his time and place (actually a little on the older end of the distributional curve).  Maryam the mother of Jesus (alayhimus-Salaam) was 14 when she became pregnant.  As for your absurd claim, kindly do what I would ask of any Muslim making an assertion concerning the Most Noble Messenger (Saala Allahu alayhi wa Ah'liihi wa Salaam)--"what is your da'lil?", i.e. "where did you get that?"  Be advised I'll no more accept anti-Islamic 'hate' site then I would accept a Nazi's claims about Jews.  Nor do we worship the Most Noble Messenger (Saala Allahu alayhi wa Ah'liihi wa Salaam)--that's why our faith isn't called "Muhammadianity" or something.  It's called ISLAM, which means the same thing as the Hebrew term "shlema".  Any more stupid questions?
That's disturbing that an atheist, and presumably an agnostic could never be voted into office. And it's also disturbing that religion or any of these categories automatically would have an affect on votes.
I'm confused.  Is he an atheist or a 'secular Christian'?  Frankly, I smell more than a whiff of artifice in the professor's atheism.
Raskolnikov, Your hatred of Jews has evolved over time in its manifestations and disguises and one can see all three forms in abundance here. Read some history and maybe you'll understand a thing or two about reality. Your antisemitism is disgusting.
"A Muslim might refuse to something for a patron because of the fact that alcohol is served..." Actually, that is exactly the sort of thing that will be allowed to occur if the baker wins this case.  "...then what about if you owned a bakery and a white supremacist was holding a gathering for other white supremacists and ordered a cake for the gathering, you would be required to fulfill his request. How would you feel about that?" If they wanted a run-of-the-mill birthday cake, then yes, I would provide that item.  If they wanted a cake decorated that said "kill all the filthy Jews", then I would explain that I find that objectionable, but would be willing to sell them the cake and the materials with which to decorate the cake.  I'd side with the baker if the latter was the situation (the couple wanted the cake decorated in a manner that the baker found objectionable).  If the couple went in and wanted #17 from the wedding cake catalog, then what the baker did was discrimination.
Your narrative is a lie. Christians are victims every day- look no further than Coptic Christians living under Islamic terror every day.  No one is saying "churches just turned dangerous," they're saying despite the harassment and abuse done to them by atheists and Islamism sympathizers, they could at least be safe in church-- which has indeed changed for the worse in the last 15 years.
No wonder Jesus (alayhis-Salaam) so harshly cursed hypocrites.  Here's where a lot of sanctimonious so-called "Christians" don't get it--you don't get absolved of sin until you REPENT of it.  Doesn't matter what religious 'label' you apply to yourselves.  Christian self-righteousness, hubris and hypocrisy PREVENTS them from repenting, as they see no need for it.  After all, "Jesus" (alayhis-Salaam) "paid the price" for their sins.  You clearly don't understand your Scripture (or don't want to).  In the parable I mentioned in Luke 18, NEITHER of the parties, the Pharisee nor the tax-collector/publican, were CHRISTIANS.  They were Jews.  But Jesus (alayhis-Salaam) said one--the miserable tax-collector--found justification before God and the other--the self-righteous Pharisee--did not.  Why?  Because the tax-collector REPENTED of his sins and the Pharisee did not.  Neither has Amy.  Clearly, neither have you.  Arrogance and hypocrisy are sins, and you proclaim yours with each post.
ctd....  Look at the situation today in Bangladesh. Dozens of atheists, secularists and liberals have been murdered by Islamists in the past two years. Many have been hacked to death on the street or in their homes in front of their families. Bangladesh has a tradition of secularism and tolerance but this is under attack today by Islamists. Hundreds of secular Bangladeshi academics, authors, bloggers, etc, have fled Bangladesh in the past year because they fear for their lives.  Like I said many times before, Islamists are the #1 threat to Muslims all over the world.
No different from those attacking Muslims.  Same people, same hatred.  These people are not "freedom fighters" or free speech saviours, they are hateful slime.  I wonder if the Cons are upset that Spicey called for antisemites to stop their hate.  Isn't that giving Jews special preference?
Demographics would like to differ and tv ratings. Majority of blacks, Chinese, Jews and Flippinos prefer Basketball. These groups combined together represent a powerful force in demographics and  finance.
(a) misleading technicality; (b) put aside Afrikaner for a moment and consider the broader point; (c) (i) such heavily concentrated wealth at the top indicates economic disease, (ii) their race indicates a persistent racial problem; (1) you're defending the bantu education system?; (2) i'm not black; i'm white monopoly capital.   You'd think Afrikaners would do better out of Apartheid than 3 in the top 16 - perhaps they were too busy blaming the English for their lack of will power ... or the Jews... or the Arabs... or is that ignorant and racist?
the ideology you describe would bother most people. seeing as this is the ideology of extremists and not the ideology of the other nearly 2 billion muslims who have similar beliefs to Christians and jews and don't wish to subjugate anybody, I think perhaps we should get rid of the extremists and get to know the other 2 billion muslims
Comparing the treatment of pigs to the treatment of Jews?  You might want to rethink your unhinged comment
The liberal FAKE NEWS media doesn't want to report about the anti-semitism directed at conservative jews.  Oh no. That doesn't help their neo nazi narrative.
70x7 is the Jewish equivalent of infinite.  Your understanding is insufficient.
Islam means "submission". It is expected that eventually all people and all things will submit to Allah. The Peel school board is in the first stages of submitting to Allah because useful idiots at the school board are willing to pervert 40 yeas of secular school policy to appease Muslim demands.
sure let's support a religion that discriminates against women, kills gays for gayness and wants to vaporize Jews - let's endorse the hatred and bow down to it - this religion is overall the most the tyrannical, intolerant value system known to man - hey editorial writer wonder why Canada is ripe for a populist uprising - its cuz u keep telling people that criticism is racism when it is not and for u to cherry pick single incidents as relevant proof shows how shallow ur arguments are - where was ur team when anti-semitism was rearing its ugly head at McGill or do u editorial writers at the G&M condone violence aginst a specific group - maybe we should punch a journo today - shows how limited ur thinking is but go on back to ur silo and listen for the echo to confirm ur bias - wrong on some many levels but that's the G&M Canada's answer to fake news
Rabid atheist? Keep on believing in that magic man in the sky, moron.
It's always a flukwing Jew, isn't it?
So, only YOUR way is the right way? So by accident of birth had you been born in say India, you are automatically going to go to hell? Because in India the faith is Hindu correct? So by just chance, just because you happen to be born in the US which is predominantly Christian, you get to go to heaven?   Doesn't that sound just a little bit like full retard to you??
John, basically your claim is that Catholics are homophobic, that orthodox Jews are homophobic, and that Muslims are homophobic.  That seems to support a couple of conclusions:  you're intolerant, you're a heterophobe.  If the shoe fits, wear it.
Last Tuesday, Dumb Dumb Donald, the Racist-in-Chief, said: “You take a look, the night before, they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.”  So, let’s do that, let’s look at the night before…Here’s a video of the people Dumb Dumb supports “protesting”, the night before, the taking down of the statue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBstLbLuNRw  They chanted, “Jews will not replace us” and “Blood and soil”; and, gave the Nazi Salute.  Racist-in-Chief? Hmmm, maybe Nazi-in-Chief would be more fitting.
Laughable. Israel is singled out regardless of this article. Just have a read of all the BDS activities internationally and nationally, at universities and in protest marches. Nothing stale about standing with Israel as most legislatures and parliaments and university administrations would attest to. In fact, the only crocodile tears and wolf-crying that is falling on deaf ears are left-wing, commie-pinko whiners, and Jew hating fascists and extremists. Israel continues to rank in the very highest on the Human Development Index. The wolf-crying Palestinians at the very bottom. Apparently, terrorism, honor killings, gay torture and apartheid, female genital mutilation, chronic Jew hatred, extrajudicial hangings, don't rank very high. Talk about a stale culture!
Left, Right, Blue, Green, Black, Purple- who cares?  Stop threatening and attacking the Jews!  It's so goddamn simple people!  This is not acceptable in Canada or anywhere for that matter!  Get your ignorant, obstinate,  monkey heads out of your    a s s e s   and stand up against this sort of hatred!  This is not about politics, it's about maintaining safety for everyone.
The White Supremacist, KKK and Nazis were not there to protest the removal of the statue.  I don't recall Robert E. Lee or the civil war involving Jews, as in the "we won't be replaced by Jews" and other related epithets shouted by by the "protesters" of statue removal.
Palestinians are a rogue entity with no rule of law or independent judiciary. Honour killings of wives and daughters and female genital mutilations are the order of the day. Jew hatred comes with their mother's milk. The land of Israel is one of core ideas and precepts of Judaism, along with God and the Torah. Denying the self-determination of Jews in their historic homeland is anti-Semitic as it discriminates against Jews whereas self-determination of other cultures and religions are conferred upon them, just listen to the Palestinians, their leaders and supporters, who claim self-detemination for their people. Criticism is legitimate, however holding Israel in contempt and opprobrium and out of proportion to any other party in the Middle East, and claiming that Israel has no right to exist, is well beyond mere criticism.
like when the Imam's spew hatred and citing scriptures against Jews and infidels.  We apparently have no problem with that.
"There are 25 million people there. They are not responsible for their dictatorial leader's actions. Using Internet bravado to boast of wanting to slaughter 25 million people, I find revolting." ======= What, pray tell, are the alternatives? - (1) Should the Germans have realized that Hitler was a psychpathic nut and toppled him before he started WW2 and slaughtered 6,000,000 Jews? History would have been different if they had. Plus 6,000,000 Jews would not have died. Plus the millions of more who were non-Jewish Europeans in Germany, France, England, Poland, the USSR, etc etc etc. would not have died because of the war. - (2) And if the "choice" is between 25 million North Koreans or 25 million South Koreans or 25 million Americans.....please don't tell me you would include your family as part of the 25 million Americans you would prefer to die.
forwhatisworth, When these people started 50 years ago to want to kill all Jews and continue to think like that instead of negotiating a settlement they deserve what they have. Terrorists are terrorists and desrve to live in ruins.
Anyone who denies this terror attack is anything but Radical ISLAMIC Terrorism  is a Huff Po, Yahoo, CNN and Obama Islamic Terrorist appeaser and coddler! Enough with the appeasement and excuses! These ISLAMIC TERRORISTS want to kill innocent Christians whom they call CRUSADERS and Jews. If you deny this, you are an Islamic Terrorist APPEASER!
Disgusting. Three thoughts: 1) Donald Trump will throw GLBT people under the bus at any time to keep conservative Christians supporting him. It has nothing to do with political philosophy. It has everything to do with political expediency. 2) It is amazing the number of born-again libertarians who have come out ever since gay people started getting equal rights. 3) If a gay or atheistic person refused to offer conservative Christians goods or services and claimed artistic freedom or freedom of conscience, conservative Christians would explode. Such Christians want to be able to discriminate while being protected from being discriminated against.
What a beautiful message. Any Christian should be ashamed of what has happened to our country. I hope Sunday will come soon. Until then, we've been overrun by a thrice-married, cheating, lying, sociopathic, greedy atheist that only worships the almighty dollar. God save us.
"Steve Bannon's editor-in-Chief at Brietbart is a devout Orthodox Jew," Your sentence implies that the current EIC is an orthodox Jew. No mention of 2012. You might want to read up on what Ben Shapiro is saying about bannon today. He doesn't seem to be a supporter. The breitbart editor in chief is Alexander Marlow. Not a Jew. I don't find it unusual there are black people supporting 45. Not every black person is the same. Like not every Jew is the same. There are idiots in both. For example Ben Carson and Bibi Netanyahu.  I don't have to prove bannon is a racist. I've read what he's said and did you know he's a self proclaimed Leninist? Btw, I've been aware of breitbart longer than two months. I have right wingers in my family so I've been shown the intelligence of right wing news sites for quite a while. Yes, Lars, you are defending bannon. AND not doing a really good job of it, I might add.
white supremacists do not subjugate people for their religion and this is taking it a little too far to say that.   I believe that Islamist do not like jews or Christians because they feel inferior them.
80% of Muslims believe a man has the right to beat his wife if she disobeys him.  54% of Muslims believe homosexuals can be punished with death.  90% of all Muslims believe a woman is worth 1/2 the value of a man. 60% of all Muslims believe killing Jews is not a crime. 80% of Muslims want Sharia law in America. . Yea we want that in Canada and Justin is making sure we get it.
Agirl, is there any conspiracy theory that you don't buy into? The one you parrot this time is straight from Alex Jones, the Infowars sleazebag who makes his living off of gullible fools. I suppose you also believe the Sandy Hook massacre was faked, too? As for the "dancing Israelis", that's as true as Trump's "cheering Muslims". That must have been a sight, Israelis and Muslims dancing around the smoldering ashes of the Twin Towers! A sight indeed, Jews and Arabs getting together over a disaster!  Have you heard of Occam's razor? It says the simplest explanation for an event is usually the true one. The 9/11 attacks were certainly a conspiracy, carried out by mostly Saudi citizens, planned by the Saudi Osama bin Laden.  There's room for only one Alex Jones. Your conspiracy theories won't take you far in life.
most of my teachers were both cigarette addicts and buddhists.  if you weren't a buddhists, you were being persecuted every day.  buddhists love to persecute everyone who is not a buddhists.  there cruelty is there kindness!
The Buddhists teachers are using there religion to persecute and cause trouble to non-Buddhists.  Religion is a very big deal in the classrooms. Its all about greed, anger, and folly.
A Christian kid, a Muslim kid and an atheist kid are all sitting in the Principle's office for fighting. What's the Jewish kid say when he walks in?  "Hey, is that a quarter on the floor."
He does have a beautiful white robe with a pointy cap, accessorized with a beautiful armband with a swastika on it. And let's not forget that manifesto in his hand signed by Hitler lauding the killing of Jews, Blacks, and all other non-whites who do not support the supremacy of the Aryan race.
Only angry fools would tear up Korans or believe that doing something like that is helpful.  And most people know that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and just trying to earn a living like everyone else. Still, our self described "thought leaders" need to dial back the tolerance shaming when perfectly reasonable people ask such questions as: * Why is an inordinate amount of violence in the world associated with Islamic societies? * Why are western progressives silent on the incongruities between women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and religious and cultural relativism? * Why do certain parliamentary motions imply that some religions are more worthy of protection than others? * Why are requests for religious accommodation in schools and other places made by Muslims often treated more solicitously than similar requests made by Christians, Jews, Hindus et al?   The answers are rooted in politics and cowardice.  Muslims are the biggest losers when such questions go unanswered.
He's a jew.
Sorry Robin. If we're going to judge Muslims by the worst element then we're going to do the same for Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Scientologists.
As I mentioned, I've read "The Pope and Mussolini." I've not read the ""The Popes Against the Jews" and never claimed otherwise. You've obviously read neither.  Where's the citations from my "inexhaustible supply of anti-Catholic authors"? Or are you just a trash talker who can't walk the walk?
Side note: Regarding the comment about Trump "allowing" his daughter marry a Jew. I'm not sure what century this person is living in? Does a man need to give permission to his grown daughter to marry whoever the hell she wants?  I suggest the author of this editorial put that bit in quotations, to clarify that these words are those of the Nazi scum, and not the author of the editorial.
Such simple minded snowflakes. So sure of your silly selves as you out hate and intolerate those you accuse of same .So quick to judge before you even finish a news report,let alone research the story further.  Its stated that the threats are multiple and sophisticated. The FBI has contacted Interpol about similar invents in Britain. Some are investigating that the calls  could had been generated overseas.   Whom internationally have attacked Jews repeatedly and have even called for the complete destruction and death of all in Israel? Couldn't be factions of your darling misunderstood liberal loved flavor of the month bunch could it,Sherlock? Heavens forbid!  Perhaps prudence would call for a moments patience for investigated facts to confirm identity be it Nazi white hate pieces of shite or a particular portion of your beloved Ali babas.
You just might be a racist. How do you know who is an Arab,  anyhow? Someone who looks just almost like a Jew or an Italian?
Or it is heartbreaking for a segregationist American southerner that his Lord is much darker than him.  Plus most of those churches were built after Europeans had seen Jews. The original Jews were darker that the Europeans. Centuries of intermixing, rape, etc have made some Jews blonde and blue eyed.
Well, considering that her party hates Jewish people, she fits right in.
This is idiotic.  White guys organize to pursue their interests just like Jews organize to pursue their interests...and blacks, etc. etc.  None of these biologically determined groups are better than others, they are all for themselves and against others.  This is what is "self-evident".  Why didn't these people care about the marchers in Tel Aviv chanting "Death to Arabs!"?  Or complain about AIPAC supporting a racist like Netanyahu?  The weird thing is to see, for example, Jewish or Black groups complaining about white supremacist groups.  On what basis?  They are just like these other groups which espouse anti racism but are racist by virtue of their mere existence.  Hate knows no race, it is present in any of these ethnically defined groups.  Guess who monitors hate?  The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish organization that finds anti-semitism everywhere.  Guess who holds white groups liable?  The Southern Poverty Law Center, another Zionist (racist) organization.  All hypocrites.
As an atheist  I respect the right of people to practice whatever absurd religion that they choose, to express their beliefs, to assemble with others at religious service and to be free to change those beliefs at any time.  Religious customs , traditions and practices are another matter altogether, in particular  when they impact non believers .  Facial covering such as the Niqab is not a requirement of Islam , it originated in certain pre Islamic Arabian cultures, imported from a region of  Saudi Arabia calked Nadj...it is worn by a small minority of Muslims....it is banned in countries such as Chad, Cameroons, Niger, Congo Brazzaville, Turkey, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Egypt...Morroco recently banned burquas for security reasons for obvious reasons.  It is naive to believe that the wearing of facial coverings cannot be abused...they have been and will be...there is nothing " civilzed" about them.
Trump is just an awful and petty little man that is out to erase all things Obama. He doesn't care what it does to Americans.    Surprise, surprise another fake xtian voted into office by other fake xtians.  I wonder if he will quote Two Corinthians while ruining the lives of "the least of these".    These days, far more atheists are better at living Christ-like lives than so many of today's so-called xtians that are white supremacists and/or Dominiinists.
My comparison is between historical Jew-hatred and gay-hatred. Now you say the Jews are goodies but the gays are still baddies. That was not the teaching of the Church until 1965. You are right that the modern church condemns antisemitism. It also condemns a way of talking about gays that you may be guilty of. But historically the church demonized gays and burnt sodomites at the stake. That is the parallel I was talking about. Marranos were treated in the same way. Now we are apologizing profusely to Jews day in day out, and rightly; we cannot apologize enough. But as Cardinal Reinhard Marx stated in Ireland last years, the Church owes an apology to gays as well. Asked about this, Pope Francis agreed, but then drowned the fish by saying "and we must apologize to the poor etc etc."
Might as well have one for the Protestants, Jehova Witnesses, Seven-Day Adventists,  the Baptists,  the Hindus, the Sikhs, Taoism, Wicca, Druze, Buddhism, Judaism, Gnostic, Hellenistic, oh I forgot... Orthodox, Amish,  Mennonites, etc. This way, the town will be for dead people only.
staunch religion hating atheist here; remove the sarcasm from your comment and I'm with you.  Christians are indeed hypocrites, but they use the voting booth to further their backward agenda not AK-47's and machetes.   I hate Christianity.  I hate Islam and fear it immensely.
Fine, let's say for every one of the white supremacists at the rally there is 100 more in the closet and 1000 more who are active sympathizers to the idea that all blacks and jews should be murdered.  That's about 110,000 people.  Sound better?  Again, there are 325 million people in the USA.
There is no place for a bunch of Ku-Ku-Klowns in Canada. In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century an English  three Canadians was a member of the white supremacist organization Anglo-Saxon, WASP equivalent to the United States ("White Anglo-Saxon Protestants").  Four members have been Prime Ministers of Canada; Sir John A. Macdonald (father of « Canadian Federation » of 1867 but not « Father of Canada » which is Sir Samuel de Champlain in 1608 ),  Sir John Abbott,  Sir Mackenzie Bowell (a past « Grand Master » (?)),  and John Diefenbaker.   In 1927 the “Orange” movement gave birth to a more intolerant and racist group, the Canadian Ku Klux Klan, which had its deepest roots in small towns in Saskatchewan because of the "yellow peril", but also because of the blacks...Jews...Catholics... The “Ku Ku Nest” in the province campaigned against= teaching French + wearing the religious habit + the presence of crucifixes in schools (more to come)
Within days of the Democrats no longer needing Jews' votes and campaign contributions, Obama stabs Israel in the back. No coincidence . . .
Soros has no scruples when it comes to making money even from his fellow Jews in Hungary 1944.....    KROFT: My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted godson.  SOROS: Yes. Yes.  KROFT: Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from your fellow Jews, friends and neighbors.  SOROS: Yes. That’s right. Yes.  KROFT: I mean, that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many, years. Was it difficult?  SOROS: No, not at all. Not at all, I rather enjoyed it.  KROFT: No feelings of guilt?  SOROS: No, only feelings of absolute power.  This Nazi collaborator pig spent millions trying to get Crooked Hillary elected, and is now spending millions to remove Donald Trump.  And liberals think white supremacists are bad?
Yeah, and Breitbart is pro-Israel and run mostly by Jews.  Come on dude, spend more than 2 minutes at a site before you make an idiot of yourself.
And what of all the conservatives who have killed Muslims or people of color in mass shooting incidents?  It has no bearing on the average person what political leaning or belief system the person held. It doesn't represent the majority.  A helpful narrative would be finding ways for atheists and Christians to come together respectfully and strengthen our shared values, rather than assume that our fellow citizens are complicit in carnage and violence. That's how hate is bred.
"Cinnamon Hitler"? Yes, Trump is exactly like Hitler, what with his half Jewish grandkids and the millions of people he's sent to concentration camps and the world war that he started. Idiot.
there is a difference between anti-Muslim hate and concern regarding the spread of Islamic thought.   Considering that there are large numbers of Catholic and Jewish cemeteries in Canada, if you would deny someone the simple comfort of the burial custom of their religious affiliation, you seem simply filled with animus.   Being wary regarding the spread of Islam however is another matter. The Islamic world, after reaching it's competitive cultural and technological peak 800 years ago, has stagnated since. Islam itself has never undergone a Renaissance or Enlightenment and it has never been forced to confront its theocratic assumptions as Christianity was forced to do under the West's expansion of pure science, philosophy, political theory technological innovation, and secularization... where are the Islamic world's da Vinci, Galileo, Kant, Voltaire, Smith, Marx, or Watt, its Oxfords or MITs, or even its defenders of the simple concept of the separation of church and state ?
This is typical anti-Israel bias at the UN - Saudi Arabia is on the human rights council, a country where having a vagina disqualifies you from driving and people are killed for "blasphemy" - what amounts to your average Family Guy joke. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation or OIC represents one of the strongest power brokers in the UN due to their size, 57 members with a particular fondness of Islamism. They often put forward resolutions making it "illegal" to criticize Islam  - no one is able to dispute the fact a blind illiterate mystic was "enlightened" by the archangel Gabriel to create a book that seems to share uncanny similarities with Christianity and Judaism (pardon my blasphemous digression but you get the point). The UN has no credibility - it is an exercise in futility and hypocrisy that accomplishes nothing beyond strongly worded statements. Zimbabwe, North Korea, Iran, China, Russia, Syria, Yemen  - who are we kidding?.
"...pander to Jewish voters..." - Alceste  My, my, look at the racist who usually hides under his thin veneer posing as the resident intellectual poo-bah dispensing truth and wisdom for  us lesser beings. Commentators on the Left not only continuously demonstrate reverse-racism against whites, Jews and older white males in particular - even when they themselves are washed-up old legal beagles - their complete intolerance for any view other than a so-called Progressive one - about as progressive as Communism ever was in its heyday (newsflash - the Dream is over), is sadly ironic. It is also rather comical to watch them bow and scrape to the multi-culti god they have created out of their deep and pervasive ignorance, shame and self doubt regarding our shared Western cultural heritage - the most progressive on the planet when compared to the truly xenophobic Middle Eastern and Asian cultures that either do not allow immigrants or do not grant citizenship.  Wake up Lefty "useful idiots".
This seems a bit far fetched even if the Anti-Defamation League asked Trump to reconsider. Trump is not saying, "America First...except for you Jews." Maybe the ADL is being a bit overly sensitive...but then, that's what they do.
Clearly such a politically-motivated article, intended to elicit sympathy for only Muslims. What it doesnt say, quite intentionally, is that 2/3 of hate crimes are committed against Jews, who represent less the 1% of Canada's population, and that the majority of these crimes are committed by Muslims.
Ironically, the German's guilt relates to the extermination of jews and homosexuals yet they are trying to  assuage their guilt by letting in the very people who hate jews and homosexuals.
Apostasy is turning away from religious principles, as we all know. What you need to do is show that apostacy is, in fact, taking place. "Malachi Martin says so" is laughable.  If you mean things like, "Vatican II rejected Eugene IV's statement that that all Jews will go to Hell", I would reply that it was correct to do so.  Eugene was saying that a loving, merciful and just God actually has none of those attributes. His God was a bigot, condemning people for what they were, not anything they had done. Sending Jews to Hell because they are Jews is on exactly the same moral level as Hitler sending Jews to Auschwitz because they were Jews.
Wonder if this writer is mormon ? Why else would she or anyone want him..He's a two time loser with a nasty,holier that thou attitude..Poor loser too.
He actually isn't. He is a comedian. Listen to his videos. Read what we has to say. He does NOT hate Jews and his supporters and listeners know that.  The only hardcore anti semites in the modern world are radical Muslims.
We live in the west, my family killed Nazis, only dealings with Jews was in school, neighborhood, friendship, business, Hunting, fishing trips, ect. Don't f-ck with my friends. I have had hunting and fishing friends that were native American, married to one, white boys, Negros, Chinese, Hmong, great hunters, some mutts like myself. This society has gone insane, letting a small group of manipulating revolutionaries control the weak minded, drug impaired zombies.
Has there never been a high-ranking Imam,  Rabbi or Buddhist Monk charged with a crime?  Why single out the Catholic Church?  Sounds like another sorry attack on organized religion.  Apparently, you can't judge an institution by a few wrongdoers -- except in the case of the Catholic Church.
Yep,  Qur'an admonishes to "seek the middle way" and avoid extremes to either side.  I was once told by a Buddhist they have a similar teaching.  And moderates know from experience that extremists on either side will hate 'em for it.  Eh.  Can't please everyone.  Been nearly half a century since I've been inclined to try.  The difference nowadays--and I really do think it's symptomatic of our society crumbling--is that mutually respectful disagreement seems to be a lost art, as in:  "You don't THINK like me?  GASP!  YOU'RE.THE.DEVIL!"  Nonetheless my intention is to hold mutually respectful discourse with you, whether we agree or not.  And I really do try to "vote' on comments according to whether they're expressed civilly, rather than whether or not I agree with 'em.  Tried voting "civil" on everything, but that isn't allowed.  Might try voting everything "uncivil" (except my friends' posts) and see what happens.
Nicely written, Neal, cogent, well-informed, & logical. But when did "information" or "logic" have much to do with supporting Trump? DJT is the vehicle for the resentments of folks who not only believe they've gotten a rotten deal (& a lot of them actually have) but also blame their distress on "the other" (i.e., blacks, immigrants, Jews, Muslims, intellectuals, etc.) rather than the actual source of their plight (i.e., the Neo-Liberal capitalist "winner take all" economy & the GOP politicians who support & perpetuate that economy). When the Tea-Party activists & other "low-information" people vote for the likes of Trump, they are actually voting against their own long-term best interests. But their resentments & lack of basic reality checks overcome their instincts for self-preservation & their ability to figure out they're being take for a ride. Trump, who makes his products overseas & trucks in foreign workers proclaims bald-faced lies – the fools believe those lies. Sad.
phobia is a fear of heights or water. Religion is a set of ideas. Anti-semitism another term that is odd, semites are Hebrews and Arabs its a language group therefore its not correct. Anti-Jewish yes, anti-Muslim correct. All these other catch phrases manufactured by the elite just dont have the facts to back up these silly slogans.
That's a wildly false equivalence.  It was never about a message on the cake, it was always about the identity of the customers.    If a bakery refused to sell a cake to a customer because he was white, that would be illegal.  If a bakery refused to sell a cake to a customer because they were Jewish or Muslim or Christian, that would be illegal.  This shouldn't be a hard concept to grasp.
The only selfish ones are the Arabs that have 22 countries and want a 23rd. Lots of other places, and furthermore Arab places, where Palestinians could acquire land and live in peace. They could do it, but so far they are more interested in eliminating the one and only Jewish state.
http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/how-the-faithful-voted-a-preliminary-2016-analysis/.    71% of Jews for Clinton with 81% of white Evangelicals for tRump.  It is interesting how the most corrupt always wear their piousness on their sleeve, no matter their religious affiliation. They cry loud and clear for all to hear how holy holy holy they are while they violate all the religious ideals and principles.   Jews are historically Democrat and stood by people of color during civil rights and protested the Vietnam war.  They are victims of antisemitism from the right (again rearing it's ugly, dangerous head in public). They just want the Christians to leave them alone  but  Christians persist in blaming them for killing the Jewish rabbi, Jesus, when in fact it was the occupying Romans. They cultivate hate.    So please do not lump my relatives in with the white evangelical Christians, the white supremacists, the Nazis and the KKK. Those are the tRump voters.
And in other news, anti-Jewish bigotry and incitement to violence given a green light.  Now get out there and a punch a Jew! Oh sorry, punch a Zionist!!  Student politician who called for Zionists to be punched escapes sanction from his peers - NP  Those nutty liberals....one religion good, another religion bad.
Because Greenblatt's stunt of registering as a Muslim is based on the mistaken notion that efforts to curb  domestic terrorism by Muslim extremists is rooted in nothing but bigotry.  By trying to condemn LE's efforts to stop terrorism, he puts a principal targets of these terrorists - - Jewish people -- at greater risk.
Why on Earth does Milos, a gay, Jewish, Greek immigrant to Britain living in the US, think the alt-right in America has a place for him? The American alt-right is a tempered version of the far-right.  The alt-right wears the same tribal feathers as the KKK and David Duke. In their glory days, all of them would have been hunting for gays, Jews, and Southern European immigrants in America, and yet he seeks their company.
Don't forget the Armenia holocaust of 1 million Christians and that six million number has been officially revised by the Holocaust authorities themselves.  Let's talk about the Jihad against Indians shall we, Koenard Elst in Negationism in India gives an estimate of 80 million Hindus killed in the total jihad against India and let's not forget why the Crusades happened! It was because of 400 years of islamic barbarism,  Can we forget how Mohammed thanked the Jews who helped him in Medina? He killed them, chopped off their heads.  Some prophet, killing God's chosen and those Nazi's weren't Christians! It is also estimated that Over 110 Million Blacks were killed by Islam.  So Christians can hardly be considered the biggest mass murderers, it isn't any surprise who really are the biggest mass murderers in history, estimated at a whopping  250 million and that is muslims.
"We reserve the right to refuse service to ..." Blacks, Jews, Irish, gays, Catholics. That what you mean?  The right of the private owner to practice discrimination is a bogus "right".   The government has always defined the rights of citizens. It's one of the things that governments do.
So, you feel that WORKING FOR the people running the death camps which were killing communists, Russians, Jews and other undesirables was preferable to STOPPING those deathcamps from committing even more war crimes and mass murder? With friends like you, Freeland needs no enemies.
There is no place for religious accommodation in my Canada. Religions of every kind are a cancer on the human race that breed intolerance, contempt and ultimately violence by those who simply take their fairy-tales way too seriously. I don't care if you're Muslim, Christian, Jewish or Rastafarian; it's all nonsense.
Time to boycott all those who contribute to Jew hatred like yourself and the Islamists in our midst who donate to Middle East countries that engage in terrorism, female genital mutilation, honor killings of wives and daughters, gay apartheid, female segregation and rape, extrajudicial hangings, and every other human rights abuse.
The "ontologically changed" Father Gil Gustafson is so convinced that public accountability helps the pedophile recover, that he refuses to tell us how many children he abused. Legal considerations.  There is within Buddhist teaching a difference between compassion and what is known as idiot compassion. If Father Gustafson is recovering  nicely from acting upon his temptation to sexually assault children perhaps he can take his recovery to a monastery cell to pray for all  his unnamed struggling victims, their struggling families  and the countless child victims of his countless colleagues who engage in his level of ontological narcissism.   Next, will there will be discussions of recovering ontologically changed serial killers grateful for their graced recoveries?   AW
Did you watch the videos? Only one side was chanting about killing Jewish people and listening to a KKK leader speak.
Wearing swastikas, making zeig heil salutes, shouting "blood and soil" and "Jews will not replace us" and championing an ideology that executed millions of civilians is a more accurate definition of fascism. Unless of course you're a Nazi apologist...
that rounding up the homeless/mentally ill  people and then determining where they go ...............scary words and ideas  ...sounds like part of the Nazi agenda .. jews, mentally ill, homosexuals, gypsies, , et al.  got  pretty raw deal...
Gary, it's human nature to want to feel good about ourselves. If someone doesn't have self-esteem, the only way to feel better is to put someone else down. Indians, Blacks, Chinese, Jews, Mexicans. Poor people, women, diff-abled. There will always be groups of people whose only sense of self-worth will come from targeting someone they feel is lesser-than.
He is no more like atheists in Eugene than any conservative mass murderer is like conservatives in Eugene.   I detest and rebuke your broad strokes grouping of people. It's disgusting and it encourages hate.
An Imam who teaches at Ryerson was caught preaching the extermination of Jews. Why wouldn't  we be concerned if  If young Muslim teenagers  believe Jews should be killed and pray for it in school, too.
Muslims and liberals excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of Christianity, Europe and America, destructive iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal wars between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects, ISIS , Taliban and Al Quada are the root causes of most of the wars and social chaos happening around the world today. It is worse than anything expressed in the west, even by trolls.
My understanding is that the Burmese lived with the Rohingya Muslim presence for a century and a half, during which the Rohingya increased greatly in number through procreation. Troubles began when the Rohingya gained a significant local majority and started persecuting non-Muslims in their vicinity. Beheadings of Buddhist monks and, finally, the brutal rape and killing of a woman by the Muslims touched off the current violence. So it's questionable whether the Rohingyas are the victims here.
But it's OK when atheists and secularists do it?  What gives you the moral or ethical grounds to hate and discriminate against me and my two wives?
Russia has been bombing hospitals in Syria. Russia has killed dissidents. Putin was a KGB agent. They've killed millions. They've banned free press. They abuse their LGBT people. They've hacked our country and others. But you're right. We should just stand back and let them do whatever they want because it isn't us. Those who stand for nothing, fall for everything. They came for the Jews but I wasn't Jewish........
Sorry to play the smug card, but we atheists can only roll our eyes at the poison religion provides.
Wow, you just can't get any more ignorant than this!  Mohammed was a child molester who married a 9-year-old girl. He had multiple wives, divorcing some of them who displeased him and left them destitute. He advocated the rape and killing of women Jewish and Christian women simply because they didn't choose to join his cult. If that's raising the status of women in his time ... well, your definition must be different than mine.  If you turn to John 3:16 and read the verses following, you would know that Jesus did not define love as accepting the immoral behavior of others as normal. But, of course, that would require actually reading the Bible.  Jesus quoted extensively from the Old Testament (every book but Ester) and made it clear that the Law was of value for knowing how to live a moral life. Before you say what he would have believed in, you might want to know what He pointed His followers to believe in. He expected them to show love without compromising morality.
So Eugene IV's Cantate Domino is still in full force. It says that Jews are automatically going to Hell. No ifs, ands or buts.
Look like another ignorant racist needs some lessons. a) Jews are Arabs (confirmed by DNA testing) they were classified as whites by Apartheid government (whilst other Arabs where not)  So in fact there are 6 whites and 10 non whites. b) The minister specifically pointed out Afrikaners not whites.  How does this  endanger anyone?  Lets look as some realities 1) If the Bantu education system was so bad why were there more black lawyers than white lawyers in South Africa during apartheid, more black doctors than white doctors? All these blacks got their degrees from Universities funded by the Whites. The thousands of blacks who got their degrees during the 70s and 80s are proof that blacks did have access to good education, the problem was most were to lazy to make the sacrifice needed to get educated. 2) Whats stopping you and all other blacks from joining the 2 blacks on the list, after all they had the same hurdles to jump you did? So stop blaming whites for your lack of will power.
The KKK and Nazis hate Jews. Trump is surrounded by Jews. His daughter is a convert and his son in law is Orthodox Jewish. Trump's grandchildren are Jewish. Before you go there, Trump also has a black friend named Dr. Ben Carson.
Actually the article says it was a sophisticated call made to look like it came from within the building, similar to the 13 other calls to Jewish centers on Monday....in other words it was a form of terrorism against Jews across our Nation on Monday....could be white anti-Semites or just as likely, Muslim terrorists.
Dave, we have to be careful about equivalents. Start with the fact that the white supremacists and Nazis want to purge America of Jews, blacks, minorities and immigrants. That in and of itself is the antithesis of what America is. They are hateful, racist and anti-semitic. Black Lives Matter wants to call attention to (in addition to many other things) the systemic aspects of our justice system that result in the deaths and incarceration of black people at a much higher rate than other populations. They not only do not advocate violence, they advocate justice, peace and love in engagements with others. Now, the reality with both groups may be that there are people who claim affiliation who act with violence (or others claim that the violent are affiliated with the organization.) But that does not make the groups equivalent. They are not. And to believe they are is to admit to some sympathy with the white supremacists. There is no other possible conclusion.
In a post three days after the inauguration of Donald Trump, Christian posted: “If Donald Trump is the Next Hitler then I am joining his SS to put an end to Monotheist Question. All Zionist Jews, All Christians who do not follow Christ's teaching of Love, Charity, and Forgiveness And All Jihadi Muslims are going to Madagascar or the Ovens/FEMA Camps!!! Does this make me a fascist!!! #MonotheistHolocaust
maybe.  this is a continuation of a robo call to Jewish centres throughout North America.  Not sure why but I would suggest Trump has unleashed the worst in people.
Sad thing is they are all waiting for and trying to bring on the same god.  Muslims, Christians, Jews all revere the same book and the same hellish daddy in heaven.  What's a pagan to do?  The bathturds have even stolen our pagan holy tree for their miserable annual ceremony.
I think if you are a gay Muslim or a Jewish teacher trying to teach Muslim kids in the public school system, you might be quite affected.
It looks like crap! if I was Jewish, i would not give one damn dime to this monstrous pile of concrete!! I hope the Canadian government didn't have to cover this pile of garbage, its disgusting and obviously a snow job by the architect who got paid millions for this mess!
I see the psycho cat hating muslim is still trying to make every story about Amy.  you always manage to weave you're hatred for Caucasians, Jews and Christians into you're fanatic diatribes. The fact that you work for the federal government should be a concern for everyone. jones is not the story here. get over it. aloha snackbar.
The malignancy is the cancer of atheistic progressive collectivism that has eaten away the intellect and morality of Bernstein's mind and his ilk. The condition is akin to rabies in a dog.
Typical liberal Jew. Where is Hitler when we need him?
"Justin Trudeau says he uses cash-for-access fundraisers to champion the middle class."  LOL. Literally. Good one!  Sure, I bet that's worth reading.   Thanks Globalist & Fail. Thanks for the comic relief but still not paying to laugh at your headlines. Gimme a call and ask if I want a subscription again you pressitutes.  PS: If you were worth reading I'd pay for you instead of trolling you traitorous fools.  PPS: To the suckers assuming I'm partisan. Grew up with G&M in the home. Lifelong atheist. Bite me.
As someone who was brought up in a religious family with two christian preachers, my life turned around for the better and I became a real productive member of society when I went to community college and gained job skills. You call me a loser but in fact you don't even know who you're talking to except someone who doesn't share your point of view. The problem with religious actions like this is people wasting all that energy and resources on something that is not even real! So that is why I say pathetic- someone trying but failing majorly to do any good.  And bronze age zombie jew- welp, those are just facts. Except zombies aren't real! (Some might say ancient desert tribe with no knowledge of how reality works, rather than bronze age, but I don't think that's what you are really attempting to dispute.) When you perceive reality as a slur, you need to examine your beliefs. I suggest doing what Descartes did- doubt all that you believe to be true, *everything*.
Oh you must be right.. that's why their called CSIS??? for Christian state of Iraq? or is it BSIS? for buddhist state of Iraq? hang on, it's ISIS... ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ  Shocked by the blatent stupidity and lack of common sense here guys... please.
Islamic radicalisation is ingrained into young minds around the dinner table, as the family enjoys mom's home cooking, and children listen to their elders talk about killing Jews, stabbing infidels, beheading Christians , burning churches, and bombing Israel for Islam, for Allah. It is the same way young Christians are taught about Jesus's charity to to help the poor and sick.
her grandfather was a Nazi , or a Nazi collaborator and  clearly  a propagandist.  Basic fact .   Her  grandfather helped kill Jews in the millions  Has she ever admitted this  fact while attacking Russia today and defending Nazi collaborators in her own family ???
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTDvh5IiPPo  So many of the protesters are not the stereotypical white Anglo Saxon racists,  as is always the implication of such  stories, but immigrants from eastern countries,  Hindus,  Buddhists  and various brown skinned people who know first hand what living amongst Muslims is all about. Many are in Canada precisely because  Muslim violent aggressions  drove them out of their home lands.
What you wrote shows you did not listen or follow along with the narration of what occurred. On a serious note I am NOT defending Nazis. I am stating reality, which you willfully ignore.  What you and the other trolls keep ignoring is that I have stated many times here I am from a multi-racial family. We are black, white, Mexican, Jewish, et al. I also had a family member murdered by the KKK, so save your ignorant accusations for those in your bubble. People like you are as ignorant as the racists because you only believe what you want, reality had no part in it.
Why are there any prayers at school?  Far as I know Christians, Sikhs, Hindus, Jews.... any other religion does not have prayers in schools so WHY THE F ARE MUSLIMS PRAYING IN SCHOOLS? WTF is going on here?
There are Jews of every race, so that won't score any points when you play Blame the Race Game. Your observation that "52% of homicides committed by black are only convictions" is a much stronger play when you embark on the fool's errand of trying to correlate melanin levels and crime.
I think most Canadians have a fear of what Islam may do to our country . Our country was founded on Judeo/Christian values which are a direct opposite to the teaching of the Qu'ran ie; Qu'ran 5 :51 "Do not take Jews and Christians as Allies "! Can you truly tell me that Muslims will vow to follow our Christian values over Islam ? Why is it that Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia , Oman , Bahrain , Kuwait and Qatar will not take any Syrian Refugees ?
He's more outraged at this than a bunch of Nazi's marching around saying "Jews will not replace us" and he is more attentive of it than the disaster in Puerto Rico.  You know, part of the USA?
The teaching of Paul IV is more likely to have led many to hell -- or to have led them to construct a hell on earth for Jews. "By their fruits you shall know them."
Very interesting comments so far. Most quote some facts that help their positions but the one fact is that all Religions are not compatible with Islam. One reason being there is a growing ignorance of Christianity and the truths of Jesus, but also an ignorance of the historical beginnings and teachings of Islam. People need to educate themselves. Islam in North America is called the "Religion of Peace" but their Mid East roots do not support this assumption. Islam is a Political entity that must rule not just be a Religion as we see everywhere it dominates as in many African and all Mid Eastern Countries. These Countries have blasphemy laws protecting only Islam, WHY?? They are expecting those same laws of protection as we see now being put forward by Islamic people in our political system. Once in power force becomes their means of making sure they remain in power. Research yourself, Islams god IS NOT the same God of Christians and Jews as they say. They are counting on your Ignorance
"I am concerned that, whether they are conscious of it or not, the white men who would vote for Trump have never fully accepted women and people of color as equals..."  Not only these, but also LGBT folks and Jews, two other groups many of these white supremacist types hate.
Don't want to leave anyone out.    Sandy Hook Elementary School - children murdered by a heavily armed JEWISH white guy.  There fixed it for ya.
No more niqqers nips spics or Jews
>> But they didn't kill the Jews by the thousands or millions  They didn't? What kind of "Hindustan" math are you using?
Your ignorance is showing , diverdave, but I am glad for the opportunity to educate. Objecting to Israel's Apartheidism, racism, colonialism, is objecting to human rights violations which is what Jewish Voice for Peace does among many good human beings. I am a supporter of JVP. I follow CHRISTIAN Peacemaker reports from Hebron. They try to protect school children from Attacks by brutal Illegal Israeli settlers. ." The UN takes First Concrete Step To Hold ISRAEL Accountable for Violating Palestinian Human Rights." BDSMOVEMENT.NET Jewish Voice for Peace reports.
Wow ... It's a take on Hitler's speech to the German people after his ascendancy - the same themes, ideas, proposed actions, beliefs and the strident exceptionalism. And Muslims take the place of the Jews in our new "post truth" age.  Frightening - and a terrible harbinger for the future.
We'd all be speaking German and they'd be no Jews (or Gypsies, or gays, etc.) left.  But perhaps you'd like that better.
"... but no one wants one Jewish state with disaffected, disenfranchised Palestine..."  Unfortunately, that is precisely what the Israeli right wing want (assuming they can't get rid of the Palestinians altogether).
Classic Zio lies. "...the caller ID made it seem as if the call was coming from our own office..." Im sure it did.   Nobody is calling Jews with bomb threats folks. Pathetic.
Holy Crap Rabbi!!  Read the damn Qur'an yourself. Sharia Law  for Muslim's is akin to the 10 Commandments for the Jews.  Infidels are worthy only of death. Guess what? YOU are an infidel.  Learn about Taqiiyya. It is the Muslims moral authority to lie to infidels if it furthers their cause.  World domination by Muslims is the point.  Fortunately there are two different factions: Sunni and Shiite. And, get a load of this, each think the other infidels.  Thats why there has been no peace in the middle east since about 700AD. Taqiyya also teaches its followers, if in a foreign country, to adopts its ways and means and obey the law of that given country.  But once they outnumber you, well it's Katie bar the door.
The Imam quoted in the article hosted last year an Egyptian "scholar" who calls for slaying of Jews, and destruction of Russians, Hindus, Shiites, Christians, Americans, Europeans.
Is this tem necessary for your discussion?  "Schmuck", or "shmuck", in American English is a pejorative term meaning one who is stupid or foolish, or an obnoxious, contemptible or detestable person."  "In The Joys of Yiddish, Leo Rosten wrote: "Never use schmuck lightly, or in the presence of women and children", which was a common view among Jewish people who felt a connection to the language, and who still viewed it as an obscene reference to a penis.
Newsflash: if you are Jewish and you work for or stand with an anti-Semitic White Supremacist, then YOU TOO are complicit.
Wow, just wow.  You are brutally uninformed.  Almost half the cemeteries in Toronto are for specific religions.  Mount Hope Catholic Cemetery is just one of them to answer your ludicrous question and there are many Jewish only cemeteries.  Your ignorance to this matter is astounding.  There are thousands of cemeteries across Canada that are Christian only.  Try getting an education.
Precisely. Despite both Sunni and Shiite being blood feud enemies, they both agree that  Christians and Jews and non believers,  must die . They will put aside their religious  differences so they can  to kill us together.
Ok, hide behind the technicality of his long term, well publicized objective.  Remain oblivious to the obvious.  You espouse nonsense of further galvanizing Muslims, something that would have all ready taken place these past 20 years, but has not.  The worst crimes of all have been committed by al qaeda, ISIL, al shabaab, boko haram et cetera, against Sunni and Shiia Muslims, a point not lost on Muslims, but beyond the grasp of the liberal-left of the west.  I never thought that destroying what can be only defined as evil now falls under the term of bigotry.  Step forth in the light and be healed.
"and all the other groups of Muslims in many countries around the world , that want to destroy Jews, Christians and non believers"   that would be all of islam
When are Indians going to join the American Tribe and stop whining about the past?  Jews have a similar or worse past yet seek to integrate not segregate themselves .
bunch of cowards do this, whether it is against Jews , Muslims, Sikhs ,blacks, Asians, Indians, Pakistani's etc etc. Let them come out  and show their faces. Bunch of creeps.
BDS and its anti-Israel ilk have only come of age in the past decade (formed in 2005) and not decades, and so has the apartheid slur, none of which has eliminated Israel or Zionism which is the objective.  Bomb threats against Jewish institutions are now the last resort of these scoundrels and their fellow travelers. Scum attracts scum.
Agnostic means Ignoramus - or without knowledge. There is knowledge, but you do not accept it as such. "The Heavens Declare the Glory of God" as the Psalms say. There is a good debate I think you would enjoy listening to, it is on Youtube and is called Bahnsen vs Stein, does God exist. Stein was one of the Agnostic leaders in his day in the 80's. I truly believe you would understand more about Christians and Atheists  if you listened to it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anGAazNCfdY just humor me OK ?  Sincerely - your friend the Troll.
Nothing gets the leftist wasp nest going like Christianity and threats to abortion. 45 likes; congratulations. How many of you have ever actually been oppressed by a Christian for Christian reasons? And you do know that there are millions of anti-abortion atheists.They are simply people that want no part of a barbaric procedure of convenience in order to escape the consequences of an irresponsible decision. You are so quick to characterize all Christians by this man's actions, actually only threats, and draw some kind of moral equivalence to Muslim extremists around the world who are murdering in the most brutal ways imaginable. Most of the killing done by "Christian" countries has many different geopolitical reasons. With Muslim extremists it's all the same. Convert or die. Also you might look at the historical death toll of your fellow travelers on the left (a religion). I'll get you started: Joseph Stalin, 20 million dead; Mao, 15-45 million dead; Pol Pot 6 million dead; Hitler.....
"Jewish greed isn't something  Jews do; it's something they have whether they like it or not. I'm Jewish, and I don't like it; I don't think it's fair, but I still know I have it..."  "Black violence isn't something Black people do; it's something they have whether they like it or not. I'm Black, and I don't like it; I don't think it's fair, but I still know I have it..."  Do you get it, now?
well, yes, he didn't want to abolish it, only fulfill that covenant and beginning a new covenant. That's why Judaism is the OT. But seeing as how the Jews killed him, it makes sense to have a different covenant, particularly since most Jews deny his claim. Islam, on the other hand, ditches all the previous lore as 'corrupted' so that it could fit whatever pillaging and killing Mo was up to.
The problem with saying "Some Muslims are terrorists. So are some Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists or even atheists" is it is taking the particular and trying to apply it as a principle. Some Muslims are terrorist because the religious structure and principles of Islam supports it. The same for atheism, the religious structure is a total reliance on person and mankind's structures as the standard. It allows for socialism and communism to also be terrorist (Stalin, Hitler) Buddhism structurally and in principle do not produce terror. The same with Christianity, there may be some calling themselves Christian who might be terrorists but the structure and principles soundly reject them as Christian. But in Islam, almost none denounced 911, the PLO lobbing bombs into residential areas, wife beating. I have Muslims from te middle East working for me, I am a Christian but in frank discussion, they tell me they can not become a Christian because their family would at best disown at worse kill them
Everyone in that crowd who was carrying tiki torches and chanting "Jew will not replace us!" and "blood and soil!" is a terrorist. Do your research.
So you are a neo-nazi using a meme from 4chan by calling other non-jews Goyim?   Do you find satisfaction in running down other ethnic/religious groups? Do you not have empathy?  I know you are probably trolling, but seriously taking the Nazi road is pretty dumb.
Steve Bannon is the puppeteer that controls Trump, he feels that he has been elected President, with his influence over Trump, could be true.  Let me quote from Steve Bannon; "Dick Cheney, Darth Vader, Satan, That's power.  It only helps when they (liberals) get it wrong." also "Scrap establishment Republican Party and start anew with Trump's movement."  how about; "We don't believe there is a functional conservative party in this country and we certainly don't think the Republican is that." Steve Bannon belongs to the Alt-Right, he told his wife that he did not want his children going to school with Jewish children. The last quote from Steve: "Are there Racist people involved in the alt-right? ABSOLUTELY.
I won't bake you a cake because you are Jewish.  Take your business to the baker down the street.  He serves your kind.
If western  European Christians defended their Jewish citizens, the latter would not need to flee.  The fact they must flee means  that European Christian are  stagnant  pond scum..............
Saunders  offers the phrases : "(terms that, in Mr. Higgins’s ideological circles, generally refer to Jews and Muslims)."  and   "moral and professional strength" .  The self righteous arrogant Trump hating self identifying "progressives" always get around to the centrality of their narrative. To wit that they are "professional"(read intelligent) and "moral" vs. those who oppose them who by extension are "ill-informed"(read stupid) and immoral. And of course racist and xenophobic. That this is always the case demonstrates the vacuity of their own moral position and depth of argument.
Muslims follow Islamic doctrine.   Palestinians follow Islamic doctrine. Islamic doctrine calls for "death to the infidels", and especially, "death to the Jews". Western nations are nations of "infidels".  But, no Western leader has ever demanded that the Palestinians, or any other Muslim nation or group, renounce the doctrine of "death to the infidels" No Muslim nation has ever renounced the doctrine.  Very, very few Muslim individuals have renounced it.  The Islamic doctrine of "death to renunciates" may explain that. And so, Israel is asked to negotiate a peace treaty with a people whose religion calls upon them to kill the Jews, but the Muslim  Palestinians are not asked to renounce the doctrine. That has been considered to be reasonable, by American Liberal Jews and their fellow Democrats. Hopefully, it does not look reasonable to Donald Trump,
Author of this hitpiece is a Jew. Enough said.
Jewish describes an adherent of judiasm, like muslim describes an adherent of islam.
The (in)famous 1917 Balfour Declaration to Baron Rothschild on Palestine (as it was then called) perfectly encapsulates the root of the conflict: a colonial power pledging to European Jews land that belongs to neither.  That Canada continues to effectively support this travesty is shameful.
No I'm only obsessed with the Jewish holocast let's get forget about it  Your a loser  No that's bullying  Go cry baby Go to a real college and gain an intellect
That is an utterly ridiculous thing to say, since these poor people were specifically targeted because they were members of the LGBT community.  That would be like saying that Adolf Hitler targeted 6 million people for death in concentration camps in WWII, and failing to mention that they were Jews.
In Canada the most acts of vandalism are still directed at the Jewish population although cases of vandalism of mosques is growing. Overt acts and words of intolerance are felt by a number of visible minorities including aboriginals, blacks, Sikhs, Muslims and Asians. Those bigoted acts however seldom reach a level which could be described as terrorism. Our white Christian majority is far from perfect but there is no comparison to attacks by Muslim extremists in Europe and the UK, attacks on Coptic Christians in Egypt or the more numerous attacks on Muslims by Muslims in the mid east and Africa. So far Muslims are much safer than blacks in the US or aboriginal women in Canada or Christians in Egypt. We should be ashamed of small acts of bigotry but let's not pretend that a single death in London totally counter balances all the deaths on 9/11 or throughout Europe in recent years.
That would give Arab gangs a great chance to kill defenseless Jews, they do it very well and with great enthusiasm.  Sorry Malumba, your brothers finished off the Jews, now they are almost done with Christians, and Moderate Muslims will go next. You wait your turn, and don't be surprised.
So every Friday in every mosque the imams pray for the killing of all Jews and infidels.  But we must show solidarity with muslims?  Welcome to the left wing twilight zone!
In an attempt to be civil, I find great difficulty with the Jew Bernstein.  In my opinion, he has always be and will continue to be scum.
Especially keep your religion out of the halls of Congress. What in the world were Kelly and the other "christians" doing injecting their religious beliefs onto the floor of the state legislature? Would they have welcomed a Muslim or a Hindu or even a Jew to comment on their religious distortions on the floor of the Senate? Just do your damned jobs and get the financial mess straightened out. And Jesus ain't gonna be any help in that department either.
No, all religions don't practice slavery.  Buddhism doesn't.  Taoism doesn't.  Hinduism doesn't.  Americans need to realize there's a huge world out there, and it doesn't revolve solely around America.  The garbage middle east religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) are the ones that condone slavery, condemn sex, and have violent gods.  Not everyone practice that garbage.
Wow.  After reading all these "Canadians" defending Le Pen, I'm sure glad I'm not Jewish.  Apparently, she is just wonderful and can do no wrong.  Things are getting very scary around here.
How many homosexuals have been killed due to their lifestyle compared to the millions of Jews killed in the Holocaust? Can you provide any numbers of hate crimes that resulted in deaths?  You are talking at most thousands compared to millions.
When one works with the Nazis, dresses like a Nazi, greets like a Nazi and hates the Jews, this person is a Nazi, even this person calls him/herself a "Ukrainian Nationalist"
These typical Muslim essays are meant to continue to soften the liberal progressive and weak underbelly of Western civilization. Most Canadians do not have a problem with Leitche's "problematic" values test. The only people who have a problem with a values test are those who do not, and will not, share Canadian values. I would not support (more tax dollars here) the government "devoting resources" to promote "equity and inclusion". This is more double speak, propaganda to support the acceptance of cultural/religious enclaves. More softening of Canadians to accept the unacceptable.  Canadians do not need to pay more taxes to exacerbate the suppression of Islam criticism. We do not need more speech and thought suppression to shut Canadians up about what they rightly perceive to be a radical undemocratic, unmodern and supremacist  ideology. If Muslims want love they need to start to integrate into Canadian society. Send your kid to violin classes with Asian kid and Jews and Infidels.
"Except for the racial element" --- my friend, you just answered why your point is incorrect about my thoughts pertaining to the 1%. And, being a Right-winger, you can't claim anything related to anti-Semitism, considering that Donnie Moscow has inspired the white knights to claim that Jews and other religions—along with many ethnicities—do not belong in white America.  Your points about Bezos and crew are off-base. You name a few of the "good guys", when the vast reality is that many of them are nothing but hedge-funders like Robert Mercer—men with undiagnosed gambling disorders—or they are techbros. Techbros are white guys who pride themselves on being an asshole like Steve Jobs, only techbros don't possess Job's God-given talent. These are fellas who open-source meaningless apps, then hold an IPO to get cash before the public realizes how useless it is. And tech is legendary for hating women and being racist. The people you seem to idolize do nothing for America.
screw islam n dummy troudeau you want more islamist dummy move to the desert build youre own outhousesn start building with your money not canadians most dont want more islamists bring more jews french greeks lebs forget the stupid bunch
If Israel had been built on secularism it would have ceased to exist a long time ago and certainly as a Jewish state, becoming just another Arab state and we know the disgusting dictatorships that they all are without exception, honour killings, gay torture, and female genital mutilation. Nice.
Another hit piece from the resident Jew defending a self-proclaimed "victim" of revelations of abberrant human behavior of a religious fanatic feeding at the government trough while dedicated to the destruction of the same.  Dredging up the Clinton's as the latest sinners unworthy of association with the pure, white, holy, christian Trumps, Pences, and all the rest of the immoral, evil Republicans refusing to eat with women, but more than willing to assault their crotches.  Goldberg is pure evil in concert with the current nazi, Bannon, infesting the governing system and despoiling the national discourse with vile invective from a modern Judas wallowing in wealth within a traitorous, misnamed "think tank" devoted to the overthrow of all freedom and democracy wherever it may be found.
I can find no info that Alexander Marlow is an orthodox Jew. So Republican Tim Scott supported both Sessions and Bannon, that's unusual. So does Ben Carson but that hardly means Bannon isn't a racist, xenophobe, misogynist. Milo fit right in with breitbart. He was a troll trying to upset as many people has he could by throwing out his idiotic comments. Your defense of bannon sounds like the people who claim they're not racist by saying some of their best friends are black!
I wouldn't have expected, not in million years, that a serious newspaper like The Globe and Mail would print/present such a blatant ignorance of history like this one by Dakshana Bascamurty.  Just to set things straight, Jerusalem was, is and will be an unified city. The so called "Eastern Jerusalem" appeared ONLY after the 1948 war, when Jordan occupied that part (by the way, why did Jordan occupy the future Palestinian teritory?), and it started expelling all the Jews living in the "Eastern Jerusalem"... making it a "historically" Arab part. In the understanding of this "reporter", 19 years (between 1948 and 1967) means HISTORY. What about the 3000 years and plus of Jewish history? The attitude of this "reporter" is cleary biased. And it is disturbing to see such ignorance written in The Globe and Mail. And it begs the question - when is media going to inform equidistantly?
I realize that people who are crazy enough to kill lots of other people seem to pick up some rationale for it. But you are intent on focusing on a small subset. "Gee, the -white- nutjobs never claim religion" except the anti-abortion murderers, and all the guys who killed people they thought were the "wrong" faith, like Jewish or Muslim. "Pledged to ISIS". ISIS isn't Islam, and pledging online isn't theology.  Others said it in this thread - white guys do mass murder and "gee, mabye they're not well" but somehow if someone's imbalance shows up as a twisting of a different faith, suddenly that person is a deep theologian, nothing crazy about them.  Right.  Read the Bible, here's Jesus: "19:27 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me. 19:28 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem."  Seems clear Jesus wants to kill non-Christians if you just read it, right? Explain otherwise.
There are about 100 verses in the Qur'an, the holy book of the religion of Islam, that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers (infidels).  There are dozens of groups of Muslims, including Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, the Taliban, al Qaeda, al Shabaab,  Boko Haram, Abu Sayyaf,  Daesh (ISIS/IL), etc. etc. etc., that follow Islam and the many verses in the Qur'an that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers.  I hope Wente and the Muslims in Canada think Muslims who follow the violent verses in the Qur'an have no place in Canada.
Nonsense.  No decent person walks along side swastika wielding Nazis and white-robed Klansmen chanting "Jews will not replace us."  Walking in that demonstration -- as opposed to running away from it -- is entirely inconsistent with simple decency.  Trump disgraced himself, the presidency and the country by suggesting that it was possible for "very fine people" to march with Nazis and Klansmen.  No decent person makes common cause with Nazis, no matter what the cause.  It's a tragedy that, in 2017, this even has to be said.  What a disaster this president is.
Oz  Islamists kill more Muslims, homosexuals, repress and genitally mutilate  more women than do all other peoples put together. Islamists terrorize and for the purpose of media & internet coverage behead, burn and torture other Muslims who are considered to 'liberal', Jews and 'Westerners'. Is it 'phobic' to be afraid of these people? Is it irrational fear 'radical' mullahs in Canada, the USA, the UK and continental Europe who preach and encourage this form of hate? How many Jews in Canada or Israel  behead and burn, are homophobic, etc?  German so-called 'Christians' killed 6 million Jews in WWII - or are you a Holocaust denier? Where's the parallel? Or are you also an "anti-Zionist" (code for anti-Jew). I say anti-Jew rather than anti-Semitic because Arabs are Semites. Or are you a naive pup like Trudeau or worse, a willing fellow-traveller like one of the other more active SJW apologists who posts regularly on this forum?
a very racist government 4 Sikhs in the Cabinet but no Chinese? Buddhist? Japanese?  Filipino?
Showing there Intollerant true colors of the real fascists, isn't a  Nazi a Jewish hating racist..huh yup!!
Wow, the ignorance of this post is staggering.  Is your goal to repel atheists by sheer disgust of what you've said here?  Shameful lumping in of people from a multitude of faiths as "lunatics".  You speak of how others "infringe" upon you, but you seem to be equally lacking in tolerance and have no issues putting yourself on a pedestal.  That which you appear to condemn, you are yourself.
Big Glenn, you don't need to rewrite history when you clearly don't understand any of it and have formed your own 'alternative history' to reflect your biased racial world. Are you referring to the 'Indians' who had lived here in North America 15000 plus years before the  Euro settler arrived, as the ones who "could not go it alone". I think most of those descendants would suggest you are wrong. And how about that Euro founding people, was that the Vikings  from 900, or are they the  French who ruled here for 250+ years  before the British. Could these founders be Scotts, or Irish, English perhaps, don't forget the Germans and even the Jews were here early on. Before you start showing your racial ignorance for special status, perhaps fix your historic ignorance first.
"There is no law in Palestine that discriminates against Jews, or anyone else for that matter"  Blatantly false, and the fact that you think Sharia law doesn't discriminate against Jews tells me and anyone reading this everything they need to know.  And regarding your definition of Apartheid... now your just splitting hairs.  Which is why I stated:  Weather you choose to call the discrimination against Jews, homosexual and other minorities that is taking place in Palestine Apartheid or some other equally horrific synonym is irrelevant.
If the fact that it was a Jewish organization was irrelevant why are the "good Jews" out in force to "protest too much".  These " Not in my namers " are  a pathetic lot. They are so concerned that their contemporaries or fellow travelers will apply the usual anti Semitic  stereotypes to them, that instead of condemning those stereotypes they seek to separate themselves from the " bad Jews " and become more catholic than the pope with their anti Semitism.
Apparently only Zionist Jews have the right to be "reactive" by electing violent radicals?  And "reaction", according to you, justifies raping and shooting helpless women, or somehow makes it less reprehensible?  And you define "comeuppance" as AMNESTY?  You make my points for me.  Please don't waste my time with this "Jews-can-do-no-wrong" gibberish.  You may take it on faith that I vehemently disagree with such bigoted fallacy.  Khalas.
While making his propaganda film, the man did not learn the lessons from Auschwitz. Yes it is good to have a strong army to protect ourselves and defend other who need help. Nazi Germany  was not in response to an invading army. The horror was it's own government and army turned on it's own people and then turned on other countries. They murdered their own people, Jews. Not because of an invasion, but because of fear, prejudice and hate. They demonized the Jews, intellectuals and others (press) and blamed them for their economic  and other societal problems. Then they invaded other countries and imported more people to kill. Substitute Muslim for Jew. His demonization of another faith proves the man learned nothing.  How pathetic. And embarrassing.
Palestinians have been oppressing Jews for centuries.  In 1839, the British consul, William Young, said that the poor Jew in Jerusalem...lives from day to day in terror of his life....Young attributed the plight of the Jew in Jerusalem to “the blind hatred and ignorant prejudice of a fanatical populace,”  JEWS IN JERUSALEM. New York Times	December 29, 1878 Crowded together in the worst lodgings, or in the dark cellars under a synagogue building, without food, fuel, or water –even water at Jerusalem being a commodity of price – numbers died of starvation and various diseases, while others went raving mad.  Those who could labor were denied employment by the bigotry of the Mussulmans and of the Oriental Christians.  Notice the date.  This was before the first Zionists arrived in Palestine.  Notice the word bigotry.
If it had been a christian or jewish cemetery none of these talking heads would say a word.  There is a word for their kind hypocrite
The article says "Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, the latest directed at Egypt’s increasingly embattled Christian minority following two church bombings last month that killed more than 45, also claimed by the group".  Apparently, that's the fourth time since January 2017 that Muslims have attacked, killed and injured innocent Coptic Christians in Egypt.  The Coptic Christians are peaceful and aren't fighting against Muslims so I guess the Muslims must be attacking the Coptic Christians just to follow the many verses in the Qur'an that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers.  Why else would Muslims be attacking poor, peaceful, innocent Coptic Christians?
That's not what white supremacists do; they want to overthrow our government, and discriminate against, or worse actions against people of color, gays, Muslims, and Jews. Sound familiar? Hint: Heil Trump (chanted by the white supremacists during Virginia rally).
The holohoax (sic) didn't happen, but the holocaust, in which the NAZI's gassed, starved and shot 6 million Jews did indeed happen. You can admit this irrefutable truth and still be proud of your German heritage, Mr. Groth.
Ridiculous.  The next thing you know other religions in Quebec will want their own cemeteries like  Jewish and Roman Catholic faiths... oh wait.
This article provided no evidence whatsoever.  Give me one example of Trump saying something anti-semitic.  Does the fact that his son-in-law is Jewish and his daughter converted to Judaism not register with anyone?  He has been talking kindly to Israel and seems to have a good relationship with Netanyahu.  Does these facts not register with anyone?  Provide some evidence and logical arguments and then I can assess them.  Otherwise it's just whining and emotional nonsense.
That color stuff thrown on people is disgusting. That is also hinduism.
Kindness will only continue to enable  fundamentalists, including clerics,  who use violent verses of the Koran to spread their religion and terrorize non believers and apostates.  A major reform within Islam is needed and this must come from within the Muslim community.  Until this happens, all we can do is fight fire with fire.   "I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them"(Quran 8:12)" "As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have " anyone to help."(Quarn 3:56)
will thay let the homeless jew work there......with his long voilent crimeal record????
This is a tired dialogue that serves no purpose except for providing soap boxes to the writers. A winging atheist is as tiresome as a winging Christian.  Whatever you believe is a private affair, and I don't want to listen, read or be subjected to the reasons why.
the bottom half is jewish as he is circumcised
This was censored by the Globe and Mail's Islamic censorship board that overrules freedom of thought and speech for some very subjective non-journalistic crap from a very religious person that should be relegated to the Religious page, not the reality page.    During the, "Cold War", Godless Communists were the enemy. Which brings to mind something odd about the use of the word enemy. The Author used the word enemy inappropriately. Certainly, we can all agree that the communists were and are still our enemy. We spend trillions to protect against being vapourized by communist bombs.  Kindness is a Christian virtue. Maybe if those hateful Pagans actually converted to Christianity, they would be kind to the rest of us Christians, Jewish and agnostics. Until them, don't expect any kindness from the religion that denied Jesus was the true road to salvation. You know, the anti-Christ religion.  Why is the above considered to be un-civil? Just pure censorship from her friends.
Right On!!!!     It is the utter hypocrisy that takes place in Canada that is disheartening.    All immigrants want full rights here (as they should) and state we should be multicultural (self interest of course).   Fine/ok, it is not race or culture that makes a person good or bad, as evil exists across the spectrum.    But the blatant hypocrisy that we are to be brow beaten for not being multi-cultural enough and not accommodating enough when all (most) Sikhs want a Sikh only homeland....all Jews (most) want a Jewish only state, etc. etc. ..    The only ones expected to be otherwise are western white countries and it is the height of hypocrisy....unless you can preach the same in your former country  you are a hypocrite.   No wonder our leaders are so out of touch in their political correctness and a nut like Trump gets elected.   Either it is global multiculturalism Mr. Singh or you are a hypocrite.  I say this as a former NDP'er  (long before you giving up on them).
The Mujaheddin, Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and ISIS were ALL created by the MOSSAD and the CIA. Osama-Bin Laden did not do 911 from a cave in Afghanistan, it was again the MOSSAD and the CIA who executed that operation. The Afghanistan war is a war against poor people and their resources and to secure geopolitical interests. CANADA and its soldiers and all of the people who "SUPPORT" the troops are therefore WAR CRIMINALS.  The Jewish-controlled media made Sajjan look GOOD to get him elected and now they made him look BAD to cut him down to size. And all of the people who fall for this ROUTINE formula are, until they wake up, COMPLETE IDIOTS.
How's this, "Lars?":  From Stormfront again:  "Annnnd guess where Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche works? The 100% jew run Cadmus group they are city state government contractor for the EPA and Homeland Security. So there ya have it folks a jew disguised as a rainbow buddhist actually works for an environmental company and Homeland Security contractor met his just domain at the hands of a White American druggie ex con jailhouse philosopher, who defended himself against 3 assailants. That's Portland, they wanted multiculturalism, they got it, this will long be remembered as the day Keep Portland weird, was no longer funny."  "Here's a pic of Talisen Myrrddin Namkai Meche feelin' the Bern:" --- Got that,  "Lars?"    The "jew" ...met his just domain.   Killed by a... "White...who defended himself against 3 assailants."  Who also killed a vet "Homeland Security contractor."  See?  Your buds think the two deserved to die at the hands of this Trump supporter.  Any more questions, "Lars?"
I would be more interested in author's views on blasphemy and apostasy that are punishable by death in her religion. I will remain highly suspicious about Islam as long as people can get killed for leaving or speaking against this religion.
send all the useless mouths back home, put women back to work raising high IQ white children stop the jews from robbing us and problem solved
OMG, you equate your privileged white male status with the hatred and oppression of others especially people of colour, women, Muslims, Jews, etc.  That someone would dare question or criticize that unearned status or demand equality for people other than white males does not make you a victim in any way.  The fact is your whining only shows ignorance and lack of regard for others.  Pathetic.
Sounds reasonable....anti Muslim bigotry, anti Christian bigotry, anti Buddhist bigotry, anti Jewish bigotry....anti-belief system bigotry.
One guy shot up planned parenthood. One guy shot up a church. One side has been preaching the politics of if it white it ain't right.  Your feeble attempts to try and pin this on the jewish community cause Trump so idiotically did it, doesn't actually make any sense. This has been happening world wide for the past few months.  What is the motivation for the jewish communtiy, the idea that they are attacking themselves with absolutely no evidence is silly at best and neo-nazistic at worst.
Show me any Imam that says homosexuals, women, and Atheists are equal to Muslim men...and I'll show you an Imam with a Fatwa on him...
Yet numerous Saudi Arabian billionaires and multi-millionaires fly under the radar as they are simultaneously the primary force behind the surreptitious export of their extreme fundamentalist Wahhabi form of Sunni Islam around the world. This is the form of Sunni Islam that motivates and drives the ISIS caliphate itself. From Saudi Arabia, it comes is in the form of literature, books, school teaching and study aids, video, audio tapes, etc. used in Muslim mosques and children's schools attached to mosques, which propagate pure anti-Jewish, anti-Gay and anti-Christian hatred.
Because 32,000 terrorist attacks by muslims in the western world since 9/11 killing over 200,000 people and injuring gravely over 200,000 cannot even come CLOSE to a few.  That's catastrophic.  Do you know how many terrorist attacks by buddhist took place in the same period? ZERO  Do you know how many terrorist attacks by hindus too place in the same period? ZERO.  So here is your conclusion.
One side was Nazi flag-waving, Swastika-carrying, xenophobic thugs intimidating a college campus and city with unabashed hatred toward jews, gays, and anyone who is not white, male, straight, Christian and gun-toting.  The other side was objecting to this vile intrusion. If that's alt-Left, sign me the f*** up.
Yes...the Democrats made the neo-Nazis rally.... Just like the Jews made Hitler invade Poland.....it wasn't racial hatred...really... The Democrats made that boy run over those people and kill that girl.... The Democrats made Mr. Trump condone the behavior.... Darn Democrats...
And the Republic party just loves its "blood and soil", "Jews will not replace us" core driving a car into a crowd and killing a woman. That's the Republic party's definition of a civil society.
I am gay and an atheist. According to Islam, I deserve to be punished by death.  Therefore it is natural I am afraid of this ideology, ie, Islamophobe.
Yes indeed. The New Black Panther Party is a virulently racist and anti-Semitic organization whose leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews and law enforcement officers.
HabFan, most of Ralph's comment had to do with black pioneers in Ontario.  Orthodox jews and mennonites take their religion seriously, too - do you find them ridiculous, too - and laugh at them online?
I hope Geert wins ! I for one , think we need to realize that Muslim Immigrants along with Muslim Canadians do not have our best interests at heart . An Imam in Toronto is calling for the death of all Jews ,and the Qur'an calls for all Infidels to be killed . We don't need any more people that have a Religion that promotes violence!! It is a fact that Muslims do not Assimilate  or Integrate into the culture of a country that was founded on Judeo / Christian Values . You just have to look at news from Europe to see the problems that Muslim Immigration has caused !
Well, Rivers, let's take a looks at the connections here.  The horrors of Auschwitz were perpetrated by a powerful nation (Germany) against a minority people (Jews). The proper echo of that basic pattern (tyranny of the majority against a minority) in modern US politics is the Trump administration determination to remove/prevent entrance to specified ethnic/religious minorities.   But this moron appears to want to associate his group (white America?) with the persecuted minority, implying that the powerful nations perpetrating the atrocity is Islam? Mexico?   It's not just offensive to use images of sacred memories for political purposes, the message itself if inverted, perverted, profoundly anti-intellectual.   How do men like this get elected to the US congress...should the world tremble?
Wow, Mike - you really ticked off some atheists here.  (They don't like seeing anyone mention any of that "Bible" stuff.  Very sensitive.)  Well done.
. the sack of garbage trump goes ahead and totally repudiates his forced apology. he has shown who he is.  he is a racist and he is an anti-semite - even if his daughter converted to judaism  his daughter put on a big charade the Sat night before the election with her visit (all frummed-up with a hat) to the Lubavitcher Rebbe's grave. The Lubavitcher Rebbe was one of the few in his extended family to survive Hitler. Jared Kushner has played the "my grandparents were survivors" long enough His fatehr-in-law defends Nazis. His father-in-law condones torchlight marches with grown men shouting "jews cannot replace us" his father-in-law is a racist - started out as a racist landlord then graduated to racist noisemaker his fatehr-in-law is either an anti-semite, or he just loves and defends them because they love and defend him  The "cutesy" couple of wealthy jews have to either take a stand or get the hell out of public view
I was pretty clear about this, MC:  I pity the Nazis. They need psychological help. Most extremists do.  I avoided nothing. Only simple people think there are simple answers to social questions. In fact, assuming that such answers exist is typically a component of white privilege.   But white supremos also need a firm hand, since they are heavily armed, glorify war, and espouse violence, and worse, against Jews and people of color, which is illegal and dangerous.  This is why the AntiFa should cease trying to kick their butts and instead shame them through outing on FB, Instagram and in the press and such. Hold them up for the losers they are and they'll vanish.  You're not asking not a simple question. Both groups--the destitute and the white nationalists--need justice to be done. Own it: you despise the poor, favor the white supremos over civil rights and equality, and you associate being on the right side of history with the supposed moral quibbling of "political correctness".
"Religious extremism," are you serious?!  Judaism, Islam, and many Christian denominations,including but not limited to Roman Catholicism and the Orthodox Churches, reject homosexuality.
All Christians, Jews and other religious denominations are angered and will retaliate every time another Muslim demand is made and honoured. This is beyond ridiculous that Muslims are allowed to force their religion down our throats. This is a very serious situation and there will be more violent attacks when our government refuses to curb this activity. Muslims can take time from their days at school to pray, yet our Lord's prayer has been dismissed as being controversial. Yes, this is going to get very ugly and could easily turn into civil war. That comment is not outrageous. Muslims have come from that very climate and they didn't leave that on the shores behind them. This is just the beginning of a rally.
Harper also ran a candidate that would come to your home and pee in your dishes. Doesn't mean Harper was really tolerant of that - at least for his own dishes.  At one time Harper wanted a party of Theo-Cons; all the orthodox religions of the book (Jewish, Christian, Muslim) even Orthodox Buddhist holding hands and hating progressives and gays like Baird. Baird wisely never "came out" to Canadians or his constituency; he just enjoy the benefits of all the progressives who fought for his rights.  BTW, Harper specifically attacked refugee programmes and had Kenney cut health care to vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers. My MP sent me dog whistle note asking if I approved of refugees "getting better health care" than me.
No. Just anti-Russian. Not anti- Jews.
Entirely different subjects. You might as well blame Jews for Hiroshima because of Einstein.
