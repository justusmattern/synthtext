Jesus gave us the Eucharist during a meal, seated at a table, not an altar, and using a cup, not a chalice.  He Himself was not a priest and He ordained no priests.  There was already an active priesthood in His faith community of Judaism.
I don't care about the Israeli government. I care about mine, and I distrust all Israeli pollution of US political and intelligence machinery. I distrust all US pols operating with Israel First ideology.  I distrust all dual-citizen US senators,  I distrust AIPAC, and all politicians bought outright by AIPAC or brought into line by intimidation from AIPAC,  I distrust all clinically insane neocons at high levels of the State Department, all left intact by one HR Clinton, and presumably influencing US "leaders" into another Israeli proxy war,  this time with Iran as the big prize.  I now, and forever for my grandchildren, distrust all Middle East enemies made by the US on behalf of Israeli reckless behavior.   "don't worry about American pressure, we, the Jewish people control America", Sharon to Peres, 2001. The pandering and influence that provided the confidence for Sharon's boast are what I will never trust.  "America is a thing you can move very easily",  Netanyahu, 2001.
True, a small number of jews joined the Judenrat in order to save their own souls.  However, ultimately, members of the Judenrat were  exterminated as well, once they had served their purpose.  Amongst jewish survivors, the Judenrat was reviled for the traitors that they were.  "So why are you focused on Ukrainans and why is any of this Ms. Freeland's fault??"  I was responding directly to your post, which was not about Freeland.
The hardcore anti-semitism started after kristallnacht. Due to the Depression, and anti-semitism, Canada and the USA didn't allow jewish refugees. The US doesn't allow Syrian refugees for the same reason - they aren't really "European". If only Swedish blondes were refugees, they would be welcomed with open arms into the USA.
All this self flagellation by our sainthood seeking pretty boy.  I didn't commit any crimes against our Indigenous neighbors, nor did my parents. I wish them nothing but the best.  Why on earth can't they simply move forward and work improve their circumstance, but without forgetting the past.  The Jewish Community worldwide has done just that, rising up from centuries of domination, destruction and unspeakable horrors to earn and retain a leading and rightful role in civilization.
"Should an atheist be able to go into a Jewish Deli and ask for, demand, and sue for the right to have them prepare a ham sandwich?"  If the deli sells ham sandwiches, yes.  If the deli doesn't sell ham sandwiches, no.  I have a five year old who can grasp the distinction; why can't you?
By invoking "Jesus" you are relying on the religion of the majority of the people in this country as your guide.    The belief in this alleged 'Jesus' and his recommendations by 70% of our population ignores all the other religions and those of us who are either atheist or agnostic.  That is supposedly what you are against; the State following the precepts of a particular religion.    Your post is therefore blatant hypocricy.   "the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform;"
If atheists want to grieve and leave condolences, all the power to 'em, I say.  If a Christian was to attack them for the way they grieve, I'd be all over that, too.  Just sayin'.  Live and let live ... or in this case, grieve and let grieve.  Anyone who wants to tear someone down for the way they grieve is just a bully in my book.
Onne, why do you assume that the faith of Christians or, by implication, other faiths, is so offensive to unbelievers? As an atheist, I don't find Christianity offensive; irrational, misguided and naive, yes. Offensive only when some arrogant, smug, holier-than-thou Christian attempts to ram his piety down my throat.  The Golden Rule says it all; it's rational, moral, makes perfect sense and no higher being is required to act upon it.
You're saying the same thing I am. Can you not see that?  I'm pointing out to GBA that labels are not helpful ways to talk about this. He's hung on up then fact that the shooter was an atheist. As if if atheism causes this. It's a broad correlation that is harmful and only perpetuates "us vs them" narratives.   Do you just assume what I say is wrong before I even say it? Can you not see that I am speaking against the exact thing you're accusing me of?  This is the third or so post from you that finger-points and hinges on amninosity over the past few days because you flat out are misunderstanding me.
Mark went to Alexandria, which had a large Jewish community. No, he did not have to receive a Coptic language diploma to make himself understood. The first Christian communities outside of Israel emerged mostly in existing Jewish communities.
Disagreeing? You're not paying attention.  I'm asking you why the priest in your example is celebrating Mass with only ten atheists present? You still haven't explained how your priest is complying with Church practice and instructions. Despite your 6 (six) replies so far to me.
Atheism is indeed a belief that there is no God or gods; as such it is a faith. It is not a religion. So much of disagreement depends on definitions; Wittgenstein felt that just about all philosophic disagreement falls away once mutually acceptable definitions are agreed on. RolandX, please give us your definition of religion, and your evidence that atheism fits it.
Wow, I see the outline of another MSW column already. The Catholic Right is like Mani, who worked a miracle by getting himself. amed after the peanut, which is indigenous to South America. The Catholic Left is like Cicero, who was an atheist, more or less, but whose name means "garbanzo bean" but it's only a faux-miracle because a garbanzo bean is the same thing as a chick pea. This is clearly a signal from Papa Francesco (with an affected little trill on the "r" in Francesco) to the folks on the fifth floor of the USCCB headquarters. Bishops, call your offices.
Actually, atheism is a belief system as it is predicated on the disbelief in the existence of God or gods.  As such, it is no more rational than any other belief system or religion.  Agnosticism, on the other hand, relates to a person who believes that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God or of anything beyond material phenomena; a person who claims neither faith nor disbelief in God.    Agnosticism is therefore scientific and rational.  Atheism, on the other hand, much to your chagrin I'm sure, is a religion.
-(and Paf !) Israel urges Jews to leave Ukraine -(and Paf !)

India has Sunday off also, why is that? India is a majority Hindu country............
Interesting that you call yourself a  "Judeo-Christian type." Do you remember the time then Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper happily prayed at the 'men only' section of the Western Wall in Jerusalem (called the 'million-dollar shot' by one of his male Conservative backbenchers?) Surprisingly few people commented on that issue. Were you one of them?  Answer keeping your name in mind, of course.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/this-is-the-million-dollar-shot-conservative-mp-cries-out-to-join-harper-photo-op-in-israel/article16427749/comments/
So why is there violence in the disputed Kashmir region and why is there conflict between Sikhs and Hindus?
No, it is not that complicated and not that recent.  Back in the 1980s Sociologist Reginald Bibby found that for the majority of so call Canadian Anglicans, Baptists, Catholics, Jews, ... the designation had no significance beyond what genre of ritual was performed when they were born, married and buried. It is about as strong as saying that you are ethnic British, Scots, Irish, French, Belgian, German, ... and no more.  Three decades later we see most young couples raising children in "Catholic" Québec not bothering to get married, let alone by a cleric in a temple.  I agree that Secular would be a better label than No Religion, but the Census category label is No Religion. For most Secular Canadians it isn't a big deal issue of being Atheist or Agnostic. Religion is simply something that does not matter in their daily lives, similar to how many pecks make a bushel.
What a provocative idea - Christians listing themselves on a mandatory Muslim registry.  Reminds me of the Dutch wearing yellow stars in fraternity with the Jews in WWII.  How many of us (myself included) would have the courage to do that?

I am not suggesting one of religion or science is "correct", but I would suggest your thinly veiled aggression toward religion may be blinding you.  Religion requires faith.  Atheists similarly have faith in science, evident in its adherents' apparent disdain of religion and the obligatory condescending comments about made up stories.  Science’s scripture is not a book, but a collection of theories.  A couple of the more notable ones, the big bang and dark matter, each require a leap of faith.  The material for an infinitely large and growing universe came from?  There was nothing before? The dark matter which makes up the majority of the universe…where is it?  At this time these foundational theories are "made up stories".  And science is finally asking what was before the big bang.  Whatever the religion, be it Christian, Hindu, Islam or the book of ever changing scientific theories, no one has all the answers.   Don’t be so full of yourself.  And have a little faith in humanity.
I agree we should stand with our brothers no matter who they are, in this case the Jewish people.  However, to not hold those accountable that preach this hate and attempt to use it as a political weapon is a detriment to society. The other thread turned into what it was because we had people rejecting reality and using the words of certain politicians to enforce a hateful world view. To turn a blind eye to this is just curing the symptom without curing the disease.
That comment has been up for 10 hours now so apparently you can say it. No different than the Christians of the Spanish Inquisition forcing Jews to convert under torture.
Last week an Imam associated with Ryerson was discovered to be preaching  the extermination of  Jews, to finalize the Holocaust. If young men who hear that at the mosques they attend with their families,  and then they say the same in schools, ought we not know about it?
Let's face it, priests in no way represent any other society in the world unless one includes Zen Buddhist monks. They are a peculiar, inclusive sub-culture all of their own.   - They are at minimum 20% gay males. - They are expected to voluntarily attempt to suppress all sexual thought and action throughout the majority of their lives. - They lack the intimate physical and emotional contact with women that enriches and broadens most men's personalities and perspective.  Now this wouldn't necessarily be a negative, providing their primary function was solely to guide others in their individual pursuit of spirituality and God. But when one includes what is, in essence, marriage counseling, aren't we expecting too much of them?
I agree that it doesn't belong but I also don't agree with the fact that as a Christian I would likely be tortured and killed in a multitude of Muslim countries around the world-yet I'm being told to be tolerant--tell me how many Christian churches/Jewish synagogues there are in Saudia Arabia?
Time for Muslims to understand that religion should not be mixed with other institutions, being political, educational, or commercial. You are free to pray for God in a setting that does not offend others, and where you do not give the impression that you have rights other religions do not. What if Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and decided to pray in schools
But Mormons are facing internal issues, have to deal with retention rate drops in many locations, etc. In Chile, for example, they are shrinking. And if Salt Lake City can have a Catholic cathedral and parishes, I guess Rome can afford a Mormon temple (alongside Mosques, Synagogues, a Hindu temple and Protestant churches). As tourist and/or pilgrim sites, they are all practically non-existent (except for their own adherents).  Nothing can match the nearly 2,000 year old historical presence of some CC sites localizing early Roman Christianity. Anyway, St. Peter and Paul are meeting Joseph Smith in a new Roman setting! And all three claim they knew Jesus Christ.
The Jews were not looking for a messiah to save them from their sins.  They were looking for a messiah to save them from Rome.  Didn't happen. We need not be uncertain of our salvation.  We need only trust.  "Fear not, little flock..."
The SPLCenter is  a joke, plain and simple, and I obviously would not take what they publish as factual.  Fr Gruner, as well as Christopher Ferrara have been slandered  by this far left biased article.   Fr Gruner believed in the fact that the Catholic Church was the one true faith, plain and simple and desired the Jewish people to convert to same.  Is that anti-Semitic?  He had absolutely nothing to do with neo-nazis.  Your comment is absolutely scandalous.  Fr Gruner believed in the Latin Mass and a profound devotion to our Blessed Mother.  He believed the changes of Vatican II were in error.  Does that make him a member of a hate group?  If it does then I guess you also should consider me a member as well.
“I’m looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like,” he told reporters. “I can live with either one.”  Now how's that for thoughtful.  Nothing wishy washy or cowardly there at all.  Never mind the narcissism on display there.  'I" can live  with....is this about him?  Here's what thoughtful, reasonable people know.  Israel cannot be a democracy under a one-state solution, nor will it be a Jewish state.  It is either going to be an apartheid state where the majority of the population will have little or no rights and definitely no right to vote or there will be two states.  The notion that it can continue in its current state ad infinium is absurd.
The secular far left, the Sanders Democratic Socialists, have a penchant for the atheism of Marx, although the Christian Left is still tolerated.  We must be trusted as well, bringing forth a vision where a libertarian democratic socialist cooperative might fund its own school in lieu of taxes and that the school might even be Catholic if the cooperative decides its a good idea.  The same is true for using Catholic Health facilities for medical care.  Government will eventually fade away, but education and health care will not and the Church can help with that - but not the Church we have now.  Catholic Social Thought is an asset to the movement and is foundational on living wages (to each according to their need).  It is a natural fit, but only if it plays nice with the other children, especially the girls.  It must be Radically Catholic, not just Distinctly Catholic. No having our cake and eating it to.
Your letter seems to be carefully  phrased to avoid flat-out stating that you believe Israel is behind these incidents... yet if you don't believe it, why say it? We can read between the lines.  More to the point - I know it is fashionable lately to make outrageous claims without any substantiation, but that doesn't make it right. If one is going to make extraordinary claims, like "Obama tapped my phones", or "The Jews are spray painting swastikas on synagogues", one should provide evidence.
"Why is it that progressives who argue that the conscience is supreme suddenly do an about face when someone acts according to his conscience?"  Seriously?   I think that most adults  find  the whole situation laughable. In the real world baking a cake is not a matter of "conscience".   Hiding Jews from the Gestapo qualifies  but baking a cake.............not so much,
4. On Germany: the Weimar Republic was in place shortly after WWI. Because of a highly oppressive treaty following WWI, inflation and poverty rates skyrocketed, giving space for Hitler to come in, find a convenient scapegoat (Jews, homosexuals, Gypsies, etc.) and begin spreading his fascist, murderous views through increasing amounts of tyrannical oppression (including the confiscation of firearms, I'd add). Again, root cause is important... why did Hitler have space to advance his sick agenda? Poverty was a big factor. Speaking of poverty and violence... The CDC conducted a study on firearms in 2010 that showed "African American males are most affected by firearm-related violence, with “32 per 100,000” deaths. Risk factors and predictors of violence include income inequality, “diminished economic opportunities . . . high levels of family disruption” and “low levels of community participation.”  (Done in 2010 at a cost of $10 million to tax payers - NRA didn't block this study...)
"If a Jewish person was approached at the border and asked for their opinions on men who don't wear yarmulkes, it would be absurd for that to be entered into a government database," Mr. McCarten said. "Equally so if a Catholic priest was asked his opinions about nuns who don't wear habits."  How many global terrorist attacks have been committed by Catholic priests? I'm so sick and tired of this ridiculous political correctness, refusal to admit facts and harassment of security agencies for trying to do their jobs and keep Canadians safe.
The divide isn't between evangelicals and everyone else, it's between devout Christians - both Protestant and Catholic - and everyone else, including tepid Christians.  Devout Christians are intolerant of dishonesty, because that's what Holy Scripture teaches: Lies are the devil's language. God detests lying lips. Jesus is the Way, the TRUTH, and the Life.  Someone who can't be trusted in small matters shouldn't be trusted in weightier ones.  Bearing false witness against another person even made God's "top ten list" of sins, along with murder & idolatry.  Most other people take a softer line. If you say, "everyone lies," you'll get no argument from them.  So scandals like Climategate & Fakegate, which revealed leading alarmist climate scientists hiding & manipulating data, blackballing & smearing skeptics, and behaving more like political activists than dispassionate scientists, discredit the climate scare, in the eyes of devout Christians, more so than in the eyes of other people.
"Has "Christian" now become used as a term of ethnic identity, where if one is white and of European roots, one is deemed to be a Christian, whether or not one is an actual believer, or an atheist?"  Of course it has and why not.? People are identified by those who perceive themselves in the majority as such if they are Muslim, Catholic, Hindu, Irish, Italian, Chinese, etc. They've all been used to label individuals as a group to be hated.   Of course, history is filled with "Christian terrorists" (i.e. IRA, The Inquisition), but then the writers of history have also been generally Christian and thus, the lack of a cultural bent to so identify those who are essentially Christian Taliban.   ""The leader of genius must have the ability to make different opponents appear as if they belonged to one category." A. Hitler
Really pathetic to hear about people blowing money on religious propaganda for the most dominant mythology in the country. Bronze age zombie jew! Like we havent all had this bs drilled into us from our youngest age.   What to make a positive difference in people's lives with your money? Community college scholarships are real and will have a positive effect.
I purposely want to avoid discussing the role of Jews in European politics and business throughout the ages,  because I would immediately be accused of being antisemitic. I am probably much more aware of their true historical role in Europe than you, since I lived through that period. I would also let the Ann Frank story better "rest in peace". Let us do each other a favour and not discuss this subject any longer.
Please understand the culture that Jesus came from.  Women could be divorced with just a writ [notice] that her husband did not want her anymore.  SHE had no recourse at all. She could not appeal it.  The woman could go back home to a father who: threw her out---because she disgraced the family name or took her back in, only to beat and treat her like a slave.  OR the woman could turn to prostitution [which many did---nothing much else in which they could be engaged ].    When Jesus spoke, he was speaking ONLY to a Jewish audience, was putting a heavier weight on the men, because only THEY could hand a writ of divorce to their wife.  Not the other way around.  In Roman and Greek law---women could also issue a writ of divorce.  Priests have a much better preparation for their life's work than do couples preparing for marriage.  Many young people growing up do not have the model of parents' whose own marriages worked.
And most conservatives never bothered doing research on WHY things were written in Vatican II's  Constitutions, Documents and Decrees in the first place.   While changes did occur, Vatican II provided American Catholics with an officially sanctioned language for comprehending and discussing the sociocultural changes so many were already experiencing.   Long before Vatican II, questions which had lain before the Church for many centuries---without open discussion were: 1) the role of bishops in their relationship to the bishop of Rome. 2) the place and role of lay people in the life and operations of the Church. 3) the understanding and place of religious liberty in the modern Church. 4) the Church's teaching on divine revelation and its source. 5) the Church's attitude toward and desire for relationship with the Jews. 6) the way Christian unity should be approached. 7) the reform and restoration of the Liturgy [in the vernacular], the catechumenate, and the diaconate.
To be completely accurate, they are not the core messages of these Gospel texts that you wish to present. However, they do tie in into the Church’s understanding, particularly of the sacrament of Reconciliation.  The Jewish process of forgiveness involved sin - repentance - forgiveness (up to a point limited in numbers).  Jesus took this process and (1) made forgiveness effective; He really could forgive sins and gave that power to his Church; (2) made forgiveness infinite.
But there were quite a few Jewish scientists in the Manhattan Project so blame away with irrelevancies.
Prove they are fake. You keep calling them that but provide no proof. We have proof they are happening.  You have nothing. You want everyone to do their own research when what you mean is read StormFront or Breitbart or any other alt-white neo-nazi websites.  You are not actually standing for anything. You are simply saying no and stomping your feet.  You want people to take you seriously, try posting some facts and not just anti-jewish rhetoric.  I mean you don't want me to call you a neo-nazi don't say things like... "This tactic is a favorite of the Zionists."
You don't understand.   Jesus re-defined priesthood...perfectly.  He came to be both victim & priest; a perfectly fused offering.  A priest, even in the Jewish time, "offered sacrifices".  In those days proxies were offered, as a means of restorative justice.  Jesus made perfect the priesthood.    From St Matthew: “Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, ‘Take, eat; this is my body.’ And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, ‘Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”  A priest's offering of self.   And this is what is meant when the Church talks about the "common priesthood" of all Christians and the "ministerial priesthood."  You and I must offer all we do; but the Mass is offered by a priest
I have taught at four well-regarded Catholic colleges and universities, and my students seem to either have already left the church or are on their way out, as indicated by their reflection papers. This is true despite the fact they come from families willing to pay out tens of thousands of dollars a year to keep their children  in Catholic education.  As one young woman told me last week, "The Catholic Church is so over!" (Really. Kids! I had to laugh.)  The poignant dimension of my story is that these young people are remarkable in so many ways, often deeply spiritual but finding spiritual fulfillment in traditions like Buddhism, Sufism, nature-centered religion and mystically-inclined communities.  When I ask them why, the most common answer is that they are uninspired by cut-and-dried dogmas/concepts purporting to control and contain a Vast Mystery they apprehend that is apparently beyond the wildest imagination of the hierarchy.  The best are leaving. I doubt they will return.
Tulsi is  a strong supporter of India's PM Modi, who is a Hindu nationalist (with distressing human rights violations in India as a consequence). She spoke at an event for Adelson,  the radical right Jewish casino magnate who rejects a two-state solution, and who promised to raise $100 million for Trump.  http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/las-vegas-billionaire-sheldon-adelson-pledges-100m-for-trump-presidential-campaign/2016/05/15/  Her outrage at Phillipinos being typecast as terrorists does not extend to other countries with Muslim populations who have been similarly vilified by irresponsible politicians, of whom she is one.   Her record on support of common sense gun control laws is zero.  Tulsi's penchant and skill for self-promotion (and her sizable war chest) make this race a long-shot -- mahalo to Shay Chan Hodges for at least jarring some of our starry-eyed collective approbation of an ideological candidate far right of her democratic garb.
Didn't an Austrian say the same thing about the Jews in the 1930s? Your kind of guy!  And to think your relatives fought against him. Very sad
Getting back to unfounded assertions, rejecting them is perfectly reasonable and I would say most necessary.  What atheism is ... is quite simple.  It just takes that simple statement of fact to explain what it is.   It's far short of being a set of beliefs to be adhered to.
Please - try some education and nuance.  You may believe that life begins at conception but most catholics, using reason and current medical science, see a development before we pronounce *life*.  Guess what, even the Church held that position for centuries and most significant denominations and religions do not have such a black and white life at conception cut off e.g. Protestants, Jews, Eastern Orthodox, etc.  Compare slavery and abortion - really - guess you know from experience about which is worse?
Surely, that depends on whether ten atheists count as "two or three" gathered "in my name" (Mt 18:20)? I believe until the 1983 code of canon law a licit Mass (not sure about validity) required at least one person in addition to the priest.
I worked for Quail Park and was fired for refusing to work with a man who put residents to bed wet and  baptized/blessed the dead body of  an Atheist resident. Don't put your loved ones in these places. They are all the same. For what they charge you you could keep them at home with around the clock care.
if the homeless jew went on a hunger strike ......would some one give him $1,500 to get a motale for a month......??????
In the name of cultural accommodation, Canada is turning back the clock on the rights of women and the LGBTQ community.  Allowing the tail to wag the national dog is an affront to the memory of all those who made great personal sacrifices and fought tirelessly for decades to ensure that women and LGBTQ Canadians could enjoy equal rights in our country. Canadians have no obligation to roll out the welcome mat for those whose ideology (masquerading as a religion) calls for the murder of non-believers, Jews, Christians, "apostates" and homosexuals. . No Canadian with a memory of history would welcome Nazis into our midst. Why then are we supposed to welcome and accommodate those whose Seventh Century ideology is just another variant of fascism?
This article brings to mind something I often think about. Why does the concept of faith become a stumbling block in our relations with others? Why should I care whether or not a Muslim or Jew believes Jesus is divine? Why shouldn't the common ground we can arrive at through our respective moral codes and our shared humanity be enough?  It seems that so many of the issues that become contentious between adherents of different religions are more about politics and power than spirituality. The older I get, the less I can get my head around a God that cares more about the profession of a creed than the behavior that profession inspires.   [NOTE: I expect the usual anti-Muslim hysteria to follow. To save time, let me state up front that I won't respond. Every religion has ancient literature with incendiary passages, and most Muslims aren't radicals. They want no more than the rest of us want out of life, which is to live in peace. That's all I have to say on the subject.]
Religions are systems of symbols that point to the mystery we call God. Most religions arise, last a couple of hundred years, then fade into oblivion, their symbols exhausted. Judaism and Christianity are along the longest-lasting extant religions, but they won't continue forever. Ideas that spoke to earlier generations -- covenant, incarnation, atonement, etc. -- will one day be replaced by new ideas and symbols that speak to the people of that time.
So if it is all economics, the Orthodoxy is irrelevant.    It is just an internal political issue for Netanyahu to retain power.   We sell to Israel; we sell to Saudi Arabia; Friedman's Jewish issue doesn't change any of that.  Where is my dog in Friedman's  fight?
"but all manner of lawbreakers. Anarchists, rioters, baby-killers, anyone who wants to destroy property, people, and our way of life"   " baby killers" ???  do they eat the babies like the jews did? or just sacrifice them?
Worst President Ever!!!  Nazi sympathizer.  "I watched the tapes real closely. Closer than all of you,"  claimed Trump at the mess of a new conference. Did you see the Vice news video where the racist psycho Christopher Cantwell talked about your son in law being a "dirty Jew" and wondering how you allowed him to marry your daughter?  Guess he missed that one, or is OK with it?  What a lazy weirdo. The man does nothing except play golf, fart around, and work hard on increasing his obesity.  And now Trump is back on the golf course.  55th day golfing since taking office.  Are we tired of all this winning yet?  http://www.businessinsider.com/why-people-are-furious-with-trump-charlottesville-white-supremacist-vice-video-2017-8
all the Abrahamic religions, dependent on an indispensable Monotheism, are at their cores, incompatible with liberal democracy...it's a top down system, which any reading of the various religious texts would easily clarify. Which is why, during their heydays, all three were easily aligned with top down political and social  systems...kings, and Popes and emperors  and sheikhs, and princes and emirs...the religions lend themselves to acceptance of authoritative rule  The difference between Christianity , Judaism and Islam however is that Islam was never confronted with pressure to change, secularize and adapt to a new set of ideals through either a Renaissance or Enlightenment....the age of competitive Islamic scientific and cultural advancement generally stalled after ~ the 1200s...one might ask, where are the Islamic world's post golden age philosophers and scientists who have challenged the very central tenets of the religion and forced it to confront its ideological constructs.....
I grew up in a Jewish household. I distinctly remember the exact same sentiment being expressed when I was young: "Why would so and so (great actors) lower themselves to such a bad film" As if actors are great artists. HA! I was always baffled by the sentiment. Hollywood is basically pure opium for the masses. Horse manure nonsense for the masses. If it keeps you entertained while plopped on the couch, kudos. Other than that. Please don't suggest such nonsense as why do great actors do bad films. Hollywood is many things. Much of the lefty agenda embedded in the message is sickening.   And at least open your brain enough to consider that most people DO NOT consider Hollywood actors great artists of any sort.  Decades ago when movies first came out, long before we could easily create our own professional level broadcasts with our cell phones, people were mesmerized by the movies. The technology was simply astounding. But have you watched any of those films?
White supremacist neoNazis in the White House wouldn't spark any anti-Semitism violence or hate, eh?  Another Jewish cemetery was trashed, headstones upended, typical M.O. recognizable through years of the same.
I feel pitty for the writer who comes from Sikh background and has shown absolute hate for Hindus in this article. Every nation & its citizens have right to decide for themselves and by depicting such poor state of affairs, the writer has shown her low demeanor.   India is a fastest growing economy and will continue progressing and all western nations are benefitting from this growth.   Every nation has its own fair share of problems and India is no different.
The article says "Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, the latest directed at Egypt’s increasingly embattled Christian minority following two church bombings last month that killed more than 45, also claimed by the group".  Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslims don't have to influenec or insprie any other Muslim. All Muslim jihadists have to do is follow Islam, the hadiths and the many verses in the Quran, the holy book of Islam, that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers (infidels).  Islam and the hadiths and the verses in the Qur'an are inspiration enough.
Note how Cassandra gets to use her Sheldon Adelson reference, even though it is irrelevant to the conversation.  She's mentioned Adelson a few times in he past 24 hours, in relation to various articles.  Both Adelson and Oliver (who she also mentions) are both jewish.  What's up with Cassandra?
Well, the Christians  spent almost 500 years in the Crusades against the Muslims,  and it wasn't until after that that Martin Luther started questioning the Catholic Church.    The "protestants'  have split so many times since then that there are too many little groups to have a good war.  Of course, the Jews have always been a good target for all unhappy 'Christians' but they are alos too dispersed to make a good war.  And socio-political movements like those in Northern Ireland have always liked to hang their desire for power on a religious hook.  I believe that is also part of the actual meaning of the Sunni-Shi'a conflicts over the centuries including the present day.
gee, people have been in this country a year on this program and you proclaim it a failure?  By what measure?  Have other immigrants and refugees done as well after a year with less support such as the Irish Catholics in the 1800s, the Jews in the early 1900s, the Hungarians in 1956, the Sihks, the Vietnamese the Koreans and the Lebanese in more recent times?
I have been to Apartheid ISRAEL that daily terrorizes the PALESTINIANS, particularly children, has illegally established Jewish settlements in PALESTINE. Now ISRAEL is threatening holy CHRISTIAN & Muslim sites. Most certainly all funding $38 Billion from OBAMA at the urging of Mazie and BRian must immediately stop. AMERICA should not support ISRAEL Terrorism. IfAmericansKnew.org., Jewishvoiceforpeace.org. Chritianpeacemakers.org.
Your first and last statements puzzle me. For one, I absolutely believe in the non-existence of things, so do you. I'm sure everyone on this thread firmly believes in the non-existence of dragons. And your last statement "Atheism is not a belief in the non-existence of God." You're describing Agnosticism, from Google: atheism "disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God or gods." And there is no difference between "disbelief... in the existence of God" and "belief that God does not exist." Those are logically equivalent statements. Maybe you're not an atheist, maybe you're an agnostic....

It's funny that there the author never bothers to explain the anti-Jewish rhetoric found in the Qur'an, and goes on to explain that the Ahadith filled with hatred for Jews are "alleged" sayings of the Prophet. I think Muslims need to introspect and examine their own canonical texts, starting with the Qur'an, and then do some writing and discourse on such topics. Merely blaming some preachers whose views find ample support within your own holy book is not the way to go. And thank you for reminding us that MEMRI is "pro-Israeli".
Well, that's the end of Israel. This year will mark the 50th Anniversary of the Six-Day War, the war that began the occupation. Expect violent protests. If the Two-State Solution is defunct, then the only other option is annexation. Which means making all Palestinians Israeli citizens. Which means the End of the Jewish State.   See Thomas Friedman's plea in the NYTimes: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/opinion/president-trump-will-you-save-the-jews.html
In your question to ATF: What is the reason (the 'just and reasonable cause') why the priest is celebrating Mass with only ten atheists present?
Monday the U.S. Supreme Court refused - for probably at least the 10th time in 40 years - to reconsider the issue of unanimous juries when it decided APODACA vs. OREGON in 1972. The Louisiana case involved a murderer sentenced to life without parole who was convicted on a 10-2 verdict. That is not now possible in Oregon, nor has it ever been. Oregon requires a unanimous verdict for all murder CONVICTIONS but unlike most states and the federal system, allows a vote of 10-2 to find any defendant, even one accused of murder, NOT GUILTY. The law was changed in Louisna as part of its dark past in repealing Reconstruction, while Oregon's vote came half a century later. Measure 302, also grantedf defendants a right rare in America, the right to WAIVE a jury, without the agreement of the prosecution. The Governor of Oreg in 1934 was the state's first Jewish Governor. History and context actually matters.
Kenneth Baitsholts is quite correct: "The reality is that we already have a one-state solution. It is the chauvinistically Jewish character of that state that is the problem."  The two-state two-step has given both American and Israeli politicians cover for over 20 years now.  The Americans could pretend they were demanding that Israel make some sort of concessions for peace, while the Israelis could go on building settlements while pretending they were open to  . . . well, something, someday.  The whole thing has been a giant charade.  The only one who was ever sincere about it was Yitzhak Rabin, who paid with his life for one last attempt to solve the problem Israel could have and should have solved in 1967, when it was still possible.  The world must now formally recognize that "Ispalestine" is a single apartheid state in which Jews rule over Arabs who are denied citizenship, legal protection and, very often, human rights.
Why do Atheists spend so much time and effort talking about something they are convinced  doesn't exist ?
Chris,   I've studied this pretty extensively and have no skin in the game. While Kiev Rus' existed for a brief time long, long ago, collapsing and disintegrating in the 12th Century. Since then, their was truly never a Ukraine nation until formation in 1991.  Their was a brief and contended 'nation' from 1917-21 as well I believe.  Moreover, the borders of Kiev Rus' overlap many other existing nations today with overlapping nationalities. This makes it a very complicated topic and further suggests that no one, including the Russians or Ukrainians, has an absolute nationalist claim on the territories currently forming Ukraine.  Polish, Lithuanian, Latvian, Belarusian, Estonian, Jewish, Estonian, and Russian peoples all have long historic roots in this region. It's very complicated. More so than in many other parts of the world.
1939, Liberal William Mackenzie King. Do the Liberals still have something against those of Jewish  faith?
When it comes to designing a Holocaust Museum, I think one's Jewishness is of vital importance.  My grandfather was from Zhitomir, Ukraine and immigrated in 1915.  When I speak of my grandfather's origins it is always as a Jew from Ukraine, as at that time, his ethnicity, language and culture set him very much apart from his ethnically Ukrainian neighbours.
Other newspapers have reported on the French Jewish immigration to the land of Rene.  Hopefully my Quebec brothers will make them feel welcome.
I'm glad someone's finally calling out the jewish influence in American politics.  The jewish lobby AIPAC is the largest financial contributor to both the republican and democratic parties.  They control both sides by stuffing money down our politicians throats.
What is "OUR" language?  "a variety of ethnicities and religions"  So this dude was screaming out against Catholics, Jews, Mormons, Protestant, Lutherans, Christians, etc.  John Badman, hopefully this home-grown red-neck didn't speak out against YOUR religion, if you have one! Maybe we can ALL assimilate into your religion?!  God knows, we don't want to be different.
There are plenty of atheists who do not like the liberal direction of our nation.
Let Christian  and Jewish students also have their own  prayer in school rooms, paid for by taxes gleaned from Muslim parents.  Muslims would be outraged they would be forced to pay for infidel religious rites in the publci school system.
Ariel,  I respect and take interest in the fact that you claim that science had no bearing on your determination that God/gods doesn't don't exist, though it's impossible for us not to consider the fact that atheism is in the very zeitgeist of our age and played a role in our social constructions. I also agree that the word "rationality" takes on different meanings over the ages, and yes, their were atheists before the scientific revolution. But again, in the spirit of our age, it is hard to refute that rationality is based upon "facts", and those facts, in the modern age, have tended to fit within the scientific understanding of the term, even in the social sciences. It is hard to deny though, that their do seem to be two forms of atheist, ones who claim science as proof of atheism, and others who do not.  But their are many Christian faiths too and we are speaking generally here. Generally speaking, modern atheists, as a group tend to claim science supports their views. Maybe not you
Why did you continue after writing the first sentence? Is not the rest of the post "your beliefs" that are "unsupportable opinions based on unprovable fiction"? There are, in fact, no experiments that can be done today that can "prove" anything that may or not have happened 1, 2, 4, or 14 billion years ago. The fact is that atheists have to add a lot of time into their version of history to make things (supposedly) work, so they simply interpret the "evidence" in a way that best fits their ideology. - But as someone continually says, if a world-wide flood did cover the entire earth, what we find is exactly what we would expect to find: Billions of fossils of billions of dead things buried under thousands of feet of sedimentary rock layers all over the world (even on the mountaintops).
You mean religions like Christianity & Judaism?
Nice spin reader but you ignored the first part of my post where I referenced the OP's statement "I don't know of a cemetary in Canada that ever turned a body away."  Now it is certainly true that the OP is not all knowing about cemeteries. My reply to him was to point out that Catholic cemeteries (and likely Jewish ones) do restrict themselves to people of and closely associated with their faith. You described this as a fake fact. I then provided examples to prove my statement. Examples which clearly disprove your assertion that my post was a "fake fact". You cannot deny that there are Catholic cemeteries who restrict who can be buried there and that my assertion is correct.  However I will freely admit that my statement is not all encompassing and that there are some Catholic cemeteries that do allow others to be buried there. I'm willing to step up and admit that I was only partially correct. Are you willing to do the same and admit that  your fake fact allegation is also wrong?
The Romans executed Jesus to prevent a riot from the Jews.  The Jews wanted him gone because he both threatened the Jewish religious leaders' power and disappointed them because he wouldn't start a revolt to push out the Romans.
A Jew invented the poison gas used in the Nazi death camps. Blacks sold black slaves to white slavers. Does that mean most Jews like Nazis, or most blacks supported race based slavery? You seem to be using that kind of logic. Some people in power will use anyone that is willing to promote their goals.
"Once you accept the faulty thesis that Canada is 'too white' and needs more diversity"...this is the very essence of the so-called "Kalergi plan" - just google Richard Nikolaus Eijiro, Count of Coudenhove-Kalergi. Quote from Wikipedia: "In his book Praktischer Idealismus (Practical Idealism), written in 1925, he describes the future of Jews in Europe and of european racial composition with the following words:[45]  "The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The Eurasian-Negroid race of the future, similar in its appearance to the Ancient Egyptians, will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals." Coming to Canada soon?
“The President’s sudden acknowledgement is a Band-Aid on the cancer of Antisemitism that has infected his own Administration. His statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting Antisemitism, yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record. Make no mistake: The Antisemitism coming out of this Administration is the worst we have ever seen from any Administration. The White House repeatedly refused to mention Jews in its Holocaust remembrance, and had the audacity to take offense when the world pointed out the ramifications of Holocaust denial. And it was only yesterday, President’s Day, that Jewish Community Centers across the nation received bomb threats, and the President said absolutely nothing.   continued
And as I keep saying: No, it isn't the same argument at all. The Church, after Pentecost, was open to all nations and not just Jews.
Wrong again, Marty E.  Herr Hitler, like Herr tRump, blamed his nation's problems on those he considered unfit for his nation.  Hitler blamed Jews, homosexuals, Gypsies, leftists, and, in the end, anyone who opposed him.  Trump blames immigrants, Muslims, leftists, and anyone who opposes him.
Gotta give him praise for trying, his experiences are meant for the benefit of all. And the Jews have paid with blood for their lessons learned. Thank you for this article.
Skin heads minor group of thugs with no real political power. Presently we have two fascist leaders in the World one is in Turkey named Erdogan leader of Turkey. He denies the Armenian Genocide of 1915 (1.5 million murdered by the Ottoman Turks) he has made it crime even to mention this terrible crime. The next leader would be Bibi of Israel who desires "living space for Jewish Settlers" only modern day event close to this is Germany 1939 Warthe district Poland. Poles were expelled for German Settlers in November 1939. Amazing thing is both Bibi and Erdogan get away with it!!!!!!!
..."would be for Canadians to begin actively supporting the Inuit hunters, designers and craftspeople who make a living from and depend upon seal."...  A lot of Canadians out there who are vegetarians or vegans, and do not support the consumption of any meat. A lot of Canadians out there who do not support a fur trade of any kind.  Are they supposed to change their belief systems?  And vegetarianism is strongly linked to cultural and spiritual belief systems like Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism. Are those belief systems not as important? Should they begin to "actively support" Inuit hunters? What does that even mean?   "Canadians" are not a homogenous group. What happened to cultural diversity?  Our PM says we are  supposed to be a post nation state. Except it seems, when there is a finger of blame to be pointed.
Disgraceful that there was no mention of the focus of the holocaust on Jews which resulted from the Nazi's vicious ant-semitic hatred anad ethnic cleansing.  Of course, the record shows that Pierre was admired fascists in his youth and was anti-semitic, as well as against WW1 and WW2 when he was against providing refuge for displaced Jews.  The apple did not fall far from the tree..
Religious studies but not religious practice.  Good idea. Christians and Jews  can agree with that.  But, no Muslim parent would ever permit  their kids learn passages from the Bible or listen to a guest Rabi explain  the Torah.  That could lead to apostasy,  the worst sin in Islam.
A man writes about his father's death and funeral, and all you can think to write about is how unfair it was that so many priests and a bishop presided at the funeral mass?  How petty. Please take a look at MSW's bio.  He is a Visiting Fellow at Catholic University's Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies.  Arguably he meets and is friends with more priests and bishops than the average person, and they came to support him in his time of grief. Not because MSW is important, but because they know him personally and wanted to provide moral and religious support for a friend. There is plenty to comment about MSW and his politics and religious writing.  However, this type of comment on the day of his father's funeral is disrespectful and unacceptable behavior from anyone, Catholic, Christian, Jewish, Muslim or None of the above.  This comment should not have passed the Civility test.
There's no such thing as a Jewish, Christian or Islamic terrorist.  There is, however, no shortage psychotic killers using the name of these faith communities in a feeble attempt to justify their love affair with violence.  They don't fool anybody who knows anything about Judaism, Christianity or Islam, but they do fool the hard of thinking who are ignorant of what these three faith communities who all worship the God of Abraham stand for.
Agree. Sr. Schenk rightly invokes the often overlooked socio-economic context of Jesus's ministry in the Galilean countryside, a ministry mainly addressed to Jewish peasants crushed by debt:  <<Roman economic practices, especially in Galilee, were responsible for the systematic eviction of agrarian families from their ancestral lands. Israelites paid a threefold tax: to the local Herodian rulers, to Rome and to the Temple. This regressive system benefited the elite at the expense of peasant farmers and poor artisans whose labor kept the empire's wealthy fed and clothed.>>  It's also true the gospel agitates against the human drive for domination. I had never heard of Walter Wink and am grateful for the introduction.   Thanks for an excellent article, Sister!
Cognitive Dissonance is a fascinating concept; it was pioneered by a Jewish psychologist Leon Festinger and I first learned it at first year Western University. It comprises the in ability to adjust ones opinions to new reality and the pain it causes internally to be self contradicted....the fact is Donald has a lot of Jewish support.
Your not playing Brett, Ruben Reyes is playing and he played you. Surely you know the meaning of the term.  . He posts under multiple aliases and always takes an adversarial and petty role to lower the level of the discourse. Whenever someone calls him on it he appeals to authority, the moderators or in this case the author to protect him from anyone who dares challenge him.  When the thread goes stale he deletes all his posts to obscure his disruptive activities . No need to get defensive about it, Ruben is a pro at manipulating people. Anyway how is whining about the misspelling the name Ruben on topic? And his bigoted white people and dumb Jews comment? What aspect of the topic exactly do those slurs address?
Mythical ancestral home, really.   Ancient Israel lasted all of about 200 of the last 3000 years. There are plenty of others who made it their home for much longer than that. Including the Palestinians.   It would have been better, post-WWII,  for a Jewish state to have been created in Austria (or maybe Bavaria) by basically turning the whole country over to the Zionists.   It would have been fairer to everybody.
You are missing the point. Yes, the past was bloody, Christians today reject that kind of action, they don't claim it with pride, but shame. They have learned from history, and evolved.  So what does that have to do with the present?  In the present, some groups commit acts of terrorism *in the name of* their religion. That is what makes it "Muslim terrorism", rather than "Communist terrorism", or "Anarchist terrorism", etc.  The Weathermen, the Baader-Meinhoff Gang, etc.,  were organised terrorist groups who acted out of a common ideology, so are ISIS or al-Quaeda-inspired terrorists.  There is no equivalent so far for Bissonnette, he did not claim to be acting in the name of Christianity, so why describe him as a Christian terrorist? Because of his ethnic origins?  So are atheists also going to be considered "Christian" because of their ethnic origins?
When you can show me how something you drop falls up rather than down, I will be happy to have a conversation about the reality of natural law.   That most other Americans - Christian, Jewish, and Muslim - believe homosexual behavior is immoral is a demonstrable fact. To you and those who share your contempt for their beliefs that  "it makes it difficult to raise children who are morally straight" and "it weakens the family as the cornerstone of society", they give chorus of "So what?"  Every law, including the Constitution, is a matter for a majority decision.  As the last election demonstrated, sufficient arrogance leads to a practical demonstration of that reality.
"He remarried and moved to Israel in 1950, where he built a family" Rest in peace, Mr. Kristal, may the memory of your name be for a blessing. The Nazi German leaders of the 1930s and 1940s are dead, their bodies turned to dust. THEIR names are offal in the mouths of all decent people. Mr. Kaplan survived them all AND built a new family. Maybe his children had grandchildren. Jews. Are. Still. HERE! That is the sweetest revenge of all.
Almost every world leader would disagree. So would Jews who wish to keep the Holocaust in memory. Thats why its called a memorial.
"You sank or swam on your own. This is no longer a Judeo-Christian nation."  So sinking or swimming on your own is what constitutes a Christian nation?  It sounds like you have been reading atheist-materialist Ayn Rand instead of the Gospels.
"Nothing is more natural and morally just than Jews building in Judea [West Bank].” - Oded Revivi  That belief is the source of all territorial wars. Territorial wars are fought when one group claims natural and moral authority over a specific part of our planet. However, no such authority exists. Rather, humanity collectively has natural and moral authority (and responsibility) over the entire planet as an indivisable whole. Nations may claim authority over land, but only so far as they are politically legitimate.  Groups of individual humans may not claim authority over the earth on the basis of race, religion, or ethnicity. It's an affront to human rights when they do.
When's the last time Jewish people rioted, let alone killed someone, over a slight to their religion?  Never.  Same thing with Christians, Hindus and Buddhists.  The laws that prohibit Holocaust denial?  They were enacted by the non-Jewish leaders of European countries, who were presumably disgusted with the Holocaust complicity of some of their fellow citizens.
No doubt you consider the Jews fighting the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising as equally guilty. I consider them heroic...
The "underlying principle" is that too many people "confuse" (lie) about what The Baker "discriminated" against. - He didn't refuse to serve the customer. He declined to use his artistic talents to create an "edible piece of art" that went against his religious beliefs......much as I would expect an Orthodox Jew to decline to decorate a cake with "Jesus, the Son of God, Loves You" on it.  - Bakers don't have to decorate a cake that depicts a "black man being lynched" for the same reason that baker shouldn't be forced to bake a "gay wedding cake": It's the "art work" that's the issue, not the customer.
Israel will continue jus the way it is unless extreme pressure is applied from the US. It WANTS to continue to steal Palestinian lands and a two-state solution would render that difficult. It will not formally expand its borders and make the Palestinians Israel citizens either because the Jewish people  would then be in the minority which would defeat the whole point of a Jewish state in the region.
Notice that he dropped the "Kopel" from his surname. When he was our rep in SE Portland, he ran as "Jules Kopel-Bailey." His mom, Kopel, is an atheist. That tells me a lot.
This can and does have a positive effect on many people.   Many people have not heard the good news since it has been withdrawn from  public schools.   This 'bronze age zombie jew' gave his life for you.   He wants you for his brother.
Beautifully said.  Oregon needs Richardson.  He reminds me of the old Hebrew National deli meats commercials.  Richardson does not answer to special interests, lobbyists or whatever current expression of political correctness is grabbing headlines, he answers to a higher moral authority.  I am an atheist but sincerely hope I can trust Richardson to hold fast to his principles.  Oregon is too lovely a place to be so diverted by mere human B.S.
The uncomfortable truth is that outside of the western world, western style dating is frowned upon.  This article showcases an Islamic dating app, but it is the norm in many non-western countries too. There are many for Christians and Hindus in India, where most marriages are arranged. The profiles of suitors are in many cases setup by the parents who choose. Such apps also make navigating cultural nuances with pan-religious/ethnic groups easy. For example, Hindu dating apps allow for specification of caste. Islamic dating apps allow specification of language, since many languages are represented in the pan-Islamic world.  In such cultures, asking a soul mate out for dinner or for a movie is a great way to alienate oneself from his/her family, and possibly, even killed. This conservatism is more prevalent in Islamic countries and hyper-conservative places like India.  Just ask the Shafia sisters. Oh wait, they were murdered by conservative representatives from these cultures.
So you agree that there is an indigenous group in the middle east who are jewish/Israelites/Hebrews?  Because you always claim that they are occupiers.
So here is some real education for you:-  The world's largest Christian country (USA), by population, only has Christian festivals as public holidays.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_the_United_States  The world's largest Muslim country (Indonesia), by population, has Muslim, Hindu, Christian and Buddhist festivals as public holidays.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Indonesia
There is a simple solution. Let Jews, Protestants and Catholics use  the same prayer room, at different times to show unity and love. Muslims will certainly appreciate that.
My reply to Sher below was deleted as "below the uncivility threshold for publication", but it was in no way uncivil.   It just went a step further in pointing out the absurdity of his argument by asking if we can expect the same consequences from our Buddhist second generation Canadians identifying with their Buddhist brethren in Myanmar if we intervene there...
I note that the following post was zapped for incivility. The two-line post in its entirety follows, in quotes.  <<"WH: No mention of Jews on Holocaust Remembrance Day because others were killed too"  http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/white-house-holocaust-memorial-day/index.html>>  The report at the link explains:  <<The White House statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day didn't mention Jews or anti-Semitism because "despite what the media reports, we are an incredibly inclusive group and we took into account all of those who suffered," administration spokeswoman Hope Hicks told CNN on Saturday.>>  I would like to hear the excuse for voting this down.
Lorenzo Vidino also said about the NCCM and  the Muslim Brotherhood: ''The problem is more indirect, Vidino said. “Generally speaking, the movement has not abandoned violence as a tool to advance its agenda.” Tactically, it doesn’t pursue violence, “but it’s not heartfelt,” he said.  “They have this narrative where they lump together foreign policy issues with issues like cartoons and so on as part of a big narrative that proves this point that the West hates Muslims and Islam. It’s that mainstreaming of this narrative which is very much the staircase to violent radicalization and the brotherhood does mainstream that. It provides somewhat of a fertile environment.'' http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/beware-of-the-muslim-brotherhood-expert-warns
So, only Atheists allowed in politics now?
Blaming all liberals for this terrible crime is despicable, just as blaming all Muslims for the terror attacks of a few is despicable. No one in media or in the Democratic Party, and certainly not Bernie Sanders who has never advocated violence for any reason, is in any way responsible for the terrible choice made by one person. Bernie Sanders this morning immediately and publicly disavowed this violence. I would remind you, WALLe and others, that violent speech from all corners of society has inspired many acts of domestic terrorists against a broad spectrum of society: Jews, blacks, government and its workers, police, Muslims, gays, and of course, liberals and now, conservatives. We all need to limit our protests to speech, and foreswear taking up guns.  I would point out that neither the president nor any member of his cabinet was targeted. I would ask you to take down your insulting and inflammatory post, and join the rest of us in deploring this tragedy brought about by one man.
I find it ironic that Jewish culture seems to celebrate Chinese food including pork.
From the beginning of the Klan in Oregon they distributed lists of stores to shop in that did not include stores owned by Catholics or Jewish people. The Meier & Frank store in Portland was boycotted because it was owned by Jewish people. One can maybe try to make the case that the focus of the Oregon Klan was greater toward anti Catholic & anti Jewish than the southern Klan but to pretend that they were focused on prohibition only is a gross fabrication.
From the dawn of humankind, conquest always conferred ownership. In the Americas, many nations conquered the Natives, and claimed ownership, which was recognized by the other nations. The Israelites  were conquered, and removed from their lands, which were immediately claimed by the conquerors. Even God said that the Israelites would dwell amongst the nations, forgetting their heritage, until God returned them to their previous lands. So now, we see the first-fruits of Israel ... the tribe of Judah, part of Benjamin, and some Levites occupying that portion of "Israel" which they conquered, took by force of arms. By the time honored rule of conquest, the Jews own the lands which they occupy. The British had conquered and occupied the land, exercised ownership, until the mandate, which provided for the Jews to return to their homeland. This was a mere ending to the Western powers resistance to them returning "home". Several hard-fought wars have re-enforced Israel's rightful ownership.
"It was a split among ethnic lines, actually, Greek-speaking vs. Jewish-speaking in the community of Jerusalem."  I see what you did there.
I don't agree a "more assertive political Islam" is "taking root" and I think your objection to the freedom of Muslims to observe their practice of barring menstruating women from participating in prayer is a little precious to say the least. There are practicing Jews who require women to do some sort of "cleanse" when menstruating and it's not as though the wider Canadian culture is entirely even-keeled on the subject. How many offensive terms are there for menstruation after all?  As for how to balance the competing interests of the freedom of a group to practice its religious beliefs and the rights of women to equal treatment, I think we apply the test that should be applied to all situations involving competing rights: a right extends until it infringes another. If we think Muslim women are being harmed by being barred from prayers (not sure that's the case) then we protect women's right to pray.  BTW I think your use of words suggests just a little Islamophobia. Just sayin'.
Since atheists go to heaven, I guess everyone goes to heaven   If this is the case, then why do we need Jesus for salvation, or the sacraments of the Catholic Church?   Seems silly.
I, an atheist for 30 years, love Christmas!  I celebrate all of the beauty in a way that makes sense to me.  It's a time for family, a magical time for kids, beautiful music, and a month of comfort food and treats.  Most Christmas traditions are pagan, so there's no need to apologize for celebrating 'their' holiday. Make it what you want it to be, regardless of your beliefs.
Hasn't it dawned on you that Canadian society includes Muslims, along with Jews, Born Again Christians, Doukhobors, atheists, Hindus...?
I've read that atheism is growing faster than any religion.
Ummm....good ole Mo slaughtered the Jews who took him in, tended to his wounds, and provided aided in his recovery.  Me thinks the Jewish tribes Bani Qaynuqa, Bani Al-Nadir, and Bani Qurayza had apposite views than you kind sir.  Regarding science, there has been nothing. No original discovery since the complete Mo Islamification of the ME. The breakthroughs attributed to Arab scholars were prior to Mo.  Any recent arab scientist of strong islamic faith learned their heathen knowledge from infidel science sources. These guys tend to be mediocre.  The successful non islamic arab scientist of any note lately did their critical educational studies in infidel western institutions and most of them tend to be atheist.
Why is it so horrible to hate people based on race, but to hate people based on their poverty is acceptable?   For example, a rare demonstration by a white supremacist group causes an enormous uproar of shock and disapproval; but the everyday vilification of Donald Trump's supporters, millions of them unemployed and on welfare, Hillary Clinton's "basket of deplorables", is perfectly good.   It's absolutely not a problem to ignore the homeless but ignore an ethnic minority and one could incite the ire of the "inclusiveness police".   All sorts of wisecracks about people existing on welfare are perfectly fine, but don't dare say anything anti-Semitic about a Jewish person.   Hatred of the poor is the hidden hate and it probably causes more harm to more people than racist hate.   Why the double standard?
You're right! The people chanting "Jews will not replace us" while marching were obviously concerned about the removal of Confederate statues. How could the fake news media not see that?
Except the Buddhists didn't kill any Muslims in Afghanistan.
I noticed that the face of the masculine aspect of God the Father (played by Graham Greene) is not shown in the trailer, but the face of the feminine aspect of God the Father (played by Octavia Spencer) certainly is. I wonder if that is also true of the movie as a whole, and what that suggests theologically.  It's interesting that Radha Mitchell is in this movie, "Radha" being an Incarnation of the Divine Feminine, in Hinduism.
July 2, 1946: The King David Hotel in Jerusalem was bombed,  (killing 91 people). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifQVDUK4DwU   Menachem Begin, who was later awarded the Nobel Prize for peace, is the same man who planned the destruction of the King David Hotel and the massacre of Deir Yassin. Ex prime minister, Shamir, was originally a member of the Jewish terrorist gang called Irgun, which was headed by none other than Menachem Begin. Shamir later moved over to the even more radical "Stern Gang," which committed many vicious atrocities.  Shamir himself has defended the various assassinations committed by the Irgun and Stern gangs on the grounds that "it was the only way we could operate, because we were so small. So it was more efficient and more moral to go for selected targets." The selected moral targets in those early days of the founding of the state of Israel included bombing of the King David Hotel and the massacre of Deir Yassin.
Arabs and Jews are both semites so maybe learn the right terminology if you are going to use it. You probably mean anti-Zionist but calling for equal rights is neither so you are just flat out wrong.....
Objections to comparing Zionists to Nazis are groundless.  Lehi aka the Stern Gang (this was one of the two Jewish terrorist groups that massacred the people of Deir Yassin), which was founded by Avram Stern and led by Yitzhak Rabin in 1940 offered allegiance to the THIRD REICH, to even help them conquer the middle-east, in return for allowing establishment of an independent, exclusively Jewish fascist state in Palestine.  They were rebuffed by the Nazis as of little military consequence, and then offered their allegiance to Stalinist Russia, which apparently wasn’t impressed either.  In 1948 the new Zionist government inducted Lehi members into the IDF, but in response to their atrocities convicted them of terrorism a year later—then granted them amnesty.  And of course mass-murdering terrorist Rabin was elected Prime Minister.  Since 1980 the IDF has awarded the "Lehi-Ribbon" to those who still rape and murder "...for the establishment of Israel".  Lehi got his fascist Jewish state.
Lela:  Before you start feeling too superior over muslims because you think Mohammed was a pedophile, you should remember that Jesus was first and foremost a Jew.  He self identified as Jewish, and had no conception of "Christianity".  He did not write or dictate the New Testament - which was written mostly based on letters and writings of his disciples.  So most of what we know about Jesus himself are things that the disciples wanted us to know, or decided that we should know - unlike Mohammad who actually dictated the Koran. Islam also has the Hadith, which is a detailed account of the sayings and life of Mohammad.  But we do know that Jewish girls during the time of Christ generally were betrothed very young - and that marriage was usually consummated  at puberty - which could be as young as 9, 10 or 11.  Almost all Jewish men of that era married - not to do so would be very unusual - so there is no reason at all to believe that Jesus did not marry a young child bride himself.
Your post is both offensive and incorrect. Hitler did target the Jewish people.
A few corrections:-  The Partition riots took place in 1947. I am not sure what you think was happening in 1948 and 1949. Perhaps you can enlighten us?  Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs are not different ethnic groups. They are different religious groups. I know your school couldn't teach you the difference.   Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs are not superstitious groups either. I repeat, they are religious groups.
Huh.  I wonder how the Jews in Germany in the 1930s would have fared had they had automatic weapons.  Don't be naive; not everyone is a pacifist.
You misquote me.  I did NOT say the God of the Christians or the Jews was HaSatan.  That would be blasphemy.  I said the god of the ZIONISTS is HaSatan.  Did not your Impostor Paul say the god of this world is satan?  Whom would you claim to be the god of the Nazis?  I suggest it's the same as that of the Zionists, playing both against each other.  Read again that quote of Ariel Sharon I posted and tell me you can see any difference between his and that old Firawm (Pharoah) Hitler's pronouncements.  That's by NO means the only example.  Kindly reply to what I say, not to what you in your presumption, sanctimoniousness, hubris and bigotry WISH I'd said.  Khalas.
Classical lies. Nobody is threatening to bomb Jewish kids people.   The call came from within the office. This isn't some sophisticated prank. Its typical Zio behavior.
This was my point in reference to GBA's comment: "It has no bearing on the average person what political leaning or belief system the person held. It doesn't represent the majority."  I reminded him that there have been various motivations and identities held by other mass murders. The fact this killer is an atheist is not a statement about atheism. I reminded him that I can lump in mass murders with almost any group of people, he questioned how that was possible so I reminded him.  I was precisely trying to stop the "this group is to blame" finger pointing that happens after any round of this carnage. I am sick and tired of the "of course this happened" vs "what a sad fluke" double standard people make based on a killer's identity and their affiliation with it.  You just read my examples and apparently came to the conclusion that "FishOrSpoon hates conservatives" for some reason.  I'm not going to assume you're illiterate like you think I am, but you are misunderstanding me.
I believe Jesus of Nazareth existed. I don't think he is a myth. The Gospels were written only a few decades after Jesus' death. By contrast, Moses or Abraham died centuries before the Torah/Five Books of Moses were written down. "The early Christians seem to have believed Christ would return within their lifetime and establish God's kingdom on earth." I agree. St. Paul's letters and the other epistles were written "before" the Gospels were. The early Christian religion in those letters is very different than what Christianity became. I believe, for example, that the concept of Jesus' divinity or the Trinity would have been foreign to St. Paul. Also, the Gospels were written over a period of 40 years, during which time, the adherents of early Christianity were kicked out of or left Judaism, and Jews fought and lost a war of independence against Rome. The Gospel of Mark is very different from the Gospel of John. Christianity succeeded because it adapted to fit Roman concepts.
"Jewish" is not a religion. Jews are an ethnic group. The religion of the Jews is Judaism, of which there are a number of forms.
No, atheism is the failure to accept the claim that a God or gods exist.  It is not the acceptance of the claim that no God or gods exist.
When they were senior Liberal Cabinet ministers did the authors say or  do anything for the Christians and Jews who were being persecuted and expelled from their homes in Iran and several Middle Eastern countries? I am pretty sure that they didn't, but let everyone know if they did.
I mean the Jewish people, especially their leaders who have opted to live on a strip of land in Palestine.
Your anger and hatred of Christians is palpable. Why so? Why would you say that Christians "ignore everything he taught?" Are you a student of the Bible and of Christianity? I suspect not. You seem to think that your own personal views of morality ought to be regulative.   Christians do not ignore what Jesus and Christianity teaches about homosexuality, for instance; or abortion. Those two awful immoral behaviors are not only accepted but celebrated by unbelievers and atheists, including most if not all Democrats.   I think you are seriously biased such that a half-way intelligent reader will immediately disregard what you write.
It is an origin story, after all. Like the death of Bruce Wayne’s parents at the hands of Joker, or Tony’ Stark’s by the Winter Solider, Bucky getting the last shot by Hydra or Captain America getting the first. Kal-el or Kara-el arriving from Krypton or the human legends of Odin Allfather and Frig, their son Thor)(Happy Thursday and TGIF) or Loki, who they fostered from King Frosty (all family legends for me as a descedent of Norman and Norse nobility). Eden was just another story, the Sumeric origin story adapted by a Jewish author.
That's the last straw. You KNOW you've entered the END-TIMES when the Buddhists start going POSTAL!
Nonsense.    First off, communism didn't fail because it set itself up as a mirror-opposistion of capitalism.  Communism failed because (1) those who actually tried to implement it were deeply flawed people with anger issues and an impulse toward authoritarianism, and (2) as a paradigm it was blind to human economic nature and incentives.  As for atheism, no, it does not need to disprove God.  It doesn't have to care that much.  An atheist these days is generally content with saying, 'I see no proof for God, so I don't believe.'
"America's amazing awesome time-honoured true blue values..."  Ahh, yes, the ones that accepted Irish child labour in the Pennsylvania coal mines. And the German and British immigrants in garment sweat shops in cities such as Camden, New Jersey and New York, where 146 died in the disastrous Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911 while shrugging off the Jewish and Italian tenements that had been a fact of immigrant life for decades before 1900.  THOSE amazing, awesome time-honoured true-blue values?   Generous democracy, indeed. Sure, if you were fleeing Russian Pogroms or the Irish potato famine. Set against Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs of needs, things were looking up, indeed.  Maybe not too much different for the Mexican illegal or Syrian refugee of today.   So much for the insinuation of "yesteday good, today bad." No reversal at all, really.  Same old. Until the last few days...
Q: Why is the Canadian government handing $300 million per year to a religious organization?  A: Because in this case, it is an honest, on the ground trusted organization in many of the countries that have been targeted for this aid.  Q: Would the same people who have (correctly) pointed this out be so vocally defensive of this, if the organization were Christian, or Jewish? Or would the response by questioning why a religious organization is receiving money from a secular government???
Too bad the U.N. as an organization and most western countries don't agree with you. Also unfortunate is the assumption on your part that I am an anti-semite because I choose to be on the right side of history. Many American Jews and Israelis also are opposed to the current Israeli government policies, not just people like myself who are not Jewish. Don't understand why you have to resort to name calling when people don't agree with you.
No, let's mind.  3 killed in Boston, and I can't find one for Chicago.  But these are the latest attempts  1. mosques, and White House  - Eric Feight, Glendon Scott Crawford  2. Courthouse, bank, forest festival, first-responders.  Jonathan Leo Schrader  3.9/11 Memorial event in Kansas City, Missouri. Joshua Ryne Goldberg A Jewish American man, Joshua Ryne Goldberg, posing as an Australian ISIS supporter, attempted to get an FBI confidential informant to detonate a bomb at a Kansas City, Missouri September 11 attacks memorial event. Goldberg attempted to persuade the confidential informant to coat the shrapnel of the bomb in rat poison in order to maximize casualties.  Funny Arabic names
Some years back I did write an article for Buddhist-Christian Studies about: "A Mahayana Theology of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist." Buddhist philosophy offers an alternative to the ontologies of the Platonic west and can help us ratchet down the highfalutin' insistence on ideological views. No one is saved by having the roght view.
No two state solution not because of Israel but Arabs ----------------------  Some senior Fatah members did argue for a two-state solution; they were assassinated.  "After Israel won territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, nothing changed.""The Jews, ever desperate to cut a deal, repeatedly offered to abandon most of the land they won in exchange for a lasting peace."  "The Arabs, as ever, overwhelmingly stood on principle. Some senior Fatah members did argue for a two-state solution; they were assassinated."  "Why would anyone ever think the Palestinians would accept a two-state solution?" - Lawrence Solomon - National Post - January 9, 2017
A couple of important points are missing.  No one that accepts Israel as  state, disputes Jerusalem as its capital.  Jews moved into eastern parts of the city after 1967 because before that, that part of the city was illegally occupied by Jordan and Jews were not even allowed to visit the holiest site in Judaism.  Imagine Muslims no being allowed to visit Mecca.   There is no "Palestinian" land.  The land in question was occupied by Jordan and Egypt until 1967.  Only since the 1967 was has some of that land actually come under Palestinian control, including the entire Gaza Strip vacated by Israel. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas (and their predecessors) have refused several offers of land for peace since 1967, and before 1967, when there was not a single "Settlement", the Arabs refused peace and rejcted a two state for two peoples solution.
A Muslim or Jewish deli would be able to easily say that they do not carry pork products, and therefore can't/won't sell the product.  The baker was denying a couple something he sells to others simply because they were gay.  As far as it being due to his religious beliefs, the other problem he runs into would be that it is unlikely he checks to make sure none of his heterosexual couples have committed sinful acts.  To me, if the couple wanted a cake with a decoration he found objectionable, I'd side with the baker so long as he offered to sell them the cake and the materials for the decoration.  If the baker refused to make #17 from the wedding cake catalog simply due to the customers being gay, then that is discrimination.
If you're a protestant, jew, or muslim--I agree.
An interesting question, but one you're not going to try to answer, I see, slofstra.  I'll give my opinion on yours, though.  The fact that TWU would be the only law school with this rule makes it no better than a single corner store which refuses to serve jews.
A thoughtful piece, Also Christmas is a beautiful time to celebrate the renewal of life -- in presents for children -- and the return of the sun after the solstice.  A less lovely aspect of Christianity is the intolerance practised by his followers in his name, in the millennia after his death. The Spanish inquisition and the crusades made one of my children exclaim, "You can love the guy, but you have to hate the fan club". The exclusivity, smugness, and irrationality of "only-if-you-believe-will-you-be-saved" made me shake my head at age eleven and walk away. As an almost-lifelong atheist, therefore, I can reassure some of the other commenters that there is no shortage of opportunities to help others outside church-based food drives. One can live one's love in professions such as medicine, and in celebrating mankind's diversity, and in championing social justice all year.
I remember some years ago I saw an interview with Alan Dershowitz on Charlie Rose  He talked about racism/anti-semetism etc  He explained that where he grew up there were Italian gangs, Portuguese gangs, Jewish gangs etc  He said 'that was tribalism, not examples of discrimination'  I wonder how much of that (tribalism) is what is what this is all about? After all what Canadian doesn't know what sort of 'hyphenated' variety of Canadian they are?
No Christian denomination has had any "prophets" since John the Baptist, that's precisely the point. Even Luther, Calvin, etc. are not considered prophets.  The Mormons claim there was a prophet in the 19th century who revealed a whole new set of laws, revelations, etc., that updates and supplements the Bible in radical ways, the way Christians say J-C and the New Testament updated and supplemented the Jewish Bible in a radical way. That's different from just claiming you understand the original Bible better than some other denomination. Radical enough that that makes Christians Christians, not a sect of Judaism, although in some ways they are and some small sects consider themselves so...  But if Christians are Christians and not a sect of Judaism in any meaningful sense, then Mormons are Mormons, not a sect of Christianity in any meaningful sense.
Um, doesn't work that way.  If it did, then it'd be one religion.  There are differences in their definition of their "god".  And, there sure as heck wouldn't be wars between them because of their belief (e.g., Muslims and Christians or Muslims and Judaists).
I am the Joe Miss Flowers is talking about. WHAT She needs to tell you more is how she responded to my information.. I wasn't mean to her, I just asked her to look into information that I have known for 25 years and she obviously has not known.Her reply to me was an F-BOMB. PERSONALLY, she should be repremanded for her actions, because if I dealt with the public like she did I would be fired. Her actions in no way represent a person in the media that represents professonialism. If a person thinks they know all about anything then they are a fool. She declined to even look at my information because if she did she wouldn't be writing this article, or for that matter if she agreed with me she wouldn't have a job. Much holocaust information has changed over the years. LOTS OF THINGS HAVE CHANGED THAT MOST STILL THINK IS TRUE AND IT IS NOT.  For example, Jews being made into soap, false, Jews being made into skin lampshades, false, the number 6 milion, false...I could go on and on.
..."God Incarnate wasn't aware of the origin of human sin and misery?"... Catholics believe two things about Jesus – that he was Divine ; but also that he was fully human.   It is often difficult for us to comprehend how these two things work together. But as a fully human person, Jesus chose to limit his human knowledge to whatever was the knowledge people had at his time and at his place.    He took the 'bible knowledge' as taught in his time, by the bible scholars of his time. He understood the physical world as people of his time understood it.    As a Jewish person of his tie, he would not have 'known' of the Universe as revealed by Hubble telescope, or of the planet earth, or continents like the Americas or Australia or the Polar regions.  His choosing to becoming 'fully human' does come with all its human limitations.
“lands Israel captured in a 1967 war”  Seized in a war Israel started strictly for the purpose of obtaining land the Zionists desire for “greater Israel”, an idea akin to Lebensraum.   The 1967 War and the Israeli Occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Jews for Justice in the Middle East http://ifamericansknew.org/history/origin.html#1967  That’s why its continued military occupation and colonization is illegal, as reaffirmed by the world through the UN Security Council in December.  A small detail that should be corrected, and that any objective journalist would not have mis-stated.
Really? One group? Ever heard of a group called "Nazis"? They've got quite a rep for being anti-Semitic. Plenty of red-blooded American white boys don't like dem Jews much neither!  In fact, anti-Jewish hate crimes still lead the pack in North America and they're not generally perpetrated by Muslims.  The primary target of Islamists is Western culture led by the US.
Somehow the fact that Hillary's primary financial supporters are countries that want to see Israel destroyed and Jewish people shoved into ovens again has been lost on the author of this commentary. Mr Trump has never said or done anything to give the impression that he is anti-Semite. Lets remember that it was Hillary that loved to kiss and hug with Senator Byrd, the KKK leader. It was Hillary that uses the "N" word when she thinks no one is listening. It is Hillary that did everything possible to destroy the lives of the unfortunate victims of her husband's sexual assaults. Keep that in mind when visiting the voting booth today.
Arabs murdered 8 Jews in Tel Hai March 1920. Arabs murdered more Jews in April 1920. Arabs murdered more Jews in 1921. Arabs murdered more Jews in 1929.  "The [1929] riots took the form, in the most part, of attacks by Arabs on Jews .“ “… 133 Jews were killed by Arabs and 339 others were injured…” Are Arabs were shouting "The Jews are our dogs!" & "Islam was spread by the sword!" as they murdered the Jews.  Haganah & Irgun were created for self-defense.  The day after the UN Partition Resolution in November 1947, some racist, xenophobic Palestinians started a genocidal war to exterminate the Jews.  Haj Amin el-Husseini – “I declare a holy war, my Muslim brothers!  Murder the Jews!  Murder them all!”  The war started with Palestinians attacking a Jewish bus driving on the Coastal Plain near Kfar Sirkin  killing five and wounding others. Half an hour later they ambushed a second bus, southbound from Hadera, killing two more. Arab snipers attacked Jewish buses in Jerusalem and Haifa.
Derry is split by a river. One side of the river the population is mostly Catholic and refers to the city as Derry; the other side is mostly Protestant and calls it Londonderry. The whole thing was called Derry at one time. Ireland was united and Catholic before England invaded. The UK only managed to hold on to Northern Ireland after the Republic was formed because it had imported so many Protestant Scots into the Province!
Yes.   Unlike women, gays, lesbians, transgenders, bi-sexuals, blacks, Hispanics, Jews, and Muslims, Non-Students are not "a protected class".  The Oregon Legislature is in session.    Maybe you can get them to add "non-students" to the category?
I look forward to the day when white folks admit they created the racial and cultural divide when they decided that being white was more important than being human or American. They made that choice for fun and profit. They don't want to know how much rape, torture, robbery, and murder they benefit from. It is why so many of them don't like facts. Facts don't make them look or feel good about themselves. This country has been a giant affirmative action program for people that Europe didn't need or want. All they had to do was to learn to fear and hate black people. Indians, Latinos, Jews, and Asians will do in a pinch. Then they become white instead of immigrants. They get to be considered innocent until proven guilty. The rest of us get profiled. Obama never got more than 45% of the white vote. The good news is that younger white folks tend to be less racist than their elders. We may have equal rights for all in another 200 years.
An episode of the BBC's "World At War" interviews a Dutch citizen who, during Nazi occupation didn't realise the consequences of stating on a form whether he had any Jewish grandparents or parents.   It was only afterwards that he realised how he had inadvertently aided the system.  The only way to block racism, it seems, is to refuse to play along.   When the Nazis made Danish Jews wear yellow stars, all Danes, led by their king, donned them, Jewish or not.  South Africa's desperate need for repair, eliminating wretchedness and poverty, is not going to be solved by the Nats, I mean, ZANC's race-rage bean-counting.   Any measure of SA wealth must take into account: • The obscene proceeds of state capture and looting not reflected on the JSE but in private companies, trusts, homes in Dubai, etc. • The race breakdown of directors, managers, etc not as a percentage of the entire population, but as a percentage of those getting "university" matrics.  Shame on Newton King for collaborating.
We don't know whether Jesus said this or not. The author of Matthew says Jesus said it.  Apparently the ancient Jews believed that homosexuality was a willful violation of an essentially heterosexual nature. We know that's not true. Dubious ideas are better discarded.  So you'd bring back Leviticus 20? Ah. The Christian Taliban.
Wow, note the immediate slide from understanding your neighbours who vote for Trump, to Nazis...who is it who's not amenable to rational debate again?  Same with "the gateway drug is interrupting, raising your voice and deliberately misunderstanding interlocutors – all standard moves of a CNN segment"... and the Left anywhere, including here.  And btw, "The fact that a slogan like "Jews will not replace us" literally makes no sense ". It does make perfect sense in their world view, just as the other slogan, "You will not replace us", does. Who's deliberately misunderstanding, again? It means they believe their adversaries, "You", among which they single out Jews in particular as wanting to do this, will not succeed in their goal to replace "whites" with "brown" people. This isn't totally without foundation, as many extreme leftists are quite vocal about wanting to do just that and gloating about how fast it will happen , including on this very discussion board...
Freeland is known for being emotionally-hysterical and unhinged, and she is now trying to deflect attention away from her recent failed attempt to label the truth of her family's history of Nazi collaboration and anti-Jew propaganda profiteering as "Russian disinformation." Freeland's prior anti-Russia disinformation campaign failed, and now she's trying to follow it up with another. Of course, there was no annexation of Crimea, and any Crimean would laugh at the idea - since they organized their own referendum, and they voted in accordance with their over-2-decades-long publicly-stated intention, which has always been to rejoin Russia. And that choice has always been their legal and natural right. “Crimea won’t be a part of Ukraine even if the ousted president, Viktor Yanukovich, returns to power. The country where we lived doesn’t exist anymore. We are going our own way and we’re trying to do it quickly.” - Vladimir Konstantinov, speaker of the Supreme Council of Crimea, 2014
Whiteness is always changing, which further proves that it is dependent entirely upon social conditions. Greeks, Italians, and Irish were once not white. Nor were Jews until after the Second World War. Now it could be argued that people of East-Asian descent are on track to whiteness.
"How do you call back people who have followed the path of Sr. Sally?" Maybe you don't Mokantx. Maybe you follow, listen, learn, contribute. I accept that the "secular" by definition is a set of minimum standards but two points: the secular society is pre-Christian; pre-denomination, and second, the essence of secular society is civil, is civilization, the "love" that is of essential co-dependency, relationship, order.  We seem to have acceded these values to "religion", to denomination. By claiming them - as Catholicism pretends that it invented ethics, morals, natural law (whatever that is)- these values become re-defined as dogma, "magisterial teaching" given back to us as direction/control. Jesus joined civilization, elevated it to the divine, and advanced from the solid logic of Aristotle for example to the incarnate passion of Beatitude and the immense challenge of love as described in I Cor. 13.  Our human commonality is secular, we build from there; but first - re-discover.

Right.  Politically-expedient history revision.  Fascism is, and always has been since its inception, a right-wing political ideology.  It's proponents said so themselves.  They openly opposed left-wing political movements.  Frequently violently.  And while we're at it, black folks did not keep white folks as slaves, the Native Americans didn't cross the Atlantic and start slaughtering and dispossessing Europeans, European Jews didn't incinerate Lutherans in ovens or put them in death camps, American church women didn't rape and murder Salvadoran death squad goons and Saddam didn't have any yellow birthday cake--they ran out of yellow no. 5 food-coloring because of the sanctions.
As Otto Warmbier was Jewish, the idea of him stealing a banner for a prize from the Methodist Church is absurd to begin with.  (Not that any prison would be justified if it even was the case)  http://www.timesofisrael.com/otto-warmbiers-family-kept-his-jewishness-under-wraps-while-north-korea-held-him-hostage/
This case is a GIANT slippery slope.  If the Supreme Court sides with the bakery, they are opening the door for any business to refuse to serve any person, and cite "religious reasons".  I mean, if you can refuse to make a cake for a gay couple, then whats to stop a Muslim florist from refusing to sell flowers to a Jewish couple?  Or an Athiest from refusing to sell to.....anyone?  And to be clear, this isnt a "Well you would never ask a Kosher Deli to sell bacon would you?" situation.  This guy makes (or made) cakes, and specifically wedding cakes for a living.  There is literally 0 difference between a "straight" wedding cake and a "gay" wedding cake.  They are both cakes.   This guy wants to be able to refuse service to a PERSON who he does not agree with.  This has nothing to do with art and what rights artists have regarding their work.  Unless this guy signs his name on each of his cakes, or any person could ID his cakes by design alone, he has no right to refuse service.
Memories of Soviet oppression should not justify collaboration with the Nazis in the deaths of jews and other Poles.
Well, despite your personal opinion, the Church teaches that the Mass is a Sacrifice offered on an altar by a priest.  Jesus Christ, our Great High Priest instituted the Catholic priesthood (sacerdotium) at the Last Supper. Christ was no ordinary Jew, He, God made Man, founded His Church on earth. That is basically what the Church teaches and what Catholics believe.
Gingrich is an awesome communicator, historian, politician and conservative apologist. But for him to say that anyone is "full of themselves" would be like Hitler calling someone "insensitive to the needs of German Jewish persons".
I think that establishing a nation as a homeland for any specific ethnic/racial/religious group is a bad idea. A nation is for everyone of that nationality, period. The nation cannot be considered as 'owned' by any particular group. It follows that I think that creating Israel on that basis was a bad idea too.  I don't want to see Jews simply transport their ill-advised political entity elsewhere. This is very hypothetical of course, but were Israel to cease to exist I would hope as many Israelis as possible emigrate to Canada.
Good post, except for one thing-mennonites.  We've never 'had to ask why' women are in the kitchen  wearing dresses.  We've never had to ask why pentecosts aren't allowed short hair or to wear pants.   And every one of those conditions you ascribe exists in those cases as well.  Why can't jewish women get remarried without the consent of their ex husband?   Why can't catholics use birth control?  And on and on.      Granted, the media has been so nuts that if I were on a plane I might be a little concerned seeing a lot of middle eastern men, it wouldn't put me off, but I'd have more concern in that case than a woman even in a burqa.
Hard to believe there are still so many statues, monuments,schools,  holidays, etc. commemorating and celebrating the Confederacy.      They do have their place. They belong with the cat-o-nine tails, the knout, the rack, the yellow Jewish Star of David, the auto da fe, and dinosaur fossils - in a museum.   No wonder slavery was quickly followed by Jim Crow, continuous racism, lynchings, segregation of black soldiers from white soldiers fighting in WWII, police shootings of blacks, etc.
Sorry, you only tell half the story (at best).  Yes, he did denounce but three days later at T. Tower, he contradicted that very statement (other half of the story).  Please provide any proof that *some* came to protect the Lee Statue?  Peaceful assembly -well, now we know that the city/police/university made serious mistakes by allowing that *assembly approval* to include signs, weapons, sticks, torches???  Peaceful - in the eyes of the beholder - if you believe that after watching actual film of the march, the anti-Jewish chanting, etc.   Well!!! So, speaking of fallacies - unless you can document that some came to protect?  what you have posted is actually an example of multiple fallacies. Two events - march at nite and rally next day - you conflate the two which is another fallacy. Rally titled *Unite the Right* which has what to do with your Protect the Statue* comment? Police had to call rally an illegal gathering to stop the carnage - again, contrary to your comment = half right
Maines and Budesky subscribe to the same anti-progressive, anti-American, Anti-christian, anti-jewish dogma preferring fascist dictatorship over any democracy.  The inclusion of some hare-brained brain evaluation fails to reveal the predominant ideology and mental dysfunction of CONservative Alzheimer's politicians, i.e., Ronald Reagan, Charlton Heston, et.al.  Similar numbers of "liberals" affected haven't yet appeared in the public discourse.  Since Alzheimer's is a calcification of the brain, it fits the Republican/CONservative ideology to a T.  The next candidates will be Trump and his closest advisors, i.e., Spicer, Bannon etc.
The concept of white male privilege is a hypothesis which attempts to explain fewer women & persons of colour in certain industries and in lower socio-economic strata. But it is a theory. And the success of immigrant populations such as the Jews, and multiple asian populations demonstrates how weak that theory is.
Sorry, the Faith of the biblical Prophets was likewise Islam.  The name "Judaism" occurs nowhere in the Hebrew Scriptures.  Not ONCE.  The only name given for their Faith is "Shlema".  That's how you say ISLAM in Hebrew.  As in "The prophet which prophesieth of SHLEMA, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that YHWH hath truly sent him."  (Jeremiah 28:9).  Of course King James mistranslated it as 'peace'--shalom.  But that's not the word in the original (Hebrew) manuscript.  The 70% figure was from a Time magazine poll taken in, IIRC, 1989. Pollsters in Israel don't really ask that question the same way in current polls, but rather in terms of 'religious' vs. 'secularist' (I suspect out of embarrassment).  But even Rabbis like Levi Brackman admit that 80% of Israelis are "secularists", with 50% of Israelis self-identifying as atheists.
Here is an interesting contrast from this commentary by the anit-Trump, PC police at the Washington Post.  You can pull the whole article off Drudge.  “When Donald opened his club in Palm Beach called Mar-a-Lago, he insisted on accepting Jews and blacks even though other clubs in Palm Beach to this day discriminate against blacks and Jews. The old guard in Palm Beach was outraged that Donald would accept blacks and Jews so that’s the real Donald Trump that I know.”  That was author Ronald Kessler in a July 2015 interview with Newsmax...
The Holocaust has been themed as the Jewish genocide. However they do not wholly "own it" as not everyone killed in the concentration camps or in the broader struggle was Jewish. We have great exanoke and almost incredible witness of St. Maximilan Kolbe, the Saint of Auschwlitz  Also Saint Teresa Benedicta of the Cross (Edith Stein) virgin and martyr. Edith was a  Jewish convert and her writings are of great interest to many.
A gentleman by the name of Lee Strobel in a book called "The Case for Christ" uses the question to try to disprove Christianity but ends up converting himself.  He was a atheist reporter at the time that he started.  He ends up running into various facts that have been run into before.  That there is books beside the Bible that mention Jesus, that we have more early copies of the Bible than any other book.  He also comes up with my support statements.  In short, he makes a pretty good legal case for Jesus being God and the Messiah.
I'm not sure what will happen first - that atheists will realize that spiritual ideas are necessary for a full understanding of the universe or if religious believers will realize that much of what they have been taught is a (metaphorically powerful) fairy tale. My money's on the atheists.
JJ If you were to do a little bit of research on the House of Saud do you know what you would ind? ...Yup they were originally Jews and since Jewish is a race now I would imagine they still are
The article says: "Since taking over the party, she has worked hard to cleanse it of xenophobic and anti-semitic associations and make it more appealing to a wider electorate."  That's what she'd like people to believe, but the truth is quite different.  When Marine Le Pen took her temporary leave from her position as FN leader, Jean-François Jalkh was chosen as interim party leader - despite the fact he was on record as saying the Nazis couldn't possibly have used Zyklon B to exterminate jews and opposing the expulsion of Le Pen's father.  He lasted 3 days before public anger forced his resignation.  Couple that with Marine Le Pen's own deliberate public statement in April that France was not responsible for the wartime round-up of Jews who were sent to Nazi death camps.
You may have put your finger on why so many Muslims want to escape their oppressive regimes and find freedom in far less oppressive western countries. Secular or non-fundamentalist Muslims, like many Christians and Jews, exist throughout Europe and North America.
"liberals"  fought the Born Again Christians, the only group large enough to have tried to impose their values, without success, even though those are a lot less extreme than conservative Muslims'.  The Hindus are actually very adaptable and do not try to impose theirs anyway, and have not asked for "accommodations" under the Charter.   Hasidic Jews accept the fact they are marginal, they don't try to impose their values, none of which are as extreme as conservative Muslims' anyway. But there have been conflicts in areas where they do demand accommodations, because they do  impact others.  Atheists have impacted society because they are now numerous, just as Muslims may when they get numerous too. That is precisely the danger. Liberals who fought hard against BACs are fine with conservative Muslims imposing their values? I'm not.
Sanctions BDS el MONDO... or Sanctions BY Israel ? Of the same to the same ?   Israel will not comply with the resolution calling for the stop of settlement adopted Friday (December 23, 2016) by the Council of the UN Security: -Benjamin Netanyahu;  'Israel rejects this shameful anti-Israel resolution of the United Nations and will not comply'; -Netanyahu said (14 & +) countries that worked to pass the resolution would pay a diplomatic and economic price and takes sanctions against the five “initiating countries”; -Immediately Netanyahu takes sanctions against the five initiating countries of the resolution (including Egypt (originally of the resolution), New Zealand, Malaysia, Senegal and Venezuela;  - Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nachshon said (14) countries that voted for the resolution were being summoned Sunday  (Dec. 24) for reprimands, beginning with the British representative; -(and Paf !)

This letter shows the danger of speculation in the absence of facts. There is no evidence whatsoever to indicate that these acts were carried out by Jews, "libruls", Trump opponents or anyone except who they appear to have been done by: American Neo-Nazis. Yet the author starts with this screwball assumption, references the demented musings of our wannabe dictator, and then concludes that the victim is the perpetrator.   It is not impossible that the unlikely scenario that Stahl postulates is true. It has happened before. However, most prudent people would wait for at least a shred of supporting evidence to emerge before making such an outrageous claim.
They were the main reason for the victory of the west over the Nazi's (certainly not Britain and not the USA, the late comers to the party who went on to cheat Russia afterwards).   They lost between 7-20 million people and were the first into the death camps to free the Gypsies and Jewish victims.
Problem with Jerry Prevo is that he forgot his place on this Earth. He forgot that only Jesus can judge and by taking that role for himself, Jerry Prevo committed a blasphemous act. Say what you will on that statement. A person in Jerry Prevo's position should be a guide and a teacher. He should remembered what the Bible represent.  But instead, the Bible may have corrupted him because he believes he is speaking for God and Jesus. No man have such authority and that much is written in the Bible, eh?  In his defense, Jerry Prevo is not the only one who suffered from his misconception of his role. Every religion from Islam to Buddhist....all suffered from misguided religious leaders who take matter into his or her hands. I am sure long ago, Mr. Prevo had good intentions. But is it a proper quote to say that "road to hell is full of good intentions?" I think we should all pray for Mr. Prevo, he will need it in due time.
This Jewish Bernstein's shelf life is way out of date. Trump was sent to Washington to drain the swamp and that is exactly what he is doing and the elite can't stand it. Keep tweeting President Trump keep them in their hysteria.
No. My description is not similar, I am talking about a group of people who has grown their share of the pie by rewriting our laws to socialize their losses while furthering privatizing their gains. The Jews in pre-WW2 Germany had no political power. People who defend the 1% sure seem to paint the fellas as a bunch of weaklings. It's bizarre that they can rewrite our nation's laws to favor them, yet they seem so powerless, when one looks at the perspective of some of their most virulent defenders. And the first part of your statement is wrong. Look at the math and DoD expenditures.
What possible reason is there for hurting children, the elderly, the "innocent?" When Christians hear of something good, they praise the Lord: God is great, God is good! When something evil occurs, they're silent.  Saying God's reasons are unknowable doesn't seem appropriate. If reason doesn't matter, then the reasoning used to pick Christianity over other religions or agnosticism or atheism doesn't matter, either.
The CBC'S Macdonald's article linked to in this article, makes the weird claim that Bissonnette was a "Christian" terrorist.  Has "Christian" now become used as a term of ethnic identity, where if one is white and of European roots, one is deemed to be a Christian, whether or not one is an actual believer, or an atheist?  I guess that follows when you need to make hostility to Islam about race, skin color, ethnicity, rather than to a set of beliefs...  The problem is, Muslim terrorists are Muslim terrorists because they CLAIM to be acting in the name of their religion. There is no indication Bissonnette was religious, or that he acted in the name of Christianity.
Incredibly gifted Jewish family of doctors. Dr. Kemble is a wonderful doctor who studied for his M.D. at Harvard and was head of the HMA. Sadly he is retiring and wasn't even that old. Ophthalmologist Dr. Cassen has also retired and was the nicest female doctor who loved her work and her patients genuinely. She, too, wasn't even that old. Appreciate your Jewish doctors. Some are you're best friends.
And Palestinian's are the UN's chosen people in their objective of eliminating Israel and eradicating Jews from the region. Personally, I prefer God.
Hey, any atheists out there willing to take the time in order to provide Ward 1 with an appropriate response...you know, eye for eye etc., rant for rant?
My wife and I both work in the health field and so, consequently, we have a social circle that includes Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus, and representatives of many east Asian countries. We have many Muslim work acquaintances: we've been to their houses at Christmas, and at least one of them set up a Christmas tree to make her non-Muslim friends feel welcome. I often have Muslim friends wish me a Merry Christmas: as far as I can tell, they haven't been in trouble with their communities for doing so. They also love Canada. Because many of them obtained medical degrees from other countries, they had to take jobs in isolated parts of Canada desperate for physicians while learning how to pass Canadian board exams. Meanwhile, many of our relatives fear our friends. when we discuss it with them, they cite things they've seen on television or heard on the radio. They're convinced that what they've seen and heard must be true and that my wife and I are being set up and fooled by our friends. Go figure.
(Part two of two)  Jesus admonishes those women, “Do not weep for me, but for your sins” of wanting to change the past, i.e. the way God creates the environment of the Faithful.  The situation is foggy, indeed, as the Faithful try to leave the earth a better place than when they found it.  As the Jews from Jerusalem said to John, “What do you have to say for yourself?” (John 1:22) the same query applies to considering “If you could change the past, would you?”  Just who do the Faithful think they are?  That is the real question.  Liturgy of the Word, Reading 205, January 2.
Are you a deist?  And if so what scientific evidence is there to prove such exists?  I am lost on your logic, unless of course you are in fact an atheist.  It would seem to me that it is an all or nothing argument, since no one can scientifically prove the existence of God.
In the United States: https://www.timesofisrael.com/3-days-later-israeli-leaders-still-conspicuously-silent-on-charlottesville/  In Germany: https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/germanys-new-nazis-see-israel-role-model  In Austria: https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/austrias-neo-nazis-find-friends-israel  Of course Israel doesn't represent all Jews (despite its claims), but this is worrisome nonetheless.
I disagree that "fundamentalism" and "non-fundamentalism" are the right ways to separate this. (Disclosure: I am strong United Church - once a "mainline" denomination!). Jim Wallis and the Sojourners are fundamentalist in their Christian path, I believe, and any justice-seeking Christian would be pleased to have the Sojourners on their side. And there are mainline Christians of all denominational ties who would be Franklin Graham fans.  Fundamentalism is a specific late 19th Century movement in response to mainline indifference. I believe it is better to differentiate along the lines of violence. Two or three decades ago someone wrote that the most rapidly growing spirituality was "belief in the redeeming power of violence," or words to that effect. Franklin Graham really does seem to fall into that category, and so do many other Christians, some Muslims and some Jews. And it is belief in violence that some people desire to see cross into the state (or vice versa).
"And then his gracious apology to the youth of the church: “Jesus Christ is the most magnificent figure in all of history, and by the way we have acted we have made Him irrelevant to you.” Leaders & pastors need to follow behind Jackson, WITH THEIR APOLOGIES.  I am not a person  who suffers from Institutional Adventitis.  I liked this report of  concern. Does the creator of the universe God bite His fingernails and wring His hands because of the "remnant church" infighting? The SDA church is reaping what it sowed. It has been so busy focusing on  institutional pride...on denominational numbers and $$$$ that it has become ignorant on the Christian basics.  By surveys...see who really knows what the "gospel" is, what "grace" means, what "saved " means to church members. How often do you hear about outreach and sharing the 3 angels' messages to make more.."Adventists" instead of Christians. What about all of the calls to "share Jesus"? What does that mean specifically??
Trump couldn't care less about what the rest of the GOP is up to regarding Jews.
Did it really? Might you have a reference we might check for that? - Thank you ...  Moebiex1 for asking - "On June 19, 1967 — nine days after the end of the war — the Israeli Cabinet decided it would offer the return of territories conquered from Egypt and Syria in exchange for peace, security and recognition." . "The Arab League categorically rejected peace with Israel at its summit in Khartoum later that year." . "Arab states tried to annihilate the Jewish nation, yet Israel remains unforgiven for its crime of self-preservation" - Bret Stephens: Special to National Post | The New York Times - June 5, 2017
Countries governed by Islamism are just shining beacons of individual liberal freedoms (just look at Turkey's "progression" under the AKP or the 57 members of the OIC at the UN. The fact that smug "progressives" in Canada champion symbols of female subjugation is shameless irony, considering the niqab is only common in countries where women are treated like second class citizens, without exception.  Interesting how smug progressives are silent when liberal female Muslims are bullied into submission or ostracized as provocateurs for choosing not to wear head coverings. In Iran, women are beaten by morality police for showing too much hair but in Canada, it's always a women's choice - blind ignorance by Canada's leftwing blowhards demands we can't defend women who are ostracized for failing to submit to their pious obligations, because it's not PC. The double standard is truly shocking - Christianity and Judaism are fair game for satire, but Islam is beyond reproach?
Rastafarians don't all come in just one sect. Just like every other religion there are various groups within it - and in many, dreadlocks ARE essential. But that is beside the point, the concourt has already found that non-essential observances are ALSO protected - specifically in the case of school rules. In that case about a Hindu girl who wanted to wear the large earings. The school argued that previous nose-stud case doesn't apply since the earings are optional throughout the religion. The court found that observing an optional aspect of a religion is an even MORE devotional act exactly because the religion does NOT mandate it absolute -and is thus even MORE protected.
Like anti-semitism, except directed at muslims instead of jews.
Now now, not all the best programmers that are Indian are Hindu. There are Christians, Sikhs, and Muslim students at UW/UW alumni that are either immigrants from, or descendants of immigrants from India that can program very well too.
First..David Butt does make some good points, some of which are veiled. Second ..is religion  associated with the creator, God or other? God does not interfere and I doubt that the God or other that we 'seemingly' know would want women's beautiful faces covered up. Who said that women's faces should be covered up? Burka's are not fashion statements. This is a religious freedom issue  in disguise. This is a man made creation to suppress women. Quebec is on the right track IMHO.  I note that when women travel, visit Muslim countries they have to wear scarves to cover their heads. They do so mainly because of the  laws in those Islamic  countries. Many of those scarves are very attractive I might add.  http://www.traveller.com.au/burqa-ban-what-should-female-tourists-wear-in-islamic-countries-10qpzk Catholics, Protestants and Jews in Canada and in many other countries eventually got it right. We live in harmony.  Tear  down that heavily veiled wall of female suppression Mr. David Butt.
What the Globalist and Bankers desire is more consumers, more debt and more chaos. Doug every week has written instructions writing about the beauty of Islam, massive immigration or the benefits of free trade. Odd time he will write about the enemies of the Globalist (Putin) Hungary and lately Poland. This paper is turning into a modern version of Pravda.
Wow, you know how to hold a grudge almost 70 years in the making.  My ex step mother is Jewish, she has never purchased a German made car or product ...
.... Which, sure enough, happened again today with at least 27 more dead at a Baptist church in Texas. . But, of course, that doesn't count because the killing in Texas wasn't "terrorism". . I don't disagree with ChuckT's point, but I think all kinds of extremist religious government are prone to that same problem.  Think what happened during the St. Bartholemew's Day massacre in France; or after Castile drove the Moors out of Spain; or the religious cleansing of the 30 Years' War; or the endless pogroms against Jews in Eastern Europe/Western Asia; or the bloodbath at partition in India; or ... . The United States was founded on pluralism, and hence on freedom of and freedom from religion, precisely because unless the various colonies could agree to set their religious differences aside, they could never have worked together to end colonial rule by Britain. . That is what ended religious wars in the US. . It isn't just Islam that ha this problem.
Oh, let us count the topics on which the VII, at a minimum, called into question the Church's perennial teaching: Religious Liberty, Revelation, Salvation, the status of the Jews and non catholic sects, {false} Ecumenism, the nature of the Church.
The Fathers leavened church teaching with Platonism, the Scholastics with Aristotelianism received from Jews and Arabs, and the best Christian self-understanding today is accessibly only to those who are profoundly steeped in the ecumenical movement.
Pre-world war II America First Committee urged the nation to stay out of the European war.  While revisionists may attempt to smear the movement, it was not about Jews.  It was about keeping America out of what was then a purely European conflict.  The holocaust was not known in the 1930's.  Americans trying to keep their country from going to war do not automatically fall on Hilter's side.  Recall, back in the 1930's Americans knew little about Hilter.  They just wanted to preserve the lives of America's young men, their children, who eventually died by the tens of thousands when America did join the war.  Frankly, as far as the European war is considered, the Russians would likely have beaten Germany even without American involvement.  Wake up that great Russian Bear and pay the consequences.  A reminder to the anti-Russian crowd of today.
Canada was overall, based in Christianity.  In comes Islam, demanding accommodation and systematic introduction of their religion. What do the canadian mainstream media, and its reader base say?, well of course, scrap the original Christian background  to accommodate the new cultural one.  Since when, let the newcomers practice their culture in the comfort of their homes, prayer's place, like many other immigrants are doing at the moment. We never had immigrants like orientals, spanish, budhist, hindu, etc, introducing motions, singling them out as 'special'. Something wrong with the way liberals are handling this affairs.
Can't outlaw free speech, whether one likes what's being said or otherwise. Much as it was upheld by the courts years ago when the NAZI organizers wanted to march through a predominantly Jewish community in Stokey, Illinois to this current rally which was also approved by the courts, free speech and the right thereof will always prevail. The ACLU defended both and won.     It's a very unique principle, one that our forefathers enshrined with great reasoning, and we are one of the few that uphold it. Even the English censor free speech, even in parliament where Jerry Adams was censored after being duly elected from the Sinn Fein Party.     Because it brings tensions that create violence by those opposing it, which then cause both sides to become violent isn't enough to outlaw free speech. Our nation was severely divided long before Mr. Trump, even he was threatened with violence when campaigning, people rioted and looted. But free speech prevails thankfully, it comes with it own price.
Which one was not Jewish?  Since all were Jewish, all the men wore beards, as required by Jewish law, even Jesus, although we don't seem to have any pictures of him as the full bearded man he certainly was.  They were all circumcised.  Changes were made over time on the requirements of being Jewish, beards and circumcision.   The priesthood developed over time.  All the rules developed over time.  The church existed 1000 years before it made celibacy mandatory - and then did it more because married priests with children were trying to leave the churches to their children.  All the ideas of the powers of the priesthood were developed over time and were based on the understanding and cultures of those powerful in the Church at the time the changes were developed.   It is now time to make a change on the requirement of only celibate males in the priesthood.  Time for married and unmarried men and women in all levels of the Church hierarchy.  Just recall St. Peter was a married man.
It's not a question of equality, it's a question of sameness.  Women are different from men, gays are different from straights, and the Jews have a maintained a unique culture.  To deny such differences is closing one's eyes to reality.
a book worth reading - In The House Of Ishmael: A history Of The Jews In Muslim Land,  By Martin Gilbert
You're cherry-picking facts you believe agree with your  opinion.  Can you state which president banned 'whole countries' based on religion?  During the Cold War, Jews were allowed in from countries where they were persecuted.  Nazis got through the screening by lying, and being white, got away with it.  You should be careful with claims that 'foreigners' have no Constitutional protections.  I stand by my statement: Judges know the Constitution much better than you.  They generally explain in writing the reasons for a decision, which makes for fascinating reading.
Thank you for that post In your dreams. You know after what the jews went through during the second world war they are not planting bombs in Germany and causing the havoc that these people are. And why? They act like people should act and have common sense and logic.
It appears he was a Hindu!The lost years of Jesus have been traced to India!He studied from the immortal yogi christ Babaji.Its laughable to think he would even think about the human side of religion and there idea of god!
You don't like fear-mongering; I don't like repressive psychological disarmament.  The resolution is an educated public, but the public schools and the universities are part of unified propaganda machine that destroys independent thinking of developing minds.  Look at the fear-mongering that goes on in the schools re:, e.g., global warming, racism in police departments, deaths of poor people because of a lack of private heath insurance.  I asked the question elsewhere what would have happened in Germany if the Jews had stockpiled automatic weapons.
There are many who follow the others - I am not denying that but all are not true. I am a pre-suppositionalist and really look at these issues in the reverse. God gave us his word, reveals it to those whom he chooses and we an rely on it and count on it as his Spirit leads HIS people into the truth, Jesus also said "My Sheep hear my voice" , I read the Quran or the Hindu writings they are babble to me as you say, I am sure some see great and profound truth, but not I. The Bible says many will be deceived, and I am sure those that believe those things are very sincere and same may be "good" people etc.  I don't know what a burning bush is, you mean one that is not consumed ? I don't think that would change my way of thinking, I really don't know as I doubt we will ever see one.
The Defense Department is not the biggest drain of resources, the unfunded entitlements are.  We also do not have emperors in this country. Funding comes from the congress.   Businesses that do not put customers first eventually fail.  Your description of "Rich people" is reminiscent of the "Jews" as described by the Nazi Party in pre-WW2 Germany.  Think about it.
LaPierre needs to go. I am a gun owner and 2nd amendment supporter, but the latest NRA ads on Youtube are a disgrace. Reminds me of what he Nazis were saying about Jews.
This (Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors) all leads to a heavy sense of inertia where energies turn in on themselves, people become demoralized, and ultimately are defeated by the system – or they simply leave. —ATF  The reason to stick it out is “Wherever the river (the Faithful) flows, every sort of creature that can multiply shall live” (Ezekiel 47:9).  “The Lord of hosts is with us; our stronghold is the God of Jacob” (Psalm 46:8).  “Therefore, the Jews began to persecute Jesus because he did this on a sabbath [sic]” (John 5:16).  John also sells bridges made in Brooklyn.  Things are not always what the Faithful want them to be, and when that happens, it makes sense for the Faithful to take responsibility and act accordingly.  Liturgy of the Word, Reading 245, Tuesday of the Fourth Week of Lent I
I don't believe we should discriminate against immigrants on what they "intend" do to as part of their religion. We should prosecute those to take action such as marrying more than one person.   Lots of religious people out there with crazy ideas. It's impractical to quiz them on every illegal belief they might possess. Should we quiz Christians too in order to see if they intend on stoning non-virgins or atheists? I mean, it's IN the Bible!
Thank you, Fr. Daly, for bringing the Beatitudes to bear on judging Mr. Trump. I think we can cite leaders of other religions as well as Christian teachings in sizing him up. The revered Hindu peace activist Mahatma Gandhi listed seven deadly social sins and two in particular are apt descriptors of our new president: politics without principle and commerce without morality.
I recall that a series of threats on North American jewish institutions was also blamed on Trump for weeks, until it was determined that the threats originated with a disturbed young man in Israel.
if he writes about the jewish lobby as did mearsheimer and walt - both great scholars (and jewish) then i would  say he's made a significant breakthrough
Take the head gear off. You want Sharia, return to Pakistan. Let me make this clear. In Canada men will not get horny if they see your hair. You will not get raped by men (unlike Egypt and Pakistan or Saudi Arabia) if you show your wrists or ankles. Western men do not think that you are a wh##e if they see your belly button. You do not need to be slaves anymore. Your religion is a heavy stone around your neck. It is an unnecessary burden on you and it is a detestable ideology to the rest of us. Reform, reject Islam. Do not make fashion to conform with the expectations of a 7th century mass murderer who hated Jews and Infidels and married children. Enter the 21 century. Assimilate. Stop being victims in Canada. The Hindus, Janes, Atheists, Asians, Buddhists, Sikhs...none of these groups impose their stone-aged values on the rest of us. They do not seek separate religious enclaves and rules, they do not reject freedom and democracy. Islam is unique in its affront to Western civilization.
Every place I've ever lived in Canada has Catholic, Protestant and Jewish cemeteries. Refusing to build a Muslim cemetery is another example of bigotry. Congratulations.
The major problem I have with abortion law is the RvW decision itself and the terrible illogic used in that decision PLUS then forcing it on us all via judicial fiat. Just like they did with Gay marriage.  The early church did not fight against human slavery because it WAS a "Caesar issue" at that point in time - but sooner than anyone could realize at the time slavery ended within Christendom - starting in the 7th century, actually, and pretty much finished by the 13th (within Christian Europe itself).  Abortion is a huge step in the opposite direction away from Christian moral values. Communism is also a huge step in the opposite direction and unconstrained immigration - worldwide - is basically a  communist ideal.  And communism embraces atheism. So, if the Supreme Court decides to end "religious freedom" because science "can't prove God exists",  is that OK with you?
This reminds me of a meme of a cruel Nazi official greeting Jews, unceremoniously dispatching each one to the ovens, then pausing to swoon over a cute little puppy, before resuming his grim action without missing a beat.  The moral of the gag was to show that a really terrible person can have discrete moments of charm and apparent grace and perhaps some isolated noble sentiments.  But to attempt to deny the greater reality with an unassailable but ultimately misleading truth can be a great exercise of banality.  We have an expression is Spanish, which comes to mind, "to try--with one finger--to cover up the sun!"
You seem to be contradicting yourself, Monte. You first argued that God's #1 concern is to mitigate want and suffering on earth. That can be inferred , you reason, from His unconditional love. Therefore, whatever God's church does, whether through law or charity, to mitigate want and suffering, is advancing the Kingdom. Your logic is internally sound.   But now you say (and I agree with you) that the existence of want and suffering on this earth is not a measure of God's love; that the persistence of suffering and earthly injustice is not inconsistent with God's unconditional love and eternal purposes for humanity. I agree. So how does it follow that SJ (the mitigation of social and economic inequities through political action) is the vocation of the church?   Social justice was the overarching concern for Jews in 1st Century Palestine. It was because the Jews would not trust a messiah who refused to deal with injustice on a political level that they rejected his unconditional love.
I'm atheist but I celebrate Christmas, as many do, as a secular holiday. I see no reason why Christmas can't be celebrated in schools as a secular holiday. We need more reasons to cheer and celebrate, not fewer.
So, Mr. Budesky, you acknowledge that criticism of the Zionist entity isn't necessarily "anti-Semitism"; how magnanimous of you--you're one of a very few "Israel"-apologists honest enough to admit this.  But then you hint that pointing out Zionist influence and control of US mass-media IS anti-Semitism?  Ah well, it's encouraging to note that at least you're too circumspect to openly employ the knee-jerk accusation of "anti-Semite!" to anyone who criticizes the Zionists entity or its American apologists like Krauthammer (that's GOTTA be a fake name).  It's hopefully an indication that fewer Americans are buying the spurious argument that opposition to the Zionist apartheid state makes one "anti-Semite".  The Palestinian Arab population imprisoned in the Gaza & West Bank ghettos are Semites.  Most of their occupiers aren't.  But if you doubt Zionist Ashkenaziim media control, consider LA Times correspondent Joel Stein: "As a proud Jew, I want America to know...YES, we own Hollywood."
"That millions of Palestinians have languished in refugee camps abroad" That and the ease with which terrorists in the middle east - ISIS, al Qaeda, ... - are able to use the occupation of the West Bank to recruit new fighters must suggest to reasonable people that the current policies of the Israeli state are a permanent incitement to terror and violence in the Middle East, Northern Africa and around the world. Those policies only exacerbate the threat to Jewish people world wide that they were proposed to eliminate.
no matter why this murder occurred it is a tragedy. It is hard to believe that these women were not attacked because they are 'different'. Attacks like this are done by ignorant people usually young and uneducated who actually fear their victim (the victims background). Racism is alive and well in the  USA and  Canada. Anyone that is 'different': Black, Asian Sikh, Muslim, brown skin, Latino, Natives, Jews etc etc are often subjected to it. Fortunately it is usually verbal or written and not physical. The death of this innocent young Muslim American is an atrocity.
If the World survives long enough, historians will document the fact that three SCOTUS decisions were responsible for the destruction of the United States: 1) Engel v. Vital (1962) 2) Roe v. Wade (1973) 3) Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) Subsequent to Engel/62, 1963 - Darwin and Atheism were infused into the impressionable hearts/minds of America's school children resulting in confusion, deception, a cheapening of human life.  Subsequent to ten-years of Atheism/Evolution, SCOTUS affirmed Roe v. Wade (1973) and the United States Federal Government became a co-conspirator in the murder of 60-mil American babies.  If President Trump does not heed this warning, America and America's citizenry will continue to suffer until the United States has been relegated to a Third-World Status...the American populous will suffer horrifically!

When and where was this utopian world you speak of, Mary Schultz. I know people who were asked if they were Catholic or Protestant when they moved into town. Jews were looked on with great suspicion. And, of course, Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims, and Buddhists were to be avoided. It would help if you didn't mention mainstream churches of the UK. And the United Church of Canada was created by a union of Methodist, Congregationalist, and Presbyterian churches. I'd say you led a rather sheltered life.
There was an African American Church in N.C. spray painted w/ "Trump" and burned to the ground  right after the election....It was marked & set fire by a liberal to make Pres. Trumps election look evil. An anti-Semite attack in New York after the election was attributed to a liberal woman who wanted to prove electing Pres. Trump was a bad, racist idea. The attacks and murders on Jewish people in Europe are often from the  Muslim community. There was an attack on a Muslim business right here in Anchorage after 9/11 and we found out it was the Muslim business owner that trashed his own shop (Mr. Maad) SO......yeah, a spike in hate crimes against Jewish people could be coming from a lot of different places, hopefully this is a crime that can be solved and then we will know.
You're absolutely wrong Rationalthought, the burden of proof lies with any person trying to make an affirmative statement. Logically, it doesn't matter whether you're trying to prove the existence of God, or non existence. Anyone making a claim, including "God does not exist", is required to provide evidence or accept that this claim is a belief. No more or less logical than the belief in deity. And that's, I believe, Roland's point, there's a notion that atheism is more logical than theism and that's simply not the case.
Straw poll for all the churchgoers out there: Is a head tax (i.e. PFD confiscation) morally justified by the Gospels? Do you believe Jesus would be cool with pulling the same number of dollars from Bob Gillam as from a 4-year-old kid in a low-income family? Just curious. I'm an atheist and couldn't live with myself if I were that selfish.
The tithing model in scripture had exactly two levels. Jews tithed directly to their local Levites, who then forwarded a tithe of what they received toward the support of the priests serving at the Temple and it's operation and maintenance. Plus, all offerings went to the Levites and were not tithed to the Temple. Based on that, I'd like to see the North American Division stop remitting funds to the General Conference until all discrimination against women is stopped. If that happened, the issue would be resolved with amazing speed.
As opposed to finge liberal atheists who are so worried about taking care of folks after birth, but don't care much about unborn babies?  You really want to play that game?  By the way, go answer my query regarding why you believe what you believe.  I know where you stand, but why?
I'm a 'devout' atheist, but I have no quarrel with religious beliefs in god or other deities. I recognize that my belief system is no more able to prove the non-existence of god, than a religious belief system can prove it.  Atheists and the religious have different answers to the same question, but they're equally incapable of resolving the truth of their answer. Atheists should have the ability to recognize that fact, the strength of character to admit it, and the decency to show good will towards other beliefs.   There is a third alternative though: the purely scientific approach. It defines god as being outside of our knowable universe, and hence outside of science's consideration. Science- other than in popular literature- takes no position on the existence of god. If god exists, he does so outside the scientific realm.  Atheists who aren't comfortable with the fact that their world-view is a belief should consider taking the scientific position.
Good evening ralnad,  I'm genuinely intrigued by your comment.  Surely there is some documented evidence you must have seen, correct?  Perhaps published in this very paper?  So please, if you would, direct us all to a source where the tenets of this "death cult" can be found.    Oh, and by the way, if you're not already a member of Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership as I happen to be, then perhaps you should sign up (and no, you don't have to be Jewish to join).  If anyone should have insightful things to say about gun control, then the descendants of European Jews should, don't you think?
"Now what?"  Nothing changes.  These are only markers.  Do you think that if Hitler was shown that he had genetic markers that showed there was a Jew in the wood pile, he would not have used Jews as a political tool.    Note, I am not making any comparison between our current president and Hitler with the above comment about Jews.
The pantywaist-in-chief will shortly leave the arena, having made his final back-stabbing move before he runs away. The true sign of a coward. His UN action will only solidify his reputation as one of the worst foreign policy presidents in modern history. A president who bears significant responsibility for the tragedy of Syria, the empowerment of Russia and Iran, and the weakening of America's standing in the world. Don't let the door hit you on the way out. And if I were him, I'd be careful not to fly El Al or even JetBlue. He can now return to his old church congregation with Rev. Jeremiah Wright and sit as he did for 10 years and soak up Wright's sermons that preached Jew hatred.
If you are making any claim, scientific or not, IF you want it to be accepted you must give a reason for it to be accepted.  Others can then assess your claim for themselves.  If you don't care about it being accepted then you don't have to worry about reasons.  An atheist who says "There is no god" might offer the reason, 'There is no evidence for one.'  Underlying that is an implicit idea that any phenomenon must make some imprint on reality, failing which there is no meaningful sense in which it can be said to exist.  It is this implicit quality of 'existing' that trips up theists when they try to put atheism on the proof defensive.
Young men radicalized. A radical Mormon will leave you a book. A radical Buddhist will meditate on universal harmony A Radical Catholic will pray for you soul A radical Protestant won't talk to you A radical Hindu will burn incense A racial Muslim will...well just read any newspaper on earth. .
"I don't know of a cemetary in Canada that ever turned a body away."  Try getting a plot in a Catholic or Jewish cemetery if you are not of that faith.
I have several atheists friends and they are always proselytizing their beliefs, as is their right in a secular nation.  So, my friend was here, doing just that, last week.  Oh, and he even knocked at my door first.
Actually, it's spot on! We no longer use state authority to burn Jews and "witches" at the stake for violating Christian doctrine, for example.
Not to mention the virtue-signalling of M-103 that the overwhelming majority of Canadians rejected but they are all bigots because phobia means "irrational hate" like fear of spiders, confined spaces, heights... of course M-103 had nothing to do with political motives of Islamist groups trying to promote a regressive belief system under the guise of fighting religious discrimination - that's never happened before, especially at the UN and it wasn't named Cairo... After all, every country governed by Islamic law is a beacon of gender equality, freedom of expression (blasphemy laws), and freedom of association (apostasy laws). It's not like Monty Python, Family Guy, and South Park etc. have ever engaged in religious satire making fun of Christianity and Judaism but then again, Islam is beyond reproach, anyone who engages in critical analysis, satire, or comedy towards Islam is a bigot - because it's 2017.
As the Buddhist sage Yun-Men said, "When walking, just walk. When sitting, just sit. Above all, don't wobble!"
We must define Islamophobia by what it truly is. We must also define "Taqiyya". Taqiyya is the Islamic practice of deception for the protection and defence of Islam. Taqiyya translates as " concealment omission, dissimulation" . The Ten Commandments tell Christians and Jew they must not "bear false witness" or to lie. Taqiyya is the Fifth Column of Islam and tells Muslims they may tell infidels like us half truths (omission) and even blame it all on the infidels (concealment) as this writer is doing right now, to defend Islam. Many westerners have a hard time to accept that such a thing is real.  That's why so much about M103 ( and other Liberal policies) makes Canadians of good-will stop and say "Hey wait a minute ". They can see for themselves the wool is being pulled over their eyes. She exonerates Islam and blames non Muslim Canadians of Islamophobia to defend Islam
It's no secret that there are jews in Toronto.  In Iran, not so much.  The Iranian census puts the number at  fewer than 9,000 in 2012, down from 150,000 in 1948.  Why are you including links to a jew who lives in Toronto?
Here are some facts for you. The Muslim population of Canada is doubling approximately every 7-10 years. Their numbers were at 3.2% in the last census but by the next one, in 5 years, those numbers will likely be over 7%. Ten years later it will be 14%. By way of comparison Jews are well under 1% and natives are 4.2%. And the children of Muslim immigrants are not becoming more secular and 'Canadian' but more religious (see Pew Survey). The number of Muslim women in Canada choosing to identify with fundamentalist Islam and the culture of the Middle East by wearing Hijabs continues to rise, going from 42% to 53% over ten years. The number wearing Burquas is small but tripled. The Muslim religion is also a political ideology, governing every aspect of government, criminal and family law. It is extremely and violently hostile to Jews and gays, and regards women as, at best, second class citizens in the care of their father or husband.
Again with the intellectual dishonesty.  There's a difference between blaming people for 1.  the actions of members of their ethnicity and 2. blaming people for the actions of political and religious groups to which they belong.  As an atheist, I bear some responsibility for what atheists say about God. I chose to be an atheist, and I give money to atheist groups to broadcast their attacks.  I own that.  I don't bear responsibility for Ammon Bundy just because we are both white.  I have Christian friends, even some fundie friends.  But they aren't running for office or out there espousing and defending bigotry.  The big pill for you to swallow is that I won't let you hide behind a pulpit and say your stinky ideas are fragrant because they have  a religious basis. Bigotry is bigotry.
Atheists aren't Atheists out of convenience...we're Atheists because we realize that Theism is irrational and illogical. It doesn't matter what you call a holiday or what it's origins are, a public holiday is a public holiday.
"Religious left" and "religious right."In other words, Christian faith has become degraded to the service of partisan-political agendas and goals. The experience of divine liberation has been confined to the slavery of the qudrennial political bullfight masquerading as presidential election, where two groups of privileged, wealthy as sin, aggressors slug it out in a year-long circus of insults and lies. What a profound "progress" indeed! For "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." But there is Democrat-Republican, left wing-right wing, progressive-conservative, and yes .. hate, lots of hate! "Good" Christian hate! Shame, and disgust! A mockery of Christ. And glee and pride by all involved. And hate in the disguise of hallow prayers and empty religious platitudes. All resulting in a perpetual Good Friday ... in the name of "progress."
This is really getting ridiculous, Ebes. You state that there is no reason for studying the NT if one is not a Christian, and I attempt to invite you to a broader viewpoint by flipping the topic to non-Muslims studying the Quoran. That is, I tried to argue by analogy: non-Muslims studying the Quoran is analogous to non-Christians studying the NT.   And your mind, missing the analogy entirely, leaps to trumpeting you lack of faith in the Quoran as inspired and in Judaism after the resurrection? I posited by analogy in the form of questions, for often inviting someone to wrap their mind around questions assists understanding. If you don't get the analogy, and you refuse my questions designed to help you see the analogy, I fail to see any intellectual way forward.
There are PLENTY of cases where a person could legally reject a custom order.  If the custom request falls outside of the custom work they normally do.  For example, if this couple had asked the baker to make an erotic cake, and those types of cakes are not something he ever makes, then he could legally refuse that request.  However, in this case, the argument has never been about the style of the cake requested being outside of what this baker could create or had created in the past.  Another often misused example when talking about this is "Should a Jewish baker be forced to draw a Swastica on a cake if requested?"  Again - very different situation.  A Swastica is a widely known image of hate, and no one can force another person to draw/design something hateful like that.  Having said that, the baker could sell a blank cake to the person and they can draw whatever image they want on the cake themselves.  But the Jewish baker has no right to say how that cake is used.
Many years ago I used to participate in an atheist vs. Christian online club.  The atheists were often more well informed about the bible than the Christians were.
You are right in the sense that there are bad people from all groups. But I can assure you that atheists do not have any book that tells its readers that they (we actually) should kill anyone.   By the way, thanks to your posting, I just noticed that the word "atheism" is not capitalised. Perhaps that is because the atheists do not think atheism is an entity who needs bodyguards and that is why they do not harm others to protect the entity.
The first paragraph of this article is pretty clear, and it is stated in uncontroversial language. The fact that so many people are acting like a bunch of rednecks upon hearing that black man was elected president tells us a lot about those people who spend a lot of time implying that their supposed "empathy" and "intellect" make them superior human beings.  The ban is temporary (four months) until something more effective is put into place. Religious minorities include the Bahá'í Faith, Druze, Yazidism, Mandaeism, Gnosticism, Yarsanism, Samaritanism, Shabakism, Ishikism, Ali-Illahism, and Zoroastrianism along with Christians and Jews. Members of all of these groups are targeted for persecution in the middle-east. The Jews were persecuted in Europe for 2000 years, and we regret not helping them get out of Europe before Hitler killed so many.  Isn't it funny that when Democrats act to protect minorities, it's a "good thing", but when someone else does it, it's a "bad thing".
R&R must also believe that since Jesus chose only Jews as apostles, then gentiles cannot be ordained. Don't give me any bushwah about the two being different:, since the logic is identical: Jesus chose only members of group <X> to be apostles, therefore non-members of <X> cannot be ordained. The two differ solely in what is put into the variable <X>.  Also, by "faithful Catholics", R&R means "Catholics who agree with ME!"
> So he knew that the Jewish Leaders  Sure, it was a sin, but we don't know enough about the story to know if it is mortal or not. In addition, he could have reneged and not delivered Jesus. Planning to commit and crime and actually doing the crime are two different actions.  You are interjecting things into the story and then accusing me of not matching your narrative.  > So you believe that God "uses" people?   Absolutely. How many stories have you heard of someone being in the right place at the right time to answer some prayer or perform some miracle?  > That concept hardly demonstrates  You assume by using people God is violating free will. That is not the case. You can ask your friend to do you a favor. If they do it, are you violating their free will?  > If one is spiritually ill---why not go to Jesus as well.  So the Eucharist is the only means one has to go to Jesus?
Get your facts right. Atheists and agnostics are the fastest growing demographic in North America.
I presume a combat rosary saw service in Iraq or Afghanistan.  While Mary loves all the troops, I am not sure that Mary the Palestinian Jew would approve of any foreign occupation by an imperialist power, speaking of that other kind of Americanism.
I don't mean to be contrary, Wavemaker, but historically the Jews have  in fact been forced to give up their homelands and relocated to live in camps, ghettos and the like.
Maybe you should discover the real meaning of the word abomination.   The point is, these laws came into being in a Jewish community abutting the Canaanite culture that had been occupying the area in question. This was also a period of intense competition between monotheism and paganism. The catalogue of sins refers to the activities of the Canaanites.  The religion of the Canaanites was cultic, sacrificial, sexual, directed toward agricultural success. That there was animal and child sacrifice to Molech has been established.
While nothing has been "determined", Israeli police arrested a Jewish teenager with dual Israeli and American citizenship.  As to the Trump-blaming, the New York Times said this:  "Critics of President Trump have accused him of playing down hatred and violence against minority groups and charged that his anti-immigrant remarks are fueling conflict.   "He did not publicly condemn the anti-Semitic threats and vandalism until Feb. 21, weeks after Jewish groups began calling on him to speak out.   "On Feb. 28, in a meeting with state attorneys general, Mr. Trump suggested that some of the threats and vandalism could be a politically motivated effort to “make people look bad,” rather than actual expressions of bias, according to people who took part in the meeting."
Whenever I would write newspaper columns about my Jewish heritage or my family's history in the Holocaust, I'd get a trove of anonymous letters or nasty phone calls that made it clear that there was some pretty ugly anti-Semitism always simmering beneath the surface. I had no idea how deep or how much. I never imagined that kind of hatred would be emboldened by the leader of my country. Gene Amole was one of the best men I ever met. He would have called it "evil" and faught to beat it down again. I call it "heartbreaking."  You can't see this kind of stuff without losing faith in us as a people. So very sad. Great column, Tustin.
The RCMP released a report that defined what a hate crime is and isn't. In order for something to be labelled a hate crime , an actual crime has to have occurred. Calling someone a name is not a crime . It's rude and can be labelled a hate incident but it is not a crime. The difference between cemetery stones in a Jewish cemetery being vandalized and a Muslim being called a name is that one is a hate crime and the other is a hate incident. Unless the authorities released a defined list of actions I would review all discussions with a grain of salt , and so should you.
Polis is a leftist Jew with a record that is not in line with most Colorodans.
Whenever a individual Sikh becomes successful regardless of where he is living or working one can expect outside interference from Hindu India. Therefore the filter of Air India is a recurring theme. Whether it is the defence minister or whether it is a NDP leadership.
Appears Ige is punting the ball to the legislature.  Lets see how many monkey fall out of the tree.  Ige taking the Pontius Pilate position when he ceremonily  washed his hands when Jesus was brought before him and the Jewish religious leaders demanded Pilate  order Jesus be crucified. So Ige is saying that if you all in the legislature want a special session to address the rail tax issue, due it yourselves.  Smart and clever position, Ige. My hands are clean says Ige.
The rest of the country (most of it) is mostly Muslim. Malaysia (Muslim officially) celebrates Christian, Hindu and Buddhist holidays.
W. Abbott,  An "alien" in ancient Israel was a non-Jew. Period. No exceptions that can be twisted into a modern application of letting anyone in to stay just because they want to be here. God told the Israelintes to drive-out or kill everyone who inhabited the land because of their wickedness and idolatry and it was when they failed to do that, made treaties or mixed nad inter-married with them that they began adopting idol worship and lost the blessings of God.
I may be illogical, but legal/theoretical injustice is not as important as problems that cause actual suffering, not just violate political wishes as in the First century Jews. It may not make sense, but that is my view.
If Israel had to rely on a human rights platform, it would not have come into existence in the first place as war with your sworn enemies and detractors has nothing to do with human rights i.e nice guys finish last or don't finish at all. The attacks on Israel's existence throughout the years is further evidence of this. And as to you final thought, there may be a tradition of Jewish atheism but it has nothing to do with Judaism whose central theme is God and Torah. In fact, without being born to a Jewish mother, how could you tell that these atheists are even Jewish. No connection to the central precepts of Judaism. No observance or practices even remotely connected to Judaism. A complete accident of birth without any further relationship, practices, observances of Judaism.
"The idea that the Palestinian Arabs are the indigenous people of Palestine is, quite simply, false. Your argument fails completely when you consider partition as a plan for the situation in the Middle East as a whole, as Jews had ancient populations in Libya, Tunisia, Alegeria, Iraq, Iran, Syria, etc., that predated the Muslim conquest. Re para 4 - "  So there were Jews throughout the Middle Eat. Who is denying that?  But the political philosophy known as "Zionism" and European (Jewish) emigration to Palestine are recent developments originating in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the measures taken to found the State of Israel caused the death and dislocation of the Palestinians living there before the European "Exodus". Since then, most immigrants  to Israel are Americans and Russians and they also make up the largest group among the illegal settlers.   Netanyahu and his predecessors have made the  two state solution impossible. So, what does Israel  do now? Democracy? Or apartheid?
If I had been a citizen of Germany when Hitler came to power and inflation required a wheelbarrow full of money to buy a loaf of bread; and Hitler promised to ignore the French and English World War One Reparations and re-build the country; the, Army and the Navy, promised to eliminate Communists in the country, take back the Sudetenland, reclaim the German African colonies taken by the WWI winners and watched Chamberlain rollover on his back to have his 'Peace in Our Time' belly rubbed, I would probably have believed the Jews were why Germany lost WWI.    Anti-Semitism was a centuries-old tradition in Germany, France, Poland, and the USSR at the time.  "Godless Communists" was essentially one word in Germany.    See the Spanish Civil War where Hitler practiced his Stuka dive bombing tactics prior to WWII.
its all politics , as long as the arab nation controls most of the oil reservs of the world , the un will pass all anti isareli resolutions ,simple as that , just to show you how ipocrate the world is just today a muslim terrorist shot a cop in italy , an airplane was kidnapped by muslims , a palestinian entered a jewish city and stab a 50 year old man , there will never be peace , since the start of the israel state which by the way was a 2 state country with a majority to the palestinians , all they wanted was all , like they say in the palestinian street from the dead sea to the mediterrain palestine will be free, meaninig no israel
Leviticus in the Old Testament also excludes menstruating women from prayers, but Christians and Jews don't follow that now.
You do understand El Al security uses racial profiling, the key to their being so successful. As in spending more time on Arabs versus time on USA, Jewish, others. Very effective process. Sad to say can't be done in the USA.
Yes Stevey, lots of people owe lots of other people a living: It's called parenting. Children don't choose to be born, unless you are one of those Buddhist/Hindu followers that thinks you chose the birth canal you floated down from. Ergo, if your parents (generation(s)) eat up all the fruits of the land before you are born, you will be scraping by once you pop into the thick of it. Look at the Cod situation for example: at one time they'd be jumping into the boats begging to be grilled up and eaten with a side of fries, now on account of over-fishing, those heydays are over. I guess you don't care one iota about the level of public debt Canada has managed to rack up? Keep living the dream and the minimum payments.
Bust Judaism, Christianity and Islam are all Abrahamic religions tracing their origins to the patriarch Abraham.  They are all related.
So the Orange Muppet got his knickers in a twist over a 're-tweet' of an ACTUAL picture, not an 'estimate' (official statement: it's against Park Service policy to estimate the size of crowds at events) so he decided it had to be stopped?  The Grabber-in-Chief makes a daily, sometimes hourly habit of trashing anyone who stands up to him, using his own twitter feed, but can't handle the Truth-That a side by side comparison shows a distinctly smaller crowd worshiping at his feet than he would desire?  First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist.  Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Trade Unionist.  Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Jew.  Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me. -  M. Niemoller  When those in power begin to silence all those that they believe to be speaking against them, we are on the edge of a terrible abyss.
Florida airport shooting suspect shouts "I'M NOT JEWISH"  ABC News https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pat3kKuiGqY
Mr. Roskell, clearly an intelligent an learned man, is nevertheless forcing the bounds of magnanimity to the absolute limits. This focus on the ultimate unproveability of God not existing is really just an excuse for him to show off his "positive" approach and rhetorical cleverness. He initiated several different threads on this topic to entice conversation so he could show off his skills.   The op ed itself offers a nice view of enjoying xmas as an atheist, but that word in a headline always degenerates into the kind of discussion on view here. To Mr. Roskell I say this; it is true that fact and logic cannot prove that God does not exist. One must look beyond that question, to the, ahem, genesis of most, if not all theism. These religions have come and gone since the beginning of civilization and probably much before that. They were created to explain the unknown and to provide a basis for moral behaviour. The evidence that we made up "Gods" for our own purposes is overwhelming.
Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Syria and Vietnam.  What do nearly all of these countries have in common? They're led by authoritarian dictators. Put in place a leader with authoritarian tendencies and you can rest assured that one of the first things they'll do is demonize a non-dominant religion. The next thing they'll do is outlaw said religion. If the dominant religion happens to be the one to which you subscribe then everything is hunky dory. If not, well, that's a different story. Just ask the Jews who survived Hitler's reich.  We just elected a leader with strong authoritarian tendencies. His first step has been to try to demonize Muslims. If we don't stand up for our Muslim brethren now and defend their religious freedom before anti-Muslim sentiment gets out of hand then we're no better than the German Christians who looked the other way during WWII.
I never knew atheists threw pity parties.    Now I do.
Oh! I had nor realized the slaughter of 6,000,000 Jews had nothing to do with religion.
As an atheist I am not required to disbelieve in a God or gods.  I am only required to not accept the claim that a God or gods exist.  Agnosticism is concerned with "knowledge" (gnosis) and whether one believes it can be definite or if there's always some room for uncertainty.  While it's typically tied up with theism, it is not solely linked to it.  Atheism can't be a religion since it has no dogma.  It is the failure to reject a claim and nothing more.  Although atheists may frequently share the same opinion on certain matters, they are not required to nor is there any doctrine describing what their viewpoints should be.
Another difference is that Jews are the true Palestinians.  Lots of Arabs migrated to Palestine looking for employment at Zionist enterprises. And many still do now, Arab immigration to Israel is high every year. Now these migrants want a new country for themselves, something they did not want when West Bank was ruled by Jordan and Gaza by Egypt.
How many Asian or Jewish football players do you know?
The author has not been paying attention. Racial slurs directed at people of colour are now forbidden. Not so racial slurs against whites; they are now all the rage. So too slurs against Jews in their Homeland, which are very popular among leftists and Muslims. Slurs against "infidels" by Muslims are widespread, not least in mosques. The author has missed the new, good, postcolonial racism that is all the rage at universities and generally on the left.
"How many Americans are vegan?  Approximately 0.5 percent, or 1 million, of those are vegans, who consume no animal products at all. In addition, 10 percent of U.S., adults, or 22.8 million people, say they largely follow a vegetarian-inclined diet."  Vegetarianism In America | Vegetarian Times  So the number of vegans in the US pretty much matches the number of atheists and agnostics combined.  I'll bet many of that 10% are, in fact, the very same people!  "Resist the Dominant Paradigm!"   (I definitely exclude myself, of course!)
You do not have your history correct.  True we may have taken over several dates.  We however never claimed to have originated the original holidays.   Resurrection Day should be celebrated more in line with the Jewish Passover as it is a fulfillment of that holiday.  Some Christians will also admit that December 25th is probably not the correct day to celebrate his birthday, but we do not know for certain when his birthday was.  I will also admit that date was probably chosen to usurp another holiday.
Hey, Frank Stahl. Just want you to know you were on to something. The recent threats against Jewish institutions were indeed done by a Jewish Zionist Israeli-American. http://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-israeli-teen-19-arrested-over-jcc-bomb-threats/  I think both the Jewish Community Relations Council and the 20 co-signers of Rev. Rachel Langford's letter owe you an apology.
"Ms. Freeland’s family history has become a target for Russian forces seeking to discredit one of Canada’s highly placed defenders of Ukraine." == Robert, what is YOUR evidence that "Ms. Freeland's family history has become a target for Russian forces seeking to discredit one of Canada's highly placed defenders of Ukraine"? Is it that any source of news that states an accurate description of Ms. Freeland's family history must, a priori, be a "Russian force"? Here's the first sentence of your very own article: "Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland knew for more than two decades that her maternal Ukrainian grandfather was the chief editor of a Nazi newspaper in occupied Poland that vilified Jews during the Second World War." Are you, too, one of Putin's puppets, Mr. Fife? Websites that publish the truth are to be honoured, not vilified, regardless of their origin. Get rid of the anti-Russian propaganda and you'll have something approaching the truth of the matter.
The following comment by the author is extremely helpful in giving us greatly needed expanded insights about how to view and interpret the Christian message: "As an option in our efforts toward understanding the Jesus story in a way that empowers us to embrace Jesus’ radical teachings on nonviolent resistance, survival, liberation, restoration and transformation, [we need to listen] to the voices and experiences of those outside of male dominated theories from Europe and America."
She's just like the Buddha 🙏 - if the Buddha was bffs with Bashar al Assad.
"a choice between his vision of closer integration with a modernized European Union and her calls to cut immigration and take the country out of the euro." That's not what she said. She wants to reinstate the French national currency, but allowing the Euro to continue on institutional settlements. There are many Germans who want to do the same with the Deutschmark; ditto the Dutch with the Guilder, the Italians with the Lira. And stop labeling Le Pen as 'far right', or 'populist'. She is a French nationalist. And finally, don't play the 'Jew-card'.

Boasberg has been an unparalleled train wreck as Superintendent. The fact that Boasberg doesn't even live in Denver would speak volumes. Boasberg's stated intentions to bring back forced busing to "racially balance" all of DPS is lunacy of the first-order. Under Boasberg, DPS is openly hostile to Christians. For example, at Denver Green School, Christmas can't be mentioned in any publication. Children are forbidden to sing Christmas Carols or utter the word Christmas. Christians are consigned to the Catacombs under Boasberg's insidious campaign against Christians. Denver Green School is a microcosm of the open hostility towards Christian students in DPS.   Conversely, illegal foreigners are embraced by DPS under Boasberg. At Denver Green School, Kwanzaa is celebrated. Likewise, Jewish and Muslim Holidays are embraced by the faculty and staff. Christmas and Easter are openly disdained. Even a mundane holiday like Halloween is strictly forbotten at Denver Green School. Boasberg's legacy.
Great news Paul ...6 million Jews weren't murdered by the Germans in WWII ...in fact there wren't even close to that many Jews in Europe at that time.  Fake news becomes fake history
"When Jeremiah heard God say that he had been called for this from the womb, it was like being told that his birth certificate named him 'Renegade-for-life.' Nothing was ever going to be easy for this man."  I'm reminded of the old Jewish joke, "Lord, I know we are your chosen people. But could you choose someone else some of the time?"
Ten atheists gather is not equivalent to "two or three" gathered "in his name."  That, however, does not preclude the existence of the Eucharist.  Nor does the gathering of "two or three" in his name constitute the Eucharist unless a priest presides over the Eucharist.
What is the "hat" on "Levi" in the picture.  It's certainly not a first-century Jewish head covering, from all appearances.
Very interesting. I wasn't aware of this. This explains how Imams in Toronto and Montreal can preach for the killing of Jews. The cops investigate, but never charge. Politicians do even less. I guess as since  killing Jews is in the Koran, it's OK to preach it in a Mosque.  Too bad they don't preach killing Christians, then perhaps someone would care and do something about this outrageous behavior.
Well at least 95% of main stream media is owned or controlled by pro Israel Jews. Thats not against the law but really they do have a bias in favor of Israel.
AJL Certainly agree, Canada should stay out of any involvement.  There is a solution. That is to use the great capabilities in establishing Israel to correct that terrible mistake. One need only look at a map. A Jewish state does not belong in Arab/Muslim territory. That is so obvious that I feel silly making the statement. A Jewish state in Muslim territory. Nothing to do with rights. Just plain  silly.  A piece of land 1/48th the size of Texas, surrounded by friends. What a powerhouse that would be. A chance for the Chosen People to exploit their capabilities. .
That is the wrong answer, because the question should be, "Why is religion relevant when it is Muslims, but not other religions?" Should we expect home-grown Buddhist terrorist bombers in retaliation for intervening in Buddhist countries? The question answers itself.
Hi Chaim, I very strongly suspect that if this woman used these words against a Jewish politician you'd have plenty of condemnation for her, and it wouldn't be calling her a "sellout."
- as Catholics, it defies the natural law and is intrinsically disordered  - for most other Americans - Christian, Jewish, and Muslim -  it is immoral behavior  - it weakens our nation's moral consensus  - it makes it difficult to raise children who are morally straight  - it weakens the family as the cornerstone of society  There are lot of folks with family members, friends, and co-workers who have same attractions who are not "homophobes" who oppose same sex marriage.  That your name-calling doesn't make the grade of civil intelligent discourse has been pointed out to you numerous times.
Now she can turn her mind to the real outrage.in the Middle East. Syria's genocidal policies. And while she's at it, she can report on female genital mutilations in Egypt, Somalia,  and the Palestinian Territories, along with honor killings and gay torture in an assortment of Arab countries.  No Jews present there, but this should satisfy even those critics who focus on Israel.
Fish says:  "It is not a term that means a violent atheist or some atheistic militia."  huh? . mil·i·tant adjective . combative and aggressive in support of a political or social cause, and typically favoring extreme, violent, or confrontational methods.
Chris,    There's always people passionate about liberating their country of origin from unjust oppressive invasion, killing and occupation.    Jews from all over the world joined the Israeli army to fight for liberation from Britain,  fight the Arab armies in 1948 and again in 1967.   In 1936, many North Americans joined the Spanish Republic Army to fight Franco and the Fascists aided by Hitler. Canada's government hated them and did not support them.   Many North American Irish helped the IRA "terrorists" liberate Northern Ireland from the British.   Tamils in Canada fought to liberate Sri Lanka.    The list goes on.    One man's fanatic extremist terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.   The first imperative is to admit the West are the bad guys; second withdraw troops from Islamic nations. Then home grown fighters will have no reason to fight against the West. Being kinder to Islamic folks here would also help. But most of the freedom fighters here have been well established.
Rob,  If it's so inconsequential to you, why are you here posting?  Clearly you have an agenda you are forwarding, and your proposed definition supports the case you wish to put forward.  You ask, "why do so many Christians feel the need to make not accepting their unprovable views a system of belief?"  Here's my question to you: "why do so many atheists feel the need to deny that their disbelief in God/gods is also predicated on nothing more than belief?"  If it's such a non issue for atheists like you, surely you'd be find with the fact that atheism is a belief system.
If it is outdated and corrupt should we not help to modernize it and help it get rid of the evil of corruption by demanding it do so? This business of forcing people to "repent" if they want to participate in religious rites is bribery because gays do not consider themselves sinners nor do others who are discriminated against by the Fundamentalist Catholic religion and its clergy. During WWII, starving Jews in Europe were only given food by Christian Missionaries, if they agreed to convert. Otherwise they were left to starve to death. This is an example of extreme cruelty caused by religious discrimination of the worst kind.
How do Zionists justify the murder of far greater numbers of innocent Palestinian Christians and Muslims? How do they live with themselves? Why do Zionists care about no one and nothing, other than the members of their own tribe?  An American Jew who has previously never been outside of certain neighbourhoods in Brooklyn is  free to emigrate and become an Israeli citizen, while Palestinians who lived on the land for generations have their villages destroyed, even their cemeteries, to make room for Zionist settlers to steal more Palestinian land.   All men are created equal... except Zionists are more equal than others.
I'm sorry, but you're incorrect and, in my opinion, sadly misinformed about the topic. Please do a web search on the Irgun, the Jewish group that fought against Arabs, the British, and the Nazi's beginning around 1936. Many of their activities were seen as justified by the conditions at that time (obviously, supporting the fight against Nazi Germany was justified defense), but many of their attacks on British troops in Palestine and against Arabs would, today, fit the description of terrorism. Also, look up the USS Liberty: you may that story informative as well.
The US and Canada , for that matter, is at WAR with an extreme islamic army called ISIS .   Only going by this one persons take on what happened, there , unfortunately ,there  has always been collateral damage.    We're not at war with hindus , buddists , jews or christians.   The US MUST be careful who gets into America.   Like it or not , it IS not a right to enter the USA.
Perhaps you have heard India described as a 'nation of villages'?  This is very true of Hinduism as well so that website is educational but not a worldwide norm of what Hindus must believe. There are academic leaders but nothing comparable to the Vatican, so ideas and practices vary. Some Hindu village cultures consider any unmarried person to be equivalent with a young unmarried adult or a even a child. A childless couple is also accursed in almost every old time, eastern or western culture.  There is a reason for The Married Women's Property Act 1882 in England.  Nun's still complain about there lack of rights within the Church to this day.
Hi, Bill - I think it's interesting that we've moved from the God-the-Just-Judge hermeneutic for the New Testament to a God-is-love hermeneutic that virtually ignore its predecessors. It typically does so largely on the basis of the curious letters of an unknown Presbyter who also develops the idea of God-as-Light, an idea that has not similarly captured the imagination of many westerners. So God is love and anything goes. Correct me if I'm wrong but one of the main contributions of the Reformation Churches was to put one's personal decision for (or against) the Gospel back at the center of Christian faith and practice, restoring a balance that had been lost in the Roman Church. So my question is: do you think we're moving too far away from that Reformation message and toward a God-is-love message that validates just about anything as long as we say we "love" one another ?  I would love to have this discussion at some point, if anyone is interested. - Monica.
You and I have had different experiences..  At a low point in my life, I received one month's worth of help from several churches (it was all I needed) even though I was a member of none.  My children and I were twice fed by the Salvation Army, Catholic Relief Services bought my family groceries, and members of a local Jewish synagogue helped me find work.
Bro, I should add that you can see the Vatican's reliance on 2 Co 2:10 for "in persona Christi" (in the person of Christ) and the historical development of that through Aquinas in Vatican Catechism #1548. But now, instead of relying on the Vulgate, the NAB/NABRE on the Vatican and US Bishops' websites has a different translation -- "in the presence of Christ" -- not "in the person of." I was not able to find any mention of "in the person of" in the Baltimore Catechism, so I will guess the recent supposedly 'traditional' emphasis on 'in persona' is ironically mostly from Vatican II documents which have it. Just a fad that happens to result in clericalism and discrimination against women. Particularly with "in persona Christi Capitis" -- meaning Christ the Head (who is Jesus, a male). As members of the Christ, women image it. The Eucharist is a remembrance, not a reenactment. Jesus was the 'one and only' sacrifice per Hebrews, and the priest does not become a Jesus and get sacrificed.
UN Partition Resolution 181 gave both the Jews and the Arabs a golden opportunity to share the land by way of partition. The Jews accepted. The Arabs rejected. As a result, the plight of the Palestinians today is of their own making and choosing.
As a "Fundamentalist" Christian I completely agree, a Nation cannot be Christian, the people in in can, but not a nation. When a person advocates this "Christian Nation" nonsense, I immediately question their wisdom and put them down the list of people to listen to or to take advice from. Here is a good message from Gregg Frazer who is a Professor at the Masters College on this subject that even the agnostics and atheists will learn from   https://www.gracechurch.org/sermons/12300
Yes, Justicels , the 3 religions are all Abrahamic religions  Historically Judaism is the elder brother of Christianity as Pope John Paul II and Benedict have acknowledged  The Old testament of Christians is the same as the Jewish Torah  However the Koran or Qu'ran of Islam is different
There is a huge legal difference between a secular marriage and a 'non-secular' marriage.  Historically marriage insured inheritance rights and the legitimacy of the male's children as his own.  Hence the death penalty for adultery for women.  Marriage in the Judeo Christian tradition is all about male property rights, not pro creation and not intimacy and not what ever else you want to throw into the mix.
Don't forget "our" forefathers turned away Jews and put Japanese in camps. The question becomes whether those how long will it take who don't qualify to stay to be deemed s, and even worse, whether they can then be found and deported, given the number of "sanctuary cities" that are popping up.  I would like them to be sent to detention centers where they would be speedily processed, and would be easily available for deportation as needed.
Dear Muslims;  Welcome to the community of progressive left wing religious intolerance. You are joining a group of Christians, Catholics and Jewish who for decades have been shunned, scorned, ridiculed, mocked and marginalized by the secular progressive community in Canada.  These leftwing progressives have worked very hard to shut down religion and religious practice in public spaces and public institutions. So this act of inclusion, by joining this prestigious club of the hated, will help support your struggle that so many religions in Canada have experienced before you.   Pay no attention to our social justice leaders, who are using tragedies to ram though pet personal agendas that seek to further divide through inequality and prioritizing which religions are more important then others.  Stay strong, be of good courage and you will succeed beyond the hate.  Thank You;  Freedom of Religion
The entire state stands with this preschool.  Ironically, by the way, over half the students are not Jewish.  Trump's bizarre presidency will end in 4 years and we can resume more sane proceedings.
I'm Jewish..   every Jewish friend and relative of mine supported trump (thanks to Israel/Zionism).   I tried to explain to them that hate is hate and just because it is playing in your favor doesn't mean you should support it... but it was like I was speaking a foreign language.  There is a saying: you peed your bed now lay in it.
Bill Curry- what if that "piece of cloth" was a swastika? Let's put one of those on the school walls. Heck, let's just have people wear a "piece of cloth" that says "Jew."
well...these other things..   the lost?  books of the bible (books, or chapters in a sense, that didn't make the cut?)  to my awareness, the only other authenticated mention of "this" jesus - jesus being today's equivalent to the name josh...many more than one - is the jewish historian's josephus .
2/2  The author of those comments is William D. Rubinstein, a prominent Jewish historian and author.  “The 'Pope And Mussolini” is more of same. Having found anti-Catholicism to sell well, he certainly is not about to suddenly become objective.  If you’re suggesting that you have an inexhaustible supply of anti-Catholic authors, I would tend to agree with you.  If you’re portraying this material as real history by objective historians, I am afraid you’ll have to ring a “No Sale”.  As Philip Jenkins, an Episcopalian, noted in “The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice” a racist, misogynistic, anti-Semitic, or homophobic comment can ruin a career, but bigotry and hatred toward Catholics is still thriving in culturally “liberal” milieus.
He was also a Donald Trump supporter. Christian attended Trump rallys. He posted on Facebook:   "Bernie Sanders was the President I wanted," wrote Christian in December. "He voiced my heart and mind. The one who spoke about the way America should gone. Away from the Military and Prison Industrial Complexes. The Trump is who America needs now that Bernie got ripped off."  and:  "If Donald Trump is the Next Hitler then I am joining his SS to put an end to Monotheist Question. All Zionist Jews, All Christians who do not follow Christ's teaching of Love, Charity, and Forgiveness And All Jihadi Muslims are going to Madagascar or the Ovens/FEMA Camps!!! Does this make me a fascist!!!"
Atheism is not a *belief* predicated on rational thought.  Atheism is simply rational thought.
I really don't understand why they are only asking  police to fight islamophobia.  Shouldn't the goal be to fight at kinds of hate.. ....against blacks, jews, LGBTQ2, etc.
Christianity was spread by the sword too. In latin America, Spain, italy, Portugal, etc not a single Muslim or Jew was left unconverted. The ones who refused to convert were killed, to the last person.  Whereas there were significant Christian communities in Muslim ruled territories of the Ottomans, the Safavids, the Mughals, etc.
In another article on the topic the Globe's Nathan Vanderklippe writes: "Armed with machetes and a few guns, hundreds of people launched the assault. They fought under the banner of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, a fledgling insurgency led by a small group of Rohingya, based in Saudi Arabia, who claim religious sanction for their cause of employing violence to halt the persecution of Muslims in heavily Buddhist Myanmar. The militants sustained heavy losses that morning, but killed a dozen people."  How is a country supposed to react to an attack on its security by hundreds of Saudi-backed Islamist terrorists?  Maybe it's a disproportionate reaction but something needs to be done about global Islamist violence and oppression.
Jewish Israeli-US teen arrested for phoning in JCC bomb threats  "After months-long undercover investigation, police and FBI say suspect, who lives in Ashkelon, used voice-altering technology to make threatening calls"  "Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the suspect allegedly placed dozens of threatening phone calls to public venues, synagogues and community buildings in the US, New Zealand and Australia. He also placed a threat to Delta Airlines, causing a flight in February 2015 to make an emergency landing."  http://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-israeli-teen-19-arrested-over-jcc-bomb-threats/
"Canada’s record prior to the war was to deny refuge to Jews fleeing oppression in Germany, Russia and other unwelcoming countries. We’ve already lived through a “none is too many” immigration policy; we must avoid unintentionally reinventing that shameful past.   "Yet, many have reasonably argued that when it comes to Muslim refugees today, especially from war-torn Syria, the anti-Muslim rhetoric falls dangerously close to what Canadians heard in prewar times."  ~ Amira Elghawaby and Bernie Farber, Globe and Mail, September 5, 2015.
You don't get it Sher, we aren't talking about the origins of mathematics - we are talking about modern day cultural beliefs that breed social regression, conflict, and division. This isn't an opinion, it is a simple fact highlighted by Europe's experience over the last 15 years. Now you have a student in Germany who is forced to change schools after he tells his mates he's Jewish. Anyone who sympathizes with Hamas or any other Islamist militancy represents an ideology that is fundamentally incompatible with progress. You have entire generations of children who are taught Jews are a cancer that must be removed from the middle east, political Islam is regressive scourge - pick any country, even Bangladesh is facing a growing militancy that leaves secular poets hacked to death for "blasphemy". Political Islamism should be addressed head on without the misguided politically correctness that deems certain topics untouchable.
Finally you answer your own question Rule.  Is a Christian a fallen person who is damned or a saved person who is eternal and free from sin thru Christ.    You want to treat women as though they are still damned but Jesus freed women as much as he freed men which is why both gentiles and women can be sacramental priests equally.  In the beginning before the fall they were equals - no difference in purpose.  Then they fell, and now we are risen back, and have regained what was lost thru Christ, so man and women, gentile and Jew is no more.  If Jesus did not free us now on earth then Jews are greater than Christians who are gentiles.  You can't have it both ways.  Either men and women are equally free or neither is free and both are damned and Jesus accomplished nothing.
As an atheist although I do not agree with the religious symbology as it leaves out the many veterans who are not Christian, I can feel empathy for this young man's attempt to bring attention to the plight faced today by our returning veterans regarding depression, PTSD, and their incredible suicide rate.  Sadly today, they go largely ignored while our politicians call for ever more war  in the Middle East.
To bring this sideline up to date, France had a second Prime Minister with a Jewish background. Laurent Fabius was PM from 1984 to 1986. His parents were from a Jewish family that converted to Catholicism.  At the time of Leon Blum, who was actually Président du Conseil, that is the head of the French government (chef du gouvernement), the role of the President of the Republic was secondary and not as important as it is now.   Another example is British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield who was born, and remained all his life, in the Jewish faith. Disraeli was PM twice, from 1874 to 1880 and briefly in 1868. At the time the Jewish population in the UK was less than 1%.
Sorry, but you understanding of Scriptures is POOR.  Mary Magdalene was not on the cross.  And Mary Magdalene was not a prostitute.  She followed Jesus, as a disciple, from Galilee.  The fact that Jesus cast seven demons from her was how the people then understood any illness, especially psychological ones.  Gregory the Great is responsible for teaching that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute---because he had poor scriptural sources.  But NO recognized scriptural scholar would agree with your concept that Mary Magdalene was a penitent.  Jesus forgave the Jewish people, including members of the Pharasees, Sadducees, and priestly group jeering him and stating "He saved others, let him save himself."  And Jesus forgave us.  Your concept of mercy is steeped in poor scriptural training,.
Before Yasser Arafat (a paradigm of human rights and highly deserving Nobel Peace laureate) coined the term Palestinian in 1967, no such people existed. Some 600,000 nomadic and permanent Arabs lived in and out of the British annexation referred to as Palestine, which came into its possession with the collapse of the Ottoman empire, but in no time in history did any entity identifiable as the Palestinian people ever form a society or govern the region, or anywhere else for that matter. The  evidence of Jewish presence, society, and sovereign governance of Israel going back at least 3000 years is without dispute however. You undoubtedly are aware of this, however the truth does not fit your agenda.   I would suggest that your handle, antifascist, be re-constructed to reflect the reality of your views.
So really what this is to Lee is an infringement on a church (collective group of people) to discuss politics - oh free speech? Either you're talking about religious freedom or freedom of speech or heck, the right to peacefully assemble. It's very interesting to see all sorts of things pop up when a hot-button issue like this comes up in a public forum. Finger pointing at a tax-free status when the issue is where and why a gay couple goes to get married.  If you're Jewish, would you walk into a Mosque and demand to be married in their place of worship, the way you want? Do you have other options? Certainly. That's what religious groups are saying -- they shouldn't be forced to perform a religious ceremony outside of their belief system. It's not hate, it's the right to practice a strong preference to abide by a religious view and the freedom to do that as guaranteed by our Constitution and Bill of Rights as a collective people in this nation.
That's like saying a racist doesn't hate black people, he just hates the color of their skin. Or an anti-Semite doesn't hate Jews, he just hates their religion. Or a misogynist doesn't hate women, he just hates their gender.
Do the math from Vatican II if you want to know why the pews are empty in those age ranges.  No, I don't belong to a college community, but I do wonder what percentage of the student body were born into a Catholic family and attend the Merton Centers (which I'm guessing is essentially a social justice center, because that's what the colleges are pushing nowadays)  No, the Jewish kids live in regular old suburbia on the East Coast, and they attend religious-focuses classes, not social justice, feel-good activities.
"Empower all followers of Jesus ... without counting the cost" is a mistake.  Prudence requires the cost be counted.  "If you, though a Jew are living like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?" (Galatians 2:14).  In this Presidential election season in the USA, the Faithful need to engage the electoratge and follow truth wherever it leads.  One candidate consistently tells the truth and the other candidate consistently denies the truth, as should be evident if the media shows what the Catholic Vice Presidential candidate said in contrast towhat the once Catholic candidate denied.  Paul, with the Liturgy of the Word, Reading 463, Wednesday of the Twenty-seventh Week in Ordinary Time II, shows the Faithful how to follow the truth in the contest of a Teaching Magisterium that is just learning the message.  Catholics need not be afraid to "Go out to all the World" especially in the context of the just-finished (to be continued)
Tell me Earl, upon what authority did the British have to give away the land of Palestinians to new colonists? Is this truly your legal argument for the legitimacy of Israel ethnically cleansing Palestinians who had been there for 2 millennia? That a wealthy European Jewry could demand the land of others, under the imperialistic rule of Great Britain, in return for desperately needed money and bringing the US into WW I?  Further, let us look at the promise of the British Government, which was not an act of Parliament, in the form of the much celebrated Balfour Declaration, delivered to a wealthy European Jew. Sounds legit ...nothing to see here
Second issue: I do think the disciples are portrayed as hard-heated throughout the Gospel of Mark, because they are. But not in the other gospels where they do come to understand Jesus. The traditional picture is from Matthew, Luke, and John. The Jewish authorities did understand that Jesus was a harsh critic of temple practice. e.g., Jesus' temple action to interfere with the sacrifices. No sure historically what the Romans understood about Jesus, but they need not have understood anything more than that he was a trouble-maker. I am still fascinated by Crossan's speculative reconstruction of the passion narrative in "The Cross that Spoke," although I dissociate myself eom his theology. Rather, I remain viscerally incarnational, for any tradition that does not concretize itself in some fashion soon fades. I read Aslan;s book, but agree with the reviews that he in the main repeats Bradon's Jesus the Zealot. Basically I see the gospels as separate attempts to enunciate resurrection.
It wouldn't necessarily cause 'intolerable scandal'.  It might cause people to make choices according to their consciences.  Your conscience will say male priests only and you can choose a Mass with a male priest.  Others are not so black/white, male/female, slave/owner, Jew/Gentile and will not care, much less be scandalized.
Country wide terrorists are the Antifa kids and BLM. These fake hate crimes have been systematically debunked.   This tactic is a favorite of the Zionists.   Working class whites are to busy working to worry about prank calling Jews in "country wide terrorist type attacks."  I can't be held accountable for you not understanding the implications of propaganda or how the evidence this argument is a hoax is in the story. Do your own research. Ive wasted way to much time in my life debating liberals who resort to name calling when their arguments get dismantled.
Obviously you've never read anything about Japanese or Islamic or Hindu or Persian or Chinese or Mongol history. You basically only seem to know history starting at around 1492 in the Western World. Other cultures haven't all been bastions of tolerance throughout all of their history.
How about this, leave non-believers, non-religious, secularists, Atheists or whatever you want to call us, to peace without God! THANKS!
Do Christianity and Judaism permit polygamy?
The atheists want “proof” for the existence of God.  How do you prove something, anything, happened in history? By its nature, history is not reproducible or testable under controlled conditions, so the “scientific method” can’t be used.  Instead, you look at documentary evidence and other corroborating evidence to back a claim.  Historical proof is based on a convergence of evidence.  Even the atheist lawyer knows this, because lawyers use evidence to build a case.  Here are two examples of such evidence that requires a judgment:
No misunderstanding here. I had indeed understood that you were trying to "elide the point" (to borrow one of your own, almost apt phrases). That is, that you were trying to merge your poor example (the 'ten atheists') with another and fitting reason for celebrating Mass. The 'hypothetical' example was your own, not mine. Blame yourself if you chose it badly. The GIRM explains the point which you have failed to grasp.
In your citation "ISIS Inadvertently Proves Bible Historically Accurate" Archbold expresses an utter and complete misunderstanding of issues of historicity and the Bible. No modern scholar doubts the historicity of the Babylonian exile of the Jews or the existence of Sennacherib. See Wiki articles on "Sennacherib" and "Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem." We have multiple confirmations of Sennacherib's attacks on both the northern and southern kingdoms of the Jews in the Bible and in Assyrian sources. The problems of historicity in the OT have to do with the much early periods. The ISIS uncovered remnants add virtually nothing to further establish the general historical accuracy of the Bible's account of the exile period.   And none of this has even the remotest relevance to the question of whether the Gospel are history in our modern sense. Best I can tell, you confuse the fact that GENRE of the Gospels is not history with questions about the historical Jesus--of course Jesus is historical.
Savages need reservations.  Anybody who thinks that hurting people is the way forward is just a savage.  Let them keep to themselves.  Savages need access to helpful information, not to propaganda.  It might sooth the savages if they could learn Hebrew so they can read signs and be productive in society if they want to be.  The Jews should provide them blankets in non-partisan colors they prefer, water, and food if they can't grow enough for themselves.
and just think what they could accomplish economically  if they truly wanted peace instead of death and destruction of Israel and the  Jews. Unfortunately , I do not believe the Palestinians want a true peace. I think it is important for the  Arab countries to use the Palestinians for their own purpose.  Interesting how Egypt Jordan and Saudi Arabia are starting to partner with Israel in many areas.
Observant Muslims or Jews don't celebrate Christian holidays. The examples mentioned by skyofblue are following their faith as much as a jew who eats bacon.
"hebes"???  I have only seen that word used as a slur against Jews.
It's complicated.   Essentially, the situation is similar to former Yugoslavia, only much prolonged: Rohingya separatist movement (which is perfectly fine) had essentially a guerrilla army (which is less fine) for at least 50 years; however, their idea of Rohingya state included a pure Muslim state purged of Buddhists, which is not fine; even worse, there is constant violence from Rohingya separatist movement aimed at Buddhists, which is not fine at all. Problem is, as usual, that while not all rohingya are militants, all militants are Rohingya, and a significant minority of Rohingya support them - which is why the military junta stripped Rohingya of citizenship a few decades ago.   As a result, the military (hardliners) want to push Rohingya out, while Suu Kyi wants to somehow integrate them. Worse, Suu Kyi doesn't fully control the military, and Rohingya who flee the conflict are often very bad militants themselves posing as refugees.
I posted this "men who wore belts that said "Mitt Gott"  because it is true.  I am pro-life and proud to be a liberal/progressive - I do not agree with the position on abortion.  However, I believe in the Constitution. I note that conservatives in Congress have refused to vote on a Life Amendment.  Rather, abortion is used as a politcal club, as you are doing right now.  Anti-semitism was a part of Christian Europe for over 1000 years.  Jews were discriminated again, forced to live in ghettos or isolated villages. "A pogrom is a violent riot aimed at the massacre or persecution of an ethnic or religious group, particularly a riot aimed at the massacre or persecution of Jews"  Pogroms occurred throughout this history and culminated in the massacre of six million Jews. Pope Benedict was a Nazi Youth.    Bibles as literature should be in high schools only if all forms of the bible, also the Book of Mormon, the Koran, The Torah, and all other Holy Books are included.
What was the results from the investigation into the Israeli youth sending threats to Jewish organizations in North America?
"No, and abortion is not any other garden variety sin."  It has been almost treated as adultery was during in Christ's time.  The man was allowed to 'get away' and the woman was caught to be tried and stoned to death.  The pattern of sexism is blatant.  By the way, abortion was permitted in Judaism before 'quickening' occurred.   "I would hope that a woman who procured an abortion would be remorseful and seek the godly counsel of a priest?  What does the priest even know about the psychological, mental and often physical situations that often leads a woman to procure an abortion?     Has the priest, personally, ever been in the same situation as the woman has?  You write about men confessing incest----but no special "juridical process" was needed to forgive that sin, either.  A man could sexually abuse a vey young child---little girl or boy.  But the priest didn't have to go to the bishop---to forgive the creep.
Interesting that all my Jewish friends go to Temple for religious services. As going to Temple refers to the religious services, while Synagogue is reference to the building.  You must be a reformed Jew.
Jewish Israeli-US teen arrested for phoning in JCC bomb threats  "After months-long undercover investigation, police and FBI say suspect, who lives in Ashkelon, used voice-altering technology to make threatening calls"  "Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the suspect allegedly placed dozens of threatening phone calls to public venues, synagogues and community buildings in the US, New Zealand and Australia. He also placed a threat to Delta Airlines, causing a flight in February 2015 to make an emergency landing."  http://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-israeli-teen-19-arrested-over-jcc-bomb-threats/  I think an apology to Frank Stahl is in order, not only from you, motleycrew, but from the JCRC and Rev. Rachel Langford and the 19-cosigners who wrote letters condemning Stahl and acknowledge that hoaxes and false flags do occur as my previous comments document.
Here is a description of the program:  "This program takes a special look at Québec's religious heritage. The historical and cultural importance of Catholicism and Protestantism is especially highlighted. However, attention is also given to the influence of Judaism and Native spirituality on this heritage, as well as other religions that today contribute to Québec culture and inspire different ways of thinking, being and acting."  http://www.education.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/site_web/videos/campagnes/semaine_enseignants/depliantECR_ANG.pdf  http://www.education.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/site_web/images/dpse/formation_jeunes/ann3_en.pdf  http://www.education.gouv.qc.ca/en/contenus-communs/education/ethics-and-religious-culture-program/program-elementary-level/competency-2-demonstrates-an-understanding-of-the-phenomenon-of-religion/

There is a simple answer directly from the NT.  When at its birth, the new movement which became Christianity, was divided on the requirements that the new believers:  obey the Jewish rites and Law.  But the Holy Spirit gave the answer which is continually ignored today by this church's leaders.  Allow two groups to choose how they would practice their religious beliefs without coercion from the leaders.  This allowed the church to grow and become the major religion in the Roman Empire by the fourth century.     Why has this method not been considered today when it threatens to divide the church?
Gary: I don't accept "the conspiracy "false flag" idea that the desecration of Jewish cemetaries and vandalism of synagogues is an conspiracy perpetrated by either Jews or Zionists to garner public support", either.  In my letter, I carefully referred only to the wave of threats against Jewish institutions.
I find all these references and comparisons to Nazis horrible. Do people forget what the Nazi's actually did? Even Antifa with all their violence haven't come anywhere close to the atrocities we saw under the Nazi regime. To equate this to what the Nazi's did, particularly to Jews but also all of Europe, is sickening. 6M people were systematically murdered for simply being Jewish. WWII killed over 60M. How on earth can you compare the two?
Calling you a Jewish name?  OMG you poor little snowflake. All this because of a spelling error. How middle school.
Dick Palmatier - Atheist ideologies and the tyrannies they engendered killed 100 million people in the 20th century alone. Although records from past eras are hard to obtain, it's highly unlikely that all the religions of history have killed that many in all of history.
the homeless jew knows where he could buy a house for $12,000......he would get a job but .....he has a long voilent crimele recorde....and prison and jail made him to crazy to work.....
Anti-Semitic hate and hate propaganda is tolerated in Canada, particularly at mosques and at universities. This hateful anti-Semitic conduct and behaviour is now threatening  institutions where Jews and their children frequent. This is the result of the fecklessness of our political and university leaders to address this development and who hide behind platitudinous policies of free expression of hateful ideas. Until such time as our political leaders and university administrations take a stronger stand against hateful conduct and behaviour emanating from sources of Jew hatred in both religious and university institutions, expect these bomb threats to grow and increase. Universities are a clear source of Jew hatred messaging  that tolerates the hateful animus towards Jews and Jewish institutions.
Man, you are completely obsessed.  How are your beliefs any different from white supremacists who blame everything on jewish control of the media?
Ok.. so you mentioned Judaism.. what about the other religions?
So perhaps one might question the thesis on which this article is based - the UN resolution denying any Jewish connection or history to Jerusalem. Why would that be, if not to undermine any credence to Israel's stubborn insistence on existing?
A decade before the UN partition, David Ben-Gurion articulated Zionist strategy: "We shall accept a state with fixed boundaries today, but the boundaries of Zionist aspirations are the concern of the Jewish people and no external facts can limit them."  Trump's promise to move the US embassy to Jerusalem at least ends the farcical charade of Washington paying lip service to a two-state solution while funding settlements that abort it. But as Ehud Barak warned, the alternative to a two-state is a one-state solution, destined to either apartheid or because of demographics the end of a Jewish state.  And I don't doubt for a minute which Israel will choose.
Please post the stats on racial profiling and police shootings of Asians and Jews. I'll wait.
No. They're attacking bigots who use their religion as a weapon to discriminate against people they disapprove of. How would you react to a Jew who refused to serve Christians? You'd scream "discrimination!" that's how.
You can say that for any group.  Blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Gays, etc.  So they're all the same? No differences and all share similar problems.  Intellectual firepower at its best.
From the atheist perspective , watching theists debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin is always entertaining as is the question of whether Francis is a heretic , I leave that to the true believers...but from my perspective  this particular pope is nothing more than a modern day New Leftist ( Communist )  liberation theologian ( as he revealed during his 2016 visit to Mexico) ...he stated that " it is the Communists who think like Christians", and , there is , of course an element of truth in that.  Christian Communism , the radical wing of Christian socialism, exists, Karl Marx was a Christian and was a member of the League of the Just, a Christian- Communist organization.  Modern day Christian Communists share many of the goals of modern day Marxists in particular the replacement of capitalism with socialism, which Francis , I'm certain , would agree with .
This misleading claim is really getting tiresome. Knowledge of politics and religion is necessary in a number of courses taught in public schools. Ones understanding of history, social studies and literature will be greatly lacking without them.  What public schools don't do is PROSELYTIZE for a particular brand of politics or religion. Schools don't favour Liberal politics over Conservative politics, nor Christianity over Hinduism.  However, it's reasonable for a school to allow like-minded students of a particular political view or faith to congregate in an unused classroom. If kids want to start a Young Liberals club, that's perfectly fine as long as other kids can start their own political clubs. Likewise with gatherings based on faith. If kids want to start an atheist's club or a club to study the Talmud, doing so is acceptable.  Every election, thousands of Canadians will vote inside a school. Making the space available for a lawful purpose is not the same as teaching it.
I am not trying 'so hard' as accepting the facts of the ORIGINAL STORY that Ms.Flowers wrote above all this back-and-forth. The victims of the Holocaust, primarilly (though not only) Ashkenazi Jews had nowhere else to go. They established themselves in Israel and protected themselves in so doing.  You do not ask permission to survive.  You can argue about what Scripture says till the cows come home. Ultimately you can justify anything through Scripture. I take it as a great comfort that so many Israelis (according to you are atheists). My reaction: "Can you blame them?"  They have built a nation with Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Ba'hai, Agnostic, Atheist elements and races that encompass Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardi Jews, Arabs, Armenians, Africans, Hispanics (yes!). They have world class science centers and educational institutions there open to all. The idea of putting someone on trial for heresy is laughable in that environment.  I hope they defend the hell out of it.
Christianity may well  be (or intend to be) fundamentally peaceful  but various off shoots are not.  Radical Christian extremists find homes in outfits like the Christian Identity movement and The Army of God and so on.  Are you saying because there is no group called RCE , the people who organize themselves with RCE precepts don't exist? Or merely that they cannot be Christians because their ideals are opposite of the larger notions of Christianity ? Like the Muslims who have been saying for years and years that the radical Islamic extremists are not true Muslims?  I think all these folks need to be owned by the larger religious umbrella they shelter under and booted out on their fannies as sick phonies-  Christian, Jew, Muslim,etc.  It is inadequate to the problem to just keep saying they aren't Christian. Owning that religion can be perverted is an important step  which is missing in the larger Christian community- at least in public.
In the other post I mentioned, the author cited Jesus' words, "Follow the Commandments."  Say what you will about legalism, but legalism is, in fact, the basis of Judaism and Christianity.
Bibi has alot of friends in Hollywood with Geffen records maybe Bibi could make a few phone calls. Trump Loves Bibi and Putin. Traditional Jewish music with a slice of Cossack dancers. Menu; Kosher food with Russian Vodka.
Atheists need not comment
Well, Indian kids work harder than kids here. I don't know if you have had the privilege of visiting a university in Canada. If you have, then visit one of the STEM subject classes. Or the Medical school classes. Just see who is overrepresented there. The Indians and Chinese kids.  In terms of PPP, the CIA lists China's economy as bigger than the US and EU:-  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html#ch  India is fourth on that list. And rising.   Let me paraphrase what Benjamin Disraeli, the British Prime Minister who was born Jewish, said to a British MP:-  When my ancestors were writing epics, yours were swinging on trees.
the settlements are important part of the Israeli plan for security. It is hard to imagine that if they make a true peace, the hatred the Arab world for Israel and Jews will stop. The Palestinians, Hamas et al will suddenly accept Israelis and Jews and stop calling for their destruction? Israelis and Jews do not call for destruction /hatred of Arabs.   In 1967 they should have not become occupiers. Some  of the settlement lands, Israeli residences in East J. has been legally purchased. I am not a big fan of the settlements. They do not encourage peace. But how does Israel make sure she will be well defended if 'peace' with these neighbors happens?  Unfortunately I think it is not possible the way things are. Israel made a  mistake in 1967.
Dude was an atheist who hated Christians.
Both PA and Hamas are better examples of Apartheid: not only they are Juden-free, but they persecute their Christian minority. Israeli Arabs and Jews have the same rights, live together and work together.   I visited Israel, talked to Arabs and Jews, and don't need to listed to cheap lies from Islamist propagandists.
"The miracle here is Jenkins."  I thought so, too. He is on target. I also thought Sen. Feinstein only half knew what she was doing when questioning Barrett. (I can't imagine, for example, the Senator, under a different disguise, asking a Jewish judicial candidate if he/she would carry on in court like an Orthodox Jew [like, say, former Senator J. Lieberman] or Reform; or questioning a Protestant, if he or she was evangelical or mainline.) Of course, questions like Feinstein's have their own pathology, political and ideological. But she cut the throat of her rooster too soon.
When a stranger expresses an opinion, Progressive111, it usually helps others if you say a little about who you are, that's all. When it comes to assessing the activity of this particular pope, who certainly does echo Latin American Liberation Theology, it is probably worth disclosing where one stands on the scales of justice. Most Christians love justice, I would think, but some believe that actually seeking it is communist, elitist, atheist, hopeless and on and on.  Say a little about why you choose Progressive111 as a moniker.
Agreed. As long as the religious keep their religion (or, ideally, their lack of one) out of their job, it should not matter.    Unfortunately, the creepy way in which politicians are expected by Christians to parade their religion around has made this an issue.    I would think some of the very best at not letting weird delusions pollute the government would be atheists, agnostics, Universal Unitarians, Quakers, moderate/liberal Catholics of the liberation theology type, nominal Jews, nominal Protestants, etc.    But even "evangelical Christian" is a very broad term and not ALL of them are unhinged by a long shot. Thankfully.
Milo is part of the Alt-right, an outspoken Jewish homosexual - interesting how the Globe omits certain details that detract from the desired "narrative". And yet the Globe continues to ignore political Islam, accepting cultural relativism as a valid excuse for misogyny and homophobia.
can the homeless jew sleep in the building at nite
Ha, so you truly believe Muslims learned to hate us only 60 years ago, thanks for the laugh. Jews and Arabs/Muslims have been hating each other since ancient times cowboy bebop. If you're trying to make a point then blame the UN, they're the morons who originally granted the land to Israel and then the Brits controlled the area, until they didn't. The Brits pulled an Obama, immediately the Jews followed UN game plan, were attacked by surrounding Arab nations, War broke out, the Arabs lost.   You can also blame the liberal democrat Harry Truman for Muslims hating us, if it pleases you.
The Gospel portrayal of the Pharisees is a caricature, a wedge meant simply to play up Christian ideas and play down Jewish ones. The Gospels were written as an evangelizing tool to spread the new religion. Not as objective history. The Pharisees were the direct ancestors of modern rabbinical Judaism. They believed it didn't take a Temple to worship God. They believed in a just AND merciful God.
The social justice warriors in the Ontario government and media have truly reached new lows in somehow trotting out Clara Brett Martin as an exemplary female lawyer in Canadian history, in the same breath as talking about barring Jews from careers back then.  Um, hello?  It was CLARA BRETT MARTIN herself who was busy trying to bar Jews from careers back then!  In a letter she wrote from Toronto to government that began: "I desire to call your attention to the manner in which the titles to property in this city are being clouded"...  ... she railed against what she called the "nearly 100,000 foreigners of which about 40,000 are Jews" in town, and prattles on about "these Jews" and "the Jew invariably" does this, and "the Jew" does this and "the Jew" does that, ultimately dismissing Jews in Toronto as a bunch of foreigners who should not be in the business of handling property titles.   The social justice warriors have hit a new low in embracing a seething anti-semite as they have...
You think Rome invented the sacrificial nature of the mass, eh? When you take Rome's word for it, it is quite easy to be hoodwinked into believing just about anything.  From a solidly Jewish resource, for example:  "Sacrifice is an ancient and universal human expression of religion. Greeks and Romans and Canaanites and Egyptians all offered sacrifices to their gods. Sacrifice existed among the Hebrews long before the giving of the Torah. Cain and Abel offered sacrifices; Noah and his sons offered sacrifices, and so forth. When the laws of sacrifice were given to the Children of Israel in the Torah, the pre-existence of a system of sacrificial offering was understood, and sacrificial terminology was used without any explanation." (jewfaq-dot-org)  Do you not know that early Christian worship was forbidden under Rome's purview, and that early followers gathered in people's homes for worship and thanksgiving? Rome didn't even differentiate it from Judaism until about 50AD--c'mon now Trid!
Her Grandfather MOVED from Ukraine to Nazi-occupied Poland to work for the Third Reich under the command of Governor-General Hans Frank, the man who organized the Holocaust in Poland. He's got a prestigious job and an apartment of the murdered Jewish publisher. He published after mass executions of Jews in Babi Yar: “There is not a single one left in Kiev today, while there were 350,000 under the Bolsheviks. Jews got their comeuppance.” www.lamoth.info/?p=creators/creator&id=2136  Then her Grandpa flees with his Nazi boss to Vienna and continues publishing his propaganda there.  There were two sides: Russia, Britain, USA was against Nazism. Canada was on the allies side back then. Her Grandpa, along with many Ukrainian collaborators, was on the other side.  It has nothing to do with Putin. Her mother was a rabid Russia-hater too.  The question is, why this nationalistic, multi-generational hatred now defines Canada's foreign policy?
Hatred for anyone for their religious beliefs has no place in Canadian society. That includes Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jews, Christians, and those who practice other faiths. Religious freedom is a cornerstone of societal freedoms and must be protected. So you are correct that Anti-Muslim hatred has no place in Canada. The difficulty occurs though when you isolate and elevate one particular faith for special treatment - which is of course a passive form of discrimination. Lets stick with equal rights for all and special privileges for none!
Evidently Canada omitted the word  'Jews' from the National Holocaust Monument and another nearby statue. Will this article be updated or should we expect a separate article on the subject?
I wouldn't hold my breath. The man probably has investments in lots of deals he will profit from while in office, and with Republicans controlling all three branches, who's going to make him? Hillary was as dirty (~"You've got to have a public policy, and a private policy") and it looks like the corporate Demonrats who backed her are still in control of the party, so we won't get a better choice next time. If you have the energy and resources, get out while you can. In 1939 the smart German Jews were already in London or New York. The writing is on the wall. Amerika is going down. I'm too old, broke & tired, otherwise I'd be in Norway now. Or Argentina.
Mel Gibson was sidelined for his own antisemitic remarks, not his father's.  If Freeland had blamed Jews for all the wars in the world, I would be first in line calling for her resignation. As it stands, people are trying to discredit her *ancestry*, which might be a very positive statement that they can't find anything damaging about the woman herself.  walkyrie, do you think it would be constructive political commentary to dig into which Russian political leaders are descendants of Genghis Khan (as many millions of people are), and blame those leaders for 800-year-old Mongol atrocities?
It is an undeniable fact that different faith communities in Canada have their own cemeteries. Why should Muslims be denied these rights?  "Religious preference leads people to be buried in different cemeteries, e.g., Catholic, Jewish, Protestant (of various varieties), interfaith or nondenominational. In the past, people of minority races and of "disapproved" ethnic origins were forced to be buried apart from others".  http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/cemeteries/
If they disagree about the Hypostatic Union and the Triune God, then they are not Christian, let alone Catholic.
So you are ok with a newspaper that expressed approval for what the Nazis were doing to jews?
I am with Ibbotson on this.  Ms. Payette's transgression is serious.  And it is even more serious that neither she nor the prime minister can see it.    Ms Payette needs to learn, and fast, that being GG does not give you the right to pontificate on the beliefs of others and insult the significant minority of Canadians with strong religious beliefs - Christians, Jews, Muslims and others should not be mocked by their GG.  Lesson #1 for all incoming GG's. It is not about you. It is about Canada.
Hopefully they don't find out about Bob's Jewish roots. It could complicate things. Hate to see Bobby showing up on T.V.  in an orange jump suit .
The fact remains that Britain nor anyone else had any right to promise Palestine to anyone, not the French nor the Jews. The Balfour Declaration was an illegitimate bargain resulting in an apartheid state.   People should listen to Miko Peled, an Israeli, an author, a public speaker and the son of a famous Israeli general, talk about how Israel treats Palestinians. In the following video he shares a perspective that you won't see in our propaganda. At 40:30 in the video he describes the real terrorism.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TOaxAckFCuQ
If there is to be an open and honest debate about this conflict we must agree that we can be critical of the government of Israel without being racist.   To my knowledge Israel, Iran and the Vatican are officially religious states. PM Netanyahu has always stated that the security of Israel as a Jewish state was a condition of peace. This would seem to exclude a 1 democratic state solution where former Israelis and Palestinians are equal citizens as an option.  The alternative solutions is either 2 states (Israel and Palestine) or 1 apartheid style state - which is what we appear to have now.  Palestinians do not have control over their land, resources or voting.  Palestinians have not been saints either and past UN reports have highlighted this.   Let's have a fact based dialogue.
Do you recall that the Crusades were a response to the invasion of Christian lands by brutal Muslim conquerors? Did you know that when Muslims invaded India they slaughtered 2/3rds of the Hindu population, their leaders bragging about how high the piles of 'infidel' heads were outside cities they destroyed? Are you aware that there were over 14,000 terrorist attacks carried out in the world just last year in the name of Islam?
I agree and it should not have happened.   As I have stated I do not support the white supremacists or their violence.   I did not mean to equate the two.   That said was there, at that same demonstration, violence from the left?  This is what President Trump means when he says that more than one side was to blame.  You can not cherry pick the violence and hatred that you are going to support.   Just like you can not cherry pick  the racism you are going to support.  Were there not some Jews that could have spoken at that rally.  I seem to remember some things in the news about swastikas being painted recently.
Sandy Hook  -  Religion not used to justify actions.  Sikh Temple  -  Religion not used to justify actions  Planned Parenthood shooting  -  Religion not used to justify actions, objected to killing babies                                                      and selling the body parts. Mentally impaired.  Church in NC shooting  -  Religion not used to justify actions.  Jewish community center shooting  -  Religion not used to justify actions.  Radical Islamic terrorist actions are all based on religious justification.
Take notice how the supporters and defenders of the white supremacists (including Trump) are trying to make this about violence. Yes, the violence has to be dealt with, but the ISSUE here, folks, is white nationalists and neo-nazis spewing their racist, anti-semitic hate. There is no middle ground here. There is no equivalency. On one side you have people who want to purge America of Jews, minorities, and immigrants, just as the Nazis in Germany attempted to do in their country. On the other side you have people who are against that. The fact that violence erupts does not in any way make the two sides somehow equivalent. One right and one is wrong. By not condemning the wrong, you are supporting it, accepting it, enabling it; it's that simple. Which side are you on? Which side is our president on?
A "true atheist"? You just blew it right there. Atheists aren't constrained by dogma. We don't believe according to rules laid down by you or anyone else.  This atheist certainly doesn't view all religion as nonsense. Only the most arrogant person would think that way. Religions have inspired the greatest works of art, music, architecture and literature known to man. You might just as well describe all of human existence thus far as nonsense.  An atheist that's comfortable in his belief that deities don't exist is likewise comfortable in the belief of others that they do. I don't take the beliefs of others as an affront to my own. People are free to believe what they wish. It's a fundamental human right which I deeply respect, even though I may disagree with the belief.
But Islam is not the only religion like that.  Everyone is bashing Islam right now, but other religions are the same.  Look at Orthodox jews, they cannot marry or even have a relationship with non-jews.  Christianity is maybe not as strong but some of their branches are not tolerant at all either.  every religion considers itself tolerant, but it is only of those who are part of that religion.
Lela, you admit no records exist to support your claims of a restrained religious hoard, but then state the atheists are worse? It's all bad, but it's all within human nature. If we can do away with any of the cults involved we might lessen future occurrences.
The Soviet Union never successfully crushed Christianity. It did not need to be converted to anything because it wasn't a place of unbelief.  Read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Today 13% of nation describes themselves as atheist. Surely the Mother of God wasn't fooled by the rhetoric or the soulless architecture.
Unfortunately, I’m an atheist, but I’ll do my rain dance; I hear it works just as well as praying, lol
There are a number of scientists who are members of my church - I strongly suspect they would disagree with your statement.  Faith and science are _not_ antagonistic.  Certain atheists like to pretend they are, because science is independent of faith, but science is not inherently contradictory to faith.
Yes, ethnic group. That's why a Russian Jew looks so much like an Ethiopian Jew. lol
Bill,  If Paul was in favor of ending circumcision he would not have circumcised the Jew Timothy with his own hand.  Paul opposed the circumcision of gentiles, not Jews.    If Paul wanted to argue his point about not giving women authority over men from local circumstance he might have.  He did not.  He argued from creation:  1 Tim 2:13-14 "For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression."  So Groucho does have a scriptural basis for asserting Paul's reasoning about not ordaining women as elders is universal.  It is based on both the created order and the sinful nature of mankind.  I have a question for you Bill, do Elders perform a priestly function in the Seventh-day Adventist church.  We are not ordaining priests are we?  We are simply ordering our congregations according to the the New Testament pattern.
I see you are quickly drifting into the same style that ran afoul of Civil Comments once already:   "It is to laugh", "Your feeble attempts", "barely-disguised extracts".  Why you believe scribbling slogans and misinformation from anti-Catholic sources trumps reality is somewhat elusive.  The number of books of recent publication, many by Protestants, some by Jews, dissecting the slur that you're repeating seems to indicate there is a bit of dissonance over your "facts".  http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/comp-reports/ecu/news6pm29072016  http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/12/09/bbc-admits-it-underestimated-the-churchs-opposition-to-hitler/  I find anti-Catholic propaganda offensive, and  believe that is what you are disseminating.
I was replying to the poster's comment which since has been deleted by others. He claims there are no Jews in Iran. If we use your figure of 9000, it is a significant population base compared to 'zero' as asserted. Sam was used as an example of the type of Jews currently in Iran. In other words, the community type was identified.  It is obvious you did not read the poster's comment. People reply to poster's comments all the time whether that comment is relevant to the story or not.
The Conservative Party’s effort to pass a new motion cleansed of the word “Islamophobia” and replaced with condemnation of “all forms of systemic racism, religious intolerance and discrimination of Muslims, Jews, Christians, Sikhs, Hindus and other religious communities” is obstructive and, frankly, misses the mark. It does not help to alleviate the incredibly hurt sentiments of many Muslims.  give me a break. obstructive how? misses what mark?  i don't care about your feelings, snowflake. you have no right to have your "feelings" protected. the jews have suffered far more than muslims and not just had their "feelings" hurt. They've been discriminated against,  murdered, their houses of worship burned, their nation constantly under threat of nuclear annihilation, all by muslims. And then theres the holocaust. How dare you suggest the "feelings" of muslims trump the actual injuries and threats to jews.
As a citizen of the United States, I'm having trouble seeing my dog in this fight!  "There are roughly 6 million Jews in Israel, 6 million in the U.S. and 4 million spread elsewhere. About 75 percent of the 10 million diaspora Jews are non-Orthodox, mostly followers of the Reform and Conservative streams of Judaism."  Why should I care?  The US deals with the theocracies of Iran, Saudi Arabia. Qatar and others; what's the big deal if Israel becomes more Jewish Orthodox?  We even exchange ambassadors with the Pope!
Of course MPs and government leaders being friendly with Israel absolutely, in no way, no sir-rryyy, has anything to do with garnering votes. When MPs visit Israel they cover their own expenses from their own pockets. And even if Palestinian electoral base were to be larger than that of Jewish voters politicians would still ignore Palestinian concerns and keep their unwavering support toward Israel. that is how electoral politics works.... Apparently in politics you put your ideas forward and impartial electorate studies them carefully and votes for the party that wins their hearts. Uhhuuh! Right!  Reading some commentaries here one gets the impression that there should be no politicking in politics.   How dare they! these two conservative MPs visiting Armenia should be banned from politics...
A group of ancient Irish (preceding Christianity) refused to practice human sacrifice and were as a result despised by other Irish. Were they Jewish or Jewish influenced? Apparently my ancestors were part of this group. There definitely was a Mideastern influence in Irish Christianity. But the story is confused, and many unproven speculations have been attached to this aspect of Irish history.
My mother who was born in the wreckage of Europe to parents who survived the camps is losing her mind over this.  She has asked me if my passport is up to date.  She figures that if Nazis are being defended, by the current party in power, that it may not be too long before this country isn't safe for Jews anymore.  I'm not sure that she is wrong, I hope that she is, but I truly am not sure.
The Stern gang was a pejorative term FOR Lehi.  Again I ask you address the history of THIS planet, but apparently that history spotlights realities you're ashamed to acknowledge.  You say assassination is "pretty exceptional for the British"? Apparently you didn't pay much attention to two centuries' worth of their atrocities in India and Africa.  Nor did I say (I'd) "get there" in terms of anti-Semitism. Please QUOTE me saying this.  I did say that's the Zionists' standard accusation in response to my arguments, until I advise them of my heritage whereupon they usually switch to "self-hating Jew", since no contradiction is too absurd to try to distract attention from their idol's clay feet.  And I take your false accusation no more seriously than I do any other from an apologist for Zionist apartheid.  Except in one sense--you DEFEND those who have the blood of 100,000 Sephardic children on their hands.  "Anti-Semite is as anti-Semite does, ma'am." (the Great Gump Sanhedrin)
there is a difference between anti-Muslim hate and concern regarding the cultural spread of Islamic thought.  There are large numbers of Catholic and Jewish cemeteries in Canada. Denying a Muslim the simple comfort of the burial custom of their religious affiliation, seems simply motivated by animus.  Being wary regarding the spread of Islam however is not so simply characterized. The Islamic world had achieved cultural and technological competitiveness with the west by the 13th century, yet since, having never undergone a Renaissance or Enlightenment, it has never been forced to confront its theocratic assumptions as Christianity was forced to do under the West's expansion and gradual tolerance of  pure science, philosophy, political theory technological innovation, and secularization... where are the Islamic world's da Vinci, Galileo, Kant, Voltaire, Smith, Marx, Watt or even Coco Chanel, its Oxfords, or MITs, or its simple recognition of the separation of church and state ?
Jews living for hundreds of years among Christians who generally despised them, who lived in separate communities, who did not seek converts and could expect little success given the disdain, oppression and physical danger Jews were all too often subject to managed to completely dilute the Semitic genetic markers they left Palestine with mostly through Christian men marrying Jewish women even though Judaism is passed down through the mother? I see studies you believe prove your claim.  I see studies that disprove it. The loss of a structure and of a "priesthood" destroyed by an invader doesn't invalidate a historic claim to land by people whose ancestors were forcibly removed from it. Zionism isn't blameless, threats of annihilation can distort reactions. The current Palestinian problem was caused by Arabs who dropped refugees into camps, left them to rot and use as anti-Israel propaganda and encouraged destroying Israel. The Dunthorpe Strategy: If you can't beat 'em deny they exist.
Neither do you. The books of the Jewish Scriptures (Old Testament) were written down by different people in different times for different reasons -- and none of those reasons was to prove Jesus of Nazareth was coming. That interpretation came AFTER Jesus of Nazareth was executed by the Romans, and that interpretation was used to read back into the Jewish Scriptures proof that the Jewish Scriptures foretold Jesus of Nazareth. The Jewish Scriptures stand on their own, and Jews have been using them just fine without Christian interpretation. Plus, Islam's central prophet's name is spelled Mohammed in English. Insulting another faith and its prophets is hardly a way to plea for tolerance of your own.
"Mr. Oei, a Singapore billionaire who is considered one of Southeast Asia’s richest men, said he also wants to give back to the community in Northeast False Creek by building a museum that could display some of the 50,000 Buddhist artifacts that he has collected." - Bravo!  "The Aquilinis and Mr. Oei have committed that the centre’s operating costs will be covered by them, not the park board, which gives the area a new community centre and part-time rink for free." - Great!
If the Arabs didn’t want to be ‘occupied’ and ‘humiliated’, then they should not have attempted to annihilate the Jews, and they certainly shouldn’t have launched their genocidal forces from our ancient heartland. If you are concerned about world peace and human rights, the pressure should be on the fascists and kings surrounding Israel committed to endless war. 11 million Muslims have been killed since 1948. Less than one percent of those unfortunate souls have been killed in conflict with Israel.
Yes true, they are like the great Octopus like the Rolling Stone Article says.  They didn't support him at all during the election.  As far as Mnuchin goes, I feel you need an insider in some capacity but no question there are some concerns.    I know Trump has businesses in SA and I feel that is in part a big reason why he hasn't banned people from SA because the hardcore Wahhabism comes from there.  It is tangled, I gather the US Pentagon sells enormous amounts of weapons to SA.  It really comes down to "the greater project for israel"  We will see where Trump really stands.  Obama and Bush were compliant to a T.  Cause massive unrest and war in the ME, Obama made the USAF essentially the Air Force of ISIS which is really a CIA/Mossad/Saudi op.  Push arabs out of their homelands, flood white Christian secular nations with Islamists while at the same time expand the land dramatically for Israel.  Also the more muslims the more likely jews will leave and return to Israel.  Its biblical
Before this degenerates into a political bickering match the way the thread on the earlier story did, I'm asking all of my fellow Alaskans to pause and recognize that this incident is not about personal political views. This is first and foremost about the victims of this crime. This is about antisemitism that continues to fester in this world and that every single one of us as Alaskans and Americans needs to fully condemn. Instead of arguing about the leadership or lack thereof from Washington, let us all be leaders ourselves by saying to our fellow citizens who are Jewish that this was a crime against them that we will not abide, that their safety and place and equal standing in our communities, state and nation will not be diminished, that regardless of who any of us voted for this is absolutely unacceptable, that we can all agree on this, and that we stand 100% alongside our Jewish friends, neighbors and fellow citizens.  Let's also put our names on it.  David A. James Fairbanks
Lol, you really have no idea what you are talking about, do you? American law is based on Judeo-Christian values.. NOT barbaric sharia law which allows women to be beaten and stoned to death for leaving their house without a chaperone.
3000 homeless poeple in lane county....so lets give the UO $10mil....and lets give  $2 dollers to the homeless jew.....that wants to build a man made island over by hawaii.....for the jews.....and then make the island a 2nd jewish state....with a 100 mile high pyrimd....that will be used as a spaceport .....
Nope, LesterP, the comment "are you taking a class in high school"  when taken in context with calling me a Jewish name "Reuben", is an insult with racial overtones.
Jonah Goldberg needs to remember that being a Jew, his white privilege card is only conditional. I wonder how he would feel about these symbols if they included postcards of Jews hanging from trees that were lynched for looking at white women. The postcards would picture a crowd of smiling white people looking up at the hanging Jew. That did happen about 100 years ago. Would he like to see those cards on sale in Times Square? Would he enjoy showing his relatives how proud he is of the freedoms we have to honor white murderers in America? After all, lynchings are just a cherished part of white heritage and history.  Is he proud to know that white people lynched more than just black people? Back then lynching was considered family entertainment for white people. White people had picnics with their kids under the "strange fruit". Some of those post cards still survive.  That is the America that angry, resentful, white people want back. There has never been a Golden Age of justice for all.
While it may be true that Nazi-occupied French authorities were compelled to cooperate with the Gestapo/SS to deport  many French citizens of jewish heritage to their deaths in Nazi concentration camps, given that: (i) French police and other low-level authorities cooperated with round ups / deportations, sometimes enthusiastically.; and (ii) prior French state officials have already conclusively acknowledged French state complicity, i'm not sure what was the purpose of Ms. Le Pen's comments?   Is French responsibility the same as say German? No. But it is not "0". Its a fine line which prior French governments have already trod and settled. Why revisit in such a ham-fisted and clumsy manner?
"Leaflets will be distributed, with contact information for the Stop Hate Campaign, the city of Eugene’s Human Rights and Neighborhood Involvement Office and local law enforcement" Sound like the brown shirts looking for Jewish. Report your neighbor Comrade.
It would be better if the Church were not engaging in heresy herself-I do not refer to Pope Francis-then she might be more credible. As it is, a Jewish tradition of poring over Torah and discussing tradition (and arguing) is encouraged as it sharpens the mind and stimulates a dialogue that reaches a deeper understanding.    As it is, dissenters in old time were burned alive. John Hus, for example. While we have moved beyond the "Dark Ages" there is precious little to recommend the Church as a beacon of light and hope in those times-although Jesus is and was and always will be, as will the Holy Spirit and all those led by that Spirit-whether they be Catholic or not.    I cannot reconcile the idea that President Diem murdered Buddhists and destroyed their temples in Vietnam while the Church published Humanae Vitae and fussed over angels on the heads of pins. If the Church is going to claim historical pre-eminence in matters religious she has a lot to answer for. Diem was  Catholic.
In the Jewish tradition, the Mourner's Kaddish says nothing about death, it simply reaffirms our faith in God:  May God's great name be exalted and made holy in the world which God created according to his will.  May God's majesty be revealed in the days of our lifetime and the life of all Israel. To which we say "Amen".  Blessed be God's great name forever. Blessed, praised, honored, exalted, extolled, glorified, adored, and lauded be the name of the Holy One, beyond all earthly words and songs of blessing, praise, and comfort. To which we say "Amen".  May there be abundant peace from heaven, and life, for us and all Israel. To which we say "Amen".  May the One who creates peace on high, bring peace to us and to all Israel. To which we say "Amen".
As far as I know, Jalkh never questioned the Holocaust. He ventured an unqualified technical opinion that Zyklon B could not have been the reason why so many Jews were massacred in Nazi concentration camps. His comments on that topic encompassed about 3 minutes out of a three hour interview. They were wrong on technical grounds, and politically stupid in my opinion.   As unwise as his remarks were, it's true that Zyklon B was but one of the methods the Nazis used in their pogrom against Jews and others. I only mention this because details matter in law and politics.  Jalkh was turfed almost immediately by the FN. Fair enough.  Marine Le Pen is not wrong in saying the Government of France isn't responsible for the mistreatment of French Jews during WWII. That responsibility lies with the interim Vichy government, and the individuals who lead it under Nazi direction. The Government of France today does owe a moral duty to it's Jewish citizens, and it seems to take that duty seriously.
"But the first explanation seems much more probable."  Why?  He didn't write his own speech, clearly.  The Nazis targeted the Jews for extinction only because they were Jews.  The Jews were omitted by intent, by Trump's writer.   The pseudo-excuse of "including" the others who died is the classic anti-Jewish denial of reality.
Yeah, that ignorant phrase certainly does lack precision.  And that is why atheists use it : they rely on the public's ignorance.  It does not exist anywhere in the US Constitution.  The 1st Amendment restricts no body of government other than the US Congress - and you know that's true because you even just QUOTED it.
Not so, TomZ: "I'm pretty sure that the trend of legalistic enforcement in Judeo-Christian law over the last 5000 years has been towards more and more lenience."  You rely far too much on your "opinion" and mistake it for fact.  As I mentioned in a previous example, Jesus, as noted in Matthew, is replacing the prevalent religious Mosaic Law (in existence for the 3,000 years in the 5,000 you cite) of the time with a new "law" of Christianity.  Mosaic Law was exceptionally rigid, to say the least.  Recent history is replete with one example after another of laws that are every bit as rigid and dictatorial as what Jesus condemned in His earthly days.  You are no informed student of history to make the comments you do about the past and present state of law in both sacred and secular circles.  It's the constant struggle of the Christian faith to resist oppression and the victimization of the less powerful, the less influential by the majority or by a minority of even one, such as yourself.
"since a lot of Conservatives lump Democrats, Liberals, and Progressives into 'hate groups' who hate God, who hate Jesus, who hate the Bible, who hate Jews, who hate Christians, and who hate the idea that there are Absolute Truths and Absolute Right/Wrongs that exist." And you are the lead cheerleader. You divide the whole of humanity into Good and Evil. And anyone you don't like, or is not Christian, you call Evil.
I am an atheist. I believe in science. Happy Holidays to all!
My thoughts are somewhat divided on these issues. I consider myself a Christian, but I also strongly believe in the separation of Church and State. I also believe there should be no special tax exempt status for religious institutions. I’m not opposed to citizens wearing a crucifix, a head scarf, a turban or a Jewish skull-cap to their place of work. I would draw the line at full face veils and daggers, as reasonable accommodation should have its limits.   Can we all just “get along” in Canada and tone the rhetoric against minorities of every description. I’m a white Christian male and it appears to me that it is this older generation that are the ones who hold the most grudges and animosity against minorities. My children and grandchildren are colour-blind when it comes to accepting minorities and I’m very thankful of that.
I'm not sure what you're getting at. That thing on Good Friday about "the perfidious Jews"? If so, that's a rather separate issue.
François Jourdan, French islamologue et théologien eudiste; “...Islam is very frozen for many centuries and basically lack of freedom - today, it must be said clearly that we cannot build a society of one religion, Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist... or atheist.  This phase of human history is now overtaken by religious freedom and human rights. Secularism requires not the ban but the discretion of all religions in the public space as other citizens have the right to have another way of life. This isn't the Koranic trend where Islam does not consider itself  as other religions and must...DOMINATE !...”
When has mankind not known 'fake news'. Even before the realization that history is written by the victors never by the vanquished have we experienced fake news. In the earliest of times, even prior to recorded history we can be assured 'stories' have been told. Myths and superstitions flourished, sometimes in earnest, but most of all to direct and control thought. Religion might have been the best tool of all conveying fake news. We don't even know who wrote the Jewish Bible, certainly Moses never wrote the Pentateuch. Many knowingly think no such person as Moses even existed. None of this has stopped or even slowed. Today close to half of the people in America take the Bible literally, deny evolution. Yet science has proven there was no Garden of Eden, no Fall, and certainly no such thing as innocent babies born into sin due to the sin of one man. So, you say;  choose to stop fake news. Who might they be; certainly not the traditional Catholic, or evangelicals...who then.
Oy vey! Not another jew trying to tell everyone how (((they))) should keep control. It's almost as if Hitler was right...
Humans have lived in villages for hundreds of thousands of years, more recently they have formed countries. It is only natural for human to live together with their own gene pool. It is so natural that in Toronto you will see many enclaves that do just that, the Italians, the Jews, the Greeks, the Chinese etc. all have their own hoods. - That's why our leaders are so anti-racist, to keep the peace: - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKDeyuM0-Og
For starters Jesus was a Jew. Not onl y a Jew, but the Jew. Yes, the rabbi's, and  moneylenders (bankers) had him run up on false charges, then tortured and executed in one of the worst ways imaginable. While its true Mary and Joseph fled to Egypt to avoid Herod's culling of male babies in Bethlehem, they never intended to stay and sponge off the Egyptian government. Actually, they went back home as soon as the coast was clear. For this reason alone your analogy is loaded with defects. As for the US policies of theft and murder, please explain what we've stolen from Mexico, China, Africa, etc. What wxactly have we stolen from Africa, Europe, Asia, South America, or Australia? Again, the facts, and a little thing called history refute your allegations. It seems you lack the ability to discriminate between a refugee, and someone who wants to relocate for the purpose of grabbing as many goodies as they can get. To the tune of around 135,000,000,000.00 taxpayer dollars annually.
I can't for the life of me understand why right wing groups in the states are anti-semitic, when American and Canadian jews are not responsible for one single death. They don't drive into groups of people nor strap exposives to their body. They are not seen in the streets of Canada and the States, brandishing AK-47s, 74s, AKMs and AKS's, while invoking whatever deity. How can Jews possibly be removed from Judeo-Christian society.  What would we have left - NASCAR, Dixie Beer?
Time for Muslims t get with the program and understand that religion should not be mixed with other institutions, being political, educational, or commercial. You are free to pray for God in a setting that does not offend others, and where you do not give the impression that you have rights other religions do not. What if Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and  decided to pray in schools?
Paid agitators on both sides.  Craigslist Post paying 5K to $25/hr,  a hollywood firm for a crowd.  Cops funneling the right wingers towards the antifa communists.    This is out of saul alinsky's playbook, divide and conquer.  Diamond and Silk, are black, women and conservative and they support Trump! Milo, Gay, Jewish, another Trump supporter.  Trump's own daughter Jewish, Trumps longtime confidant, Cohen, Jewish, Trump's own Son-in-Law, Jewish!  So to think Trump's is a NAZI is absurd and conjecture!  These white Nationalists are no different then La Raza or BLM, they are not all white supremacists.  Perhaps they too are sick of seeing out of control immigration in only White Nations?  On an industrial scale from NGO's and why?  I think Trump and Co. are getting closer and closer to that massive pedo child ring, linking John Podesta and the DNC.  Remember both Bill and Barry went to Epstein island.    Why hasn't the left press covered the biological attack from Antifa, feces urine?
Help me understand..I gather there is a temporary ban for entry to the US from "the Seven Countries" until deeper more thorough vetting is completed. I don't know how many practicing Muslims reside in those 7 countries but imagine it is significant and many will inconvenienced by the delay. There is no ban on residents of other countries coming to the US be they Muslim, Christian, Hindi, etc. So my question is why am I reading headlines in major media print and protest signs that say Muslim Ban is wrong approach by Whitehouse or Muslims Banned - Fight for Muslims! Something is not correct, if there is as they the Protesters say, a ban on Muslims would that not mean all Muslims world wide are banned from coming to the US? Yet I also read that Muslims are travelling to the US from other then the 7 without incident. Isn't more accurate to say Country X citizens of all faith's are banned until vetted?   So help out if you can...these are opposing conclusions, they can't both be right.
Can we please back up the train to sillyville.   I'm an Atheist.  If you were to ask me to support any religion it would be going against my belief.  Are there laws of this land already in place to cover the horrific act of murder?  Yes there sure is.  Lets let our laws deal with the situation.  All the Liberals can hold hands on the front lawn of the Parliament buildings and sing Kumbaya for all I care if they want to get votes.  That's all this is about.
One thing you said was correct.  The victims are indeed overlooked.  Such as the murders of five Muslims while praying in their Masjid in Montreal.  And overlooking that by all indications this is the work of white supremacist and/or neo-Nazi types (several of whom comment on these pages).  Similarly, the Muslims who who have come forward in solidarity, and raised funds to help restore the damage to Jewish grave sites are overlooked by those--also posting in here--who have falsely accused us of this despicable campaign.  Destruction of synagogues is expressly prohibited in Qur'an.
Does Orthodox Judaism provide for ventilators and feeding tubes?  If not, do they really want these devices used to prolong the semblance of life?  Take them away and the poor chap will soon meet their criteria of dead.  .
The point is not about who is more racist. The point is whose racism affects people more. A black person living in a ghetto could be racist, but that doesn't affect a lot of people. But a white manager hiring hundreds of people can hurt many people through racism.  Therefore, European discrimination has had a far stronger effect on world history, than Asian or African racism. If you look at anti-semitism, Europe has had it for two thousand years, culminating in you-know-what in the 1940s. Whereas the Jews were far better treated in the Middle East or India.
Traini is lying about it being about the homeless spice and pot smokers,   he's a Mormon and he's always trying to take smokers rights away.
Jerusalem was an ancient Canaanite town, neither built nor named by Hebrews, but conquered, sacked and then abandoned by them. The “City of David” was not settled until the 10th century BCE. Throughout this time, Palestine has been populated by Palestinians of various cultic persuasions.  Jerusalem highlights the tragedy of the dysfunctional family of Abraham, Jews, Christians and Muslims. The two-state solution is organic. The one-state alternative promotes Jewish Zionism, exemplifies American imperialism and disregards the Palestinian presence. It is neither just nor logical.  The word palestinian means “a migratory person.” Israel means “he will be prince with God.”  Ishmael means “he who will hear God.” Palestine is not about a name nor a way of living. Palestine is about living  and journeying together, organically not alternatively.
Mainstream Media reporters are ignorant of Christianity, and Judaism, because their Master strives to remove Christianity and Judaism from American life.  Accordingly, the religions are seldom mentioned in the media, except in reports of lawsuits by atheists, claiming denial of rights.   However, their Master takes an entirely different approach to reporting of Islam.  Islam is glorified, although its doctrines are never discussed.   It is considered "Islamophobic" to even mention the doctrine of "death to infidels", and accordingly, there is no mention, even if the Ayatollah shouts it.   The Muslim World, however, takes the doctrine very seriously.  The two major branches of Islam, the Sunnis and the Shia, each consider the other to be "infidels", and they have been killing each other for centuries, for that reason.  They still are, today, and of course, they are killing non-Muslim "infidels', as well.
"Thousands packed into the pews — Christians, Jews and Muslims — in a show of solidarity and support and in repudiation of a message of violence, divisiveness and hatred. . . But each of these townspeople, whatever their faith, or absence of faith, with their actions lit a candle against the darkness that had come to their town."  The bottom line, if we are ever to defeat and move past terrorism and hate. Good editorial.
And yet Christian do not follow Jewish food laws, or have to get circumcised. Why is that?
Reality: 1. Those Jews who comprised 15% of Palestine's population where mostly immigrants from Poland and Russia who had arrived after 1905 .  Re peace proposals: In 1988, the PLO recognized Israel as a sovereign state within the borders of the 1947 recommendatory only UNGA Partition Plan, Res. 181 (which, for the record, violated the terms of the Class A British Mandate for Palestine and the Atlantic Charter, was never adopted by the UNSC and was grossly unfair to the indigenous Palestinian Arab inhabitants.)   By signing the 1993 Oslo Accords, the PLO accepted UNSC Res. 242 and thereby agreed to recognize a sovereign Israel within the 1949 armistice lines, i.e., as of 4 June 1967 – 78% of mandate Palestine.  cont'd
Ward1 in Springfield: I don't think there is any evidence that the recent threats made nationwide against Jewish institutions originated in Eugene or even in this country.
I have heard Ashkenaziim do so.  Repeatedly.  Sometimes directed at me as personal insult, characterizing me as descended from a 'bastard' despite passage of 4,000 years and despite the Torah's unequivocal recognition and acceptance of polygyny as "hilel" = "halal" = lawful.  My son's Australian father-in-law likewise resents disparagement by POME (Prisoners of Mother England) after two centuries for being descended from "convicts".  You apparently overlook Esa'u marriage to his paternal uncle Ismael's daughter (a fairly common practice in many regions of the world from that time to this), which means there are at LEAST as many Arabs descended from Is'haaq, and therefore Abraham + Sarah (alayhimus-Salaam) as there are Jews.  But in light of your fairly unbiased characterization of this ancient (and ongoing) tale of jealousy between wives, I'll offer you details preserved among the Arabs which may have been forgotten by our Jewish cousins.  It's not complicated:  (CONTINUED BELOW...)
That's why the Jewish Lawyer's religion is money. For 30 pieces of Silver, you can get a jewish lawyer to invent a new religion, any day of the week!   The Alaska Bar Association's Training Camp; shown at the Fairbanks Four Trial, hang up the innocent, and let the guilty go free. Can't pass law school, apply with the Alaska AG's Office.  "Jesus is brought before Annas and Caiaphas and questioned, with intermittent beatings. Afterward, the other priests (Caiaphas does not accompany them) take Jesus to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, and insist upon Jesus' execution. Pilate tells the priests to judge Jesus themselves, to which they respond they lack authority to do so. Pilate questions Jesus, after which he states, "I find no basis for a charge against him." Pilate then offers the gathered crowd the choice of one prisoner to release — said to be a Passover tradition — and they choose a criminal named Barabbas instead of Jesus." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caiaphas
Given the alt-left's visceral hatred for Israel and its BDS (boycott, divestment and sanctions) campaign against Israel, it is more likely that the blame rests with the so-called 'anti-Zionists'.. The alt left's voluminous skirt of "anti-Zionism" has been providing a convenient hiding place for anti-Jewish bigots for a very long time. When the perpetrators of these vile acts are found, the news will probably be greeted with deafening silence from the political left and its allies.
As I keep saying, the Apostles were all Jews, therefore gentiles cannot be ordained. It is precisely the same argument as "the Apostles were all men" one.
Progressive111, where have you been? I've always been aware of Jews during my school years as they took off for the High Holidays. And the school always accommodated them. I've known a few Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists, but not well enough to know how they'd need to be accommodated. As for Evangelical Christians? What on earth do you mean? Sundays are holidays. So are Christmas and Easter. Holidays, as in HOLY DAYS. And our local school celebrates "Orange & Black Day" instead of Halloween because fundamentalist Christians equate it with Satanism
Wow... You're the one with reading comprehension problems. I was praising these fine people for their good works and I agree with them.Every religion has it's share of extremists. I wouldn't categorize these nice people as extremists. Atheists have extremists in their ranks too. They have historically been called communists. I didn't bring up Trump. You did but I don't think he's a very trustworthy person. I didn't vote for him and I'll be very happy when his term is over.
Re: para 2 & 3 - Palestine did not "belong" solely to the Arabs, as there have been Jews living there without interruption for 3,000 years.  The idea that the Palestinian Arabs are the indigenous people of Palestine is, quite simply, false.  Your argument fails completely when you consider partition as a plan for the situation in the Middle East as a whole, as Jews had ancient populations in Libya, Tunisia, Alegeria, Iraq, Iran, Syria, etc., that predated the Muslim conquest. Re para 4 - The point is the hypocrisy of the Muslim world  in advocating for the larger, bloodier, more disruptive partition to accommodate their aspirations, but reject the same policy for the Middle East. Re para 5 - Europeans like to view that they are at the centre of history, and the view that Israel = European colonialism is an expression of this conceit....tell that to the 6 or 700,000 Jews who found refuge in Israel from Libya, Algeria, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Iran.  Europe doesn't own Jewish history.
Well, Mr. Minshall, you are just one man. Are you saying then that all Jews committed war crimes then? Did I say you committed war crimes or did I say our nation committed war crimes?  In 1948, Israel was attacked. How you think otherwise is beyond all logic. Then you talked about Semitic people living in Israel since the dawn of time. You know well as I do that it is not ethnic differences that is creating the havoc today but religious difference. Palestinian Jews and Arabs are divided by faith, not race. So it really don't matter who was there first. But we do know that the Jewish nation has been there far longer then a Islamic state.....actually that part of the world never been a state of any kind once the Jewish kingdom was destroyed by the Roman Empire....until 1948. Then the Arabs decided to  exterminated it and failed. Because they failed, you are whining over the petty notations.
Gad what an admixture of myth and absolute bunkum.  "...a few bands of Christian women kind of kept the Roman Empire at bay."  This "in keeping with Catholic theology"?  Somewhere million of disenfranchised Catholic women are laughing out loud.  "A planet that hates humans and a God that has broken his covenant with the Jews."  So Gaia and God got together and pulled the plug?  I can only hope that when you post you are high on something, the alternative that you actually hold these beliefs is too sad to contemplate.
"Ms. Freeland’s family history has become a target for Russian forces seeking to discredit one of Canada’s highly placed defenders of Ukraine." ==  Robert, what is YOUR evidence that "Ms. Freeland's family history has become a target for Russian forces seeking to discredit one of Canada's highly placed defenders of Ukraine"? Is it that any source of news that states an accurate description of Ms. Freeland's family history must, a priori, be a "Russian force"?    Here's the first sentence of your very own article:  "Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland knew for more than two decades that her maternal Ukrainian grandfather was the chief editor of a Nazi newspaper in occupied Poland that vilified Jews during the Second World War."  Are you, too, one of Putin's puppets, Mr. Fife?    Websites that publish the truth are to be honoured, not vilified, regardless of their origin.  Ditch the anti-Russian propaganda and you'll have something approaching the truth of the matter.
Am I missing something? Because your link leads to an article that refutes the claim that Soros helped round up Jews during the Holocaust, and that he was a Nazi.  Did you call Soros a Nazi in order to make fun of the (usually right-wing) people who sling mud at "leftist globalists"? If so, I'm sorry. The sarcasm didn't make it through the internets.
You wrote: "As for the Baha'i, they got in trouble with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary government for having sided with the Shah. Understandable. Shah Pah'lavi via his murderous Savak secret police murdered 1.3 million Iranians during his 26 year, US-sponsored reign of terror. Actions (and alliances) have consequences. Next question" - - - - - - - -  So my 'next question' is: How is this different than what any Nazi would say about the Jews? You have just justified what the murderous Khomeini regime did do a powerless minority within its domain. The Nazis accused the Jews of being 'at war' with the German State and causing its defeat in WWI. You have just done the same thing with the Baha'i (instead of Jews, although you don't appear to hold Jews in much higher regard).
What a weird thing to write. If I'm understanding this, JH is saying that Jews should be celebrating that somehow millions of people they knew and loved did NOT die because the holocaust did not happen, so somehow all these people lived and were accessible? Or is JH trying to say that millions of people DID die, just that they all died ACCIDENTALLY? This is ludicrous. I'm not going nuts with anger because the proposition is already nuts, and it is only necessary to point it out. As for freedom of expression, what was that country in the 1930s that had publicized book burnings but made sure that every newly married couple got a free copy of Mein Kampt? There is your 'official' narrative! This led to a big war you may have heard of.
"by Amy Hart: Utopian communities or communes enjoy a long, diverse tenure in the United States. From isolationist and anti-technology Christian communities like the Shakers and Hutterites to primarily economic-equality-focused utopias like Oneida and Brook Farm, communes have existed and even thrived in the United States for centuries ... The social and political events of the late 1950s and ‘60s produced the ideal environment for the rise of new religious movements, and out of them, new religious communities.  Until this period, most religious communities shared at least some link with the Judeo-Christian tradition, but the new communes of the 1960s adopted the emerging religions of the East as well as the “New Age” spirituality made popular during this time." Certainly constitutional, but the neighborhood folks can feel uncomfortable with things that they aren't familiar with. Get to know them, mingle, put your apprehensions to rest. They're normal people and they don't bite.
Socialist Mitterand claimed the same. In fact, he was part of the Vichy administration and joined the Resistance in 1943 when it had become obvious that Germany was going to lose.   It wasn't until Chirac that a French leader publicly acknowledged the complicity of the French authorities in rounding up Jews. French police, in their zeal, even rounded up the children that the Gestapo had not asked for.
If you review the authors' performances as senior Liberal Cabinet members you will find that they never spoke out publicly about many of the "ethnic cleansings" which took place while they were in political office, such as the cleansing of most Christians and Jews from all countries in the Middle East with the exception, of course, of Israel.  And yet they were no friends of Israel.  Why, then, are they now proclaiming their self-righteousness and condemning Canadians for doing nothing about the Rohingya?
Malumba,  The question is whether the atheist is making a scientific claim for the non-existence of God/gods or merely stating their opinion.  If it's their opinion, it's a matter of faith or belief that God/gods don't exist, sometimes predicated on a scientifically based argument such as the one you propose here.  That's fine but it makes their position no more valid than the religious claim.  You use the scientific method only so far as it is convenient for you here, however.  Just because we cannot confirm the existence of God/gods does not mean He/they don't exist, nor would science make such a claim.  Science hypothesized the existence of the atom and quarks before we could discern their imprint on reality.  So, despite having no meaningful sense in which they can be said to exist, science did not deny their existence, it simply did not confirm it.  So too, with God/gods.  Not being able to materially discern the existence of God/gods doesn't negate God/gods, except to atheists.
Patricia forgets all about WWII and who one and who lost. Wars have consequences. Not to mention Patricia's hatred of Jewish people.
I haven't noticed that, but I have noticed that the standard response is to somehow try to invoke antisemitism whenever M 103 is mentioned.  You do realize that jews are not muslims?
I don't quite think you got it. I'm not saying your thinking is wrong, there are people like you describe (religious atheists) but atheism is just the lack of belief in theism.   Theists believe that the cosmos is the result of a deity who is actively involved in its creation. An atheist is someone who doesn't believe SPECIFIC theist's claims. When a theist says "God parted the Red Sea" an atheist, by default, will say "Maybe, but I don't see any evidence for it." Atheists are people who have dismissed ALL theistic claims in this way.  The key thing is that on both sides of the fence you have gnostics (with a 'G') and agnostics. In this context being a gnostic doesn't mean Gnosticism, it simply refers to your belief about what we can know. A gnostic theist will claim they KNOW there is a deity, and a gnostic atheist will say they KNOW there isn't. Most people are actually agnostic: they can't say they KNOW (hey, it take's faith!) but they choose what they think is more likely.
So should we hold our breath for the regular columns from the Catholics, Jews and Buddhists too? Right, I thought not.
True.  Very true.  The Declaration did, though.  That one came first.  It's one of the two founding documents.  Which of course you already know.  You also already know that our nation was founded on Judeo-Christian values.  I know you probably don't like it, but you do know it to be true no matter how hard you argue that it was not.
Was the GOOD SAMARITAN a Jew? a government employee (Priest) ? No, the good Samaritan was a private citizen.  Jesus expected charity to come from the PRIVATE SECTOR.  Government programs collect taxes at the point of a gun.  You must be a government bureaucrat.
Civil Comments has much bigger fish to fry than NCR.  NPR, for example, would be a potential client.  "Blocking" has proven to lead to exactly what it led to at NCR:  - conversion of a public discussion group into a platform for multiple private conversations  - a collapse of civil discourse  - a tendency to speak of the "blocked" in the third person  - in this instance an effective banning of Catholics and an influx not of progressive Catholics but of agnostics, atheists, "Mahayana" theologists, and so on right out to anti-Catholics.  Civil Comments is a business. There is no money in replicating Disqus' mistakes.  National Catholic Reporter is trying to present as an alternative Catholic media, there is no advantage to having its public face present a motley crew of opponents of Catholicism.  I would happy to provide examples from the Disqus archives.  Yes, "we had really thoughtful discussions" ... synoptic, few participants, and outright hostility towards contrary opinions.
Why don't you go remove some grave markers yourself?  If I see you, I'm calling 911.  This  desecration of grave stones is reminds me   of people who vandalize  Jewish graves and has NO  place in America. Re-naming a public highway is not the same as  desecrating a "private" cemetery. How misinformed can one even  be  to confuse   the two?  More than a little....
Jack,  I see Jesus in everyone. The homeless drug addict and the Billionaire President. We all were created in His image. He took on the form of a poor Jewish Carpenter's son and yet  He's the God of the Universe. Lord of Heaven and earth.  He is wealthy far  beyond our comprehension of wealth.  His streets are paved with pure gold.  The fact that  He humbled Himself and took  on the form of a lowly  servant, giving  His life to save  us from sin and death.  Not just saving some, but  all of us  un-deserving sinners who put faith in Him, shows just  how much He loves all of us.  Love does not enable sin. It forgives sin while expecting better of us.
though I am not a supporter of the settlements I still think Obama did this as a last slap to Israel and the PM.  Obamas attempt at smooching with other middle east countries was a failure. They still hate POTUS and everything western democracy and Christianity/Judaism stand for. I am not surprised  by Obamas feelings. His arrogance and lack of knowledge of foreign affairs was laughable. He is seen  as a weakling/coward on the world stage (Russia/Ukraine/Syria etc). He should read about 1929 Hebron massacre, WW2 and the Nazi/Arab coalition. He might understand things a bit better. He blames Israel for all the problems of the middle east. This was predictable 8 years ago. He supported a racist church minister too. Some president.
Please post information concerning the system of faith and worship which an atheist is required to follow.
Because there is so much misinformation about the nature of atheism.  I really don't care if a person is an atheist or not.  I do care when atheism is misrepresented.
There were probably millions of Germans who opposed the holocaust. But only one Schindler. That's not because Schindler was great. It's because he was a wealthy industrialist before the war who could pass for a loyal Nazi. He could save lives because of things utterly unrelated to that: his career path chosen decades earlier and his rich parents.   Are the others less great? No. They did something no less impressive. They Rebuilt Germany in the aftermath as one of the freest and most equal societies on earth!   Meantime two Polish doctors in a small town made a small scientific discovery (how to make a Typhus test give a false positive result) and saved at least 8 times as many lives as Schindler by faking a Typhus epidemic. The Germans were petrified of Typhus being far more susceptible to it than Poles and that fake outbreak made them quarantine the entire town saving the lives of every Pole and Jew who lived there.  And I bet you do not know their names.
Yes, I was. My point is that studyin under Protestant religion teachers can be useful for Catholics. The worst religion teacher I had was a Catholic.   One of the best teachers in any subject I ever had was an atheist Marxist. He insisted that we question everything, including what he was telling us.
Haven't you heard of the God of Atheism?  His worshippers attend The Church of the Fake God.   Squiggly worships there.  It's about a block from where you live.
Saudi Arabia ,Bahrain , Kuwait , Qatar and Oman have not taken any Refugees - they call them Terrorists!  Refugees coming to Canada should be prepared to return home when hostilities cease . Refugees from the middle east that follow Islam will never integrate into our Judeo/Christian society  and therefor would be happier with their own kind . One should look at Europe if you have any doubt .
I too oppose  Israel's settlement policies because they  complicate any possible peace agreement.   But demonstrations that call for the destruction of Israel only play into the hands of Israel's hard liners.    Ms. Khan has it right--  kindness is the best weapon against extremism. And just as we must extend those acts to the Muslim community, so too must the Muslims community extend those acts to the West,  including the Jews, by not denying the Holocaust, as is commonly done in the Middle East,  and which was largely the rationale  for the foundation of the State of Israel.  It is not kind to call for the destruction if the State of Israel.
Right. So did the Jews kill 6 million innocent Germans (in support of your "everyone did it " theory)? Did the Natives in North America commit genocide against the Europeans?  There are parties that are a lot more guilty than others. Accept that.
" they recognize (judged) that a woman's decision-making or, say, a Jewish person's decision-making will likely be different" from what they approve of", sounds pretty much like "hatred and unacceptance" based on gender and religious affilliation. Are Jewish persons "people of color"?  These "white men" you speak of seem to have very limited experience of anyone other than themselves.
In regard to the WW review of the Glenn Beck article on Portland as the #1 place to avoid... As usual, Willamette Weekly is incapable of journalistic maturity due to the noise of their own existential beating drum. You've completely missed the point of the poll which identifies Portland, OR as having the highest population of religiously unaffiliated persons per capita. If WW were less interested in their own flag waving and more in tune with correspondent reality, you might have gotten this right. It's not that people in Portland are more "fallen" than any other city in the country. That is not possible so please, curb your enthusiasm for being the top denizen of iniquity in the atheist's list of who's-who in the country.  The bottom line is that this city has a population that is uniquely ready to receive the good news of salvation made uniquely and exclusively possible in and through Jesus Christ.  I understand this is a liberal journal, but stop the Nietzsche-loving flaptrap.
I am a long-time NDP voter - federally and provincially.  But as a scientist and atheist I can't deny feeling uncomfortable about his overt non-secularism.   Identifying so strongly with one ethnic and religious group makes everyone else "the other".
Jesus NEVER, NEVER referred to himself as a Priest!  He was NOT born of the Tribe of Levi, nor was he of the House of Aaron.  He was of the Tribe of Judah, and of the house of David.   During Advent we hear this over and over, and certainly during Holy Week---Jesus is a King.  The writer of the Letter to the Hebrews [and it was NOT Paul who wrote this], was trying to point out to the Jewish people who would read this, that Jesus was superior to Moses and to the high priests---because he was the "Faithful Son" [Hebrews 3:1-6].  Those people selected as presbyters in the very early days of Christianity [selected and voted upon by the people], were just as capable of celebrating THE MEAL [as the Mass was called in the very early days], and acting in 'persona Christi' as any ordained priest today.  Jesus told us, 'where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in their midst."  And he didn't mean this only if an ordained priest was there.
"panhandling is a job - sort of"    Well of course it's a job!  It has existed for millennia.    Buddha, Diogenes, Catholic monks are just some of those who have engaged in the practice.  Some religions hold that this is the only way their devout adherents should support themselves.  Hinduism, Sufi Islam, Buddhism, and Jainism come to mind.
Something you fail to take into account. The powers that be had ZERO interest in keeping records of a "False prophet" of a Man claiming to be the son of God was not something Jewish leaders wanted around as it would have cost them their political power. Rome had no interest as it too would fall from Powerful Pagan leaders to that of Christian ones.  So of course there are few if any records Then there are those lost to time or fires. So expecting a historic record from 2000 years ago to just pop up ain't happening.
Many studies have shown that these folks have extremely high disposable income.  If such a study brings in additional dollars to our state and lowers our taxes, we should welcome it unless, of course, you want to keep out certain "undesirable" elements like Arabs, Jews, African-Americans, etc. and any other group that you are personally offended by.  In that case, you might be happier living in Mississippi or Alabama.
Time for a little education Mr Racist  1)The economy of this country is white; this group of mainly Afrikaner men control almost all the levers of our economy  What utter bull manure SA's 16 top richest people : 3 are Afrikaners, 2 are black 1 is Italian, 8 Are Jewish and 2 are English South Africans. 2)  Of the R5.8-trillion private property (excludes agrarian and commercial land) value in South Africa, blacks own township or RDP style properties. Statistics SA proves your cliams to be a lie  Africans now own about 52% of the land that households claim to own if measured by size of the property. The majority of first owned properties is African owned. Regarding second brick dwellings 94.2% of second properties are owned by Africans,  3) that receive mammoth discounts on their power  For 22 years black people have run Eskom so who's fault is this???  You sir are clearly spewing rubbish in order to create racial tensions within SA to deflect attention from your parties corruption.
James,  How do you suggest responding to those who exploit these acts for political gain?  The reason I ask, as despicable as this is, this is what we are faced with:  "Trump suggests that anti-Semitic bomb threats, vandalism might be a conspiracy to make him look bad  Donald Trump was asked today about the continued bomb threats at Jewish community centers and vandalism at Jewish cemeteries in America. Trump took the opportunity to wonder if maybe Jewish Americans were doing it to themselves to make Trump supporters look bad."   What response should that kind of exploitation earn?  You mentioned our 'leaders' may not stand up for the victims.  You couldn't have been more correct.  Instead of standing up for the victims, Trump attempts to climb on their backs and make it about him.  And that's not to mention his 'supporters' attempts to steer this issue into a form of support for their anti-Muslim campaign.
Wow, Jeff, that's quite the conspiracy theory there! Welfare moms are the ones who REALLY control America...and SNAP (food stamps) is part of secret plot to organize them to function as a drone army...LoL! Where are the Jews in this whole thing?? No. Seriously - you're talking about corporate welfare right?? Cause I'm very close to muting you out...dude c'mon.
"In the case of Ukraine, one must remember that Ukrainians' memories, in 1939, of the rule from Moscow included the Soviet genocide against Ukrainians in 1932-33 in which millions of Ukrainians were intentionally starved to death.  Based on that experience, the Germans probably looked less dangerous than the Soviets."  ergo   this collaboration aided and abetted the genocide of Jews in  Europe  .
As an atheist, do I get more?  I would suggest that the decline in membership in labor unions can be directly tied to the fall in income for working people.  Unions are a counter balance to the inherent greed of capitalism.  Post WWII union membership grew to record numbers.  Income of union workers set records.  All workers benefited from the inroads made by organized labor.  Reagan's all out attack on workers was the turning point in the road that brought us to where we are today.  All of the well turned phrases and good intentions of Iconic leaders will not replace the work needed to get workers back to a place in which they have enough clout to stand together and get their fair share.
Good grief! You have turned them all into atheists. What ever happened to "Separater Brothers"? (They didn't say: "Sisters" then in the days of Vatican II)
Seriously dude. Because something is true today, you assume it was also true in 1948  ? Right, because history is a static thing, time doesn't pass and nothing changes. Because today Jewish people are well represented in the upper echelons of government and business you assume this was true at the end of world war 2 as well (it wasn't, not even a little). America was so anti-Semitic even during world war 2 that they turned the vast majority of Jewish refugees, asylum seekers and people fleeing the holocaust away. Anne Frank would have survived if not that her asylum request was rejected !  But there was a LOT more than the deathtol involved. There was the slavery, subjugation, stripping of property, denial of work, forced relocations,violent oppression, extraction of wealth - all things the holocaust and colonialism had in common.   A simplistic "which killed more" comparison is silly and colonialism wins anyway with well over a billion deaths.
The same arguments could be used to justify requiring Jewish children to attend Hitler school or their parents to drive down Goebbels' Hwy?   These artifacts were not placed in the aftermath of 1865 to mourn the horrors of fratricidal war. Most appeared nearly a century later during the civil rights movement as  prominent reminders/warnings to African Americans that there were still those who considered them subhuman.  There are monuments to erect  that would mourn  the people enslaved and the young who were conscripted and sacrificed.  There is no "honouring"  the defenders of enslavement.   .
Atheism makes the claim that God/gods doesn't don't exist.  When you make a claim, it must be supported by facts or it is nothing more than a belief.  If atheism has no proof, it follows suit that it is nothing more than a belief system, just like any other faith.  If that's the case, I agree with you.  But if you insist the atheist claim is true, support it with facts.  If you can't, the claim is either untrue, or simply a belief.
The inexhaustible richness of this sacrament is expressed in the different names we give it.. It is called...the Breaking of Bread because Jesus used this rite, part of a Jewish meal, when as master of the table he blessed and distributed the bread, above all at the Last Supper (Catholic Church #1328 -1332)  Melchizedek was king of Salem and a priest of El Elyon, "God most High." The order of Melchizedek refers more to his act of "eucharistein," thanksgiving,  and the exchange of tithes between Abram and him. There is no mention of sacrifice.  In Hebrews 10:14-18, we read that "First [Jesus] says, 'Sacrifices and offerings, holocaust and sin offerings, you neither desired nor delighted in ..For by one offering he has made perfect forever those who are being consecrated ...Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer offering for sin."  I suspect that God prefers the breaking of bread to the spilling of blood.
Meyer the Jew and Joey Bananas? What's different from them and 'Doc 'and 'Sudsy' looking for 'jinoteras' at Ancon del Mar? If you have money to  pay, there arc still 'Cubanas y Cubanos' who'll play,. Eh?   We sponsor them to become 'loving' new Canadians all the time.
You're very right, about both the need for solidarity with the Jewish community and the need for a constructive way to win over those on the right with morals. When I first read your post I had a knee-jerk response against what I falsely saw as a "thoughts and prayers and no more required" approach, and I was wrong. The problem for me is that the president and congress get to take the moral high ground by condemning atrocities, but are never made to acknowledge their role in enabling hateful actions, and any attempt to do so is viewed as partisan bickering. I unfortunately feel that unless a news story comes from the FBI on either someone on trumps team orchestrating this, or the russian blackmail file, the see no evil mood will prevail on the right.
Was thinking of the Jews recently found in unmarked graves consigned to a ghetto by Urban VIII. Malnourished, poor hygiene-a precursor of the camps. Any triumphalist view of the church lacks integrity.             Love Pope Francis and could wish more Catholics had listened to him before voting for the current elected public official presiding as President of the US of A.             I was once an existentialist, enthused with the view Jean Paul Sartre had of freedom and responsibility. I am still an existentialist, but of another kind.              To be in good faith is an article of faith almost, in the Existentialist credo. One can't defer to "authority" and so abdicate responsibility for one's choices. This an axiom, a universal truth. Here is where the appeal to Tradition as a means of avoiding responsibility for choices made in freedom is inauthentic. If your choices validate tradition it may be, again, of another kind. (posted with another account.)
The Constitution arises from an English legal tradition aimed at disestablishing residue of Abrahamic laws and legal fictions.  None of the Framers were Catholic or Jewish, yet the SCOTUS is now 6/9 Catholic and 3/9 Jewish.  North of Mason-Dixon, especially in the Delaware Valley, these religions were seen as abusive. Abraham's torture of the child Issac.  Imposing a legal fiction of "virgin birth" on infants.     Here in Colorado, decades before the 19th Amendment of the US Constitution, the popular vote of men constitutionalized a prohibition on discrimination in women voting because of Catholic and Mormon religious immigration (both these religions have laws prohibiting women from voting).  If you want to be Catholic why not stay in a Catholic country (or return to one)?   Virtually all of Latin America is available. Also, Ireland, Poland, Italy, Spain.  If you want to be Jewish why not return to Israel?
Where to begin?  The Seder was/is a family feast.  No family is complete without its women members.  The feast was/is prepared by women and the aftermath of the feast was/is cleaned up by the women (although in some families a few men graciously help).  Jesus, Who was Himself a layman, instituted no priesthood.  There was already an active Jewish priesthood.  Had He wanted to be a priest He would have incarnated into the priestly tribe.  Our current iteration of priesthood owes as much to Roman administrative concepts as it does to Jewish  beliefs, and Jesus, as we all know, was a faithful Jew.  Apostles are messengers, in this case messengers of the Good News.  Mary Magdalene bears the title Apostle to the Apostles.  What does seem abundantly clear is that the all male priesthood we know is stultifying (deservedly) from the inside because it lacks the wisdom and strength of half of God's children.
The Jews in Germany were secular. And then see what happened.
A politician who wears a particular irrational ; religious' belief on his sleeve for all to see, is a bad choice.  He has to represent all, including atheists and other rational people. Religion and faith based nonsense is best left at home, for your own time, not as a representative of all constituents and on canadian taxpayers time!
This is an interesting story that proves that sometimes people just don't like living next to a religious institution, even when it is an institution that represents their own religion:  http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/despite-residents-opposition-cote-st-luc-council-approves-synagogue  Cote St Luc is a suburb of Montreal whose population is close to 60% jewish. After the city council approved a zoning change to allow construction of a new synagogue, the residents acquired the necessary number of signatures required to call for a referendum to block it, after already having submitted a 70 signature petition to ask that the project be halted.  http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/proposed-new-shul-divides-largely-jewish-cote-st-luc  The mayor, understanding that the "no synagogue in my backyard" side would win the referendum, has decided to rescind permission to build a synagogue in that location and is helping the synagogue to find another location.  continued....
"Islam, Judaism and Christianity are same religions".? Try keeping up with the news. Jews and Christians aren't  murdering innocent people  in the name of their faith or their God.
Good point that is kinda silly on my part.  The story goes that Sisi was born to a Moroccan Jewish mother, his maternal uncle was a member of David Ben Gurion's political party.     Who knows for sure I don't.....but his appointment was convenient for Israel that is for sure.
"They don't want a Catholic cemetery there, they don't want a Jewish cemetery there, they don't want a Chinese cemetery there, and they don''t want a Muslim cemetery there. What's so hard to understand about that? "  What's so hard to understand is why you make that claim with no evidence one way or the other.
Then those 'atheists' have arrived at their belief system a negative way: they're recoiling from a belief that someone else has. Atheism is more than a negative response to other beliefs. Atheism has a structure that stands on its own. Otherwise it would hardly be worth bothering with.
JP Beaudet2,   I once met a lawyer I wanted to obtain justice for me in a court of law. He threatened to rip my lungs out. Presumably he meant in this world. Needless to say, he failed to take my case. Generous atheism would be fine with me. Rational humanism is good as well, Secular liberalism would be good. Democracy, including justice for all, would be best.
And that's where we part ways.  You just did what the president did.  There were facists at Charlottesville and they were chanting "the Jews will not replace us." True conservatives like Sen Hatch saw that and didn't straddle the fence just like you just did. He recalled his father's death WWII, lamented how he was determined not to have his father die for nothing and called out the wrong and evil SIDE in Charlottesville. That was it.  Period.  He is a true conservative not trying to win conversations and play politics with evil.  He said nothing close to the "many sides" or tried to equate those good "well behaved" Nazies with people like his father who died in WWII.  You just dug in your heels, made my point and added more fuel to the fire refusing to add an unconditional voice of peace and love to obvious hate and evil.  True conservative and liberals agree and would never straddle a fence so clearly evil.
Jesus, Moses, and Solomon were Jews; Cleopatra a Greek - all look white to me.
"WH: No mention of Jews on Holocaust Remembrance Day because others were killed too"  http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/white-house-holocaust-memorial-day/index.html
"Carnac the Magnificent"  of Johnny Carson fame speaks!  With an anti-Semitic and bigoted tongue, of course!  Trump would be the first National politician since 1950 or so not to 'care' what American Jews think!
Jews, homosexuals, blacks, and other minorities are not treated humanely and equitably by the government of Palestine. https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/palestine-state-of/report-palestine-state-of/  If Palestine were declared an independent state today, it would be every bit as much of an apartheid state as Israel.  Likewise, the Arab League is made up almost entirely of apartheid states.
It's a Canaanite city where Jews, Christians and Muslims have all lived.
India had a woman Prime Minister much before Canada thought about it. The President of India's largest political party is a woman, born in Italy, Catholic (in Hindu dominent India). Imagine Canada gets a Prime Minister, who is Muslim, Woman, Black and not born in Canada. Tell me who needs to learn from whom about diversity and tolerance.
As Sherman David says, the palestinians could have had a state in 1936 (Peel Commission, 1948 (UN Partition Plan), 2000 (Camp David), 2008 (Olmert Peace Plan), any many an occasion in between.    They pay the price for their continued rejectionism or their outright desire for genocide against the Jews (see the Hamas Charter, or go back to the Grand Mufti al Husseini's alliance with Hitler).  If the palestinians ever change, they won't be "oppressed by bureaucracy".
Interesting.  Taught by Catholic nuns early on, but she's Jewish.  Maybe Feinstein is too Jewish to be a Senator.   Maybe she has anger issues against Catholics because she's a Jew?  Will the press ask that question?  Will NCR?
I've been told there are two schools of thought about where the color "Roman purple" for cardinals came from:  1.  John's Gospel:  "The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns, put it on His head, and dressed Him in a purple robe.  And they went up to Him again and again, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and slapping Him in the face.…"  Purple being "royal" in the Roman color scheme.  2.  The cardinal's Roman purple robes [actually a scarlet red] are a reminder to the cardinal that he is sworn to shed his blood for the papacy.  Actually, I just think they like wearing bright colors to distinguish themselves from the hoi polloi.  It's a clerical thing ...
...like when the Jews were disarmed by their professional military?
#1. YOU don't know who I voted for. It is dangerous to make assumptions. #2. I am not the "defender of all things clerical, conservative, et al." - again making assumptions. My so-called defense consists of requiring proof in the face of the onslaught of false/unproven accusations. That there seems to be a plethora of those remarks sadly speaks to the sheer volume of comments filled with falsity, hatred, and purposeful misdirection that need to be addressed. #3. Be very careful of statements like "Catholics like you" - you only show your own hatred, bias, misunderstanding. I hope your conversion to Judaism helps you with what you need to unlearn.
His actions are inconsistent with Christianity. If a Muslim, Hindu, Jew or whatever acts in a way that's inconsistent with their religion I will call that out also.
The thing is most of those "overpaid white males" are actually Jews. Once you account for that there is no over-representation of white professors.
How about considering the position, not of the 'atheist', a term the writer appears to use with a grimace on his righteous face, but of the 'anti-theist': the enemy of all religion? As the late great Christopher Hitchens (no he did not recant on his deathbed, as so many Christians claimed he did) subtitled his excellent book, "God in NOT Great" - 'How religion poisons everything'.
@Neighbor That's from the Hebrew bible (the OT). Doesn't mean much to today's Christian unless A) You are also a very strict Jew, or B) You take the whole bible literally. Now that would be backwards. We agree! Thankfully, most folks at Imago do not take it all literally. Yes, some are quite conservative. Most  are moderates who probably voted for Obama, they recycle, they bike, they drink micros, and the main reason they are at Imago is because the music sounds like Mumford & Sons. Really! Not because of the theology. Ever thought its the far left that is guilty of the group think?
Not a soul in memory has left the world in such turmoil as the fanatical community organizer. To the right he will surely go down as the most despised President ever.  The stage is set in the middle east for a conflagration such as the world has never seen.  With the hatred of Muslims and the intransigence of the Jews  the introduction of an amateurish fanatic in the White House was just the catalyst needed to bring the world to the precipice of all out war.  The right or wrong of Israel's policies hardly seem to matter any longer. The left will loudly disagree but it now remains to be seen if Trump can once again pull  a rabbit out of the proverbial hat.  Coupled with very tenuous relations now with Russia I know there has never been a more dangerous period in my lifetime.  Elections do indeed have consequences.
Hey Cuomo, for the record, YOU are NOT a REPORTER! That would mean that you write down and report what actually happened without adding any color or changing anything. You are only a very bad opinion promulgator who lets his own homosexual and communist agenda alter everything you say or do. You and EVERYONE at CNN deserve no resect at all for your laughable attempts to "report" the "news". You and all your associates (emphasis on "ass" in associates) are lying, cheating, partisan bigots, atheists, communists and traitors. I will gladly pay for the gallows to string you and all your compatriots up and I would gladly pull the trap door handle. It would be doing the entire world a great service! I will lobby til the day I die to have both your press privileges and your broadcast permits permanently revoked!
No, Stephen. God's church is never satisfied with the status quo. It's just that the church seeks to change the status quo through Kingdom living, not political advocacy.  Christians who believe that the policies of Barack Obama or Donald Trump are God's method for changing the status quo distort God's plan and character.   Jesus changed the status quo by a life that led to death on a cross. When the disciples of John the Baptist came to inquire why He seemed uninterested in fulfilling His inaugural promise to change the status quo, Jesus responded with  displays of personal love and mercy toward the victims of sin - not strident protests to Caesar, and demands that Caesar reform the laws that perpetuated the social, institutional and cultural status quo.   The Jewish leaders expected the Messiah to change the status quo and achieve justice for the Jewish people. They would resonate with today's Christian social justice warriors.
(Part one of two)  Myanmar, 88 percent Buddhist, began a process of democratic reforms in 2015 to emerge from a half-century of military rule. Suu Kyi, who had been put on house arrest under the military leadership, was elected the country’s State Counselor, a role equivalent to prime minister, in April 2016.—Joshua J. McElwee  such things happen neither in a secular nor religious vacuum.  “Keep me safe, O God, you are my hope” (Psalm 16:1).
I doubt you could find Cuba on a map and you outa try the loco weed sometime, you would probably make a lot more sense. Jews & early Christians used a lot of weed in the Holy Anointing Ceremony. Look it up.
Huge numbers of non-Christians (atheist and otherwise) perform acts of charity 365 days a year without needing any godlike fantasy to spur them into action. At the same time many, many self-proclaimed Christians do little or nothing. There are good people and not so good people regardless of where they stand on god/no god spectrum. Food banks, since you mention that sort of support, are staffed all year round, not just handing our turkeys in mid winter and you don't have to be a card carrying anything to help out.  On the subject of a mid-winter festival ... as there are so many faith groups that do something around this time of year why do we not, as a community, concentrate on the winter solstice for our big meals, drinks and gift sharing. It's the one universal date we all should celebrate without bringing any religion to the table at all.
I don't think that the moral premises of many people on the left and right are all that different.  I think that the differences are in the approach to those premises and how one builds on them.   I think that most moral people would agree that the taking of the life of another is usually wrong, that cheating, lying and stealing are wrong, that faithlessness to a spouse is wrong, etc. I think that most moral people would agree that kindness, charity, caring for children, altruism, faithfulness in marriage, honesty, integrity are all good.  Many on the left are not agnostic nor atheists (despite what some (and I'm not suggesting you are doing this!) like to posit); nor are all of those on the right members believers in God.   I think that there is much more commonality re moral conclusions than you suggest.
About 2 weeks ago, dozens of these guys showed up on the 16th St. Mall. I've lived near Writer Sq. for 2 years and haven't seen any till recently. I know they are fakes (not real Buddhist priests) from growing up in NYC and seeing all the faux Hari Krishnas and fake Buddhist Monks who trick naive people into believing that they peace loving men of religion soliciting donations. On the Mall, they hold out a hand with a beaded bracelet. I give them a wide berth as I shake my head. They are panhandlers and I have no idea how or why they suddenly appeared in downtown Denver -- but beware!
The Jehovah's Witnesses have always refuse to stand for the flag; anthem or pledge. They consider it to be making a religious idol. It seems to me that for any other religion that they have a good point. The flag is not supposed to be a religious idol for worship where not paying homage is treated as a heresy. Why would CCU support creating a religious idol?
Mr. Hu, or your most current name change--- Rompecorazones,   the article you referred  to begins by comparing assisted suicide to the Nazi's.  What brought recent attention to assisted suicide in California was a young woman that moved to Oregon where there is the possibility of assisted suicide because she had a painful brain tumor causing daily seizures.  It had nothing to do with Nazi doctors experimenting on Jewish people.  The people of California after this incident fortunately made a thoughtful decision to allow a person to die with dignity.  A person with such marked intercrainial  pressure does not spend their days thinking of the beauty of suffering then going to heaven.  She had horrible pain and seizures all day and night. You refer to deeper points in your quoted  article!  The article was full of misconceptions.
It depends on usage. In Hebrew and Yiddish, it simply means "non-Jew." In English usage, though, it carries a negative connotation, implying that non-Jews are inferior. The vast majority of Jews do not use the term, preferring the neutral term "non-Jew." Neo-nazis, however, employ the term to insinuate that Jews secretly hate and conspire against non-Jews, in their effort to justify their anti-semitism.
It's more interesting that the PDN thought that this rant was worthy of being published, than the rant itself. E.S. must have off the grid during the last 12 months away from t.v., radio and the press. Must have missed the hate filled rants of the candidate, now President elect, nor his hate filled rallies, and the support of the American Nazi Party for him, along with the rest. Or his open mocking of disabled people, or  veterans like John McCain, the parents of a soldier KIA, etc. I'm sure there are people who voted for him because they believed he would stand up against abortion, or magically bring back all the lost jobs in America, that his party gladly helped move overseas. But then there were the openly racist supporters, that he helped fuel at every rally. "Could she possibly mean that Kristallnacht is imminent?" Yes. Already happening.  Muslims have already been attacked. Beaten. You only willing to stand up if its Jews that are being beaten? Not Muslims?
If it were a beautiful and inspiring construction then he would have been Jewish-American because it looks like something from the Bolshevik gulag the Poles get credit.
If religion does not belong in schools then take away the Saturday and Sunday as off days from curriculum. They were made off days to accommodate Christians (Sunday) and Jews (Saturdays) for their religious (Holy-days) to accommodate their prayer rituals.  Muslims are only looking for one hour of time to pray on Fridays. They should the up the game and ask Fridays off and watch people go in a riot.
And Trump has an Orthodox Jewish son-in-law and a daughter who converted to Judaism to marry him.  Please spin that one for me.  I'm all ears.
I know that Cohn is Jewish and that gives him a certain sensitivity to this issue.  But really...was it bad enough to start a feud?  Not in my book.  Go back to work.  The country needs competent people focused on running it.
All Mariology is derivative of Christology.  When early Christians viewed Jesus as a human Messiah, they were comfortable with viewing Mary as a pious Jewish peasant. As their view of Jesus evolved, and they began to think of Jesus as divine,  Mary's exaltation was inevitable.
The accusation has been suggested  that those who are really upset about Deady's name being  on  Deady Hall are somehow trying to "cover up" Oregon's history; I was simply showing that the opposite  is the case.  Thus I'm happy Black Lives Matter raised this issue.  I'm hoping that the UO has now come to recognize there is not a single building on campus named for a minority person*; that none of the campus statues show a minority person (except the romanticized Indian maiden inside the art museum)  and that Sheldon's famous history of the UO up to WWII does not mention even a single minority person, not even Condon's students Wemura and Paul Gatow.   *Now, if we recognize Jews as   a minority---as  we should, as this KKK discussion has shown that Jews were targets as were Catholics and blacks-- we can be proud of Friendly Hall, named for  Sam Friendly (Freundlich) a great Eugene Mayor, businessman and most  of all  fantastic supporter of the UO!
When you can show me how something you drop falls up rather than down, I will be happy to have a conversation about the reality of natural law. Until then ....  That most other Americans - Christian, Jewish, and Muslim - believe homosexual behavior is immoral behavior is a demonstrable fact. The majority of Americans say to you and those who share opinion on "it makes it difficult to raise children who are morally straight" and "it weakens the family as the cornerstone of society", "So what?"  At the end of the day every law, including the Constitution, is a matter for a majority decision.  Sufficient arrogance can lead to a practical demonstration of that reality, as the last election did.
With 32,000 terrorist attacks by muslims to the rest of the world there is nothing irrational about disliking or having aversion to islam.  Those terrorist attacks are real and obviously a HUGE warning that there is something very badly wrong with the followers of islam.  Why are MPs ignoring the facts:  the police reports across the country clearly show that highest hate crimes are against jews at the rate of 29% and that hate crimes against muslims is much lower on the scale with 11%. There is nothing of a warning that says that something  should be done to protect muslims.  On the contrary, if any motion should be put forward, it should be protecting jews against hate crimes.
And how about there is neither Jew nor Gentile, slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ.  Kind of deflates an all male priesthood, no?
No, I don't deny the Holocaust of WW2.  6,000,000 Jews murdered for  just being Jewish. The Pope and others did not look the other way.  He saved thousands of Jews from certain death. He knew Hitler was evil, but dangerous and he had to act discreetly. Hitler's ultimate goal was the destruction of all religion, . Including the Pope's and the Pope knew it. .  Hitler managed to manipulate a German population who had lost faith in their leaders and their religion after the First World War, a brutal  war reparations  after the treaty of Versailles left the country broke.  To top it all off inflation reached a point where their money was worthless.  Hitler exploited a vacuum in German a  society that  had lost their faith and morals to the point where the Devil himself could become  their savior. They did, indeed, make a deal with a National Socialist Devil and it resulted in a humiliating and costly defeat. Millions dead and a whole generation lost forever.  No, I don't deny the Holocaust
Dare I raise the spectre of political correctness gone mad. Let us objectively observe the behavioral trends among different religious youths from the second generation, i.e, born and brought up in Canada. The Christian kids , the budhist kids, the hindu kids, etc have religion as the last thing on their minds. the 2nd generation hindu kids can not be dragged to a temple even if tempted by free big mac afterwards. Even if the 1st generation parents try to ram religion down their throats they just laugh back. That is as it should be; healthy and natural behavior - just have fun but be responsible. I do not understand the obsession with same age kids from the muslim community to cover their faces, kneel down however many times a day...doesnt that strike anyone as wholly unnatural ...
"The Goyim Knows, also known as Shut It Down, is a catchphrase used to impersonate and mock jews and the conspiracy theories arround them, as a goyim (non-Jewish person) has discovered a Jewish conspiracy, so the Jews shut the conspiracy down to prevent the “truth” from being exposed. The catchprases are often used as captions on images of jews talking on a phone or a handheld transceiver"  from Know your Meme  ThomasPaine is quite correct.....the phrase is anti-Semitic.  Such information is very easily accessed on Google.  It's always a good idea to spend a few minutes researching an issue before commenting on it.  That way you don't look so ill-informed.  Gary Crum .
Goldberg had better be careful. The white supremacists that elected Trump have no love lost on college educated Jews. His white privilege card is only conditional.
"The poem is irrelevant" That poem was most definitely NOT irrelevant to my German-Jewish father and his sister in 1939. And tens of thousands of others similarly situated. That poem embraced a principle, as prima facie stated.
Umm, North Korea is NOT atheist. They have deified cult of personality.  That's not the point of contention however. It's whether their atrocities are committed because of atheism. Atheism is not an ideology. Marxism is. Atheism is merely a lack of disbelief, so the comparison is disingenuous.
And what passes for your 'logic' touts scientific endeavor as the infallible new religion, grandly replacing the old ones.  All kinds of interesting aspects of your religion.  Consider eugenics, Linneaus' 'racial' classifications of humanity, Stalin's Society for Militant Atheism, Larmarckism, Hermstein's & Murray's 'Bell Curve', the 'orthodox' paleontologists who--quite wrongly--denounced Robert Bakker as a 'scientific heretic' for his theories on dinosaurs (which now ARE, ironically, the current orthodoxy), etc. etc.  By proclaiming yours as the ONLY TRUE RELIGION you've just proved yourself no different than those you disparage.  You're like a Phlogiston chemist--you're wrong from scratch (apologies to R.A.H.).  BTW, the earliest human teaching to elucidate what is now called 'the scientific method' was al-Qur'an.  But of course that would be embarrassing to an adherent of your religion, so you'll have to shriek, flail and deny it.  Hopefully you won't try to burn me at the stake.
Today I attempted to read a lengthy article in New York Magazine co-written by nearly all their staff writers about the rise of the alt-right movement which gave birth to Trump. I must confess to not having finished it, but I read enough to get the gist of it: the alt-right is driven mostly by over-educated, under-employed white males, and its rise would not have been possible without the internet. Trying to figure out a coherent underlying philosophy of the alt-right, however, is a challenge, since they mostly seem intent on blowing everything up. I'm not sure how progressives challenge such a world-view since their particular nemeses seem to be Jewish establishment conservatives - people like William Kristol and Leon Wieseltier come to mind. I do know that I am against anyone who views racial minorities with contempt, and if these are the people who brought Trump to power, and apparently they are, then I am all on board with being on the offensive, never mind Trump's own ghastliness.
There are no "solutions" to current global warming.  That I understand.    Now, I also understand that you are celebrating partial success of a different agenda.  This Santayana?       "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it", "Only the dead have seen the end of war'."  "Fanaticism consists in redoubling your efforts when you have forgotten your aim."  "My atheism, like that of Spinoza, is true piety towards the universe and denies only gods fashioned by men in their own image, to be servants of their human interests."     "Skepticism, like chastity, should not be relinquished too readily."
Kudos to Michael Schwartz for giving serious and informative answers to questions that are tainted ("Why are there Jews everywhere?), or worse (the "lizard people" question is not just "stupid," as the author admits, but downright offensive). I'm not sure what the dynamic of this interview was, but what may have worked live and in private failed in print. Good to know about "Mensch", though. And the dinner series sounds well worth attending.
I don't accept that you need to ditch any term that has SOME negative connotations for some people, you are right about that.  It is a valid term used in many contexts unrelated to Jews, it is people like you and Buruma trying to force it out of circulation for political reasons who are extremist ideologues.
One of the few things that Muslim scholars and Jewish scholars have agreed on is that the Berbers are the people of Goliath.  Those folks were living in Canaan when Bani Israel arrived.  When I get time I'll find the passages in Genesis that acknowledge the Arabs were already there when Bani Israel moved in.
I see that you, Motley, care more about semantics than facts. You can always find an angle that justifies white racism. You would make a "good German". They never asked where the Jews disappeared to.
Well articulated Cal.  With her publicized - but far too gently discussed - long history of temper outbursts, uncivil treatment of the Secret Service & military, her compliance in theft of White House furniture & art work (much of which had to be returned, along with a heavy fine), her concealed health problems, HRC should have been shunned from government long ago.  Let us all pray that Judeo/Christian ethics & statesmanship will guide our leaders at all levels and all voters in this election.
This is similar to what I was going to write.  Many people make all kinds of statements but fail to use Scripture as authority.  They use culture, feelings, statistics, etc.  Some would even dare to claim that you must put Jesus first.  That is just a claim when their doctrine or beliefs is not based on the truth about Jesus and the truth about His Word.  When a person make claims about Jesus not being in the synagogue and working with the people, they attempt to make that comparison to the church.  Jesus established the church.  Upon this rock, I will build my church.  We do know that he was talking about the global and invisible church but He was talking about the church.  The synagogues were not the church.  All I am saying is that our doctrines, beliefs, practices must be based on truth and that is the truth of God's Word.  Every decision the church makes must be based on Scripture and not feelings and statistics and what is popular in culture at this time.  We are the light......
Origins. Plural. Western Civilization has many, many sources. Christianity played a major role, and it fused Jewish monotheism and Jewish ethical values with Greco-Roman culture and philosophy. Persia/Babylonia, Egypt, and other ancient cultures also played a role. One small example, there's a huge debate as to the origins of the Western-languages alphabet, which can be traced back to the Romans and then to the Greeks. A lot of scholars then trace it back further to the Phoenicians, but some scholars argue Hebrew is just as ancient as Phoenician. The first four letters of the Greek alphabet are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta. The first four letters of the Hebrew alphabet are Aleph, Bet, Gimmel, Daled.
You pretend Trump is accomplishing what Hitler accomplished in the 1930s. That reveals a shocking degree of pampered parochialism your thinking.   Last night on TV, on NBC from America, the first reports were these: - Trump's bans against Muslim majority countries are causing chaos for travelers of many types - The tweet from Justin Trudeau is read out word for word ("... Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith...") - a Muslim mosque in Texas burned down last night, and investigators are probing it as possible hate crime, having arrested a local man for a hate crime a few years ago involving that mosque.   Hello? Germany's 1930's press was no conduit of empathy and facts about minorities, like USA news above. Indeed, Goebbels, the government master of newspapers then, fired all Jewish journalists in 1933. Cartoons of Jews as rodents then appeared, and claims that Jews needed blood of Christians for rituals.  Get a grip. America is not 1930s Germany. Not even close.
It is not a question of whether the word or the logo are offensive in themselves, but of reducing a race to a mascot, especially when that race has historically been demeaned. The point is easily understood if you imagine a team calling itself the Jews with a logo featuring a hook-nosed, bearded man in a black hat.
Freddie, something is wrong when you have to six entries just to answer one. Once more, I say that ethnic origins do not separate the Holy Lands, it is strictly religious faiths that separate the Holy Lands. And no matter who's seed is what, Jewish faith came first in that land, way before the Islamic faith who have taken control of the region.  You seem to get very anal into this problem but I think you can't see the tree in the forest. Once more, after all that you have written, you still haven't come with what you believes to be the proper solution to the problem. Since it is not about the "seed" of whoever but the faith of whoever, I am still waiting to see what your thoughts are on the proper way to handle this. I am asking for your opinion on this, Freddie......you must have a thought or two, eh?
Being critical of the policies of the government of Israel is not "anti-Semitic".  The people criticizing the Israeli government are not making bomb threats against Jewish centres in Canada. They've been criticizing the Israeli government for decades without resorting to domestic violence or hate crimes against Jewish people.  This appears to be new and most likely related to Trump making racists everywhere feel welcome.
Harry, There you go again,  I merely stated Adolph Hitler was Baptized as a Christian.  Harry, answer this.  If Nazi Germany was 90% "Christian" (mostly Lutherans and Catholics), why did the country elect him in the 1930's and enthusiastically support his murderous regime against non-Christians until  the Red Army invaded Berlin in 1945? Unless you're a Holocaust Denier, the Pope and other church leaders looked the other way while Hitler murdered Jews, Jehovah Witnesses, Gypsies, Slavic people, the disabled, and others he called "Worthless Life".  Hitler accomplished this through the propaganda of "Aryan Racial Superiority" that the German people fully supported. Apparently, you can tolerate Confederate symbols of slavery and hate from the KKK and neo-Nazis, but can't tolerate science, critical thinking, or even evolution.  You invent your own history.  America was founded on "freedom from religion" as well as "freedom to worship anything or anyone".
Remember when President Trump was first elected there were several elite designers who said they would never "dress" Mrs. Trump, not design for her or fabricate dresses for her. No one got upset over that. If an individual went into a Jewish deli or a Muslim food place and demand that the restaurant serve them pork, they would refuse. How are either of these scenarios different? The couple should have just gone to another bakery rather than making a big stink, but then that is what liberals excel at.
The Rothschilds, like all the great Jewish banking families, were Sephardi Jews. The Jews that lived in Germany and Poland and would become the victims of the holocaust were all Ashkenasi Jews - two groups which had nothing in common. The Ashkenasi were impoverished, kept in ghettos and had almost no political clout whatsoever. They first arrived in Europe around the early 18th century, arriving in the Eastern parts, and spoke Yiddish.  The Sephardis arrived several hundred years earlier via Spain. They spoke Laddish and all the great Jewish banking families are from this group - and that is entirely an accident of history. The Roman Catholic church prohibited Christians from charging each other interest on loans, Jews were not subject to this law - so these Sephardic Jews, particularly in Venice and Naples could get rich running banks that would give loans when other banks wouldn't - because they alone could charge interest.  The victims had nothing in common with the people blamed.
Perhaps your comment would make sense, Marty, if you would substitute the word authoritarianism (of the Holy Father) for the word "authority."   The definition of infallibility was poorly defined by a VI in the 1800's that did much damage to the church.  Fact is that Pius IX dismissed the conclave when he did not have the votes for it but reconvened it after the Northern European and American Bishops were gone.  The fact is that Pius IX had shown himself to be emotionally unstable by the kidnaping a Jewish boy that a maid had baptized.
Richard Rhyner: You and I are on opposite sides of the river. You are an extreme conservative. I'm an atheist liberal that usually scoffs, eye-rolls and mutters when I read your posts, lamenting that you are not alone, that your views represent a large number of voting Alaskans.  But on this we agree. The Iditarod race injures and kills dogs. While I believe that sled dogs love to run, they have limits and those limits are often exceeded. I'd like to see the race be scaled back. The Iditarod serum run the race commemorates is nobel and important, but it could be celebrated in a different and more humane way.
No, "Reason" is a term manufactured by generally Left leaning Atheists. What they imply by it is they believe that they are open to the "truth" and "Reason", that is as long as it lines up with their chosen Dogma which is generally the religion of Science. They bow at the alter of science but their brand of science is very flexible and can be conveniently "tweaked" to line up with their beliefs.
Your son should not be praying in school hours. Take him to Masjid after school hours on a Friday to pray along with you. Oh, I forgot you being a woman won't be allowed to pray in the same room as him!            Why don't you persue your activism against the Imam and the Sharia or whatever law which won't permit you pray in the Masjid along with him instead of writing opinion pieces in the 'progressive' newspapers like the G & M.          How about if Hindu students, Buddhist, Sikh, Christian children etc. start demanding  facilities and privileges as you are doing? The liberal apologists for the Muslims did not think of that when the school boards gave these special religious privileges to pacify Muslim parents as you played the victim card. Hindus do special prayers to their gods and goddesses on Tuesdays and other religions also have special assignments for prayers.  Keep religion in your homes and masjids and don't stick out like a sore thumb.
I was able to find the answer by Googling "investigation Israeli youth threats jewish organizations". That input pulled up dozens of articles. Since you are posting on an internet forum, I presume that you have access to Google.  Therefore, I am presuming that you had no reason to ask your question other than to insinuate that all threats against jewish institutions are inside jobs.
As a former atheist, its frightening to see the delusion and denial of those still held by the atheist belief.
So I checked out your site. That's the kind of source you rely on, an internet page by God knows who?  You're as bad as the New Atheists who "know" Jesus never existed because they read it on jesusneverexisted.com.  Paul's authentic letters predate the gospels (though there are some scholars who date Mark to the reign of Caligula). For starters.
Jesus had apostles and disciples.  He was a Jew, so he didn't ordain any Catholic priests...in fact, Christianity didn't exist when Jesus was alive.  At best, for years afterward, "christianity" was just another sect of Judaism.  Maybe the church needs more rabbis?  And yes, there are male and female rabbis, married and single rabbis...
I never understood how Caplan could hate his fellow Jews so much.  His utter lies about 'defenceless Palestinians' defies reality and all the Palestinian terrorist attacks every year (the 'stabbing intifida' was just this year's version).  Caplan deliberately lies and hides the fact that the Palestinians have rejected statehood three times in the last 16 years, and originally in 1947 through 1967.  Caplan justifies murder of innocent Jews, calls Jewish babies, women and children brutal settlers, openly lies about guilt and innocence, and frankly, I don't know how this socialist lives with himself.
I don't think anybody has made the claim that they didn't or don't exist.  Also if you look at the studies that your relying upon if you check the people involved you will find that the researchers had skin in the game rendering them not objective or credible.  As for your attempt to lay responsibility for the Palestinian problem at the feet of the Arabs the notion that this is the result of refugees being dropped into camps for propaganda purposes is laughable. Perhaps the idea of choosing an inhabited land, ethnically cleansing half of its people and oppressing the rest is the source of that instability.  For it was not the countries of the middle east that were hostile to Jews prior to Zionism. Yet somehow European colonialists felt they could take this land without repercussion. As Ilan Pappe said, Zionism is a noble cause, creating a safe haven for a persecuted people. BUT ..CONT'D
Anti-religious bigotry against some groups of Christians appears to be acceptable in Eugene.    "Freedom of Religion" in Eugene appears to be applicable primarily to the Christian religions of a particular class and, currently, to the  Jewish and Muslim religions.    As an agnostic, I am personally unaffected, but disagree with the hypocrites involved.
It’s important to compare apples with apples. Islam is not like Christianity or Buddhism. It has socially and politically ideological implications as well as religious. Think of Marxism or Fascism. But the author succeeds in making it all sound so simple and innocent.
"And studies have shown that overall, religious children are not as nice as atheist children."  Hopefully those 'studies' were not paid for by taxpayers....  "Follow the money" is a game I like to play on anonymous 'studies' mentioned by commenters.    Wanna play?  Give the link(s) to the 'studies'!
Countering Buddhist extremism?   Catholic extremism?   Amish extremism?  If only there was a list of extremist violence from those religions -- but there's not.  However, the same cannot be said of Muslim extremism.  http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/attacks/attacks.aspx?Yr=Last30  One way to look at the victims of these violent attacks is that they are martyrs.  To ignore their deaths is to suggest they died in vain.  That so many are shown the gigantic amount of evidence of Muslim extremism and respond by saying it doesn't exist, and those who say it exists are "bigots"......it's quite a strange phenomena of our times.
Do the 17 predominately Muslim countries allow Israeli Jews?   Regardless of who has mentioned it?  I haven't heard any comments from people here, however.....  And it is not a ban on Muslims.  I don't recall reading in the order that Muslims and Muslims only are temporarily banned from entering.  Also please don't forget - it is temporary....and only until comprehensive vetting is completed.  That is not a "ban" - although it is a great word to whip up controversy with.
Re-read the article. Her uncle didn't know that her grandpa was Nazi collaborator until his death. He authored much of research about Ukrainian nationalists role in Holocaust. Try reading “What Was the Attitude of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists toward the Jews?”  Freeland redacted her uncle work with not factually confirmed, one-sided story about her grandpa being actually part of resistance to Nazi ... And, as if that whitewashing wasn't enough, Freeland's official public story STILL portrays her family as victims, fleeing Hitler and Stalin, not willing Nazi collaborators, taking over murdered Jewish publisher' business and apartment, and profiting from igniting antisemitism. Finally, when the truth comes out, Freeland calls it Russian disinformation campaign??..
"77% of Canadians are Christian"  Gimme a break. Only one Canadian in three is still religious. As far back as the 1980s Sociologist Reginald Bibby found that for most nominal superstition believers being Anglican, Baptist, Catholic, Jewish, ... made no difference in their lives, apart from determining what genre of ritual was performed when they were born, married, and buried.  http://www.people-press.org/2002/12/19/among-wealthy-nations/  "Among Wealthy Nations  U.S. Stands Alone in its Embrace of Religion Six-in-ten (59%) people in the U.S. say religion plays a very important role in their lives. This is roughly twice the percentage of self-avowed religious people in Canada (30%), and an even higher proportion when compared with Japan and Western Europe. Americans’ views are closer to people in developing nations than to the publics of developed nations."  https://www.irreligion.org/2011/09/16/half-of-canadians-think-religion-more-harmful-than-good-poll-finds/
Where does the Lord's prayer mention Christianity?  Don't Muslim's, Jews, and Christians actually share the one and same supreme being?
Hmm - any other demands on  customs, traditions and practices that  morphed from religion into secular societies due to their practical rationale,  during the last 2000 years no less?  While you are at it   - care to address all other 10+ major religions practiced today, and their "days off".   Start with Buddhism, Shintoism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Tao,...?
So we need to abolish the 7-day week because it is based on the Bible?   Maybe we also need to reform the calendar? You realise we are in the year 2017  because we use the Gregorian calendar, with B.C. and A.D. meaning Before Christ and After God (Deus) (the recent change to the nomenclature Before the Common Era and After the Common Era in academia notwithstanding)?  For Muslims we are in the year 1438, and for Jews the year 5777. ..  Or you could just accept that our society is the result of its history, and 2000 years of Christianity has left its mark on our culture and traditions.
anywhere in the world a place frequented by western 'decadence' seems to be a target. Being a Christian also puts you at risk (Christians in Egypt are targeted for their religion.....Jews are targeted everywhere , even South America with help from Iran/hezbollah). As far as ISIS being upset with Turkeys involvement  in Syria, Assads regime bombs innocent / civilian populations indiscriminately and has used chemicals too. What a mess, who can even begin to understand it.
First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist.  Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Trade Unionist.  Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Jew.  Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.    Martin Niemöller
I'll agree that for many atheists, atheism isn't a religion.  However, there are quite a few atheists who do seem to treat atheism as a religion - and treat everyone who disagrees as heretics.  I think it's understandable that many consider atheism as a religion when there are self-appointed priests telling atheists what they should believe, and proselytizing atheism for all they are worth.    Of course, they reject that terminology, but that doesn't make it less accurate.
I'm a Christian and would like to worship at the Kaaba, do you think I can get in?
Jewish Lazar kaganovich killed 60,000,000 Christians in the Holodomor. Try again.
I would like to engage in a rational dialogue.  What is the best way to go about that.  I say we both ask three questions and the other person needs to answer those questions directly, not deflect like you are doing above.  You said absolutely nothing other than criticize Israel and you are anti-semite.  1.  Has Israel recently passed another law allowing for the expropriation of Palestinian people from their homes in the West Bank to allow for Jewish settler? A member of parliament in Netanyahu's own Likud party, Benny Begin, son of the late Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, speaking before the vote, labelled it "the robbery bill". 2.  Has certain members of Knesset called for the genocide of the Palestinians (please note I can provide direct quotes if it helps)? 3.  Is Israel strategically expropriating (see robbery comment by Begin) property in the west bank knowing it is worth the most from a resource perspective? Answer my 3 and I will answer yours.
Predictably, GBR uses this tragic event to get out his Breitbarf talking points. Strange how you were sooooo quiet during all your skin head soldiers heinous acts emboldened by the DC dog whistle calls we have endured since November.  Oh...And I suppose you are going to say those were liberal skin heads that attacked Muslim and Jewish places of worship.  Heck, even your president FINALLY had a united tone today. Wouldn't expect the same from you.  Too busy adding to your hate agenda.
The total number of dead during Partition in 1947 was between 250,000 to 1,000,000. That was the total for Hindus and Muslims. This happened due to the divide and rule policies of the British. They encouraged both sides to go after each other - a very effective way of controlling the entire subcontinent.  And the Muslims were victims of Hindus and Sikhs. Not "Indians and Hindus" - did you think there were any non Indian Hindus involved here? I guess that two minute Google search was not sufficient to educate you on the intricacies of the subject.
Really?  Do you understand history at all?  Hint, it isn't "victimhood" in the pejorative way you are trying to use it, if it is true.  Jews have been hounded out of most nations in Europe at one time or another, murdered in a truly industrial manner in the mid 20th century and while things here are better, still get blamed for many things.
Your entire comment was sound, except for the last sentence: "Not being able to materially discern the existence of God/gods doesn't negate God/gods, except to atheists."  Only atheists who haven't given the matter sufficient thought believe that lack of evidence of god proves his non-existence. Atheists that understand the scientific method- which should be every last one of them- understand the governing principle: you can prove something exists, but you can't prove that it doesn't. Claiming that lack of evidence proves non-existence is irrational, illogical and even contrary to common sense.
Speaking as an Atheist, this article supports what I've believed for a long time ... that you can write negatively about Christians with impunity, but don't ever, EVER criticize Muslims, for to do so is bigoted and wrong.
Please provide citations for your assertion that the Constitution and Supreme Court have rejected the concept that America was founded on Judeo-Christian principles.
It is quite sad to see a prominent churchman like Bishop Barron who has a big public following avoid holding big shots on Capitol Hill to the same standard by which he critiques other people with far, far less power and influence.  His attack on Griffin's hateful display of alleged humour, for example, was quite justified in its own right, but Bishop Barron has ignored equally repugnant displays in both word and deed by President Trump.  Indeed President Trump has attacked freedom of religion, incited violence, and demeaned women for more than six months non-stop.  There is no doubt that the President's hateful rhetoric has 'inspired' an upswing in anti-Semitic violence against both Jews and Muslims but, so far as I know, Bishop Barron has not condemned the President for his very anti-Christians attacks on other people.  Such double-standards reduce Barron, and others who take the same approach, to disciples of convenience who choose not to proclaim the Gospel to the powerful ...
Like the Rechabites and the Jebusites?  Brother Noel, the term alien or stranger included people dwelling in the land who were not Jews.  They were not to be vexed or driven out. Jeremiah praised the Rechabites and the Jebusites dwelt in the land by treaty.  Its complicated, like always.  You are simplifying
Reasonable people do not fear the modesty of Muslim women but they do reject the self-effacement of some.  Reasonable people also fear the strident condemnation of Jews, Unbelievers, and Apostates, the disapproval of individual choice that is woven into the fabric of Islam.   Reasonable people fear the  insistence by most visible leaders of this faith worldwide that their interpretation of holy law supersedes human-made law.  I would welcome some articles in the Globe that deal in depth with these issues; nothing less will lead to understanding.
"Social conservatives are freaking out because they no longer control the moral and ethical paradigm in this country, they can no longer have the government harass and punish gay people because they feel gay people need to be punished and controlled." ========== So of course your solution is to "have the government harass and punish" Christians, Jews, and everyone else you feel should be "punished and controlled" because now people like you want to "control the moral and ethical paradigm in this country." - Hmmm. So, according to you, any "truth" is decided only by "who's the top dog" in human history. Interesting philosophy. Too bad for you it fails to consider God in your "paradigm."
I've often wondered why an integrated, multi-ethnic state with constitutionally established equal rights like those of the Western democracies is seen as such a threat to many American Jews, who represent less than 3% of our population and do well here by any standard as a protected minority.  Both white nationalists and Jewish nationalists express and share fearful concerns about the "demographic threat" of an unwanted population and "losing majority."
Debbie's name drives me crazy!    I know it's just her name, but  I keep thinking "Wasserman Test! with all those connotations!  What is really strange about the "Bernie is a Jew" issue is that according to her bio, Wasserman comes from a Jewish family as well!  I guess for the DNC during this election, winning for Hillary was more important than either bigotry or family!
That last is over-the-top, but there is justification for the like in some remarks of Pope Francis that were not included in the commentary online by NCR.        In essence he said it is is better to be an atheist than a hypocritical Catholic. A rich Catholic caring nothing for the poor, compared with a humanistic atheist in good conscience serving with DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS for example, serve to make the point.         The abortion issue is an excuse for self-righteous political maneuvers. Trump promises Gorsuch will repeal ROE vs.Wade. He cannot without a consensus and their is no indication that he will try to get one. Bernard Law was an active supporter of the pro-life movement. Let me repeat this again: Law was an avid supporter of the pro-life movement.       I am pro-life. I also have a conscience that is outraged at the duplicity and insipidity and deceit of many contemporary Catholics. Pro-life is a term I refuse to let the demented co-opt for their personal use.
Do you think that you help to reform something by fearing it? Religions are about empowering people who have no power, and so, when they know the world is afraid of them, then what incentive do they have to reform?  I do believe that Islam and all religions do need to call to account those of their adherents who practice the religion violently, but Islam is no different from Judaism and Christianity in that regard.
I haven't labelled myself, but I know I can leave to folks like yourself to do so to simplify your thinking such as it is. I had to look up the meaning and from what I gather with it's probable Jewish influence (an Abrahamic religion), it doesn't seem to fit my initial reply, not that that ever stopped you in the past.
Its a little over a 100 days of President Donald Trump infant administration,, every time you see the word Democrat with Donald Trump, its always, "always" against his agenda.  if its not a dirty joke (like these liberal Democrats supporters comedians on late night) its protest of some kind.  These liberal, secular, progressive atheist Democratic party will never accept President Trump as our country leader because of their sour grapes hate.     President Trump has accomplished a lot of things for this country in his first 100 days. For American  jobs, and keeping company from heading out of the country...for American is what this President has done.  A commercial  ad for television was produced about President Trump accomplishment, but CNN (fake news), liberal networks ABC, NBC CBS will not show it.      President Trump is for Christian values, where as Obama was not.  Maybe thats one reason the atheist secular Democratic party will not accept President Trump Agenda.
You make the point yourself. The English word "sacred" is being applied here. "Sacred" to a European descendant means where the jew god walked, where the jew god shapeshifted to be born as human, where the shapeshifted jew god died, where the jew god laid waste to entire nations, where the jew god performed miracles, where the jew god picked his chosen ones, so on and so on. Suppose I find out where your mother is buried and go dig up her grave to "harvest" any jewelry or articles of clothing that I can sell to have a little grub stake to invest in Vegas. Would you find that offensive? Why? Is that ground sacred or hallowed because of some ridiculous religion? Maybe you would be satisfied if the Native Hawaiians only used the Hawaiian language to explain the places of respect, reverence, awe and honor to the ancestors. That is all they are saying, the haole is desecrating their graveyards, their birthing areas, their places of meditation, ho`ihi he mea ʻē aina, not jew god "sacred".
Dear John Hobson, shame for criticising Card. Burke's hero Cyril of Alexandria. I would quote a notable bio. sketch: "Cyril had punished himself for several years as a desert monk, but as was often the case, the tribulations of the flesh served merely to deepen his fanaticism and fire his intolerance: imagine him as a kind of fundamentalist mullah"*.  Not at all akin to the apparent indulgences source of the Card.'s rigid fanaticism. Another: "Cyril was a heretic hunter, and Jew Hater. Around Easter 415, he roused a Christian mob to attack the local Jews, sacking their homes, and seizing their synagogues to purify them and turn them into churches. He drove the ancient community from the city"*. The Saint was also involved in the skinning with oyster shells and burning death of the lady Hypatia, after which "Cyril's career in the Catholic Church blossomed"* *Holland, "Misogyny The World's Oldest Prejudice", pp.95-6
Who would believe anything written by this most duplicitous and self-serving of politicians ? I would prefer to interpret his reasons for switching from support and participation in Vichy as others have done - pure self-interest. It was obvious in 1942 that with the Americans in the War, and German problems in the east, that Germany was going to lose.  Mitterand's excuses for the rafle date from 1994.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0aWE_N7opU    They are the same as le Pen's - that the the Vichy government was not the true France. Neither are justifying it; both are blaming it on an "illegal" government that had replaced the real France.  Mitterand was a friend of Bousquet, who organised the Vel d'Hiv round-up, until in 1986 it became too politically dangerous to continue. It was impossible that he didn't know of Bousquet's eager participation in the round-up of Jews.
Just another example of the dis-respect that is encouraged and fostered by the elite leftists, academia and pop culture wanna-be's toward anything traditional. It pains the left to no end to hear a traditional anthem with the word god included as it forces them to acknowledge for all their disdain and arrogance toward it, Canada was actually built on the foundation of Christianity. Even I can admit that and I am an atheist.
The Star Spangled Banner is the more appropriate song, for the history it records, in the fight for freedom. America the Beautiful is a religious song with the jew god, and there is a thing in the Constitution called the 1st Amendment, the Exclusion Clause, that the US Government will keep church and state separate.
Keep on ranting about "Hindus" and "Muslims" in India and Pakistan.  Smart people call it "what-about-it-try" ,as in "well what about...this... or that".   It's a form of deflection that no longer works.
I grew up an atheist thanks to our public education system. Like you it wasn't until I began thinking for myself, rather than believing what I was told and taught. At that point I was able to shake the atheism belief instilled in me by others.  I also don't adhere to religions as a belief, religions are simply moral and ethical ways of leading ones life. You must also realize religious writings such as the bible are not literal works, they are metaphoric writings based upon both fact and fiction to get the moral and ethical understanding across.  The problem with atheism is its the result of delusion and denial, not understanding!
So if we send troops to help the Rohyngyas, the Buddhist majority will unite against our "invasion",  and eventually we will have Buddhist terrorist bombers on our own soil seeking revenge? Maybe those second-generation Vietnamese-Canadians identifying with their Buddhist brethren in Myanmar?
No, they contradict as well. Both (well, all three) are projections in the sense of 'God', hence God's changing demeanor. Christianity was a reaction to the hypocritical rule-crazy Judaism, and sums 'The Law' up into the 'Golden Rule'; whereas Islam, clearly created by a con artist who mooched off a rich widow and hung out in a cave all day, it isn't simply a change in demeanor, but it doubles down on Judaisms folly while somehow not grasping Christianity's consolidation of it, and almost everything Mohammed does goes against all that was established, and then he just says, "Oh, wait, Allah said its ok" (a difference between the Judeo-Christian and Islam God is that in the prior he tends to come forth with a challenge, whereas Islam he comes after the action. Even Ayesha recognized his con when she said "Allah moves hastily to please you"
That is "your" (questionable) interpretation of the anti discrimination "law", but it is NOT the prima facie 1st amendment right. A license from a city is only in order for the City to Control sales tax and determine if a business is "legal" (not in violation of state and city health regs, fire regs or engaged in criminal activity). The baker is in business to make cakes and using his artistry. No one FORCES the gays to come into his shop and demand a particular decoration on his cake. A catholic bookstore is not forced to carry atheist books or jewish books or muslim books-why should a baker be forced to decorate any cake for any reason? It is NOT a necessity to have a wedding cake, nor is a wedding cake a necessity of LIFE, HEALTH, nor should/can anyone be forced into a personal services contract. A city or state "business license" does not give government control over the individual owners or their "religious" beliefs or business activities.
Not true - atheism is simple a lack of belief in a god or gods.  There is a very big difference between not believing that god (any god) exists and believing that god does not exist.  While the latter group are atheists they constitute a subset of all atheists.
François Jourdan, French islamologue; “...Islam is very frozen for many centuries and basically lack of freedom - today, it must be said clearly that we cannot build a society of one religion, Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist... or atheist.  This phase of human history is now overtaken by religious freedom and human rights. Secularism requires not the ban but the discretion of all religions in the public space as other citizens have the right to have another way of life.  This isn't the Koranic trend where Islam does not consider itself as other religions and must...DOMINATE !...”
You make a good point. I am not a fan of Libeskind's architecture but his Jewish Museum in Berlin, which I have visited, is astounding in its symbolic references. The building made him famous but for the most part, his architecture lacks soul and originality.
Your answers don't match the Gospel story of Judas.  Judas had met with the Jewish leaders to deliver Jesus to them well BEFORE the Last Supper.  He left the Meal to get the Jewish Guards, and then, knowing that Jesus would go to the Garden of Gethsemene---he led them to Jesus.  So he knew that the Jewish Leaders [High Priests] wanted to capture Jesus, and he had planned to deliver Jesus for the 30 pieces of silver.  That was a sin.   So you believe that God "uses" people?  That concept hardly demonstrates the great love that God has for each and every human being.  God doesn't use people like a broom or shovel.  Finally, when people were ill, disturbed by evil spirits that they could not explain---and they knew that Jesus was coming to their town---they hurried out to meet him, to ask him to heal them.  If one is spiritually ill---why not go to Jesus as well.  That is what SIN is----spiritual sickness.  Jesus is the Divine Doctor.  What is so hard to understand here?
"eth·nic·i·ty, noun      - the fact or state of belonging to a social group that has a common national or cultural tradition."  Do you see anything in the definition of ethnicity that prevents Russian and Ethiopian Jews from belonging to the same ethnic group? No. Russian Jews and Ethiopian Jews all belong to the same cultural tradition. They are Jewish.   You're welcome.
FACT: 2016 (latest year they've data Stats Can,  hate crimes declined in 2013, but  increased against Muslims & Jews. What's up with the Liberals? Minister Jim Carr; why aren't you advocating for Jews?   Nat'll Council of Cdn Muslims: “question for all of us must be – now what?” Calling for 1) special training for local police forces, 2) sensitivity courses in schools NATION WIDE, 3) name Jan 29, National Day of Remembrance and Action on Islamophobia. Quite a wish-list.  FACT: 1847 to 1900s,  Toronto bastion of WASP, treated the Irish Catholics like dirt - the city’s original immigrant underclass, faced bitter discrimination for decades. Sectarian tension ran so high TO became known as: "The Belfast of Canada! Off the boat, if they THOUGHT you had a cough you were sent to the Cholera Sheds - death beds! Shopkeepers window signs "Irish now welcome/don't apply". This discrimination endured til WW.  Let's get real, every group no matter the year faces lack of acceptance, hatred & bigots!
Odd I don't recall the self-promoclaimed 'wise Latina,' Justice Sotomayor whether her Catholicism would impact her ability to serve on Surpreme Court and this is 'only' a Court of Appeals appointment. Interestingly, the Supreme Court is comprised of 6 Roman Catholics and 3 Judaism. Talk about a lack religious diversity! The country is not 67% Catholic and 33% Jewish. Just saying.
Nazis with the active support of Ukrainian nationalists killed millions of Jews in Ukraine during WWII, crimes that Germans acknowledged but Ukrainians ever since denied. That is the story behind this story.
Lela,  Gun control in most of Europe (as in US and the Euro colonies), is a modern invention, dating for the most part to post-WWI era when establishment fears of large numbers of armed and trained veterans, coinciding with rise of anarchism and Socialism (usually blamed on foreigners, usually subtly or not, eastern Euro Jews) as political threats to estab. order. Politicians made the same claims of increased crime rates and danger to society to disarm the law-abiding in what were already very low violence societies. England's first substantive restriction, for instance, was a licensing program enacted in 1920. Restrictions gradually increased to the confiscation of registered firearms and handgun bans of the '80s.  However, what is ignored is -none- of these laws shows a stat sig decrease in rate trends of homicide or violent crime from prior to enactment. They show -no- measurable impact on public safety. England, for instance, has had effectively the same homicide rate since 1860's.
You have to understand that to Tridentinus, his interpretations are infallibly correct. He has told us, more than once, that his opinions are "congruent" with the magisterium. Disagree with HIM, and he reads you out of the Church.  You must also understand that Trid wants, oh, so desperately, to believe that the magisterium has never changed a teaching. He can only maintain this fantasy through torturing the words of contradictory statements so as to make them somehow appear not to contradict. Thus, he has Vatican II saying that freedom of religion is a fundamental right somehow not contradicting Pius IX saying that freedom of religion is "an insanity". He has Eugene IV's statement that all Jews are damned agreeing with Vatican II's statement that Jews can be saved, just like everyone else.
Alexander Murrinson is a paid agent of Azerbaijan and it's dedicated mouthpiece. How interesting that he would find nothing positive about Armenia, n'or anything negative about Azerbaijan. How conveniently he forgets that nasty episode during WW2, the Warsaw Jewish Getto uprising. Everyone blames the German Nazy troops, but forgets, that in the final mop up of the surviving non combattants, The Azery SS volunteers were enthusiastically going house to house and bayonetting the children, the women the elderly.  Murrinson is a Jew who makes us all look bad. Shame on him and shame on the publications that spew his vile hatred.
Wasn't Einstein an Atheist?  As such, he would not have been qualified to serve as president of Israel.
I am an atheist, but I will defend Imago Dei as NOT being one of those evangelical churches that gets involved in right-wing politics or campaigning. They are involved with the social needs of the community, including the poor and needy. (Their discreet homophobia and misogyny notwithstanding.)
and Christianity and Judaism isn't?  LOL
It is a propaganda piece to tell us that war is bad for everyone, no matter what side you're on or if you're even involved at all. Sure, all of you can discuss whose fault it is, but none of that matters for all the kids and families who have no blame to share. Are Israeli bombs devastating to innocent Lebanese families? You bet. Are Hezbollah rockets devastating to innocent Israeli families? You bet. Israel is not bad. Jews are not bad (*). Lebanese are not bad (*). Bombs and rockets are bad. See the difference? (*) generally speaking, most of them, for the most part
But flocks of Jews are now converting to the Catholic church as they feel  sorry for so many empty pews on Sunday.
Uller, care to back anything you say with anything?  Trump silent on Jewish threats until it is rubbed in his face numerous times. His main advisor is a guy that ran a paper with anti-semite values.  What propaganda are you talking about? How do you assume it is not nazi's attacking the jews?   I think you have demonstrated your inability to provide facts.
I dunno. About three million Canadians today have German roots, and in the USA, about 50 million Americans trace German roots - German Americans are the largest of the ancestry groups reported by the US Census Bureau in its American Community Survey and accounts for about  a third of the total ethnic German population in the world.  So if you do not want to be surrounded by German blood, I am afraid you are out of luck.  Your post is a bit bizarre, though - in its silence about whether Canada should have done better with JEWISH refugees from Germany in that period of history...
You are aware that the disabled were forced to 'identify' themselves with the star,  and that the disabled were the people that the extermination experiments were conducted on long before the Jews were treated in such a manner........right?
The Law Society of Upper Canada has refused to accredit  a future law school because of rules that would prohibit legally married gay couples from having sex - and you call them 'social justice warriors'.    Would you still call them 'social justice warriors' if they refused to accredit a law school that put major roadblocks in the way of Jews being admitted, Demento?
Canada needs to pass laws that separate the Church and State. _ Islam, Judaism and Christianity are same religions, all with dead teachers for over 2000 years. Three dead religions. _ These religions are used to control people, for statism. They have nothing to do with spirituality. _ Christian are 80% of Canada or post-christians. They are either scared of Islam or accept Islam. Since the 60's the US Christian have been creating war with Islam with Jews in the middle. - We need to be rid of these cults once and for all. Keep them out of our government is the first step. Then our of our legal, medical and schools system.
A similar case has already appeared in the SCoC, R v Keegstra. The guy taught his class that the Jews created the holocaust in order to gain public sympathy because he believed in a Jewish conspiracy. The SCoC found that although a teacher has the right to freedom of expression, Section 1 can be used to limit such freedom in cases where the accused is in violation of laws, or in violation of another's rights held under the Charter.
or amish communities.....  or Mormon communities......or Russian orthodox communites....  or jewish neighborhoods.....  or anyother village or neighborhood is inhabited by the same kinds of people......
"The Nazi went after German Jews and Aryan Germans later." . The Nazis went after "Aryan Germans" ?   Really ?  How amazing !!!
The Scouts are dying for many reasons.  I took my son to a Cub Scout meeting when he was of age - can't remember how old now - and but as part of the process, I learned that he would have to pledge a religious oath. I was a Cub Scout back in the day and don't recall doing that. As an atheist I felt uncomfortable having my son make a pledge that my family could not get behind - so no Cub Scouts for him.  It's not the "gay agenda" that killed the Scouts. It's changing times.
Michael Schill is another JEWISH troublemaker(mother Coplon i.e., CAPLAN) from NEW YORK.  The JEWISH BIBLE BOOK LEVITICUS STATES THAT HAVING SLAVES IS PERFECTLY PERMISSIBLE & RAPE OF SLAVE GIRLS IS PERMISSIBLE. IT ALSO STATES THAT THE DENATIONALIZATION OF THE JEWS' SLAVES IS THE #1 PRIORITY SO THEY CAN BREAK THE SLAVES' SPIRIT FOREVER. LEVITICUS ALSO SAYS THAT BEING GAY IS WRONG. LEVITICUS ALSO STATES THAT FIELD WORKERS ARE ANIMALS & THAT ONCE SOMEONE IS YOUR SLAVE, ALL THEIR PROGENY ARE SLAVES FOREVER. MAYBE MICHAEL SCHILL & JEWISH PEOPLE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR OWN BIBLE & ISRAEL'S RACISM & THEIR WHOREHOUSES(STOCKED BY WHITE WOMEN FROM RUSSIA & EASTERN EUROPE AFTER BEING KIDNAPPED IN ALBANIA & TURKEY) IN TEL AVIV & HAIFA VISITED EXCLUSIVELY BY BUSLOADS OF ORTHODOX JEWISH MEN INSTEAD OF RUNNING GUILT-TRIPS & MIND CONTROL GAMES ON THE WHOLE PLANET. BY THE WAY, AMERICA ONLY IMPORTED 3.5% OF ALL SLAVES FROM AFRICA, SO BLACK PEOPLE GO ASK FRANCE, BRITAIN & PORTUGAL FOR MONEY. GO CHINA!
Folly for the lemmings following our Marxist feminist gender bender commie loving and sellout to Islam leadership!
1,600,000,000 muslims around the globe need to rise up and forever stamp out radical Islamic terrorists.  They should be able to accomplish this with sheer numbers.  They know who they are.  Muslims execute women and homosexuals, why not terrorists???
Of course I am judgemental, I see an apparent atheist trying to convince others to lose what little faith they may have left.  I find that very disturbing .   You definitely have an issue with providing a clear answer without ambiguity.  I think I know exactly what your intentions may be, and that is a concern.  I'm sure you will disagree.
President Trump has been the most pro-Isreal president to date.. why would you hold him responsible for any anti-semitic acts? Why not blame the only people who still, to this day, hate jews? (im referring to the religion that literally preaches about killing jews.. and it rhymes with ShmIslam.)
When 10,000 Jewish scholars examine those self serving archives and give the church a clearance then we can be sure they are true.  Also, if what you say is true then why did Pope John Paul II apologize before he died. Surely, he knew the contents of the archives.
So now that I provided evidence we are going back to you arguing your original (losing) point?  I did not disagree with your position that  "there are cemeteries who do not accept other faiths". My comment was only and only to your "Try getting a plot in a Catholic or Jewish cemetery if you are not of that faith." post. I repeated this a few times. You conceded that non-Catholics can get plots in certain catholic cemeteries. What's more to discuss?  Absolutist? Is that a bad thing?
Jewish fella says what?
I was born and raised in Hawaii, but have lived 30 years in Bali and have known more friends and neighbors who have passed on than back home. The Balinese are Hindu-Buddhists, and when they die they are cremated and their ashes dispersed at sea or in a river. The big difference here is the belief in reincarnation and ancestral worship; the soul returns in their descendants, and eventually after many rebirths becomes a divine ancestor who is worshiped in the family temple. Of course their practices are unique. I've heard of other options in the USA, such as burying the ashes beneath a tree so that it becomes a living symbol of the deceased. Is that common in Hawaii at all? Or incorporating the ashes in the clay used to make a special pot or vase to hold flowers on special days to remember the deceased? There are more lasting options...
Doug Saunders - old brand , old spin.   25,000 Jews have left France for Israel, the US, Canada and Australia in the last 3 years.At the rate they are leaving there will be no Jews left in France in 10 - 15 years.
These religious-based arguments make the faith of the next appointee a big issue. Currently we have three Jews and five Roman Catholics. Not exactly a representation of America. How about an atheist to replace Catholic Scalia?
Aaron, just WHO is this "homeless Jew" you are constantly referring to?
He was an atheist, like you.
You are ignoring the Chinese that were prohibited and what we did to the Japanese.    FDR denied entry to an entire shipload of Jews  in 1939.    You are too Eurocentric in your historical "knowledge", even such as it is.
Gene, the democrats are not in charge.  The republicans are.  Even here in Alaska. Second, the nation was not founded on Judeo/Christian principals.  Third, when Obama was elected he was accused of being everything from the AntiChrist to a Muslim operative.  Fourth, Hillary never said she was against Christianity.
An anti-Semite with  Jewish grandchildren!  You will twist anything to match your biases!
Two killed by bears in separate incidents - Wrong time wrong place, humans are much too religious or too "educated" atheists to pay attention to the Cosmic Code jurisdictions and use my wisdom...

"Don't you mean "Zionist influence" ...wouldn't want to do anything to reduce Zionist influence since historically been such a peaceful calming influence. Not." - TheDunthorpeMD.  I've heard that MD's are prone to drug abuse.  Not sure I ever met any that were abusers.  But if you're actually an MD with access to dangerous drugs I urge you to seek professional help. Israel seeks to preserve it's lawful and historic existence in the lands Jews inhabited until dispersed by Rome in 70 AD. Without the ant-Semitic activities of Europe, especially Russia, during the centuries Jews resided in the region there would be no Zionism. When the Arab states surrounding the nation quit trying to destroy it there'll be no need any longer so seek assistance and support from other nations.
Art, Jews are not just a religion. It's a nation. A nation with a homeland. That's why Jews don't seek converts. 600,000 Jews died defending Jerusalem from the Romans, who lost 80,000 men in the battle. Then every year, for 2000 years at Passover, Jews would pray "Next Year in Jerusalem". They said that every year for 2000 years until 1967, when they finally made it back. In contrast, Palestinians lost Jerusalem in less than 24 hours, after suffering a few hundred casualties. Why do Palestinians deserve Jerusalem more than Jews?   This UN resolution ensures that both sides remain firmly gridlocked, just when compromise is most required. Palestinians will be able to point out with some justification, that the UN Security Council has already determined the border at the 1949 Armistice Line, or so-called Green Line. Israelis will then turn around and say Palestinians are not prepared to grant concessions.Worse, it makes it impossible for the incoming Trump Administration to make headway.
Arabs are not entitled to get all lands left from the Ottoman Empire. Britain basically gave each of "its" Sheikhs a country.  None of the minorities were given lands, except for Jews. Israel is 0.01% of the lands, taken by Arabs, yet the Arab states still fight their Jihad to get the whole land for themselves and leave nothing to everyone else.
Not true! 270 Million est killed by Mulism, 80 million Hindus alone! Check your facts !
In 2011,  the author Lubimor Luciuk was involved in a campaign against a Holocaust  exhibit at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.  Part of the campaign involved the dissemination of postcards across Canada that depicted Canadian jews as pigs who controlled the government.
Say what you will about the Jews, but they are pragmatic and learn quickly what security measures actually work and what are mere fluff.  After the Lod Airport (now Ben Gurion Int'l) massacre way back in 1972, they went so far as to erect machine gun emplacements in full view of the traveling public.  A different society and circumstances one might argue, but I don't see any airport in the United States going that far even if an attack resulted in scores of casualties.  It hasn't been nearly as well publicized as the first time, but yet again in a real-world test, this time in July at Minneapolis-St. Paul Int'l Airport, TSA screeners failed to detect 95% (17 out of 18) of replica guns, explosives and drugs brought up to security checkpoints by "red team" agents.  This is comparable to the dismal results from 2015 where 67 out of 70 articles of contraband got through.  The lessons we have yet to heed?  One, is that you get what you pay for.  Two, is that you need to learn from mistakes.
Many laws were legal?   Do tell.  Anyway, thanks for reminding us you still think half of America are quislings.  Even those of Jewish background.
According to their religious beliefs, the Jews, Jesus and Muhammed all go back to Abraham.
Yes, and perhaps you could begin unlearning. Who appointed you the defender of all things clerical, conservative, et al.? Dante put popes in Hell.  Langland in Piers Plowman decried oppression of the poor. There's a strong Catholic tradition which corresponds to many of the values of the Democratic party. It's Catholics like you, and the majority of white Catholics voted for evil, was the catalyst that made me take a step I've been wanting to take for some time: converting to Judaism. Now you can have your smaller, purer church.
Franklin Stahl is obviously right here.  Jewish Zionists are clearly responsible for our local outbreak.    They must have agents everywhere, even apparently operating in Eugene.  This is a completely reasonable thing for any rational and sane person to assume.   Stahl is most definitely not off his rocker.  Would anyone here question Stahl's sanity, or believe that he is biased?
Disraeli became Anglican as a child, when his father left the Jewish faith converted.
In 2003, there was little doubt among m0st western countries that Saddam had or was acquiring nuclear weapons and already had WMDs in the form of poison gas he used on his own people.  And there was no doubt among western leaders he was the most dangerous, destabilizing dictator in the ME who started at least two wars, paid bounties to families of suicide bombers, vowed to eradicate  Israel and the Jewish people, murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people, repressed 80% of the population of Iraq (five million fled left to get away from Saddam) to reward his Sunni tribesmen, squandered millions from the UN in the oil for food program to build palaces while spending about $100 a year per person on health care, and laughed at 15 UN resolutions.  US and allied forces took him out quickly.  But they lost the peace to Al Qaeda and Saddam loyalists until Bush's Surge Strategy routed Al Qaeda.  When "general" Obama withdrew the US forces and created a vacume, ISIS eagerly filled it.
Yeah, I meant Lot, not Abraham. So, a bunch of men want to personally get to "know" Lot's guests, and become rather vocal about it. Lot refuses and the men get surly. So Lot offers to let the men personally get to "know" Lot's daughters. That's when God intervenes and blinds the men. Jewish rabbis have long said the town was destroyed because of the men's inhospitality towards Lot's guests. But, if we go along and say the town was destroyed because of sexual immorality (homosexuality), why was it okay for Lot to offer up his daughter as a sexual plaything? Isn't that just as immoral?
There appears to be some confusion between mandating universal participation in religious events (the Lord's Prayer, Christmas and Easter events) for all students as opposed to simply accommodating specific students' needs for their religious practices (prayer rooms).  I would oppose any attempt to mandate religious participation by all students in any public school. On the other hand, I see no reason not to allow students (Muslim, Christian, Jewish, whatever) to use an unoccupied classroom as a place for prayer.  I don't see what is accomplished by screaming at others or throwing a temper tantrum. Religious accommodation has no impact on the greater student body and is largely unnoticed by people who do not participate. If Christian or Jewish students request an equally reasonable religious accommodation and it does not get approved, I will happily protest with you.  Up to now, I've seen no rational reason to oppose this accommodation except naked religious hatred.
Like clockwork, the Divider in Chief is given a script to read in the attempt to make him seem less insane, and 24 hours later he makes his poor speech writers cry by doubling down on the crazy train.   I'm sure the "nice people " who were chanting "The Jews will not replace us!" and the Hitler favorite "Blood and soil!" are very relieved to have their leader back again.
Jesus appears to have been a Jewish reformer without an interest in creating a new religion. Christianity was a "post-Easter" affair that began as a Jewish sect and assumed a variety of forms in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Obviously the Pauline, Gentile strain survived to become the basis for "orthodoxy."
say "Jews" not "Jewish"
"Except for the racial element" --- my friend, you just answered why your point is incorrect about my thoughts pertaining to the 1%. And, being a Right-winger, you can't claim anything related to anti-Semitism, considering that Donnie Moscow has inspired the white knights to claim that Jews and other religions—along with many ethnicities—do not belong in white America..."  Well... okay... I'm just going to tip-toe away before this madness becomes uncontrollable.   Donnie Moscow sends his love.
"i find it interesting that another finite resource are jobs and yet, the far left has no issues with giving these jobs to illegals that will send the wages out of the nation, rather than pay taxes."  Move on, folks, nothing new to see here.  Just the same old xenophobic rhetoric that has been used against the Irish, the Chinese and Japanese, the Jews, the Poles, the Slavs, the Serbs, and now the Latinos and Middle Easterners. Same old, same old fear and loathing of the "other", couched in the language of economics.
Umm. You guys do know that a Jewish house of worship isn't called a "church", right?
No.  What you said only holds if we can you assume that the logical starting position is that there is a god.  If we look at the balance of evidence in support of atheism versus that in support of religion (nothing excpt people's feelings and fait) the logical starting point is that there is no god.   An atheist can  say god does not exist because there is no evidence the he/she/it does exist, and everything that we have observed to date has a natural explanation (ie. not supernatural).
"Ayaan Hirsi Ali was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. She has also received several awards, including a free speech award from the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, the Swedish Liberal Party's Democracy Prize, and the Moral Courage Award for commitment to conflict resolution, ethics, and world citizenship.   She is an opponent of female genital mutilation, as well as a feminist and atheist."  But apparently she's not aligned closely enough to the dreamy fringe to avoid a gratuitous drive-by smearing from our resident female genital mutilation fanboy here in the Globe comment section.
This question has been asked throughout our nation's history. Will blacks damage a white community? Will Jews damage a Christian community? Will LG's damage a straight community? Diversity is fine as long as you think like me. Will the bigotry ever end?
"Podesta responds by mentioning the creation of Catholic in Alliance for the Common Good and Catholics United.". Rather misleading, the actual quote is “We created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this. But I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up”. Certainly an admission that the Democrats created these top down phony front groups to try to undermine Church teaching. I don't see how any Catholic can say this is not a scandal.  MSW failed to mention the racism at work as well, also from Podesta "Some groups of people are almost always highly successful given only half a chance (Jews*, Hindus/Sikhs and Chinese people, for example), while others (Muslims, blacks** and Roma***, for instance) fare badly almost irrespective of circumstances"
Murder is "illegal taking of life."  Indeed it is.  Abortion, then, quite obviously is the legal taking of someone's life.  It is legalized murder.    Just because abortion is legalized murder does not make it morally justifiable or morally correct.  Hitler had the Jews killed legally.  Do we see anyone defending the Holocaust based on that?   Tell me--if abortion is not murder, why should we work to reduce abortions--or so no one needs them? To coin a phrase, what difference does it make?  If abortion does not take the life of an innocent human being, what difference does it make whether women want to choose it or not?  In short--if I didn't believe that abortion took the life of a human being, I would not care about abortion!  I care about punishing people who murder innocent defenseless human beings.  We treat animals better than we treat the unborn.  The sad thing is that you and people like you think there is nothing wrong with this!
When I was young, my father taught new Canadians who had come here from European refugee camps after the war. Most Sunday afternoons for many years we had visitors to our home who had been my father's students. Among them were several men and women who had been imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps. Some were Jews and several that I remember were 'gypsies'. Needless to say, they were all quite happy and grateful that they were now Canadians.  After a time, they all found jobs and many started their own businesses. The visits became less frequent and eventually stopped as they settled into Canadian life.   Canada was at one time deserving of its reputation as a haven for refugees. Is there any reason that our country of 35 million people, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, can no longer accommodate such as small number of immigrants and refugees? Have we become that fearful and selfish?
I know who DD is... my point is he is a despicable nobody. He and his followers haven't been relevant in a while.  Liberals loves to point to him and others like him and exclaim, "they are the heart of the Republican party and Nazism is alive and taking over and republicans are all xenophobic".  Which is a lie. Do Republicans have fringe groups? Sure. Do the Democrats have fringe groups? Sure. But the ones calling in bomb threats and destroying Jewish graveyards tell a very different story, even though you may not see it. In fact, history has taught us. (freeheels) you can deny it all you want, but he Democratic party and its followers have made hate and antisemitism a party platform for more than 150 years.  Do some research watch the video I linked to and see for yourself.  I particularly like the part where they pan to the audience at the 2012 DNC convention and you see the people yelling "NO". Very telling indeed. P.S. who was it out helping to clean up that mess in the graveyard?
Christian have been creating war in America since the 60's. A war against men, a war against drugs, against freedom, against sexuality, against the internet, against language, against islam (with jews in the middle.)  All we want is peace but as long is there religion in Canada and the USA i won't happen.Canada is particularly bad off because it is written in the Constitution, special rights for religion which we have to keep paying for.
You're describing a social product not the Church. Jesus wouldn't recognize most of the churches in the US today. The Christian Church met on Sunday evenings, not in the mornings and they gathered the poor together and fed them. The Christian Church met in buildings that already existed. The Christian Church let everybody show up in regular clothes with no preference towards banker attire. The Christian Church never taught "tithing" knowing this is a Jewish doctrine and not Christian. The Christian Church shared everything with each other and confessed their sins to each other and those obviously not keeping with Christian doctrine were put out of the Church while today's churches look very similar to every other organization in the country, same alcoholism stats, same divorce stats, same abortion stats, etc.   Check out 2 Timothy 3 1-9.
since you have a deep understanding of the quran, do you care to share islams solution to atheists?   spin these qurans for me:  - But as for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will be cut out for them; boiling fluid will be poured down on their heads; Whereby that which is in their bellies, and their skins too, will be melted; And for them are hooked rods of iron.  - O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination - Those who disbelieve Our revelations, We shall expose them to the Fire. As often as their skins are consumed We shall exchange them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment Lo! Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. - As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.   let me save you the trouble.  '...i am reading them out of context'  right?
It's a long ride. It start with the Christians, then the natives, then the Jews, now the amazon women of Toronto, every group needs special identity and special right$$$ in Canada. It is an endless waste of time and money.
"It is not the priest who waves a magic wand to make a "holy sacrament" - it is the faith of the believer that recognizes God's presence."  So if a priest were to say Mass in the presence of 10 atheists, there would be no transubstantiation?  In order for you accuse the Church of sexism, you deny what happens at the Eucharist.
The Constitution is not a confirmation of the DoI. The DoI contains no mention of how the new nation will be set up. The Constitution does echo some of the language of the DoI in spelling out protections against violations of the rights of citizens - specifically when speaking of taxation, and in the 3rd Amendment - but the two documents have different purposes. They are both important documents, but mention of religion in the DoI does NOT mean that the Constitution endorses "Judeo-Christian principles".  The DoI does briefly make religious references: "... the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God ..." in the first paragraph, "... their Creator ..." in the second, and "... the protection of divine Providence ..." in the last. None of these is an endorsement of Judeo-Christian religion. The DoI states that governments derive "... their just powers from the consent of the governed ...", NOT from religious authority of any kind.
We Canadians routinely single out minority groups for special treatment around human rights. Look at the protection offered Jews after WW2, or the LGTBQX community.  Sure we have existing laws in place to protect Canadians of all types from human rights abuses. So technically it is not necessary to cater to special interest groups. However what is wrong with a symbolic gesture like this?  It certainly will not do any harm, and will go a long way to bolster Muslim immigrants to Canada.  I fully support it.
My religious holidays are somewhat different than Catholic's or Jewish (I am not muslim either).Should the whole country take days off when I observe my holidays? There are a lot more faiths in Canada, if we have time off to accommodate every single one we wouldn't get anything done.  Sat/Sun off might have been a Christian thing originally. It is now secular traditions and has nothing to do with Christianity or Jewry. Many (non-practicing) Christians mow their lawns or go to work on Sunday. Church attendance is low. Many Jews don't observe Shabbat.   Religion has no business in schools,workplace, government. Scrap the catholic school systems, let people make arrangements with employers: to go out and pray, to bank time for their own holidays etc.
I don't. Please explain why having a Muslim cemetery is more threatening than a Jewish, Catholic or Sikh cemetery? Or one that honours First Nations religions.
LFS: Good people march with Nazis? Good people stand shoulder to shoulder with those who are chanting, "Jews will not replace us" and other odious sayings.   I guess you and I might have a different definition of 'good' and I'll leave it at that.
Is there a Jewish or Christian organization that gets $300 million per year? I don't think any of that is relevant myself. But I'm not sure that their is.   The giving of the cash doesn't seem partisan, Harper loved his dude too. The issue here is political officials accepting gifts, which is illegal. It's not really up for debate, it is against the law to take a gift, whether or not it influences policy. It's also against the law to offer a gift to a political official or government staffer.
Tony, these groups, and the one that marched with torches last night in particular, were displaying swastikas, giving the Nazi salute, were chanting Nazi slogans. They chanted white supremacist slogans and chanted words for Jews and gay people that cannot be printed in the DP. What do you propose they be called?
If you carried a torch with those Nazis, if you marched alongside them as they chanted "Jews will not replace us" and "blood and soil" you are not a "very fine person", you are, at best, a Nazi sympathizer. At worst, you are a Nazi. If you stood and chanted with men and women who wore hoods emblazoned with confederate flags you are a KKK sympathizer. If you stand up for these people's good intentions and walk in solidarity with their "defense of cultural heritage" you are at least a fellow traveler in white supremacy, more likely a white supremacist yourself. Nobody marching with that crowd is a decent person, nobody. And they all had a hand on the steering wheel, as did Trump and his entire group of supporters, every one.
According to the Southern  Poverty Law Center.  There have been 867 hate incidents since the election.  Anti-Immigrant (200), Anti-Black (187), Anti-Semitic (100), Anti-LGBT (95). Anti-Muslim (49), Anti-Woman (40) and the rest a mix of others.  I find it interesting that Mr. Blair doesn't even mention anti-Semitic incidents in this piece despite the fact that hate crimes against Jews account for the 3rd highest amount of reported hate crimes and highest of all hate crimes against religious minorities.  Granted most of this article was simply quotes by others and Mr. Blair does have a link to a BBC piece that documents it all, including the anti-Semitic incidents.  I only point this out because it is further evidence of what appears to be long-standing bias at Civil Beat, something I have been complaining about for years.  Civil Beat is blind to anti-Semitism, even more so when the offender is an immediate family member of a top CB reporter.
"...could become...an upper middle class rich white church."  19% of Catholics (with incomes over 100,000 plus) of 75 million US Catholics = 14.25 predominately white million Catholics 44% of Jews (with incomes over 100,000 plus) of 6 million US Jews = 2.64 Jews 35% of Episcopalians (with incomes over 100,000 plus) of 2 million = 700,000 Protestant Episcopalians  from "How income varies among U.S. religious groups," Pew Research Center
Quite the double standard:  Notley is pushing for the promotion of secular values public schools,  but somehow objects to the promotion of christian, muslim or jewish morality in faith-based schools? Does the constitutional protection of the freedom of religion not apply in Alberta?
(most effective way to prevent radicalization starts at the community level) No. To prevent radicalization government has to stop interfering in Muslim countries. Note that every western country which has been attacked by Muslims had previously attacked Muslims. I would put the start with the taking over of land in Palestine. That was an attack on Muslims. They retaliated. No matter how justified the Jewish people were in taking land in Palestine, they should expect retaliation.  (Ms. Freeland concluded by saying that Canada stands “shoulder to shoulder” with Israel and supports its right to its security and to live in peace). That of course is an impossibility in its current position, with porous borders providing access to Israel`s enemies world wide.
Rule of Law? You mean, which allowed genocide and large scale looting?  Protestant Christianity? Right, that was why 6 million Jews were sent to the camps. Since they made the wrong religious choice?  In the 18th century, it was primarily military technology and organization that the west had a superiority on. A large part of the industrial revolution took place after colonization.
I am sorry the extreme right is NOT the only conservative movement now. This is typical liberal propaganda to smear those on the political right most of whom are more fiscal conservatives then social ones.    If you grew up in the UK in the 50s and 60s you should remember the economic policies that those left wing government had which nearly ran that country into the ground.  In Canada this is represented by Avi Lewis and the gang and I suspect Justin Trudeau..   As for the alt-right crazies they do not encompass all "white" people The did not include Jews, Catholics ( me ) and eastern Europeans. However sounds like you could join.
The text of the resolution repeatedly and wrongly refers to the West Bank and eastern sections of Jerusalem as “Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.” In actuality, the Palestinians never had a state in either the West Bank or eastern Jerusalem and they are not legally recognized as the undisputed authority in those areas.  Jordan occupied and annexed the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem from 1948 until Israel captured the lands in a defensive war in 1967 after Arab countries used the territories to launch attacks against the Jewish state. In 1988 Jordan officially renounced its claims to the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem.
The Anti-Christ? Love your Democratic Party. Just toss in a Clinton Jewish Law Degree.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3n9yjiuMLI
Well, that's an interesting theory, to which I would suggest: parsimony and Occam's Razor! Since this graphic represents a Catholic organization, I doubt it's meant to evoke a Buddhist interpretation of the Eucharist...
It is a good job the early Christian martyrs didn't have regard for "the legal lines between Church and State, when the state demanded that they bow down and worship the Emperor. Your State is demanding that Catholics stand by and do nothing whilst millions of unborn children are put to death and you advocate going along with it because it is rendering unto Caesar.
Yeah and it's ironic that Ivanka's husband is Jewish!  Guess Trump's German heritage wins out.  Do I hear the clicking of boot heels?
"It is extremely disappointing that the Prime Minister will not support Indigenous peoples, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, Christians and other faith groups who believe there is truth in their religion," he said on Facebook.  What a naked demagoguery by the leader of the Conservative Party!  How about those scientists, who belong to the above mentioned faith groups and contributed to the advancement of humankind? Are they also traitors of their faith-based communities?
The land actually legally already belonged to Israel in the first place, it was captured in 1967 war from Jordan who occupied it illegally for about 17 years. During that time they ethnically cleansed West Bank of all jews, through expulsions and massacres, They also destroyed many ancient Jewish temples and other historical sites.  Jews could not even enter Jerusalem at that time. After 1967 under Israeli control Christians, Jews and Muslims all live and pray in Jerusalem in peace and security.
Why Christians??? We should give priority to atheists and agnostics. They tend to score much higher in IQ's than people who believe in 2000 year old fantasies and fairy tales.
I heartily agree. Angela Merkel showed such grace in the face of our president with his Neanderthal manners and self-serving "jokes." I found myself wishing she were our president. She has also shown real humanitarian instincts in her welcoming so many refugees. I read that she is a atheist or agnostic, but she definitely shows more Christianity in her actions than our president and so many of our cowed legislators, in  my opinion.
As an atheist you are as religious as anyone.  You have a world view and framework you hold to in understanding the universe and existence.  These positions are not fact based as no means of knowing ultimate truths exists.  You simply prefer the atheist religion where religion is defined as a system of understanding existence.
Take notice how the supporters and defenders of the white supremacists (including Trump) are trying to make this about violence. Yes, the violence has to be dealt with, but the ISSUE here, folks, is white nationalists and neo-nazis spewing their racist, anti-semitic hate. There is no middle ground here. There is no equivalency. On one side you have people who want to purge America of Jews, minorities, and immigrants, just as the Nazis in Germany attempted to do in their country. On the other side you have people who are against that. The fact that violence erupts does not in any way make the two sides somehow equivalent. One right and one is wrong. By not condemning the wrong, you are supporting it, accepting it, enabling it; it's that simple. Which side are you on? Which side is our president on?
Fight over the right to breathe? Next up with be Holi, with loads of colored powder thrown around. I hear that the Ganges is badly polluted, but devout Hindus still bathe in it to cleanse themselves spiritually.
I was raised Unitarian but have always been Atheist.  I've been saying it for a while now, what is the deal with all these militant 'christians' ... they should be praying for Peace but most definitely are praying at the alter of personal greed and war.
I refuse to vote for any political party with an overtly religious leader. I don't care if it's Sikhism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever, I will not vote for the NDP until they elect a leader who will put the signs of his religious beliefs aside; religion should always be a quiet personal thing and not on public display.
or take for instance ...there are no female imams, muslim women are relegated to different areas of the mosque,  and if a women, jew or a dog walks in front of a muslim man while praying he has to stop and start the prayer session all over again.
To Moebiexl - BILL CLINTON - "In 2000, at Camp David, Israel offered Arafat a state. He rejected it." . “I regret that in 2000 he missed the opportunity to bring that nation” — Palestine — “into being,”  was Bill Clinton’s  bitter verdict on the summit’s outcome." . Within two years Arafat was calling on a million “martyrs” to march on Jerusalem. . "Arab states tried to annihilate the Jewish nation, yet Israel remains unforgiven for its crime of self-preservation" - Bret Stephens: Special to National Post | The New York Times - June 5, 2017
Why Allan, the one word I changed in my post was "Christian". And it kept getting censored, yet when I changed it to Muslim or Islam, the post wasn't censored. Isn't that amazing?  This post censored once already....why is "christian" a dirty word to the progressive left?
There were no "very fine people" on the side of the white nationalists, Nazis, fascists and Klan. Even if one grants that it's possible to oppose moving Confederate symbols and statues from public property without endorsing racism and slavery, no "fine" person willingly links their cause to the Nazis and Klan. The torch rally was not a candle-lit procession; it was eerily reminiscent of rallies by the Klan and the Nazis. "Fine people" don't march along with folks who are chanting "Jews will not replace us"; who believe that Trump is not racist enough because he "gave his daughter to a Jew." There was no moral equivalency; the president's moral blindness is on full display. This does not justify violence from the left, but it also does not support the preposterous claim that both sides are equally to blame. The blame falls squarely on the morally repugnant racism of the alt-right and the president who embraces them and is embraced by them. The fact that Trump is a racist is not news.
The Church, bishops and cardinals are not seeking the justice position.  The candidate is a Catholic, as is her right in this Country; or should only atheists, lapsed Jews, and Democrats be judges?
In addition to myself, how many other posters here do you stalk and harass and misrepresent not just on The Globe forums but on other forums (as you have just admitted here in regard to me)?  I also post on an invitation only board founded by a Jewish lawyer out of New York who has created a lively discussion forum involving accomplished people from several countries and professions and the spectrum of political, economic and social views.   Would you like me to arrange an invite so that you can proffer your mindless, juvenile clap trap there, too?  Do you think there is an atheist's chance at The Vatican of getting this invite from me?  Actually, there's no fool like a young fool, especially a young Liberal fool who will believe anything - twice.  Now go away.
For your information I am David's uncle, his mother is my sister.  Secondly, I'm not telling anyone what to believe.  People are grieving and sharing their thoughts.  However, an atheists weighs in and feels it's the appropriate place and time to try and discredit our beliefs.  Don't turn this around on me.  Nice try.
Very early on in this discussion, you posted the following: " Atheism, on the other hand, much to your chagrin I'm sure, is a religion." That comment, and various others, indicated that you were arguing that atheism was a belief SYSTEM. Now, in this smug post, the tune has changed. Suddenly, you win the argument if I admit that atheism means not believing there is a God. This is the very thing I've been saying the whole time. Notice that you failed to use the word "system" once in your last reply. Also note that although you have continuously referred to atheism as a belief system/religion, you never capitalized it.   I believe (see what I did there) that people who identify strongly with a religion have an innate need for order, organization, a power structure and meaning. Encountering people (atheists) who reject that is difficult if not impossible to understand, perhaps even threatening, so the religious categorize atheism as a belief system to avoid staring into an abyss.
"When have the leaders of PLO and now, Hamas, ever refused to speak with the Israelis?"  For last 8 years or more they refused face to face negotiations...remember it was Abass not Netanyahu who walked away from the Obama brokered negotiations even after Netanyahu meet all of the negotiation preconditions like release of PLO prisoners and freeze on building of new settlements.  And Israel is a "The Jewish State" right now and despite that there are around 20% Muslem Arab citizens in it, plus other minorities of other religions. Palestinian plan all along has been to turn Israel into a Muslim state, and then to rename it, right after ethnically cleansing it of the Jews.
Well it wasn't an atheist that came up with the Big Bang Theory for one.   It was a Jesuit priest.
Your analogy is seriously flawed. The Jews in question were fleeing annihilation by Hitler and the Nazis. Many of the individuals who are now being denied entry into the U.S. are adherents of a violent and odious ideology that is akin to Nazism.  Like the Nazis, the members of the crescent moon death cult seek to kill Jews, gays, Christians  and anyone who opposes their totalitarian aims.
Who do you think the Zionists are.....Ewoks?? They are Jews, Freddie...Zionists are Jews. The reason why I wrote about all Jews committed war crimes is because you insisted you haven't commit one when I stated that our nation has done so in the past. You individualized it, implying that individualizing Jews as well. You wrote it, not me. With all your "statements", you have yet to offer any solution to this problem. What is your solution, Mr. Minshall.....do you have one? Or all you got is extreme exaggerations to spread around?  What is YOUR solution to the problem in the Holy Lands?? Do you have some ideas right? Some thoughts?
What other " countless people" have repeatedly gravitated back to their original homeland of 3000 + years after having been violently expelled and reexpelled?  Not being Jewish myself, I see much to be admired in the persistence of a people that others have attempted to eradicate and still wish to do so.
Not being an atheist, I'm not. Nothing is special in our universe: certainly not humanity. HLB
Clearly, the list of (and violence against) targetted groups in the US (and Western society generally, including Canada) is growing as the disaffected angry, nihilist fringe grow and increasingly feels they have licence to come out from the shadows where they have always existed to attack whoever they blame, by whatever means and for whatever reason that strikes their fancy.    Energized by demagogic rhetoric which creates the illusion that such hate and its methods are mainstream and such outbursts normal, groups from this fringe begin by targeting the Mexicans, Muslims, etc but quickly expand their hit list to include groups targetted in past generations such as the Jews (and can Blacks, Orientals, Feminists, etc. be far behind).  Society must get at this contagion of irrational hate at its root causes before it metastasizes further.
I love Ben. There is a difference between JEWS and ZIONISM, Rick.  Zionism stands for oppression, racism,abuse of children, illegal occupation, murder of the Palestinians, which I don't support.
The Holy Spirit came to sanctify the Lord's disciples ----men and women----enabling them to preach the gospel.  Amazing that Peter and the rest stayed in Jerusalem preaching in the Temple.  Why didn't they go out to build new churches immediately?  They believed themselves to be Jews [as they had been their whole lives].  They did not think of themselves as different.   Jesus did not reward the Pharasees, the Scribes, the Lawyers of the Law or the High Priests---who believed that their righteousness and following the law would save them.  And Jesus did not always go after those who repented.  He sat with them, FIRST.  Where did the lost sheep repent?  Or where did the lost coin repent, when the woman [feminine version of God] go looking for it?  God ACTED FIRST in our behalf.  God did not wait for us to come repentant first.  You changed your name here---but you still preach the tired and false message.  God so loved the world.....
From what I can gather from the article - I'd say this is true, but only to an extent. There are, after all, around 1,8 billion Muslims - around 1,5 billion Sunnis. Surely, 1,5 billion people cannot be the problem; the problem are the few thousands who use Islam for their own agenda to justify their barbaric actions. There are equally bad people who use Buddhism (see Burma) or Christianity (see Central African Republic or Lord's Resistance Army or Irish Republican Army) to justify horrific atrocities.   If religion is just an excuse for despicable actions - and it seems like it is - then looking at the underlying reasons behind despicable actions could be a better strategy, perhaps.
Have held off replying to your last post because there’s so much wrong with it that adequate refutation involves addressing at least four of your earlier posts to point out the inaccurate and contradictory nature of your arguments; and I’ll likely exceed the “civil” character-count limit a few times to get it done.  But here goes--you said:  "...Did I say you committed war crimes or did I say our nation committed war crimes? The reason why I wrote about all Jews committed war crimes is because you insisted you haven't commit one when I stated that our nation has done so in the past. You individualized it, implying that individualizing Jews as well. You wrote it, not me."  You said WE committed war crimes—in normal English usage that includes ME.  And again, I haven’t done so, nor will I approve, defend, rationalize, minimize or accept responsibility for war crimes done in the name of the American people (one of whom is, again, ME).  (CONTINUED BELOW...)
No big deal. The IEEE Pacific Rim Conference at UVic overlapped with Ramadan 4 years ago, so we kept the buffet line open past sunset. No biggee. Even accomodating Halal is no different from accommodating requests for  Kosher, Beef Free (Hindu), Vegan, or special diets such as Renal Failure (low sodium, potassium, phosphate, ...)
The term "Koinê" for the "dialect" of the NT is accurate, but misleading. It's the same as Attic Greek, with just a small number of changes, here and there, in spelling, morphology and syntax. Then there are a few traces of Hebrew or Aramaic expression, "semitisms," esp. imitating the great Jewish Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures that is the foundation of Catholics' Old Testament, viz. the Septuagint. Also, the NT authors each has his own style, Mark, John and Revelation being pretty simple, but Hebrews and the deutero-Pauline Ephesians and Colossians being more complicated and affected (and ugly IMHO; Oscar Wilde said somewhere, "One of the principal arguments against Christianity is the style of St. Paul," and I suspect he meant Eph and Col).  My degrees are in classics, but my interests are quite theological, e.g. regarding the Near Eastern and Greek pantheons. Lately I'm studying the development of the cult of Yahweh, or better (I think), Yahûh (Yahoo!).
There were no Buddhist terrorists seeking retaliation "for attacking Buddhists" during or after the Vietnam war, or the Korean war.  Because not only is it against Buddhism, but because it never occurred to Buddhists to do so, or that the US was "attacking Buddhists".
More problems with the English language, Ascalepius.  As pretty everyone knows, anti-semitism means "hostility and prejudice directed against Jewish people."  I'm sure you know it, too.
It is actually incorrect; the Nazi swastika has its arms at an angle, not parallel to the horizontal or the vertical.    What has been drawn is actually the svastika in Sanskrit, and it is an ancient symbol of auspiciousness in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.
The Romans executed Jesus for treason against the state.  To declare oneself the messiah, as it was understood among the Jews in Palestine at that time, was to present oneself as an heir to indigenous rule and in opposition to Roman rule.  Jesus' ministry was, in essence, in complete opposition to the Roman empire.  (Which is why the Gospel of John had to be manufactured at a later date than the Synoptic Gospels, to make Jesus less of a threat and more palatable to Roman audiences.)
Moreover, Chaim Weizmann had assured Truman that the new state would be secular, then requested recognition of a "Jewish state." Truman crossed out these words, substituting "state of Israel."  http://www.al-nakba-history.com/origins1948/usrecognition.html  Palestine, unlike the other long-recognized cultural-political regions within the Ottoman Empire and before, was never allowed to become a nation due to its seizure and dispossession by Zionist terrorism.  It had never been a "country" because there had been no countries.  But the UN Charter established self-determination of the majority population as the guiding principle for post-colonial emerging nations, a right denied Palestinians who were 2/3 the population in 1947-48 and owned 94% of the land, which was not the UN's to give away.  Secretary of State Marshall and Secretary of Defense Forrestal strongly opposed Truman's recognition, but facing NY Gov. Dewey in the upcoming election, he said "I have no Arabs in my constituency."
I gave Jews as a specific example, mentioned by name in Cantate Domino.  (Is there a way of getting italics and other HTML in Civil Comments? The user guide is silent on things like formatting.)
ThomasPaine:  Thank you for this information.  Here's a wikepedia citation for those who might not believe you.:   "The use of triple parentheses or triple brackets, also known as an (((echo))), is an antisemitic symbol that has been used to highlight the names of individuals of a Jewish background. The practice originated from the far-right blog The Right Stuff; the blog's editors have explained that the symbol is meant to symbolize that the historic actions of members of the Jewish ethnicity had caused their surnames to "echo throughout history".[1] The triple parentheses have been adopted as an online stigma by antisemites, neo-Nazis, and white nationalists to identify individuals of Jewish background as targets for online harassment, such as Jewish political journalists critical of President Donald Trump during his 2016 election campaign.[2][3]"    I agree with you that it constitutes overt anti-Semetism and should be removed.  Again, thank you for the information.  Gary Crum
sky  Most of the Jews in Germany disavowed extreme Judaism by the early 20th century.. It didn't help them
Why is it you 'christians' aren't very Christian these days ... I'm just curious.  Atheist Liberal here.
The problem with the peace process is two intractable sides and our efforts to influence/coerce/force/bribe both into acting like grownups and sitting at the table with the common goal of peace. Unfortunately, this article - and the UN resolution on which it's based - is a perfect illustration of how not to help. The resolution that Jerusalem, and sites like the Western Wall, have only an Arab history is kind of... obscene. Why would there be a thousands year-old Western Wall for the Jews if they hadn't been there before 1948? The holiest site in Judaism is the third holiest in Islam - how can that be if the site has no Jewish history? The only rational solution will be a shared Jerusalem - erasing its history would be outrageous for either side. And validating this is beneath us all.
So, what is she going to do? Double down on easily verifiable facts? Will she try to rewrite history, maybe try to justify attempts by the Ukrainian nationalists at ethnic cleansing? Perhaps she can hide the Ukrainian complicity in the Holocaust in the German occupied Ukraine? The only way she can come out of this with any credibility is by being upfront about established and verifiable history. Having a Jew hating grandfather does not make you one. Hiding that fact makes you a suspect.
Arlene,  since you only first became aware of Brietbart a few months ago, it's totally understandable that you didn't look up who became Editor-at-Large in 2012 when Bannon took over as Executive Chair-- that would Ben Shapiro: Orthodox Jew. . It's also totally understandable that you find it "unusual" that a black Republican lawmakers, homosexuals, and black leaders clearly support Bannon : because it doesn't fit the Leftist narrative that "we control who's a victim, and if that victimized group dos' support us, they must clearly not be a "real" member of that oppressed group." . I'm not "defending Banon," I'm simply telling you that in order for you to label him him the nasty things you are-- it sure would be swell if you could produce a single piece of evidence to prove it.
I'll be curious to see how Mr. Trump's Jewish son-in-law continues to 'advise' his father-in-law in view of the tsunami of anti-semitic hatred Trump's supporters are unleashing.
That doesn't appear to be a Colorado town hall.  That's Kansas and you should show the GOP marching with torches saying "Jews will not replace us" to be fair in that case.
I believe Lee is to be admired for his effort to unite the country after he lost. Also, his statements against displays that kept wounds from healing. And I'm fine with museums, history books, etc. And I'm always glad to hear of people such as you, who believe blacks should have equal opportunities as fellow citizens.  I wasn't born a person of color, I'm not Jewish, I'm not Muslim, and I'm heterosexual --none of this by choice; it's just the way it is. In short, I don't face their challenges.   With this understanding, and also after spending time with coworkers and friends who do face discrimination, it hurts me to see their hurt when they share some of their experiences. And some of it is darn ugly for no other reason than people judging them based not in fact, but on bigotry.
Bob Lacher - You have a right not to believe the truth of God's existence. I have a right to believe. Neither of us has the right to force the other to believe differently.  But, your assertions display incredible ignorance. Naziism, which was a godless ideology despite the lip service Hitler paid to the pastors in the beginning, killed about 10 million people. Soviet Communism killed 20 million. Chinese Communism killed at least 30 million. Gather up all the other godless dialectic struggles around the world during the 20th century and you're looking at about 100 million people killed in the name of "No God."  Historical records are sketchy because past eras didn't keep records or those records rotted, but anyone who does study history can figure out that those "dogmas" you so deplore have killed far fewer than the "Godless" coalition has.  I'm not saying those killings were right, but that clearly "dogmas" have demonstrated more restraint than atheists.
Ah, Malcom X's speech from the movie is most appropriate at this time it goes like this: I'm not here today as a Republican or a Democrat or a Mason or an Elk or Protestant or Catholic, Jew or Christian .... and We been Had, we been Took, we been Hoodwinked,  we been Bamboozled, led Astray, Run-amuk, this what they do." SO, if especially during the Special Session your rep's don't over-ride Walkers joy ride this quote goes double. And you will see it again and again and again!
I think Kerry may have been right about several things, but I suspect he's wrong when he assumes that Israel would allow Palestinian Arabs to outnumber Jewish Israelis in any meaningful way. I suspect Israel would relocate many people to specific areas that can be secured and controlled -- as ironic as such a move would be for the historical Jewish community.
It is no surprise that granddaughter of Ukrainian nationalist and Nazi collaborator "warns Canadians to beware of Russian disinformation".  What else would she say? Can we expect her to tell Canadians of how Ukrainian nationalists were mass murdering Jews and Poles  during the war?  For example, out of 1500 persons involved in shooting of tenths of thousands  Jews at Babiy Yar near Kiev, 1200 were Ukrainian nationalists.
What does YOUR Jewish son-in-law say about it?
Please read the paper- Paris, Brussels, Holland, attacks on Jewish institutions, businesses and individuals. Not hard to find Roy. One doesn't have to be a bigot to look at hard truths and this is one. The last to presidents of France have had to go out of their way to reassure French Jews that they are welcome in France to the level of fear- and the fear is coming from attacks by radicalized Muslims. I don't condemn all Christians for outfits like the KKK and Westboro- but I'm not going to be willfully blind and deny they exist.
Canadian non-Muslims need to show solidarity for the existing Constitution and Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  And equating "Islamophobia" to anti-Semitism is deeply troubling.  The Jews faced a horrendous holocaust of astronomically diabolical proportions.
Why are you so obsessed with this angle.  Could it be that you are embarrassed that he is a violent, gun loving, righty?  I think you might be trying to pain him as a lefty since in your mind the left are not Christian and are atheists - which could not be further from the truth.  Just curious.  I just googled it and I see it all over.  He also taught bible school.  Apparently he was very confused about his religion.  Perhaps something bad happened to him as a child while in church.  Who knows?
It only took a few thousand to hijack Germany, impose martial law and create space for the sadists, racists, misogynists, anti-humanists, and the fearful, hateful, and angry to take out their frustrations on those who no one wanted to defend -- it started with political opponents (the 'left', the liberals, the socialists -- those so hated here on the Globe and Mail by the bitter 'right'), it spread to homosexuals and intellectuals, and then the disabled.  Then they imprisoned the Gypsies, Slavs and then those who were Jewish.    The commentary here on liberals, on welfare 'cases', on immigrants, on increasing miminmum wages at times has the same hateful rhetoric that allows some hate-filled racist to march down south.  We have no higher moral ground when we allow commentary that categorizes everyone by one characteristic-- whether their race, origin, gender, sexuality or class/status/income.
Saudi Arabia very progressive democracy having a very good record regarding, gay rights, Christians, Jews and other religions. Respect for women and open to all views.
Palestinian Arabs already got their homeland in Jordan, and Jordan takes 80% of lands allocated for both Palestinian Arabs and Palestinian Jews.   Now they want to have TWO Palestinian Arab states.   Everyone sees, that this new Arab state will be extremist, poor militant and will cause troubles for Egypt, Jordan and Israel. That new state already refused to accept Palestinian Arab refugees!  Why is it that only Trump can say: wait a minute, who needs that new state???
I think that the Catholic response to the current politics of our country is completely appropriate for NCR as what NCR talks about is the religious response to the political situation. When St. Maximilian Kolbe went to his death to protect a Jewish father during the Holocaust, one could argue that his actions were only political (against the Germans and for the Jews), but that would miss the action as truly Catholic (protection of life, the poor and unwanted).
Well, working with members of the media means one has inserted oneself into surroundings wherein douchbag-density is considerably higher than ambient.  Example, back in the 80's a long-time friend of mine from Columbia started to make it in Hollywood doing character parts in such shows as 'Baywatch' and "Silk Stalkings'.  But he was always cast as a Columbian drug lord.  The final straw came when his (Jewish) director harangued him in an embarrassingly stereotypical, nasal New York accent: "C'mon!  C'mon!  Act like a Sp1ck!"  He walked off the set and has never looked back.  He didn't sue or anything--but then my friend placed higher value on dignity than on money.
I have had two long term relationships with hard-core atheists. (I am not particularly religious)  Biggest Christmas supporters I have ever seen. Insisted we set up trees decorate the house, you name it..  I could never figure it out..
Wow, some nastiness in this thread.  Can we set aside politics just this one and only time and resoundingly and with a united voice condemn this action and tell the Jewish community of Alaska that we, their fellow Alaskans and Americans, absolutely and unwaveringly do now and always will stand with them and will consider an attack on them as an attack on us all?  Is this too much to ask?  Because if it is, then our country truly has lost its way entirely.
Niddah 44 b provides that "A girl of the age of three years may be betrothed by intercourse" while Sanhedrin 84b  http://www.come-and-hear.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_84.html#PARTb  is silent on abortion.  But, since we are not pre-Christian era Jews, let's examine this as though we were Catholics.  Self-defense involves an action directed toward an unjust aggressor so to render the aggressor unable to cause harm (see CCC 2265).  Self-defense also requires intending only stopping the aggression, not killing the aggressor.  But direct abortion is always directed at killing the fetus and the fetus does not meet the definition of an aggressor. The fetus is unable to will to be born, or will to cease causing harm, or in fact exercise any control at all.  http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius11/P11CASTI.HTM  paragraph 64
Self delusion.  That's funny.  Reality is with people, not oft repeated scripture designed for the national brand identity of the Jews in exile.  Marriage is how people assert the adult right to form their own families and leave their families of origin.  Jesus says that.
If he had converted to Judaism  or to become a Lutheran woudl that be a story ?  The gist of the story is the Islam is superior to us.
It reminds me of the ship loads of Jews who were turned back in Montreal, New York even Havana at one point; or the shipload of Indians who were turned back in Vancouver . This is too much for a person's little mind to comprehend. What have we got here? What is going on? Just because a president  puts his signature on a policy, doesn't mean it doesn't have to go through congress or lawyers, really? The US  is moving fast on authoritarianism which eventually means you know what. Sad time.
A guy named "Weinstein" considers himself a conservative?   I wasn't always an antisemite, but I'm learning.   Jews wish to topple this president.  That will enhance the standing  of Jews in America?
For Jerry Falwell to praise Trump for standing with racists, bigots, white supremacist and people who believe Jews and blacks are inferior to whites makes him one of them. Jerry, where is your Christ-like character? As a Liberty-alumni and a pastor I find it abhorrent that you are standing with David Duke and white supremacists. This is wrong! BTW, Trump has nothing to do with jobs, the stock market and the economy. The trajectory were all in place from the Obama Admin before he took office. Actually he claimed the job numbers were false every time they came out under Obama because they were so good. Now he believes in them. It's a joke to say N. Korea is backing down. This is the White House talking points you are parroting. I received their email  with the same nonsense. Trump's reckless rhetoric  is shameful. Where are the faithful Liberty Univ deans like  Drs. Wilmington, Towns, Hinson, Gutierrez, Borland to save Liberty's reputation that Jerry is dragging in the mud?
Canada needs to pass laws that ban the indoctrination of anyone under that age of 18 with religion. Christian, Jew and Muslims etc.
Isn't the headline a total oxymoron?  An atheist regards Jesus of Nazareth as being, if he existed at all, a mere mortal no different than any other.  What is there to celebrate on December 25?
A few days ago, Donald Trump explicitly and specifically denounced racism, bigotry, the KKK and neo-Nazis. Yet according to this editorial, when Trump said there were good people on either side of the statue issue, he was really praising a white supremacist Neo-Nazi that can't stand Trump's daughter being married to a Jew.  This editorial is NWOC- not worthy of comment.
We buried my father almost two years ago. He was not a None, but he was a Jew. He said his prayers intermittently, kept most of the commandments most of the time, was a somewhat reluctant regular at the synagogue, and didn't really believe in anything supernatural. So I found out what people do at the end of life if they don't believe in an afterlife.  My father strove to make the most of every single moment of life he had left from the moment he was diagnosed until the moment he fell dead. Earthly life is precious to people who don't believe in heaven. Once next year became irrelevant, he stopped thinking about next year and turned his attention to the next day.   When it was over, he was buried with the traditional Jewish burial ritual. The whole thing took about fifteen minutes, because the balance of Jewish opinion on death is that nobody knows what happens afterwards and all one can do is hope for the best and leave it to God, if He exists.
"Jews culturally appropriated it -consider it NYC pidgin."  Oy vey, now that's not kosher:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQhwNtY3N2k
excluding Jews and women is NOT the same as excluding people who want to have pre-marital sex the Human Rights Commission defends women and Jews I don''t think it defends the RIGHT to have pre-marital sex just do it but don't except that the world would universally approve   to clarify I am all for PRE-MARITAL sex  by the same token i won't be applying to Trinity Western why make life more complicated?
Well, you reject what the Church teaches on such subjects as Religious Liberty, Revelation, Salvation, the status of the Jews and non catholic sects, Ecumenism, the nature of the Church.
My post is completely factual, so I'd love to hear what folks dislike about my post.  And here I thought atheists loved facts and science.  Do you not know what atheism is?  Or do you not like being informed what atheism is?  Not sure which, so please enlighten me.   I will await a thoughtful response which follows one of two courses: 1) you can prove God/gods don't exist through the presentation of irrefutable evidence or; 2) you can prove that my definition of atheism is incorrect by posting a recognized dictionary alternative and disproving the existing of mine.  Or, you could just admit that I'm right, cause I am.  :-)
I am sad that so-called-Christians are only Church-goers.  READ the Gospel of Matthew Ch. 25:31-47.  Christ enumerates the areas in which the Final Judgment rests.  It's not about adhering to the politicalizing of a president who would be dictator, but of recognizing that ALL are God's children and ALL are welcomed who do for others--often SEEN as the LEAST.  Jesus never subscribed to the Jewish desire to see themselves as the ONLY favored people of God.  And we should not look at others as OUTSIDE of God's love and concern.  During the rise of Nazism in Germany---the bishops of Germany told the people to OBEY the governmental leaders.  It was 15 years later [1958], when they finally condemned the Holocaust.  As far as "killing the Catholic church"---it is time for the Church to realize that it cannot put up walls---but bridges instead.  BTW---most of the Hispanics who sought refuge ARE CATHOLICS coming up from dictatorial countries south of Mexico's border.
You have watched too many episodes of House Sanford Silver. Let me give you a quick lesson in the history of Israel. For starters the people who currently run things and constitute the majority of the inhabitants living there have no, none, zero historic claim to that land. They share no DNA with the original inhabitants...None.    These aren't semitic Jews SS making it hard to blame anti semitism   Are you even aware that Jerusalem and your sovereignty, together with your temple and priesthood, have been destroyed for over 1,460 years?
Bruce MacDonald423: Christians and Jews, what few remain, continue to this day to be persecuted and expelled from their homes in the Middle East and yet these former Liberal Cabinet Ministers and all current Liberal Cabinet Ministers remain silent.  Do you consider this "whataboutism" and therefore irrelevant?
lintymint: Your comment reminds me of this article:  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/pope-francis-warns-about-dangers-of-fake-news/article33237167/  "Pope Francis warns about dangers of fake news"  To which  the G&M commenters responded:  "Peasant Philosopher Dec 7, 2016 That's rich!.......Coming from a man who builds his entire life around the basis of faith without evidence!"  "M_G Dec 7, 2016 As an atheist I find this ironic on so many levels."

The far left .... that's communism and frankly I don't see that anywhere in this country. What I see is a left leaning group that supports rights for women and all people. One that treats all people in society with dignity not just the well healed. I see a left that still has both poor and wealthy citizens but just not as extreme as what resides in the dreamscape of the American right like those of the Tea Party wacko's and most of the GOP.  That left also supports religious freedom from not only Christians but Muslims or Buddhists.  Only a narrow minded person would think there is some sort of far left movement here. You need to get outside of Breitbart news more often.
As have countless societies that were not Jewish so what is your point?  1967 borders and be done with it.  Instead Israel lives up to everything that bigots have said for hundreds and hundreds of years about them.  Of course political correctness forbids us from discussing what was the point of contention for bigots all these millennia....despicable behaviour.
And here we go again...the problem is he's white, or he's male, or it's an assault weapon, or he's a Democrat, or he's a Repub, or he's an atheist, or he's a Christian, or he's a Muslim...blah blah blah blah...  No, the problem is he's an American.  Americans don't have respect for others' lives.  If they don't get what they want, or if they have to sacrifice something for others, or if they're scared, they justify killing other people.    We never turn the other cheek, or treat someone how we want to be treated, or sacrifice and offer kindness to receive the same.  We're simply a violent culture that takes what it wants, and we never take responsibility when we're hurting someone else.  It's always "their" fault.
The dog and cat eating "myth" was common in the 80's. Over time, we tend to remember the outline of what we had "heard" but few facts. As with most of these things, there is usually a grain of truth that gets emphasized. 1982 N.Y. Times: "...there has been growing resentment among some lower-income whites, as well as blacks and Hispanics, who feel that the refugees are taking jobs and housing that would otherwise go to them; and after some refugees admitted to news reporters that they often ate dogs and cats in their native lands, they are blamed whenever a nonrefugee family's pet disappears."  I asked a friend who had managed housing with Asian immigrants. Many had never seen a range top or oven. He said a few tried to make a fire on the top of them. I am sure they only tried it a few times. In a land of diverse lifestyles, what is "our culture"?  Isn't it at least the effort to accept other cultural norms: Atheist, Christian, Jew, liberal, conservative, green, consumer, media, etc.?
Posts talk about how Trump in 2017 is accomplishing what Hitler accomplished in the 1930s.  That reveals a shocking degree of pampered parochialism in their thinking.  Right now the TV is on, NBC from America. The first reports were these:  - Trump's bans against Muslim majority countries are causing chaos for travelers of many types - The tweet from Justin Trudeau is read out word for word ("... Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith...") - a Muslim mosque in Texas burned down last night, and investigators are probing it as possible hate crime, having arrested a local man for a hate crime a few years ago involving that mosque.  Hello?  Germany's 1930's press was no conduit of empathy and facts about minorities. Indeed, Goebbels, the government master of newspapers then, fired all Jewish journalists in 1933. Cartoons of Jews as rodents then appeared, and claims that Jews needed blood of Christians for rituals.  Get a grip. America is not 1930s Germany. Not even close.
Jews did nothing to provoke these attacks and remember who the majority of the perpetrators were.
Atheist Texas killer hated his Christian in-laws.  Obama military failed to incarcerate felon and failed to register him so - under *current* law – he would not be eligible to buy, own, or possess a firearm for life.  Retired NRA instructor shot killer and stopped the rampage cold.  Nonetheless, debate on gun ownership has many possible positions that Catholics can advocate. But arguments should be factual, rational, and devoid of sentiment and passion. [NOTE: to save responses, love is a virtue of the will, not a sentiment or passion. Thank you]
Israel is a rogue nation, a pariah state, for no reason other than its own conduct-- a state which places one group above others, based on religious differences.   Your attempts to characterize critics of Israel as "jew haters" is just part of the hasbara you deny exist.  You seem to forget that not all Israelis are Jews, and not all Jews are Israeli. In addition, not all Jews are Zionists, and not all Zionists are Jews.   Zionists should stop conflating Israel and Judaism. One is a state, the other is a religion.  Conflating the two, as Netanyahu has done, for example, is anti-Semitic, because it suggests all Jews support Israel's illegal conduct towards Palestine and Palestinians, when in fact, a great many do not.   If someone criticizes the Vatican over its policies, is that "Catholic hatred"?   Or do you suggest Jewish people, or the religion, or Israel, are special or exceptional compared to the other faiths, or states, extant in the world today?
Many Muslims, Jews and other religions dont like the fact that Christmas and Good Friday
Facebook Allowed Advertisers To Target ‘Jew Haters’.png Today, ProPublica published a bombshell report showing how Facebook allowed advertisers to select anti-semitic categories to target certain users. Facebook apparently has ad categories such as: *Jew Hater *How to burn Jews *History of why Jews ruin the world Really. Well, if you are trying to target groups of Nazis, White Nationalists or just super angry white guys who want to dress in matching polos and khakis while carrying tiki torches, you may want to select these categories. And Facebook is totally there for you! At the end of the day, Facebook is a business and their product is YOU, the user. They will take any money they can from advertisers, because that is their business - selling access to you. So if you are a Nazi, they will market that. And to the right company/group/political candidate/hostile foreign government working on behalf of a political candidate, that is what they are looking for - Nazis.
Mnuchin, notwithstanding his sterling pedigree - 2nd gen Goldman Sachs, private schools, Yale, Skull & Crossbones - and the enormous wealth he has accumulated, is a sniveling nebbisth with a clear sense of "I'm really out of my league", particularly when life is measured by anything other than money. On his 3rd seemingly lily-white shiksah (a gentile girl when married to a jewish guy), he still needs to validate himself to these airhead blonds; one was set up with an art gallery, the other cashed in on a super-duper-prenup, and this one, Linton, is so full of herself, that Stevie-poo needs to keep her interested - trip to fort knox for the eclipse, gov plane to europe.  He's just a sniveling weasel whose sole role in life is to lower taxes on the wealthiest of Americans so his ex-partners at Goldman Sachs will finally accept him as more than an impotent little drone with money making talent.

The intolerant left will not abide the presence of a non leftist...they will not abide the presence of  Jewish man...they will not abide the presence of a conservative.   The left insists on lock-step fascism.  Anyone that is not in lock-step will be shouted down, harassed, and in many cases assaulted.    In left-wing America, don't you DARE be anything other than left-wing....or you will regret it.
As far as explaining Primacy of Conscience you already know that you and I have different concepts of it. Inviting the couple to to delve into scriptural commentaries is exposing them to false interpretations as well as genuine ones. Human nature is such that the choice of interpretation is likely to be that which favours their desires. You did not say that they should be apprised first and foremost as to how the Church judges their situation. Presumably Jesus regarded marriages between Jews as being joined together by God, hence His words, "whom God has joined together, etc". St Paul was referring to gentile unions which he obviously didn't regard as 'joined by God', so he wasn't overriding Christ.
no, it is an atheist country actually.  Are you talking about immigrants or refugees?  If the later, how do you know that they are struggling, or struggling any more than the Jewish, Viet, Hungarian or other refugees we have taken in over the years?  Or are you against immigrant and would prefer our population to decline like Japan where they have an elder care problem?
WHy you picking on Mormons?
It is not based on judeo-xtian law Only place religion is mentioned in legal documents is to push it away from our law. Wingnut judeo/xtians want to put in place their own form of sharia, and we'll fight them off too.  Biblical values, if xtians followed their holy book, is as bad, and we won't have it here. Tell it to toxic xtian talking heads and preachers who say women shouldn't have positions of authority or be teachers, shouldn't have control over their own fertility.
It's a racial one. You need to study the history of Arab and Jew to understand this.
Sure, and when the plane goes belly up and nose down the atheist starts praying and the priest forgets to. Fear has powerful effects at the moment you experience them. Now try this one. You are 72, home alone but have a gun. 4 huge guys are outside throwing rocks through your window and kicking in your door. Where do gun right stand at that moment?
Actually the Ashkenazi Jews were derived from  Khazar tribes in the East, who only assumed Judaism as a religion but had no genetic relationship with the Biblical Jews. yet they predominate in Israel and  claim a direct descendance from Abraham as the rightful inhabitants of today's Israel (given to them by God himself) To quote Minister Dlamini, this is another smallanyama of their history. It is interesting though, that in Israel the Sephardic dialect of Hebrew has become the official language. Perhaps you know the reason why.
In reverse order....1. the insistence on the right of return has made the two state solution impossible.  2. It may be true that European Jews spear-headed the founding of the State of Israel, but they were doing so on behalf of all Jews, including the 6-700,000 who moved to Israel from all over the Middle East, and you don't get to tell the Jewish people who gets to lead them.  Jews get to do that...which is what self determination is all about.  The "death and dislocation of the Palestinians" was minimal when compared to the death and dislocation of Sikhs and Hindus when India was partitioned, so if that was far greater level of dislocation was justifiable to accommodate Muslim self determination in India, then the far lesser level of dislocation is also justifiable to accommodate Jewish self determination, in some tiny part of the Middle East where Jews have lived continuously for 3,000 years.
Too many requests for accommodations leads to a backlash  How come Hindus, Jews, Sikhs, Buddhists, evangelical Christians don't ask for religious accommodation?
im with harron on this one. uh is 97 years old. imagine if the policy in 1920 was, our faculty will reflect our community at large, and our student body in particular. white men protesting her statements remind me of white southerners that think its ok for black people to have to walk by a statue of lee to get their driver's license or for an atheist, buddhist or other religious person to have to walk past the ten commandments to file a land transfer document. public property is for the public. college students should expect to be taught by people that look, talk and act more like them. we all have biases, cloaked in the guise of values and unwittingly impart them to young minds. time to stop it. this lady is spot on in 2017.
I guess those Imam's in Canada who were shown preaching about killing Jews and non believers have been charged with hate crimes?
The shooter's blog is full of atheistic rantings.  Atheists are responsible for the pogroms of Christians, Jews, and other believers.
The Jews hadn't had a political/legal system since the fall of the Hasmonean Dynasty to Herod.  Even the Sanhedrin said that they had no power to put someone to death.
You misread my comment. That is the favorite response of the atheists, that due to fear of Hell is the only reason I attempt not to sin. If I was informed hell did not exist I would suddenly start committing all types of crimes and sinful behavior.   That is nonsense, I try not to sin due to my moral character as well as the fact I don't want to offend  God.   My only point is that hell exists, as is mentioned in the Gospels, and hopefully no one ends up there.
for those in the media and commentariat who are afflicted by poor health - too bad soo sad - maybe u could cover the garden show or the bridal show - save the martyr victim routine u chose this if it too much for u leave it nobody cares that u r hurting Millbank, do the world a favour and drop dead if you​ so chose or do like a Buddhist monk and self-immolate if ur angst is more than u can bear - that'll teach the people for electing somebody u cant agree with now wont it
Barry's last vindictive move against the Jewish state. But he is history... bad history.
Who's "rioting violently"? Resistance protests have overwhelmingly been peaceful affairs. The rash of anti-Semitic bomb threats and vandalism of Jewish tombstones is a right-wing eruption.  Authoritarians dangle the specter of anarchy to quash dissent but authoritarianism is itself a vector to totalitarianism. Just a reminder: Steve Bannon, who now occupies a powerful position  in the White House, described himself as an "anarchist."
Refusal to release funds belonging to Jews in Occupied France.  Chase Manhattan Bank acknowledged seizing about 100 accounts during the Vichy regime.
I know from your previous comments that "accommodate" is a pejorative for you, but that's how civilized western countries handle significant differences.  We don't call it 'kow-towing' to provide reasonable accommodations for jewish, mennonite, hindu, sikh or muslim Canadians.  It's part of what makes us civilized.  It's part of what makes us different from Saudi Arabia, for instance.  And continuing to lie about the existence of 'no-go zones' doesn't help your argument.
Just imagine if  the nominee were Jewish and a senator was questioning their faith.  Is there an analog to antisemitism for Catholics?
I always find it galling when people attempt to exonerate the hierarchy for their actions and inactions during WWII. A Jewish/Catholic group have continuously been refused permission to view the Vatican archives of that period. Wonder why?  However, there is absolutely no running away from this one for the US Bishops. They supported this maniac. I mean, just how can any of them come out and criticise Trump now without making themselves look like the complete eejits that they undoubtedly are?  And by the way, the good ol' Bishies have done nothing to enhance the cause of the anti-abortionists. If anything, they've damaged it.
Countries that ban entry of Israeli Jews:  Syria Iran Iraq Yemen Libya  Algeria Bangladesh Brunei Kuwait Lebanon Malaysia Oman Pakistan Sudan Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates
EKBlack's post has all the hallmarks of an internet troll. The comment seeks to push buttons and disrupt discussion. Consider the phrase "sanitize the nation into political correctness". What does it mean? Political Correctness is Right Wing code for the suppression of racist, sexist, and homophobic opinions. There's some crazy belief on the Right that one isn't truly free unless one can hurl abusive language at women, people of colour, or members of the LGBTQ community.  I have no idea what brutal one-liner cartoons EKBlack is recalling. But I can imagine racist images of Jews, Asians, and Black Africans which were all too common in the first half of the 20th century. They express a public sentiment of oppression and White superiority. I don't see why anyone would be nostalgic about them.  Why is the language of the Right always "brutal" & "hard-hitting"? There is no truth in threats and intimidation. Racial and misogynistic slurs are not "truthful comments" we need to hear. Shame!
10 percent of Indonesia is Christian, 1.7 percent is Hindu, 0.7 percent is Buddhist. 87 percent are Muslim https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Indonesia#Religions  While Jews make up 1.2 percent of the US population, and control a good section of the US economy, there still is no Jewish public holiday. Because in Christian countries, non Christian holidays are not allowed. It is enough that non Christians are allowed to live in the country, and allowed to practice their religion.In Indonesia, all religions are given equal respect by the law.  For every Saudi Arabia, there is a tolerant Muslim country like Indonesia. In fact, Indonesian has 6 times more Muslims than Saudi Arabia.  Something most people on this forum know nothing about.
About to get much more interesting. This link includes screenshot pictures etc. --  "Texas Church Shooter Was Antifa Member Who Vowed To Start Civil War"  ...Kevin Kelley’s Facebook page stated that he was an atheist and his interests included “Civil and social rights” and “Civil rights” as well as endorsements for local Texan Democratic political candidates. His page also featured photos of several high powered weapons....  His Facebook page was taken down without explanation less than an hour after the shooting.  http://yournewswire.com/texas-church-shooter-antifa/amp/
A Muslim follower of Islam attacked, shot, maimed and killed many innocent people in a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey.  There many verses in the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers.   For decades, Muslim followers of Islam have been attacking, maiming and killing innocent, civilian non believers in the Middle East, in other parts of Africa, in Europe, in Australia, in Asia and in North America.  Scholars say Jews, Christians and Muslims are all people of the Book, the Holy Bible. They have the same God of Abraham. Jews call that God YHWH or Yahweh, Christians call that God Jehova or Lord. Muslims call the same God Allah (peace be with him).   Which group is following God's will properly? Is it Jews, Christians or Muslims?
Actually, sky, I'd say the author's concern is that 'cosmopolitan' has been used quite specifically to attack Jewish people.  ...Oh, and 'nativist' was used back in the 19th Century.  And nationalism has also been used quite effectively by anti-democratic authoritarians.  Your posting just ignores all this history....
I'm all for protecting our borders but the cost -v- benefit of this venture is highly questionable.  It's reminiscent of how Hitler built Nationalism by rallying Germans against the "enemy" Jews.  Smart people will figure out how to establish a Visa program that allows entrance for Mexicans to fill menial jobs that we won't.  Over time Visa participants could graduate towards citizenship.  Win for our economy (higher income tax collections for starters)--win for the Mexicans--win for business owners struggling to fill menial labor positions--win for our national budget by sparing billions pegged for the wall--win for other programs such as Social Security (which is for Americans who have labored for decades) that could have billions funneled to it instead of the debacWALle (I should trademark this one)....
If Freeland had blamed Jews for all the wars in the world, ========================== So when she calls her Nazi grandfather - "fighter for freedom"- you accept that? Nazi were "fighters for freedom"?
Homosexual activity has been proscribed throughout the history of Judaism and Christianity.  There is no way the Church is ever going to change this so all these dissident organisations are wasting their time.
The Council of Florence says something of the sort (and even says the all Jews are going to Hell). If you want us to return to that dark past, remember what it led to.
Interesting observations, Stephen. I don't think you can attach the same significance to Jesus refusal to be pressured into fulfilling the deep-seated social justice aspirations and messianic expectations of 1st Century Jews that you attach to the fact that He didn't have children. He sure had plenty of affirmation for children. Why no endorsement of, or even reference to, the social justice activists and protesters?   The dog that didn't bark isn't always significant. But sometimes it is.   I agree that God inspired the entirety of Scripture. Does that mean we should have a theocracy? Should we have the death penalty? OT prophets condemned exploitation, dishonesty and disrespect for personal property and personal autonomy. We moderns all agree that what they condemned is immoral and illegal. OT prophets were not egalitarians. They would have drooled to have our rule of law. Christian social justice advocates engage in OT eisegesis in order to rewrite the gospel mandate.
I think history will show there have always been ethnic enclaves. Little Italy, little Portugal, little Ireland, little France, Chinatown, etc have all existed. Jewish ghettos existed everywhere in Europe till the 20th century. Because the gentiles didn't want them to stay in the same neighbourhoods.  And yet those enclaves change over time. Many of the ones in Toronto have been gentrified. Chinatown in Calgary doesn't have too many Chinese people any more. Little France is a yuppie neighbourhood in Calgary.  As for first world countries, they started out as third world countries whose inhabitants moved to the Americas. London was a disgusting rat infested city a hundred and fifty years ago. Ditto for Paris three hundred years ago.
I know, me too. I didn't want to type the whole dang thing but wanted to be clear. What the heck is a Wasserman test? As for the "Bernie is a Jew" thing, to be fair it was not Wasserman who said it, and that was as far as it went-part of the whole Wikileaks trauma was exposing the sausage making of politics, and lots of folks were a little shocked at that, I think. The DNC problem was that they were not at all impartial, and that is supposed to be the mission.
That is a terrible, heart-wrenching, and scary live feed. Fry rambling about altering DNA, needing some time with his blanket, and Fiore trying to pray him out only for Fry to announce he is a Messianic Jew. This mentally ill kid has been a pawn of the others the whole time, and now he is alone. He clearly is incapable of making a good decision about his future, and the presence of guns means no one can help him.
Envelopes were made to be pushed. I cite all comments as ‘good’ and ‘civil’ because I refuse to be an unpaid censor for ADN.  But my point was that, considering how routinely the so-called ‘liberal’ media excoriates and demonizes Muslims, it’s kinda hard to take seriously your hints that there’s some kind of insidious ‘pro-Muslim' bias encouraging Shannon’s criticism of Senator Kelly’s self-righteous hypocrisy while giving Muslims a pass on everything.  US political and media pundits routinely talk about us the way Herr Goebbels used to talk about European Jews.  Sorry for any big words.
Wow, scapegoating the Jews again!? Where exactly did you find he's an activist? I did not see that anywhere. A quick read of that guys blog shows he is  insane...he thought he was telepathically connected to her. Also he says his computer was hacked...maybe coincidence or maybe Putin & Co. found he was easy to manipulate and set him against her because of her support of opposition groups...
Is this now the Globe & Islam or why this heavy advertisement for a religion that is less than 5% of the Canadian population? Or is this part of a series? Then I am waiting for a similar story about orthodox Judaism/Buddhism/Hinduism/Christianity and so forth. Thank you.
More news outlets are deleting their commentary sites; the great liberal bastion the Toronto Star and CNN dropped theirs ages ago as they could not take criticism. Other outlets increasingly  only allow comments on safe topics. Others censor or ban anyone who upsets the apple cart by talking about sacred cows or elephants in the room: such as homosexuals and aids, or black crime, or overpaid civil servants,  Canadian Jews and Israel, or anything deemed politically incorrect. Of course it is okay to bash white Anglo saxon men or Muslims. But it is not okay to point out the  striking similarities between Orthodox Jews and Muslims and how they treat their women, or how a lot of Muslim men chase Christian and Jewish girls but we cant go near their girls. And it is not okay to talk about how only lower middle class Christian boys fight and die for Canada in te middle east wars while so many others hide out in elite schools. I wish some academics would address these issues objectively.
US(Jewish) judge????
You are wrong about Netanyahu and the Israeli public.   Neither support a viable Palestinian state. They want the status quo: democracy for Jewish Israelis, discrimination for Israeli Palestinians, and apartheid for the West Bank and Gaza.
More  details please! Please tell us what your OWN grandpa did exactly that people are now attacking YOU personally over as is happening to Freeland? But I suspect neither you nor your grandpa have been so  attacked which would mean your comment has zero relevance to Freeland's situation.  Btw, maybe you think German art galleries that discover they have art the Third Reich stole from Jews should just keep the art anyway on grounds that "Hey, our paintings may be stolen, but you can't blame us. The Third Reich did it 70 years ago so we're keeping them, even though we know who the rightful heirs are!" Sure.  "100 years ago" Yeah, right.
greenpeace single handedly destroyed the centuries' old sealing industry in Newfoundland. Seals now total 6,000,000 which has been a major contributor to the decimation the great northern cod stocks in the north atlantic.What greenpeace has done to Newfoundland can be likened to what Hitler did to the Jews. No , greenpeace didn,t kill Newfoundlanders, they just took away the livelihood  of past & future generations of our people , CONGRATULATIONS GREENKILLERS!
mira you help by providing what the root cause is and that is undeniable.  If you treat people badly they will not feel valued or worthy as human beings.  That is despicable that people were made to feel that way; equally so for black people, Jewish people, women (etc.).    But there is a striking difference, Black people,  Jewish people and women have picked themselves up and said I am every bit as good as anyone else and I will make a success of myself (in general of course); there is not a generational victimhood.   In there lies the solution......we all get the cause and effect of this...and it is dreadful, but it is the next step you are missing.  To always come with your hands out is psychologically counter intuitive and sets you back emotionally.    You are better than that.   With apologies to the thousands and thousands of our FN peoples that have already figured that out.
None of the Muslims I know subscribe to extremism, but positioning Islam as a religion of peace is a tough sell if they continue to open prayers with a call to victory over Christians, Jews etc.  Such has been reported by multiple sources, with one link posted below.   Worth a read.    http://www.torontosun.com/2015/01/13/muslims-shouldnt-pray-to-defeat-non-muslims
and yet here you are accusing the Jewish Zionists of mere 'excesses' against non-Jews in Israel and saying absolutely nothing about Israel's barbaric, genocidal treatment of ten million Palestinians since at least 1935.
Funny, the fact that universities are today bastions of anti-Israel sentiment seems to have escaped you.  In 1967, Israel was attacked by surrounding Arab countries, rendering it the clear underdog. The world loves Jews when they are the underdog. Once Israel proved that it can withstand the onslaught of its surrounding adversaries and enemies sworn to its destruction and elimination, Israel no longer attracts the weeping university types who love an underdog.
The idea that there are no atheists in foxholes is a tired and laughable concept. Totally without merit. It is simply an attempt to minimize atheists. Actually, there are more and more non-believers now saying out loud that they are no longer intimidated by what has been a dominant culture of beliefs in supernatural mysticism. About time! But societal changes work this way. Our country is slowly moving away from "White Privilege" and "Religious Privilege". It takes time ... but is happening. Good.   Regarding "taking Jesus into the voting booth" ... that is similarly laughable. Five people who claim that they "know" what any given god wants will give five (or more) answers to what it "is" that god wants. This means that the claim of "what god wants" is REALLY just a self-centered statement of "what I want". Why drag your deity into it? Why not simply admit, "I have my own personal opinions and desires ... and (for better or for worse) THAT is what I take into the voting booth."
what we see around us is the result of several generations being brainwashed in to believing we are nothing more than evolved pond scum, hominoids, animals, that are accountable to nothing. there is no god, and we can do whatever pleases us. and we are surprised that we are sinking in to chaos? mothers and fathers murdering their children, children killing their families, kids killing with abandon? and don't tell me religion is responsible for masses of murders- it is the god-haters and the atheists that have committed more murders in the past 100 years than any other group through all of history.
How many Jews are allowed to live in Iran and Arab countries,  Zero!  No wonder they want a country of their own.
I gave you a star because I agree that all religions and religious practices should be entirely removed from public schools.  However, admittedly, I am an atheist and have no use for religion. As long as the law requires that religious needs to be reasonably accommodated, I don't think asking to use an empty classroom to pray is unreasonable.  When I was a kid in school, I would get detention when I refused to stand for the Lord's Prayer.... now THAT was unreasonable.  Muslims may want to practice their religion, but at least they've never tried to force me to practice it... which is more than I can say for Christians.
Religious accommodation woudl include the establishment of a Jewish temple in every school too, But that ain't gonna happen.
Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a position she earned by the voting citizens of her district in Hawaii.  A Hindu-American from Hawaii.  Wonderful introduction of exotic flavors of curry spice and inamona.  A backdrop of political, military experiences rooted in a mix of multiple cultures and flavors.  She is a responsible, dependable, and well grounded in the reality of this world.  I trust her steadfast leadership and honesty, pa`a on a foundation of integrity and aloha.  Both necessary in our world of uncertainties.  She not only listens, she hears...a rare quality in today's politicians of "reality TV actors."
Isn't it interesting that the entire history of Judeo Christianity (and even the Judaism that preceded it, from Genesis on) is every sect declaring itself to be "the" church?  Every new reformation deems itself basically peerless, and the most authentic agency of God's will, over all others.  You'll fix this when you fix human nature.
Dennis, I think Jesus being a sacrifice is just a theme that would have resonated with Pagans of that time. But there are also passages indicating sacrifice is not suitable, "I desire mercy not sacrifice" and "you are worth more than many sparrows," etc. Yahweh would never accept a human sacrifice and Jews knew it then and still know it (story of Abraham's attempted sacrifice of Isaac).   Thanks for all your defenses of me, Dennis, very much appreciated !!! However, religion is just a hobby for me as I bide my time with medical adventures. I wasn't schooled much on religion, just Catholic high school, and I am actually very narrowly focused in my writing. But I try to be careful and factual, so maybe that is what you noticed. Thanks again.
We cannot avoid speaking of the World Trade Centre. Similarly, however, we must recognize the damage caused by the colonization of the middle east in the 19th century. As well, how can one avoid speaking of the creation and western support for a Jewish nation? It is a fact of history. How then can we face the Muslims who were disenfranchised, whose homeland was reduced to something that resembles little more than a penal colony?   Conversely the Jews were themselves exiled as they had been before. Coming from somewhere, yet belonging nowhere. Did they not, after the horrors of the Third Reich, finally deserve a home, historically validated, when so much of their world in exile had been laid waste? What were the former Jewish sections of Warsaw, Prague and Budapest now but rubble devoid of the possibility of life? Where was their home if it no longer existed?
The bishops' claim that they are defending religious freedom is baseless. Christians, Jews and Catholics have been elected and appointed to serve in all branches of the government. They have passed legislation that governs civil not religious life. It is the non-Western, non-Judeo/Christian religions that are threatened.  The Church does not have to provide birth control instructions, contraceptives or abortions, nor does it have to officiate at civil unions or divorces, whether same or opposite sex. The Church does not have to accept or minister to alternate lifestyle individuals and communities.  The Church does have the option of condoning personal arms, capital punishment, armed conflicts, nuclear weapons and environmental disregard.  The bishops are not defending religious freedom. The bishops are promoting religious license. They hope that Church will trump State. It is more likely that it is they who will be Trumped.
The Klan was big in Eugene and the rest of Oregon in the 1920-25 timeframe.    There were so few blacks, though, that they had to settle for nailing the American Flag across the door of the Catholic Church and picking on Jews.  Quite a few blacks came to work in Kaiser's shipbuilding yards in Portland during the war (Vanport, Oregon) so that solved the scarcity of targets, but by then some sanity had appeared.
Rampant anti-semitism within the National Front's leadership is entirely possible, and certainly disturbing if true, but it is difficult as a skeptical news reader to know if this is an accurate characterization these days given the penchant of left-leaning journalists like Saunders to throw these labels around loosely as a means of discrediting right wing politics in general. The era of taking people like Saunders' word for it is behind us, unfortunately.   Saunders' concern for French Jews is belied by his silence at the failure of France's mainstream parties at stemming the alarming rise of anti-semitism in that country. As has been amply reported in the news media, a veritable exodus of French Jewry to Israel has been underway for several years now (e.g., http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/22/middleeast/france-israel-jews-immigration/). Where is Saunders' outrage at Hollande and other mainstream politicians for allowing this disturbing trend to continue?
Why is the religion of the country relevant? Western troops have been in countries of many different religions. The troops were not there to fight Islam, but fighting to help one faction of Muslims against another. It is only relevant because some Muslim terrorists claim it is.  If we interfere in the civil war in Myanmar to help the Rohyngyas, will we later be accused of having interfered in a Buddhist country, or is religion only relevant when the country is Muslim?
Why does love have to require touching strangers?   There are other major religious cultures (Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam) where the people express fellowship without needing to hold hands or kiss.  Paul's letters don't define my practice of Christianity.     And Jesus was betrayed with a kiss.
History lesson #1 Adolf Hitler DID the exact same thing at one time........to the Jewish faith! Now it's Muslim's BLAMING one RELIGION for your problems makes you look just like NAZI Germany in 1938! THIS IS COMPLETELY UNAMERICAN!!!! TRUMPELTHINSKIN NEEDS TO BE IMPEACHED!!!!!
Ortho-toxic is a non-word coined as a pejorative with which to label those Catholics who are not persuaded by the persistent onslaught of progressivism. If the laws of the Sabbath were made for man then it behoved the Jews to keep them. In the Church there are two types of law, the Natural Law written by God in men's hearts, the Divine Law revealed by God in the Scriptures and Apostolic Tradition which cannot be ignored or changed and the Precepts of the Church which the Church has the authority to impose and remit. You don't seem to take this into account. Bishop Paprocki is only upholding the teaching of his Church, what else ought a Catholic bishop do? He cannot overrule the Law of God, Natural or Divine. Mercy which confirms someone in their sinful state is a false mercy. It can be likened to encouraging the Gadarene swine to go over the cliff. +Paprocki offers to all the prospect of repentance, reconciliation and a firm purpose of amendment just as Christ would have done.
If those three young men had been Muslims shouting "Death to Jews Death to Israel" nothing would be said, printed or done.  As happened in Calgary, leftists defend it as constitutional free speech and nobody says anything about it
exactly.  Allan Rock Mr. Tainted Blood and Axworthy are very selective in whose human rights they consider violated.  Christians and Jews need not apply
You know of course that Jesus was referring to the Jewish law here? Just how kosher is your kitchen, J.Bob? There are many jots and tittles therein to keep you busy complying for a lifetime, as it does most Orthodox Jews.
The man in the ditch was shown kindness. Do you know the probable reason the Jews avoided him?  Had the man in the ditch been there as a result of a just sentence of death, and the Samaritan took pity on him and saved him, that would have been mercy.  Your situation is the result of mercy. The Holy Father would have been completely just in refusing the request.  Personally I would refrain from this ongoing war against the Church’s discipline were I the recipient of completely unearned and generous indult.
Really? A Hungarian Jew living in Nazi-occupied Hungary was a Nazi? Please explain how that worked ...
Atheism is a belief system because there is no more evidence to support the assertion that God does not exist than there is to support the assertion that God does- namely none. Therefore, anyone making either claim is making a statement of belief. That's all Roland is saying. Maybe you believe there is no God, but you have no more evidence to support that theory than someone who believes that there is. In that way, atheism resembles theism, both are statements of belief, devoid of facts.
You are correct as to Stalin...But as you said he was raised with religion but became non religious. His actions speak to that fact. Hitler's mother was Jewish yet he chose not to follow the faith and persecuted them.  Religion was not driving those fanatics but a lack of a religion.  The Declaration of Independence proceeded the Constitution and  it gives references to GOD.
I don't have to 'know' what every Catholic thinks.  I have Catholic doctrine, catechisms,  all sorts of things where the Church tells them what to think.  I can get similar doctrinal publications from the Mormans, the Jehovahs Witnesses, the Baptists, the Lutherans, the Episcopalians, the Church of England; they all will give me their version of  'Christianity'.      You post your scripture, I post another scripture.  You post another scripture, I post another scripture. This goes on over and over infinitum and at the end you believe and I do not.  And neither of us are posting 'scripture' in its original tongue, unless you speak Aramaic or Greek or Latin.  It is too much trouble with no useful result.
How come there's no Buddhist terrorists?
Prgressivm :      Agreed and unfortunately Islamism is spread by the radical sect Wabbabis of Saudi Arabia in their religious schools or Madrassas throughout the Muslim world. It is also up to moderate Muslims to break this link to the Wahhabis. They don't seem to be doing a good job of this as evidenced by the visiting Imam to a mosque in Montreal who preached killing jews one by one; and apparently no Muslim in the mosque reported this incendiary speech to the authorities. Our government could best use their resources to combat Islamism (per example) rather than a mis-guided and wrong headed effort to combat Islamophobia by bill M-103. The sharia law of the Islamists provides for harsh penalties for criticism of the koran, Islam or Mohammed and it seems to me bill M-103 borrows from the ideology of the Islamists as it attempts to enshrine in Canada protection against criticism of Islam when in some instances, criticism should be made rather than covered up.
There is no proof that this is the alt right.  It is equally possible that it is the  alt left.  Both groups hate jews. Furthermore, the latter hates Trump and would be happy to set him up for responsibility..
Atheism is simply a denial or rejection  of claims there is a supernatural deity.  That being the case it has no structure.  Rejecting an unfounded assertion is a positive thing, practically speaking.
And of course, you never let facts stand in your way:  'He's the first private club owner in Palm Beach, Fla., to admit an openly gay couple, according to Laurence Leamer, the author of “Madness Under the Royal Palms,” a book about Palm Beach society. Mr. Trump made his club, Mar-a-Lago, more open partly out of disdain for the restrictions that barred Jews and African-Americans from joining exclusive clubs in Palm Beach.  "It’s one of the best things he’s done in my view in his life,” Mr. Leamer said. “He really changed the nature of Palm Beach.”  Rand Hoch, a gay activist who founded the Palm Beach County Human Rights Council in 1988, recalled bringing dates to Mar-a-Lago on two occasions. Both times, he said, Mr. Trump, who loves to play the role of greeter as guests arrive at his club, was pleasant and approached the two for chitchat."'  https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/23/us/politics/donald-trump-gay-rights.html
"There was no Aramaic word for church. It comes from the Greek translation."  Got lost in translation?? lol. Yes, the Greek word "ekklesia" was adopted by the Greek Old Testament to deliver the Hebrew  work, "kahal," which, along with the Hebrew word, "edah," (rendered in Greek by "synagogue") can signify a religious assembly of Jews. Not surprisingly, the early ekkesia of Jerusalem borrowed it, as it were, especially when it became necessary for Jesus' Jewish followers to identity themselves as a distinct community from Judaism, owing to the influx of Gentile converts. Indeed, Gentile conversions -- Gentiles admitted to full standing without becoming Jews --  made it necessary to establish within the believing community some kind of legislative body with authority to make it clear that non- Jewish new comers were not obliged to follow Jewish law, obligations. But even apart from that, Jesus' mandates to Peter and apostles before and after his Ascension suggest ekklesia, in Synoptics.
Marian apparitions have a place in Catholicism, but they are not equal to Revelation. Nor have they been used to found a "restoration" church, as it were, or new religious body (like Mormonism, for example, whose founder, Joseph Smith, established a church based on the divine visions of Jesus he experienced in the 1820's  and the angelic visitations of the Angel Moroni). We have to, of course, respect the religious traditions of all, including Mohammad's visions and visitations. For that reason alone, I stay clear of critiquing them -- whether of St. Bernadette's or Joseph Smith's or of Mohammed's (though as a Catholic, I feel more in sync with the Fatima children or St. Bernadette, for that matter, especially having experienced Lourdes).
I'm old and educated, so I know a lot, but for the life of me I cannot fathom a logical reason why a sex business would need to be distanced from a liquor store or weed store. I can't wait for some conservative to offer the reason that doesn't pass the logic test. As far as churches go, I'm an atheist, so I couldn't care less if they put them in churches, but out of decency I'll concede that common decency is the reason for that one, as well as schools. But it's not like school kids won't see them. As an elementary school kid driving with my family, we'd often pass a topless joint. I always wanted to check it out and was frustrated that I'd have to wait till I was older to do so.
Oh Christ!, pun intended. Israel doesn't need to fear American disaffection as long as there are Israel-First, dual- citizen, upper level pols in Congress, the State Department, and on K Street. Everyday Jews in America have as little to do with Israeli treachery and American governmental collusion in that treachery as any free-thinking taxpayer, save for funding it. Friedman just gets more insipid with each key-strike. To think a reporter like Seymour Hirsch has to now publish his latest American embarrassment in a German newspaper because he is not adequately spineless for American or British publication, and certainly not for Tel Aviv.  Nobody but Friedman, and maybe Trump and Netanyahu-the comb-over boys, expects any kind of enlightenment from the Israeli Orthodox. They're as vicious as any other brand's orthodox. That's the problem with certainty.
A thoughtful, well-written op-ed piece. But what is missing from his contribution -- and this is true with much of atheism -- is what he (and other atheists)actually do to help others during Christmas-time, or at other times during the year.  Let me relate what we do at our small Baptist church here in Fredericton,  NB. During the year we compile frozen turkeys,  essential toiletries, non-perishable food, and grocery gift-cards for low income families. During the past three days we shipped hampers to 17 families and single people (43 people in all), a shipment that averaged about $120 per person. Our goal at out church is to give enough, to make a tangible difference for the poor. There is a quote in 1 John that we should "love in deed and thought".  So it is this where I most disagree with atheists. They talk a great deal. But where is the love? -- David Murrell (PhD,  Queen's), Economucs, UNB at Fredericton, NB
You are looking at the past with rose-colored glasses. When the Irish Poles and Jews first arrived, they were not considered to be "from the highly educated classes of Europe, noted scholars and business people." The reaction to them was just as full of fear-mongering and ignorance as the reaction to today's immigrants.
Christianity, Judaism and Islam are the same religion.  They have no leaders, they passed 2000 years ago.   People who follow their one book do not have a spiritual advisor to guide them.
The word Zionists is used as disparaging against the Jews. Just like you did with your conspiracy of it being a hoax, which you have still not moved to attempt to prove. You just say it like it is true because you believe it.  You need to get outside your bubble if you don't understand how defense of terroristic threats to a religious group are not in some way tied to the Right and their war on the "others".
Human Development through Scripture Rohr Sunday, September 10, 2017   The Hebrew Scriptures are divided into three major sections: the Torah, the Prophets, and the Wisdom books. Theologian Walter Brueggemann observes that these three excellently represent the development of human consciousness itself. [1] The Torah (the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) gave the Israelites the Law and a sense of their chosenness. For natural and healthy self-development, any culture or family follows a pattern of first providing structure, which develops identity, boundaries, and self-worth as beloved and special. It is easiest to start with an initial sense of “order,” as even educators now recognize The books of the Prophets represent the birth of good and necessary critical thinking. Without it, we remain far too self-enclosed and smug. The lack of healthy self-criticism within both Judaism and Christianity shows how little attention we’ve paid to this part of Scripture.
The era of Seig heil Trump Amerika begins. A Hitler-like cabinet, a Hitler-like agenda, a Hitler-like alliance with Putin, (Mussolini), the constant slam of NATO, a war on Hispanics and a Great Wall to keep Hispanics (Trump's Jews) out of Amerika, and a non-existent free press, are first signs of an Amerika that will eventually disappear like Nazi Germany did. Hitler's aryan Nazi nationalism was just as popular as Trump's white nationalistic fervor. We are doomed.
This guy with the pecker OCD. Couldn't he have just subscribed to BushDVD.com and practiced his hobby in the privacy of his office/bedroom alone? Hey, boy! Go write a book to succeed Portnoy's Complaint. "though it did focus on masturbation more than I recalled but the novel really addresses Jewish identity issues which may have changed somewhat over the past decades but undoubtedly remain in the minds of many Jamish people."
Can politics not be set aside and everyone condemn Jewish centre bomb threats, mosque murders and other expressions of hatred against both Jews and muslims? Surely it's time to realize that words have consequences.
Isn't the main story of slavery in the Bible where God lays waste to Egypt because they enslaved the Jews?
Paul, if support for Israel was in our best interest, there wouldn't be a need for the Lobby. At the upcoming AIPAC convention, you will see both Republicans and Democrats - it makes no difference - competing with each other in pledging allegiance to Israel. You might be interested in mainstream academics Mearsheimer and Walt's book, The Israel Lobby, or Stephen Sniegoski's, The Transparent Cabal: The Neoconservative Agenda, War in the Middle Ease, and the National Interest for Israel, because both books focus on the Lobby's influence in getting us into the Iraq war - hardly in America's best interest. You would see it wasn't "for oil." And if you then want to dig deeper, read Jeff Halper's book, War Against the People: Israel, the Palestinians, and Global Pacification. Did you know? Jewish groups like the ADL regularly send US police to Israel for training on how to suppress an unwanted population http://tinyurl.com/nfn7rzk New York Police Department now has a station in Israel.
The Palestinian people have lived there for so many centuries - Palestinian Jews, Palestinian Christians, and Palestinian Muslims. I wonder if the Globe and Mail could research and provide a story about the carrying capacity of the land, and how much ground water is being removed by the people who build and move into these settlements. What is the rate of removal compared to the traditional and, presumably, sustainable rate before the Zionist movements began. If they are not careful, it won't be that many decades before we are hearing stories about their "God-given right" to water from Egypt, Jordan, etc.  Scripture, alone, makes for a poor sense of place.
CONTINUED FROM ABOVE)  Today 1.8 million Palestinian Arab Muslims and Christians--that's TWICE the total population of Alaska plus 400,000 more--are penned behind concrete walls and concertina wire in an area equal to the distance between Anchorage town limit and Eagle River with about 5 miles on either side of the intervening stretch of Glen Highway.  These captives are routinely denied water and power, and are repeatedly subjected to aerial bombardment—like shooting fish in a barrel. When such outrages were visited on Ashkenazi Jews in Warsaw, Poland, their confinement was called a “GHETTO”, and those who orchestrated said outrages were hanged by the Nuremburg Tribunal for crimes against humanity.  And today the America REWARDS the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the Warsaw inmates with nearly $4 billion for doing the same to the Palestinians as the Nazis did to them.
But God isn't Catholic.....nor Jewish, nor Muslim, nor Buddhist, nor Hindu, etc.  Jesus actually had a number of female followers but the early 'fathers' of the church chose to honor twelve men....relating to the twelve tribes of ancient Judaism.  ... The gospels that actually name the apostles don't even have the same list of names.  The 'church' didn't even exist as an organized religion until after Constantine (around 312).  The church was alive with political maneuvering; hence what we see today.  The Bible, which didn't exist in a New Testament form until the 400's, has been edited, translated and retranslated through the generations to fit the male hierarchal ideology. Now the hierarchy have backed themselves in a corner of historical tradition and can't admit that they just might have misinterpreted the teachings and practices of Jesus.  Historical artifacts have uncovered evidence of female deacons, priests, and even Bishops in the early church.
Atheists already seem to do that Kristi.  And the Muslims in Syria, Libya, Iraq and Iran already put all the blame for their problems on Christians and Jews. That is why we see so many of them beheaded by ISIS types.
To the extent that this dialogue on the history and reason behind Catholic Social Thought and  Action  has had to be written and pontificated is and of itself a complete and utter tragedy in my eyes. The patriarchy continues to sow its seeds to the highest bidder. Any intelligent, socially aware person who was alive in some way during the pre Vatican II and Vatican II experience would know this and has known this for decades. Social Action in World War II was Pope John the Twenty Third- exiled by the Curia -  to Bulgaria getting Jewish adults and children out of the hands of the Nazi's. He could have been killed. The actions of nuns in those countries hiding folks, the nuns and priests walking in Selma. The worker priests in France. St. Emily - both of them in France and Italy working with those no one wanted to touch, or talk too , or help. The history of Judaism - of course it is there- and in all great religious and or philosophical  great thinking. Actions not words.
this is just the tip of the iceberg...... wonder how many more left-wing institutions are suffering due to snowflake politics - but I can hear the whines from the 'flakes: "why did u let them school me like this, it isnt my fault, I didnt do it" we have similar probs here in Canada, a prestigious university (and I use the term loosely), Ryerson, has banned speakers, is forcing students away from internships they 'deem' problematic (anti-semantic due to nature of internships with Jewish organizations) and the admin refuses to investigate cuz it could affect their prog street cred and their pandering to anti-Jewish groups - funny how people vote with feet and wallets
Why would any sane 'Israeli Jew' want to go to any of those places ?
How many more decades do Israelis have to kill Palestinians, and vice versa before it is realized that founding a Jewish state in Palestine was a mistake. The Israelis did wonders establishing Israel among their enemies. What would they do if they lived among friends (Texas comes to mind). In both cases it is only sand. A chunk of sand surely cannot be worth all the killing. Is any killing worth a land of sand.
Daesh (ISIS/IL) Muslims have been spreading from Iraq and Syria into Lybia, Yemen and Afghanistan and have been influencing Muslims in Europe, in Africa, in North America and elsewhere.  The U.S. recently dropped a huge bomb on a Daesh ISIS/IL target in some attempt to wipe out Daesh (ISIS/IL) but can one wipe out an idelogy and a belief in Islam and the hadiths and the verses in the Qur'an that call for jihad (struggle) and for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers?  Look at the Jewish people. They and their beliefs have lasted for over 9,000 years despite discrimination, harrassment, war and horrible genocide.   Is that what we face with radical Islam? Will their beliefs last forever?  Come to think of it, who is going to change the views of Muslims as long they keep following Islam and reading and following the verses in the Qur'an that call for jihad (struggle) and for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers?
Other faiths are able to maintain a married clergy and marriage is obligatory for Orthodox Jewish rabbis. For a hierarchy so focused on the bottom line, the costs of keeping a family pale to insignificance when one considers  the billions of dollars spent in settling the abuse cases, not to mention the complete destruction of Catholic moral authority.  The pestilence of child rape would be far less likely to be countenanced if there were women living full time in the rectories and chanceries.
wouldn't be a crime...it would be a total denial of an overwhelming amount of evidence.  those folks with the camp ID tattoos on their forearms?  ..who are still here?  they're pretty committed to that story of ethnic cleansing and the pics of the living skeletons, piles of gold dental work, .mountains of orphaned shoes  ...digging and then filling the pits with the corpses ...the jews laid them out like people...with respect - the germans dumped the bodies in like so much trash.  yup -   those old tattooed people really believe that they went through this!!  go figure.
We are free to disagree with their politics, but this doesn't come even close to crossing the line into hate speech the way "Death to Jews" does.   Hate speech needs to be prosecuted for what it is.
"And what, pray tell, is the standard definition?" . Of or pertaining to non Judeo-christian religions or deities.
i know more about christianity than 80% of americans. chances are very good i know more about christianity than you. my knowledge of christianity actually extends beyond the american sunday school naiveté  im an ABT/Jerry Prevo made atheist. i came to atheism through christianity.
Jews, Christians, and Muslims all worship the same God. I'd make the case for Sikhs, also. If there is only one universal God, and since all four religions claim to worship one universal God, they must be worshipping the same God. But, YHVH is the written name for God for Jews only. Observant Jews do not try to pronounce that name, using "Adonai" (Lord), instead. English speaking Christians call God "God, the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit/Ghost". And Muslims call God "Allah". The modern dispute between Muslims and Jews has more to do with the State of Israel than anything to do with Hagar and Sarah. The dispute between Christians and Muslims has more to do with the Crusades and colonialism -- and the fact that both religions see as their ultimate goal the complete conversion of the world's population to one OR the other.
As a Mormon may I respectfully commend NCR for this kind article.  For me personally I have always had an abiding love for Catholics and the Catholic Church.  Of all the other churches the Catholic Church is the one that I find most similar to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.   We have much we can learn from one another as each of us seeks to pick up the cross of Jesus and follow him.   Again, my deepest things for your kindness.  May His Peace be upon each of you and your families.
Yes there are still NAZI and NAZI like people in Europe, however the attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions in France, Belgium, Germany etc have all come from Radical Muslims. Do not know if that is the case here but would not be surprised.
Maybe you should look at the number of Jewish children that were saved in France compared to other European  countries, ( statistics available from Jewish sources ). Yes , there is always a number of people ( in any countries )who will try to get money or favours in any situation. I grow up in France (borned  4 years after the end of the war )on the Swiss border and ,our Pastor and a number of catholics nuns in my village have been recognized for passing hundred of jewish children through the forest at night to Switzerland. Did you ever ask yourself how many French citizen were shot by firing squads by German Forces for trying to hide Jewish ,to blow train tracks , to refuse to cooperate etc...My father was 18 years old when he left occupied France to reach  Africa to meet with the Free French units. Yes this was a very sad , shameful time for France , but maybe you should always ask yourself how much better or how perfectly you would have handled yourself in this terrible time.
Apparently not enough torture and deaths as the UN and the UNHRC haven't passed any resolutions condemning the Syrian government. Oh, I forgot. No Jews or Israel involved!!
Whether you agree with Shannyn or not or Paul Jenkins or not we can never outrun the "slant" in what they say.  Whether that feller in North Carolina stopped and helped was a matter of his choice. (free will). Shannyn by her "slant" assumes that he was a Christian. She doesn't know that, but she played on your belief. I guess the Creator told Shannyn that he was. So what if the "lord" told him to move on what does that mean? Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, and on and on refer to a higher being as "lord."  I know that if I saw a legislator in the ditch, (except for perhaps a very rare occurence), I'd beep the horn, give 'em a wave and drive off. That's the human side of us all. It's not for us to get really too "preachy" and define if someone is good or not. Prejudice never shows much reason.
Those two states are Jordan - the Palestinian Arab state and Israel  - Palestinian Jewish state.  That leaves no room for the second state of Palestinian Arabs, currently in the making.
Good article.  Are you sure you are an atheist?
Actually- that's surprisingly close: Hitler and his leaders used the American Democrat model for slavery and racial oppression at that time as a model on how to persecute the Jews and rationalize their use of lebensraum.  Fast forward over half a century, and the racial identity politics played by Leftist Fascists and Congressional Democrats helped propel Trump and America to the win. Glad you got it!
Well, it is a race issue and blacks felt, at that time, completely at war with the dominant culture that it felt was flooding its communities with heroin and locking up its citizens for far longer periods than similarly charged whites. Also, MLK was gunned down, showing many that peace may not be the way for further change. Farrakhan was a leading force in attempting to force slumlords to accept responsibility for their dangerous buildings: the race-baiting of Jews was in that context, as abhorrent as it was.  As far as his marriages: never heard the man was abusive to any of them. I like to follow the "judge not" rule, especially in personal issues, but go ahead on if your life is spotless! Finally, in saying what he did about the races, it's not that different from proclaiming a certain race, The Chosen People, is it?
Certainly, Michael, because your atheism is certainly doing your attitude, mood and kindness so much good. In what way does the appointment of a new Archbishop harm you, exactly? Assuming you are an adult, just walk away. No need to be nasty.
Singled out? Netanyahu's Israel is right there alongside the other rogue states of the region.  It's an ethnocentric colonial state created by European Jewish immigration to Palestine in the 19th and 20th centuries. It won't last another 35 yearrs, according to the CIA.

Um- "anti-semitic?" That same Pepe icon is used by Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos: both Jews. Let me guess- you also think they and Steve Bannon are white nationalists, and let me guess- you think that because this paper/WaPo (same thing) told you so. Congrats- you're the reason this paper is going out of business.
Arab racism against Jews? It is a political conflict, not a racial one. The Cold War was not a religious battle between Protestant USA and Orthodox USSR.   There are better examples. But when it comes to looting, slavery, genocide, etc, European countries have had by the highest score in the last 500 years. For example, the Spanish looted all the gold and silver from the Incas and Aztecs. If they had to return the money to Latin America, they would be a Fourth World country.
Religion is OK as long as its not imposed on others.  In this case it IS being imposed on secular schools. The fact its done in another room is no excuse.  It is sanctioned by the school and creates a religious division. Every religion has violent extremists.  Neo-nazis, white supremacists, KKK, Jewish defence league, IRS, jihadists.  The difference is: most are excluded from their religious centres. The problem arises when they are tolerated and protected within their religious communities.  As are some of the above.
You can disagree with my comments as much as you like, but that doesn't change the fact that the refusal to accept the theist claim is not the same as accepting the opposite claim.  The definition of terms (something you yourself like to reference) bears this out.  Although, I fully agree with you that should someone make the claim "Gods do not exist" they are operating on faith until such time as they could provide evidence for this claim.  They are not, however, merely "atheist."    All people who make that claim are atheist, but not all atheists make that claim.  From another point - All people who believe in multiple gods are theists, but not all theists believe in the existence of multiple gods.  It is a secondary question which follows the question of theism.  Here's a happy little cartoon - http://www.stanleycolors.com/wp-content/uploads/atheism.jpg
Always happy to learn about cultural appropriation from a representative of BYU-Hawaii, that fine institution that owns, operates, and profits from their Polynesian Cultural Center right next door. It's a good place to show tourists what Hawaiians were like before Christians and Mormons stream-rolled their spiritual values and way of life -- for their own good of course.
Yes.  Though some stereotype us as 'holocaust deniers' thanks to a few vocal idiots among us, neither I nor the Muslims I know deny the reality of the Third Reich's mass-murder of European Ashkenaziim.  Indeed, there are Bosnian Muslims in the US whose relatives were dragged to the camps and the ovens on the orders of Hitler himself, because they dared hide Jews from the Nazis and their Croat allies.  The minority of my 'co-religionists' buying into this falsehood should realize continuing to endorse it is against our interests because it merely encourages those itching to repeat this atrocity to 'putsch' further toward their hateful dreams, but with Muslims being loaded into the cattle-cars to camps with "Christ will set you free" banners over the entrances this time.  One can publicly revile Muslims today in ways that are no longer 'fashionable' if applied to Jews.  Just words, right?  That's how the Nazis started.  Then they progressed to eggs, then fists, then rocks, then bullets.
Jews and their prayer habits have been around for a long time, but they never demanded society reorganize itself to accommodate them, which is why it has never become an issue, except for the extremist ultra-Orthodox, which have become an issue even in New York and Israel with non-ultra-Orthodox Jews.
The Imam advising PDSB hosted last year an Egyptian "scholar" who calls for slaying of Jews, and destruction of Russians, Hindus, Shiites, Christians, Americans, Europeans.
This is an excellent article. I think both sides of any debate are absolutely integral to any idea, albeit politics, religion, freedom or any other sticky subjects. If we do not have a right to our left or vice versa, we do not have a balanced opinion. M-103 is a perfect example of this, a study of Islamophobia, by only mentioning one idea, the feeling of the other side of the argument is not being represented. How about the Muslim family that escaped from a war-torn country and came to Canada to start anew? They've become Christian and love their peaceful lives. Then more people come, perhaps some they've known in the past, Now this family has become apostates to their previous religion. Or how about the Jewish family who've no representation, or Hindus, or Buddhists. When an idea has representation from only one side and not the other, it becomes illogical to even investigate in a biased direction. We need true equality and freedom of speech no matter the opinion, or we all lose.
As we can see everywhere Islamic Jihad is the source of many wars. These wars are ideological first and territorial second.   Arab Israeli war is another example of Jihad. Arab states took 99.99% of lands from Ottoman Empire, including most of the land allocated for Arab and Jewish Palestinian states. This current war is not to give Palestinian Arabs another state, in addition to Jordan. It is to destroy Israel in stages by making it vulnerable.   Calling lands Judea and Samaria means more than the West Bank (of Jordan River). Especially for Good Samaritans, who are never called West Bankers. Indeed, West Bankers are not always Good Samaritans.
Interesting. I didn't see an hourglass but I can see the upper star portion as a stylized womb, if I squint (also a stretch).  Regarding "concurrency", if one is of an Eastern Religious mindset (or even if one uses so-called centering prayer as a spiritual practice), finding heaven by looking inward is not so far-fetched.  The Guiyuan Buddhist Temple, in Wuhan, has a number of statues, some of which do represent the stars or heavens "inside" of the Buddha (who has peeled his chest or stomach back to reveal the universe). Maybe the stars are on an altar cloth (pick-nick blanket?), like Mary's cloak in her Guadalupe image.
Jews need to give up Zionism. Not all whites are white supremacists and not all Jews are Jewish supremacists. If to be white and silent about racism is to uphold white supremacy then by the same reasoning, to be Jewish and silent about Zionism (Jewish nationalism) is to be complicit in Israel's injustice to the Palestinian people. The Star of David is prominent on the Israeli flag and people confuse Judaism and the political ideology, Zionism. Most progressives wouldn't think of celebrating Columbus Day (in Eugene, it's been changed to Indigenous Peoples’ Day) yet our local Temple Beth Israel will be celebrating the ethnic cleansing of Palestine on May 3. Unfortunately, there are many parallels between white supremacist and Jewish supremacist ideologies, demonstrated here, "Why a Texas rabbi keeps losing the debate over Israel with a white nationalist leader" http://tinyurl.com/zd5rel5  A former Hebrew teacher explains, Zionism is nationalism, not Judaism http://tinyurl.com/lv6kn2o
What religion are these folks? 7th Day Adventists, Mormons, Quakers, what? How did they get so much news publicity?
"Kravivski Visti, a Ukrainian-language newspaper based in Krakow that often published anti-Jewish diatribes including “certain passages in some of the articles that expressed approval of what the Nazis were doing to the Jews.” Certain passages in some articles? And that makes it a Nazi newspaper? Pretty lazy thinking on the part of  Robert Fife and the Globe. And that makes grandfather a collaborator? And Freeland has to pay for her grandfather "alleged" sins? Why don't we go after the grandchildren of theCanadian ministers who refused entry to Jewish refugees in their hour of need in the 1930s?
Tom, I am sorry, I think you are more hopeful than practical. The American Catholic Bishops have allowed themselves, as a body and individually, to be corrupted by ideological stances that do not allow dialogue. They have been baited and have taken it, hook, line and sinker, and while duped into thinking they have influence, have made the Catholic Church in the US, sectarian.   November 9 and 10 marked the 76th anniversary of “Kristallnacht” when Nazis ran wild, desecrating synagogues, burning the Scrolls, burning and vandalizing Jewish businesses and homes, terrorizing a community of people, killing 100, and initiating the persecution of the Jews, resulting in the Holocaust.   Ideology replaced politics and so civic society in Germany was wiped out or significantly diminished functional politics, to the point that civic society could not resist the great evil let loose in Germany, Europe, and the world.   Our religious institutions are so infected by ideology- we need a cleansing.
You do realise that the Nobel committee is a Northern European organisation, run overwhelmingly by practicing Christians? Nobel himself was a devout Lutheran. Over 80% of Nobel winners are Christian and most of the Jewish winners were secular. Muslim winners are mostly from this century - hardly surprising when you know the roots of the Nobel organisation.
Faith is the belief in something without any evidence to support that belief.  That in itself is contradictory to science.  You'll find that a large majority of scientists are atheists or agnostics.  Religion isn't part of their lives.
Probably as long as there have been public schools in Canada those schools have been closed on the Christian Sabbath and (perhaps more recently) on Jewish Sabbath so that practitioners of those faiths can follow certain dictates of their faiths without even missing classes. Has anyone been interested in even learning whether there has been outrage around that? Would such outrage be "understandable"?
The equivalence between 'anti-Semitism' and 'Islamophobia' is very rough indeed.   Pseudo-scientific theories concerning race, civilization, and "progress" were widespread in 19th C Europe. The terms  'anti-Semitism' was coined as the name of racial doctrine whose aim was the derogation of  Jews as a race; in other words, self-described anti-Semites professed hostility towards Jews for racial reasons not on grounds of religious prejudice. The proponents of this doctrine used 'Jewish' and 'Semitic' interchangeably.   I agree with P. Galt that the term is a misnomer, but not for the reason he gives. There are indeed lots of Semitic languages, and one might speak of Semitic peoples as those who speak such languages. But the idea that there is a Semitic race, of any kind, strikes me as preposterous. (There are lots of Indo-European languages, but speakers of those languages do not constitute a race.)
To borrow from my very dear close personal friend Woody Allen (he's Jewish- wonderful people, the Jews - tremendous!) that's the best laugh I've had with my clothes on!  And he isn't even senile!  then again, has anyone tried to see if they could grab him by the scalp?  What if an attempt to do so revealed a Mission Impossible - like latex mask?  What if . . .

A lie. The US Jewish judge issued a lengthy dissenting opinion. How's that. Furthermore, Morris Berthold Abram, an American lawyer who was involved in drafting the Fourth Geneva Convention, argued that the convention "was not designed to cover situations like Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, but rather the forcible transfer, deportation or resettlement of large numbers of people." How's that.
That is not true. First of all there was no Ukraine during WWII.  Second Poland had one of the largest if not the largest underground armies fighting NAZI state. Poles of Ukrainian descent did join Germany's NAZI, one of them, Stepan Bandera murdered quarter of a million of Poles. Situation got so bad that whole underground division was sent to the east. Poles of Ukrainian descent that were captured killing other Poles, Jews and/or collaborating with the Nazi regime were executed with over 10,000 collaborators liquidated as common bandits. They were sentenced to death by Polish underground legal system.
What Oregon has done legally with votes of the people about assisted suicide is irrelevant.    Five old people in Washington D. C. can decide tomorrow that assisted suicide is Unconstitutional.  They just did it for a couple years ago for Oregon's Anti-Gay Marriage statute; no State statute is safe.   Are you aware that of the eight (8)  Justices on the Court today there are five (5) Catholics and three (3) Jewish?    Both faiths are against suicide.    Gorsuch was raised Catholic and attends an Episcopalian Church in Colorado.
the majority of KKK in Colorado back in the 20s was GOP.  And that matches up with what our state was back in the 20s; GOP controlled.  Are you Christian/Jewish/Muslim? DO you go to Church/temple/mosque? Have you ever met ppl that joined just to pretend? Perhaps you have met some that converted just so that they could marry somebody? Many of them are NOT true believers.  And based on what I see of today's churches and groups like the GOP, there are few true followers. Many so-called Christian have more in common with the devil, then with Christ. And finding a TRUE REPUBLICAN in the GOP at one of their meetings? Good Luck.
Theophobia would be a better term....wonder why the political class avoided using it....but it doesn’t quite fit the script.  Sufferers are usually those who were raised in strict religious environments, exhibiting  avoidance behaviour, avoiding spiritual activities , avoiding interaction with others who believe in the particular religious belief system...however they still believe in the deity in question,  “ fear the wrath of god” if they do anything wrong according to the religion in question....a severe anxiety disorder/ panic attack.   Atheists cannot be theophobics by definition, since they do not believe in the very concept of a deity....however it is intrinsic in the Islamic belief system to have a fear of Allah (“Fear Allah wherever you are “), in a way that the other members of the Abrahamic tradition don’t seem to fear their god to the same extent, one would expect more cases of theophobias in their ranks.
Sorry, that's not a fact.  It's a slogan.  And a pathetically false one.  Timothy McVeigh--"Christian Identity" movement; Anders Breivik--European nationalist/Christian supremacist; Robert Bales--Christian US Army SSGT; Frasier Glen Cross--Christian neo-Nazi and white supremacist; Scott Roeder--Christian anti-abortionist; Wade Michael Page--white supremacist; Barukh Goldstein--Zionist Jew; Jim David Anderson--"conservative" Christian; Larry McQuilliams--anti-immigrant extremist; Jarad and Amanda Miller--white nationalists; Craig Hicks--atheist; Eric Rudolph--Christian anti-abortionist; Andrew Joseph Stack--Catholic, pi$$ed at the IRS; Christian Phalange Party--Maronite Christians; Anti-Balaka--Christian, Central African Republic; JDL--Zionist Jews; Kach Chai Party--Zionist Jews; Lord's Army, Christian--Central African Republic, South Sudan; Tamil Tigers--secularists (Sri Lanka).  This is an incomplete list.
With the exception of King Henry VIII, virtually every disaster in the church has been caused by the "ontologically different" clergy with the laity as their victims. The present church model just isn't working. The hierarchy either doesn't care or is incompetent. Judaism and the Bahai Faith illustrate that an organized religion can function very well without a clergy. While it will not happen in our lifetimes, a future iteration of Catholic Christianity will be one without clergy.
Sorry to hear that Loren, about your troubled memories of an Adventist youth. Indeed, if that is the kind of Adventism you remember growing up in, then I fully understand why “progressive Adventism”, AT and Spectrum are the order of the day for you.   30 years and Adventist, most in ministry, now a pastor, we’ve raised two vegetarian children in the Adventist faith (now 19 & 17 yrs) teaching them to reverence the Sabbath, to love and honor all peoples including Catholics while putting them through our Adventist school system.   Yet, the Adventist message and mission have not changed and especially our foundational understanding of the final events of Bible prophecy. But my oh my; how these Adventist times, they are a changin.
BTW, last December a talk-how host (CJAD, anglo) invited non-Christians to call in to say how they felt about Xmas, expecting a ot of complaints about feeling like outsiders, etc. It didn't happen, he was inundated with Sikhs, Hindus, Jews telling him they loved Xmas, had a Xmas tree, etc., no matter how much he tried to suggest the reverse...  It is really only a tiny subset of the monotheistic religions that considers it forbidden, a betrayal of their religion to celebrate other religions' holidays. Those people have every right not to do so, but they should stop trying to prevent everyone else from enjoying it.  I celebrated Eid with a family of Muslim friends, and Holi when I was in India, it didn't turn me Muslim or Hindu. Many Muslims from countries that once were moderate and peaceful, nostalgically tell of Muslims and Christians celebrating each others' holidays.
Personally, I'm cheering for Tough Jews -- a great show from Storefront Theatre.
A better description of Islamophobia might be the irrational fear that Islam is an intolerant force that will subvert the traditional values and freedoms of Canadians.  Other religions have come to Canada in the past. At the same time that we welcomed Muslims we also welcomed Buddhists, Sikhs and Hindus. They have not caused a stir like Islam.   Islam is different from other religions in that it explicitly discriminates against unbelievers. This is written in the Koran, or so I am told. I have read parts of the Koran but have only gotten to the parts where wife beating is allowed.  Muslims have a problem that only they can solve. They must forsake forever Sharia law and expressly reject those teachings of the Koran the declare war on unbelievers, accepting that Islam is not superior to any other religion.  Until they do this problem will not end.
Because various posters have asked about this. . . .   Two years ago, Irwin Cotler introduced a motion that began with these words:  " That, in the opinion of the House: "a) there has been, in the words of the Joint Statement issued following the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on January 22, 2015, “an alarming increase in Antisemitism worldwide,” including the firebombing of synagogues and community centres, the vandalizing of Jewish memorials and cemeteries, incendiary calls for the destruction of Israel and the Jewish people, and anti-Jewish terror;  It concluded with:  "  And the House further calls upon the government to: 	a) continue advancing the combating of anti-Semitism as a domestic and international priority; 	b) expand engagement with civil society, community groups, educators, and other levels of government to combat anti-Semitism and to promote respect, tolerance, and mutual understanding."  It was adopted by unanimous consent of the House.    It was
I wonder how many of those 'Klansmen' like his Jewish son-in-law or his black Secretary of Health and Human Services?  Or his appointment of Justice Gorsuch, who was raised Catholic?  Your attempt to link his voters to the Klan is just another method of bigotry.    His Klan 'support' has the same validity as linking the anti-Trumps here in Eugene who ice pick tires to prove their liberal values.  Or the ones who like to burn cars in Portland.    You are trying to tar all Trump voters with the same bigoted brush.
Mass should not be celebrated without a minister or at least one of the faithful present, except for a just and reasonable cause.  You have signally failed to explain that the presence of ten atheists constitutes just and reasonable cause. It is obviously nothing of the sort. You failed to think this through.
And the Jews are, once again, the most recent (and current) conquerors. Their legal claim isn't based upon God having given them the promised land, which they had conquered in ancient times. It is based on them having occupied, and defended by force of arms, several times within contemporary history, their claim to the land.
yes let us be like Israel  since they will recognise an independent Kurdistan for obvious political reasons not soft moral reasons like the authors  look back to UNSC Res 688 in which the US carved up Iraq under the pretext of protecting the Kurds  it was done mostly to ensure Iraq would never pose a threat to Israel again  Now the US is at it at again by controlling 50% of Syrian air space with a view to ensuring that country is no threat to Israel either  We need to have a bigger debate about how much the Jewish diaspora influences Canadian and American foreign  policy  before we start recognising new  countries in the Middle East  left right and centre  the fact the media doesn't talk about this is self evident  Wait for Trudeau's announcement declaring Canada's recognition of an independent Kurdistan and then ask yourself  - is that why we sent troops into  the region to give tacit support to Kurdish freedom fighters?  an uninformed Canadian public is Israel's best friend
Isn't it cute the way that the post writer carefully chose his start date (2003) in order to avoid the three thousand people who were slaughtered in the events of 9/11 about a year earlier?  That is a bit like talking about the murder of Jews worldwide in history and conveniently omitting Germany from 1935 to 1945...
Israel: democracy for Jewish Israelis, discrimination ad second-class citizenship for Israeli Palestinians, and apartheid for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. That is what is supporters defend.
When Ethiopia and North Korea suffered from famine, it had nothing to do with Christianity or Buddhism, the majority religion in these countries. It was more to do with the socialist dictatorships ruling these countries.  When 4 million people died in British ruled Bengal in 1943, it had nothing to do with religion. It was Churchill's policy to divert food from Bengal to Europe, to build buffer stocks in Europe during the war.  Creating false cause and effects must come easy to you.
It's hard to see how this call for greater compassion and conscientious activism to help refugees of different backgrounds, faiths and colours applies to contemporary Canadian society.  Perhaps the authors did not see Rosie DiManno's recent column in The Star, where she defended the lack of empathy for Muslim victims of terror in Islamic countries because their 'culture' is unrecognizable to 'us'.    However, DiManno insists that we automatically feel empathy for victims of attacks in Berlin, Brussels or Manchester because "few [Canadians] can picture themselves in Kabul or Aleppo or Mogadishu."  Odd, I thought *universal* human rights and refugee protection was about recognizing ourselves in other human beings, not in their cities, cultures or religions.  After all, by DiManno's logic, non-Jews should feel justified in not feeling empathy for victims of the Holocaust.  Canadians are losing touch with their own values and identity.  That's the story here.
Obama's last petty (but very damaging) stab at Israel.  And there are still jews who support the democratic party?  Hard to believe.
I grew up in a family system that included hatred, harsh discipline and sexual abuse. I survived somehow.  God was in my life even though I was raised an atheist.  After I grew up I was faced with the questions--how do I restore my own life to psychological, emotional, social and physical health--how do whole families restore themselves to health?  I've struggled with this all my life--my mother was absolutely opposed to recognizing anything was wrong--I had to choose between family and sanity.  The mental health system didn't help either.  The American Psychiatrists (APA) covered up the sexual abuse of children for 100 years and they still didn't want to acknowledge Developmental Trauma in the 2013 edition of their Diagnostic Manual-DSM--and remember they were advising the bishops and so the Church took the brunt of the crisis the power brokers of psychiatry refused to address.  I pick myself up and refuse to give into hopelessness and despair sometimes every day.  God bless you NCR.
"In the name of Islam" doesn't mean these people are fighting a religious war. You call the Planned Parenthood shooter a psychopath, but he shot a cop and two other people just because they were there - he didn't break in on an abortion in progress.  Look up these names  Michael F. Griffin Rev. Paul Jennings Hill John Salvi Eric Rudolph James Kopp Scott Roeder  Murder at or because of abortion, which is legal here. "Rev." as in Presbyterian until they excommunicated him when he started advocating violence against abortion - on religious grounds.  You'll probably say they were all unstable. Yet why don't you notice the same about the others who are mentally unstable enough to find a reason, pick up a gun or bomb, and start randomly killing?  Islam, like Christianity and Judaism all descends from Abraham, and anyone who looks in the Bible finds enough bloodthirstiness to twist that into a "cause" too. When they lose it.
Dear Mayor,   Also, please, consider your bias here. American Atheists is not making any attempt to censor you, erase your city's culture or anything of the sort. They are, rightly, bringing your "town" into alignment with the constitution.   Your right to religion is rock solid, as is your right to display symbols in appropriate locations. Your religion is not under attack... the shear number of churches in the area prove that....   As to your reference to military personnel who serve and who have lost their lives, you make a HUGE assumption here with your suggestion all those who serve share your religion. You know, sir, this is not factual. The US military is an inclusive service, which, constitutionally, makes no reference to religion or no religion.   I appreciate your reaction to what will be a significant change, but you must acknowledge the people you serve as mayor do not all share your religion. That symbol has an appropriate place and it is not on public land.
"One can tease out" and create a straw man, and then say he proves your point. Why not give more evidence of what you believe to be the "generalized system and form of worship (sic) surrounding the tenets of science", or just accept that atheism is not a religion?
I am deeply offended by Singh's refusal to condemn the mastermind of the Air Indian bombing and those that continue to glorify the terrorists that committed the crime. This is politics of the worst kind. Jagmeet Singh has been denied entry into India given his extreme views. He has also tacitly implied that India was responsible for the Air Canada bombing, not Sikh terrorists - this is not true. Mr Singh represents Sikhs first, including extremists Sikhs, Canadians second, and his full repudiation of the Air India bombing and his anti-India views suggest that he is anti-Hindu.
Our country is a work in progress...we have hated Catholics, Jews, any race but white, Eastern Europeans, and double hated them, left them to die, if they were Eastern European and Jewish. But each time we learn, sort of...'course it seems to rear it's ugly head again and again...think the past election. Now we hate Muslims...oh we call them Islamic to hide our shame...Little d was so proud today, Radical Islamic Terrorists, he spewed like the hateful vomit of which he is so proud. And his followers love it, lap it up. If you want to see how Germany lost control of their democracy watch his latest circus...really, really scary! Each generation gets better...now we have LGBT at the newest whipping post as they too seek rights and respect...baby steps, two forward and one back...it's progress...and love and real Christian values.
If you believe I am the one that misunderstands, I think I understand a lot more about compassion  than an article that compares Nazi experimentation on jews to current day laws that allow DAS.  "Dignity" is one thing that you seem to miss.  No one is talking about Kevorkian and his ideas.  We are trying to address what is and is not compassion and what is dying with dignity....
you overestimate any residual anti-Semitism in QC by a factor of about 3-4, meaning I trust the French Jews who choose Montreal -- they sense its openness, unlike those here  relying on  history books as their guides to city life in 2017....
So, what about the six million Jews and five million others sent to death camps, or forced to dig ditches and then machine-gunned, or forced into the backs of vans where they were asphyxiated?
Speak for yourself, CAELew.  If your church keeps hemorrhaging, it will be -- for all practical purposes -- extinct in a decade. Less than one percent of the US population belongs to it, the Protestant Episcopal Church. And your ecclesial counterpart in UK -- the Anglican Church -- has shrunk from 17% of the population (identifying as Anglican) to 15% just this month. Nothing great about that, making an ideal out of loss -- unless you have trained your imagination in fantasy to see past reality.   Finally, the CC (according to Pew's most educated/least educated/highest income/lowest income Study) has the most educated and richest block of members -- over 12 million on them -- of any other denomination in US, Christian or otherwise. The most the EC can come up with in that category is 700,000; and the highest income group -- American Jews -- can only come up with 2.6 million members in that category.
Sher is an Indian/ Hindu nationalist likely from East Africa let in by Trudeau's old man. He has no loyalty to Canada but is one of the millions of "passport Canadians" who continue their centuries old hatreds and grievances of other ethnic groups in Canada. He likely brought his corrupt practices to Canada and is busy cheating people daily for loose change. If times get tough they are the first to run and hide.
Actually, he's very funny. I like him.   The reason left wing authoritarians hate him so much and want to shut him down is not because they are afraid of his ideas. It's because they fear so much the sound that comes from his audience.   Laughter.  It seems to be the right that went out and got him this time. I suspect they just didn't like seeing a gay Jewish Catholic become so prominent in their ranks.
They do not explicitly say that balancing justice and mercy is an error. However, it is implicit in their "question". To certain people, the thought that people should go unpunished is wrong. Otto von  Bismarck is believed to have said, "it is better that ten innocent men suffer than one guilty man escape."   I know nothing about the men personally, but Burke et al seem to find the thought of the divorced and remarried going to communion to be personally offensive. Personally, I find the attitude of refusing mercy to be offensive.  On another wholly unrelated subject, you praised my son for "respecting the law" on divorce an remarriage. He does not respect that law. He LEFT the Catholic Church because of that law. It would be like saying that Jews who left Germany in the 1930s "respected" the Nuremberg Laws.
You're changing your position. First you said that atheism was a "denial or rejection" of a supernatural deity. Now you're softening it to "declining to buy into them."  Those are two different things. The former is an assertive position. The latter is a non-committal position- it doesn't buy into the claim about god, but it doesn't deny it either. What's more you reinforce that non-committal position by mentioning that you're open to considering new evidence in the future. That's all well and good. Your earlier statement about atheism and your claim that rejection of something unproven is a positive thing was not.
The main point in XIV is that whenever states deprive targeted groups of their rights, the federal goverment has the authority to overturn that action. No going after blacks, Jews, Romany, Chinese, atheists, women, gays, Catholics or people who disagree with Catholics. While Justice Thomas thinks that the unborn make the list, no other Justice does. The plain language of the amendment is born or naturalized. In Roe, the ability to be born was equated with birth, but until Congress, who is the only body who can enforce the Amendment says differently, States can only nibble around the edges after the first trimester, where they generally pander rather than balance the interests of the unborn child and the mother in a crisis pregnancy. They might be able to ban abortions of Downs babies, but getting such a case to SCOTUS will not lead to overturning Roe. As for living wage, if you want to call Pius XI a Marxist, that is on you. Casti Connubii 121, 122.
Nazis with the active support of Ukrainian nationalists killed millions of Jews in Ukraine during WWII, crimes that Germans acknowledged but Ukrainians ever since denied. That is the story behind this story.
You can see that Chin's outlook was influenced by the famous quote from Martin Niemöller:  "First they came for the Socialists And I did not speak out Because I was not a Socialist Then they came for the Trade Unionists And I did not speak out Because I was not a Trade Unionist Then they came for the Jews And I did not speak out Because I was not a Jew Then they came for me And there was no one left to speak for me"
And, I'll bet most of the bad ones have members who are FBI agents. Got to watch those "Christian Identity" and "radical traditional Catholic" folks. What, no Jewish traditionalists?
Before folks start taking turns attacking Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, they should absorb and process three (3) pieces of information on Jews and Ukrainians during WW2 - a book launch, a conference, and a debate:  1. Conference, University of Toronto, 27 October 2016 Jews and Ukrainians: A Millennium of Co-Existence https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-1p5NiSu_antNCJ6HHwlss5IoLgGJJLe  2.

A reasonably moderate article balancing the compromise that Canadians are pretty good at. Proud to be an atheist. :)
what the church teaches and what we put in law are two different things, with the former being a form of Catholic relativism. Abortion teachings are fairly consistent in Catholicism, not in Judaism and sodomy is disliked because heterosexuals think gay sex icky and gay priests double down to cover themselves
For 500 years the Muslim Ottoman Empire protected Jews, fellow people of the book, from the murderous Christians of Europe.
The largely Progressive/Liberal controlled media and the Liberal Party itself considers any posts supporting Christianity and the traditional ideals that Canada was founded on as hate literature.  No wonder the imams in Canada aren't afraid to promote hatred and demand the death to all Jews in our mosques.  The National Post carried the story but not a peep from the Globe and Mail.  http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/liberal-jewish-and-muslim-mps-condemn-imams-who-called-for-the-death-of-jews
Trump is an honourary Jewish President  3 kids 2 married Jewish 1 married half Jewish  Goodbye Obama's anti-Israel - not very subtle
What ever happened to the case where the Israeli teen (and his father?) were found to be making threats to Jewish Centres in North America?
She is clearly someone who has trouble with the truth and whose word cannot be trusted. She not someone a nation needs as a foreign minister. Her denials of the facts about her grandfather's collaboration with the Nazis and anti-Jewish writings give the impression that she supports those views and indeed we see her in Ukraine meeting with neo-Nazis there.  This sends a very bad image of Canada to other nations that she has to deal with in her role as foreign minister. The source of these stories is not the Russians as she claims but her own uncle, as is now admitted, and her grandfather's role is set out in the University of Alberta archives and Los Angeles Holocaust Museum archives. Lately two American journalists John Helmer and the famous Robert Parry have brought it to wider attention. The "Russia is the source" of these facts is just an attempt to divert the public's attention from the facts she has denied but can deny no longer.
I agree with you that this is an opportunity to express our abhorrence of the cowardly actions, and to find unity with our Jewish brethren. However if as you say this is a crime we will not abide, how do we accomplish anything by refusing to hold our leaders accountable for allowing (and in my opinion condoning by their silence) a climate of xenophobia to fester?
Yes, in 1944, Germany was already losing the war, getting slaughtered by the Russians to the east and getting dwarfed by the Americans in the west (in 1944, Germany produced 40,000 new combat aircraft, whilst America, in the same year, produced 114,000, along with an interesting new device you may have heard about, called an atom bomb). Germany militarily was flushed halfway down a toilet in 1944, and had some refugees moved from there to Canada (!), it would have done nothing to get their homeland out of the toilet spiral, indeed, the loss of able bodied people would have hastened the passage to the underground toilet pipes.  Still strange, though, your silence about Jewish folks.
"For us, the Jews are an authentic religion of the book, and if they are not too entangled with Israel, they are most welcome in Iran, and it would be a tragedy for us if they left." In contrast, "the Baha'i's are not a genuine religion, and have no place in Iran."  Al-Imam Ruh'hullah al-Khomeini (radi'Allahu an'hu).  Having said that, the group responsible for persecuting the Baha'i was the 'Hojjatieh Society', which was banned five years after the Imam's return.  You'll note they weren't pardoned, nor was the cleric who led them elected prime minister, nor did the Islamic Republic name a military award after them.  As for reaction against the Baha'i for supporting the Shah, what you overlook in your 'Nazi comparison' is that the Shah murdered 1.3 million of his own people.  How many Germans did the Ashkenaziim kill (admittedly one is tempted to answer "not nearly enough", but I'm looking for a number here...)?
You do realize that a mosque is not a church don't you?  church /CHərCH/ noun a building used for public Christian worship.  mosque /mäsk/ noun a Muslim place of worship.  syn·a·gogue noun the building where a Jewish assembly or congregation meets for religious worship and instruction.   Think twice, post once please.
There are more Muslims in the Israeli Knesset than there are Jews in all Islamic state governments combined.
Arab Leaders are very selective. and   how they treat other religious minorities  in their own countries They should  look i in their own   mirrors..  As an example the  Christian  Copts  who were in Egypt well before the Arab Conquest do not have a particularly easy time.  .      Saudi Arabia does not allow any other non Muslim   religion to  practice there.  Interestingly  from  historical records Jews were an important group in  that areas before the rise of Islam. Nearly a million Jews wee expelled from Arab Countries after the establishment of the State of Israel .wit h confiscation of their f property.  The long established Jewish Communities who contributed greatly to their countries well being are no longer in Iraq Syria, Egypt Algeria and Libya. .   Alexandria in Egypt was a haven during the 2nd world war for Jews from France, Greece and Italy.  What a difference today.  that Jewish people are not allowed to be part of arab  countries..
Bannon described himself in 2014 as a “Leninist.” “Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that’s my goal too. I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment,” Bannon said, according to a a report by Ronald Radosh in the Daily Beast. According to a sworn statement by his ex-wife in 2007, Bannon said that he didn’t like Jews and didn’t want his daughters to go to school with Jewish people.
Rubio and Trump are both old fashioned with no vision....but large ego.  Both do not care about the majority but their own limited view.....Rubio, being so young, but so short-sighted......so old fashioned.......shame on Floridians to have voted again for a puppet controlled by a Jewish group against the overall interest of Americans
It's because these Jewish people have more charity than left leaning Catholics.
I knew you were being sarcastic.   You just have not figured out the debating technique I have been using when I say that you agree with me.  Also, although I have not indicated it, most of the time that I use it, I am laughing.   As far as what he might have eaten, your guess is as good as any.   For about 2000 years nobody has successfully answered the empty tomb question.  If it was the Romans that moved the body, why would they do it?  It just created more problems for them.  The Jewish leaders had even less reason to do it.  The disciples would had to have gotten through the guards and would not have become the leaders they became.  How do you account for the empty tomb?
The Zionist part should be... the international Jew.
Maybe they will, or maybe they'll take another approach.  I haven't seen the jewish communities in Montreal or Quebec City agree to give up their jewish-only cemeteries - nor should they.
Why not include religious bigotry against women, homosexuals and Atheists? Why pander to Muslims, who are guilty of most of the violence against Muslims they consider Infidels? Are the Liberals going to investigate Canadian Muslims accused of attacking other Muslims? http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/luckily-i-escaped-man-accused-of-role-in-pakistan-mosque-attack-tells-of-his-return-to-canada
There was a net gain of 40 (yes 40, from 429 to 469) religiously motivated hate crimes in 2015 over 2014 according to the infographic.  Now we don't know what type of crimes were committed and this stat could be entirely misleading.  If I break into a church for example and steal the donation plate, is that recorded as a hate crime?   For example, if a firearm is present during the commissioning of a crime, the police will record it as a firearms related offence.  Even if the weapon wasn't actually used, it could be sitting in the basement closet for example.  Total hate against the religious hasn't seen a significant increase in Canada, just a shift onto another religion.  Good to see Muslim groups all of a sudden concerned about hate, now that it's not only the Jewish being attacked.
First of all, congratulations to everyone.  Over the years the normal response to change or something that can't be immediately explained is to burn witches, blame it on the Jews,  or sacrifice virgins.  That this has not been proposed now is a credit to us all, and makes life less stressful, especially for Jewish virgins who are also witches.  Since human beings have introduced so many wonderful and useful things, it is understandable that there is a push to DO SOMETHING, even if only symbolic, even if the cause-result is imperfectly known.  I think that we can agree that there have been two snowball earths, and that the pre-Nebraskan (AKA pre Illinoisian) glacier period was about 1.8 billion years ago.  Further we can agree that the most recent glacial period, the Wisconsonian, ended about 10-12,000 years ago with the glaciers pretty much where they are now.  Any glacial revival project needs Canadian approval.  Also the scope of the project: just cover Whitehorse, or also Ohio?
So you're saying that even when people are being targeted for a specific human trait- be it their race, or sexuality or anything else, the government shouldn't address that matter directly. Instead it should issue a generic plea for everyone to play nice.  So when gays are being targeted and murdered, the government shouldn't condemn violence against gays. And if Jews were being targeted and murdered, the government shouldn't condemn anti-Semitism. No matter how bad it gets against a specific group, you feel the government should just issue a bland statement against discrimination of any kind.  I believe that's insufficient. When we see violence and hatred directed against gays we condemn violence and hatred towards gays, while denouncing discrimination in general. When we see Jews being targeted by violence and hatred we condemn violence and hatred against Jews, while denouncing all forms of discrimination. That's what M-103 does concerning violence and hatred towards Muslims.
So, the take away message is that the far right, the far left and the muslims of France almost equally dislike jews.
One wishes that?  What you mean is YOU wish that.  And what you mean further is that you imply those people don't support that; what you mean is to suggest that the people who are against anti-muslim hate speech here are all for anti-christian hate speech somewhere else. That's  an obviously irrational position that you baselessly invent just so you can insult those people. It's triple-irrational: 1) baseless invention 2) implied not stated 3) that's an absurd false dichotomy.  Jews and Muslim Arabs and Persians have lived side-by-side peacefully for centuries. Centuries. So if you're genuinely concerned about anti-christian and anti-semitic sentiment there (and not just using it as a cheap ad hominem) then do some research and find out what has changed, because the religions haven't.
As Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe in blood transfusions, could a Jehovah's Witnesses's business refuse to provide insurance that  covers blood transfusions?
"The Hindu numeral system, or Hindu–Arabic numeral system a positional decimal numeral system, is the most common system for the symbolic representation of numbers in the world. It was invented between the 1st and 4th centuries by Indian mathematicians."  Nope. No Islamic good ole Mo followers. But a bunch of Indians from Asia.
Theology:  The study of elaborate verbal disguises for non-ideas.  Alvin Plantinga’s sophistry notwithstanding, Epicurus still stands unanswered after more than two millennia.  There’s also Stephen F Roberts’ take on things:  “I contend we are both atheists, I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.”
Every time Tebow took a knee, he was denigrated by the "Progressive?" Left, the multititude of Atheists in Colorado, and the Leftist Media.  The hatred shown to him was insufferable!
Hmm, sorry to have to ask, but, if Anti-Christian, Anti-Women and Anti_jewish hatred has no place in your Canada...what are you living here?  Because all three are alive and well.
Here's a handy defintion, provided courtesy of the Canadian Parliamentary Coalition to Combat Antisemitism (see page 5).  http://www.cp-cca.ca/pdf/Report%20of%20The%20Inquiry%20Panel-CPCCA.pdf  Just replace all references to Jews with Muslims, and related terminology, and presto!  Instant acceptable definition of Islamophobia.  After all, this was the basis of the February 26, 2015 motion in Parliament to condemn antisemitism, proposed by Irwin Cotler, that passed unanimously.  If this wording  received unanimous acceptance in Parliament, why should it be any different if the same wording was proposed for Islamophobia?  Why all the drama over M-103 when Canadian leaders have already endorsed specific protections to one religion?  If Section 2 of the Charter is our guide, then protections afforded to adherents of one religion from discriminatory criticism and hatred should be applied to all, n'est-ce pas?
It's a lot easier being a Hindu and believing in reincarnation; if you die - no problem  - you will just come back again.
These are not "Buddhist protesters" as much as "Bamar protesters" or "Myanmar nationalist protesters".  I mean, we don't use headlines like "Christians rally against refugees" to describe a gathering of Trump supporters.  I know it's easier to use convenient, superficial labels than to spend the time explaining the ethnic differences between people who look the same to us, but it is a grave disservice to the many others who share that label but not the views.
In other words, there are Black Jews, Asian Jews, and White Jews.  Ashkenazi & Sephardi Jews who have no Asian or African DNA are white. Period. There is no debate to be had.
Monte,   The "aliens" in ancient Israel were either travelers passing through or those who were staying and becoming Jews. It was when these unbelievers were allowed to stay and intermarry without becoming Jews that the nation fell.    Liberals point to America's pre-20th Century lack of border controls as precedent, but even that is twisting things because those people come to America willing to embrace their new homeland, learn it's language (English) and become part of the nation. Contrast that with how many immigrants today are refusing to learn English, demanding government benefits and doing things like attempting to establish Sharia law by force. Without firm border controls America is headed toward being just like the countries of Europe where uncontrolled immigration is overwhelming both the public welfare systems, decimating their prosperity and destroying the rule of law.
it is based on the lack of evidence of the god you say exists (or any of the ones you say don't exist). it is not a belief system or religion and while not agnostic, most atheists would change their mind if you could provide evidence . you may counter that there is evidence, however most atheists would then want to test that evidence and would quickly find that is not possible.   . The crux of the difference comes down to testing the evidence vs believing someone else interpretation.
Thank you, 'Bodacious Professor'.  I could not agree with you more.  You are so right in that too many people blame Vatican II for causing ALL the upheaval of the 1960's.    Actually, the Council was a fulcrum poised between two epochs a) the world settling down after WW II and b) the Age of Biopolitical issues percolating like a massive lava flow all during the 1960's---especially 1968.  This decade was decisive in producing the world in which we now live.  The official church had many issues to deal with in Vatican II---a magisterial teachings from the mid-nineteenth century---vitriolic opposition to democracy, suffrage, religious freedom and other liberal political issues vs. religious liberty, democracy, freedom of conscience, atheism, and vernacular liturgical adaptations.  The Council Fathers did not see coming at them: equality for women, complexity of sexual identity and relationships and biomedical technologies---all that we face today.  And these are not all the issues.
My reaction to Trump's statement is that everyone knows what the Holocaust refers to, the Nazi campaign that caused the death of more than 6 million innocent Jews.
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. I'll give you a scientific example, Superstring Theory is a prominent branch of physics that predicts the existence of magnetic monopoles. There is precisely zero evidence that such particles exist. Does that mean that they don't? Of course not. But by the standard used by atheists you have to state that they don't exist, because we have no evidence that they do. I feel bad for all those poor deluded physicists.
Thank you Ward: that was a wonderful Ali interview! What a great guy, brilliant and funny. What he said, of course, absolutely is true, in its day. Black men walking around with white women were in grave danger in much of this country (still are, in places in the S and W…).  With the destruction of the black race (drugs and incarceration) and identity that took place in the 20th century, a "black is beautiful" message was a wonderful one to focus on. Black Muslims were law-abiding, brooking no criminals in their church. No drinking. You may wish to note that, until very recently, Catholic priests STRONGLY urged catholic boys NOT to propose to non-Catholic girls. Aren't you outraged? Same with Jews: intermarriage is frowned upon, though, unlike Catholics, a woman really can't become a Jew in traditional sense.
"what is 'moral' 'right' 'good' and 'defensible'" Okay, Robert, who is on your naughty list? Gay people? Women exercising their personal choice who have an abortion? People having sex (straight or gay) without marriage? Atheists? Anyone who isn't conservative Christian? Store owners who say "Happy Holidays" in December?
The fear you describe is easily banished - choose to be neither gay or atheist
Perhaps the person did not realize this was a real trooper. Trump has been saying that the six sided jewish star that he took from the neo- nazi site was really a police star.  I notice the trooper is wearing a pentagram instead. Perhaps the person was as clueless as Trump and thought the cop was actually a devil worshipper impersonating an officer.
I'm not suggesting your wrong, but "literally thousands of cemeteries across Canada that are exclusive to Catholics, Protestants and Jews."  Can you cite references for this statement?
For netanyahu to state that the settlements are not the core issue of conflict is disingenuous. The Palestinians have already recognised Israel both at the Camp David accords 1978 and again in 1988.. to recognise Israel as a Jewish state .. is that upping the anti? Netanyahu has publicly declared he will never recognise Palestine and unless he agrees to a two state solution Israel cannot become a Jewish state. To say that the US policy has been to support a 2 state solution is also kind of disingenuous.. if they would quit supporting Israel militarily and financially they would be forced to come to the table. I watched part of the news conference wher Netanyahu whined about the UN being "unfair" to Israel. Really? If you continue to break the law shouldn't you expect criticism? Trump and netanyahu.. everyones nightmare! I had to go have a shower.
Israel is not the model of combat power.  We are.  And they also have forced conscription. So you're arguing for a pushover force and forced service.  One insight I had in my 3 combat deployments in the middle east was a MUCH lowered opinion of the Israeli military (which had been over-hyped by then largely Jewish influenced US media in the 60s, 70s, 80s).  You bought that view, and now are reflecting on that in your answer.  I remember the insight distinctly.  I was in one firefight against Iraqi forces and I learned how awfully bad they were (individual actions, small units, company level, battalion level, division level) responded, and I came to the insight that for the most part the Israeli forces only seemed good in comparison to the chubby girl scout like forces they went up again.   I worked with reconstituting their forces in a different deployment and saw up close and personal how they behaved and operated in combat and in garrison.    We have the best, and we need to keep it.
the homeless jew only needs $12,000 to buy a house.....so stop giveing money to fake charitys ...that abuse the homeless by overcrowding them ....in stuffy buildings.....
I for one am thankful that "Islam is peace" - Imagine how chaotic the world would be if Islam was hatred , or if Islam were intolerance, or if Islam was misogyny , or if Islam was violence.. - - - thank goodness that "Islam is peace"
This is exactly why free speech is critical in a democracy. The Oligarchs are using supposed racism as a way to take it away.  This is situation worked perfectly. This is how democaracy works He said nasty stuff People responded accordingly He lost his position That is how free speech works.  The Canadian government is using you.  Heaven forbid you are thrown in jail for crapping on a tax collector because he's Muslim or Jewish. These laws will be used against you when all you did was get pissed at a tax collector. That is how totalitarianism starts. You completely missed it.  There is a very clear insidious purpose to the bills being proposed in Ottawa.  The fake out the cons proposal only to pass the Libs. Thus the oligarchs get want they want. To take away your freedom  The Trump victory has hastened the oligarchy's need for control before they are toppled here and elsewhere. The German government is proposing to use immigrants as voters.  Without immigrants they will lose .
No, let's mind. 3 killed in Boston, and I can't find one for Chicago. But these are the latest attempts  1. mosques, and White House - Eric Feight, Glendon Scott Crawford  2. Courthouse, bank, forest festival, first-responders. Jonathan Leo Schrader  3.9/11 Memorial event in Kansas City, Missouri. Joshua Ryne Goldberg  A Jewish American man, Joshua Ryne Goldberg, posing as an Australian ISIS supporter, attempted to get an FBI confidential informant to detonate a bomb at a Kansas City, Missouri September 11 attacks memorial event. Goldberg attempted to persuade the confidential informant to coat the shrapnel of the bomb in rat poison in order to maximize casualties.  Funny Arabic names
So funny most U.S. Citizens get their "Opinions" from the Democratic Party's $5 Billion A Year Propaganda Machine that is funded by U.S. and International Corporations.   And even worse were Brainwashed by the Democratic Party's U.S. Labor Union Owned Teachers and Professors.  Facts what I learned from having to deal with the Muslims since 1982, as well as formal training and education (University and Madrasa not at the U.S.).  Muslims have a Culture of War.  The Holy Koran was written by Mohammad as a Military Commander demanding 100% Support from All People to Support his Large Armies that were conquering "The Known World".  109 Suras of the 114 Suras of the Holy Koran are the Written Declared War Against Christians, Jews, Unbelievers (Kafir).  The Celebration of Ramadan is the Celebration of the Defeats and Massacres of Christians, Jews, Unbelievers.  Sura 2 All Muslims must join the Jihad against the Christians, Jews, Unbelievers, no excuses, as proof of being a Muslim.
I disagree. I think it's obvious that the main point of the march in Charlottesville was in support of white supremacism, as proved by the chants of the marchers, who represented white supremacy groups the KKK, American NAZI Party, Vanguard America, and various white nationalist groups. Maybe the don't beat their wives and kick their dogs, but they want to repress black and brown people and Jews, and they want America to be a place only for white people. They are no better than the institutionalized racist of South Africa, demanding apartheid.  Those are not good people. they are a threat to millions of American citizens.  The statue of Lee was a symbolic rallying point, but white nationalism meaning racial and religious bigotry and exclusion of everyone not white was the message.
I disagree about where the burden of proof lay.  Those with fantastical claims with no evidence need to prove their point.  Atheists have much evidence on their side, the religious do not.  Atheism is actually the rational position.   Religion is based solely in faith.....it is emotional rather than rational.  I have an extensive scientific background, so yes, I understand the scientific method very well.  And I understand the difference between faith & belief vs facts & evidence.
50000 police and 7000 soldiers. All needed because a very tiny sliver of the population hailing from another culture that hates freedom, womens rights, and Jews, has been allowed to proliferate unchecked.  France is a case study in multiculturalism. There are lessons for other western countries to draw from.  The glaring suggestion from this mass deployment of troops is that not all cultures are equal.
this is a symptom of intolerance, not just some silly municipal 'right'.  The Muslim community has the right to have a cemetery to bury their deceased just like Jews, Christians do. Denying this right is undemocratic, unCanadian and wrong. Simple.
See my post elsewhere.  Her father was on the editorial board of a  newspaper known to rabidly attack jews. It is easily verifiable.  If I know it, she knows it as well. She should just admit it and move on.
For the argument that Jesus chose only men for the Apostles, then since he chose only Jews, gentiles cannot be ordained. This is EXACTLY the same argument.   "The constant practice of the Church" means nothing: Owning slaves was a regular practice in the Church until the 19th century. So this should not have stopped.  The magisterium has been wrong in the past, it is wrong now. The ACTUAL reason  for the "constant practice" of not ordaining women was the belief that women are inferior to men. Thomas Aquinas wrote in the Summa Theologica, Supplement, q 39, art 1, "since it is not possible in the female sex to signify eminence of degree, for a woman is in the state of subjection, it follows that she cannot receive the sacrament of Orders".  This belief has been officially repudiated -- which means that when the magisterium taught it, the magisterium was WRONG -- but is still firmly in place. It is just tarted up by calling it "complementarity".
America is not a secular nation! It is a pluralistic, and free nation that was founded based on Judeo-Christian principles.
I just wonder if the roles were reversed e.g.  A Jewish cemetery next to a Mosque.  Would there be an outcry from the religion of peace? Would the press be as quick to condemn if it were the other way around?
The Liberals under McKenzie King were very xenophobic and racist and Uncle Louis St. Laurent was scarcely better.  Immigrants were selected in order of descending ethnic preference: northern Europeans, southern Europeans, Jews, then Asians at the very bottom of the list.  The Asiatic Exclusion Acts, the Head Tax and the so-called "continuous journey" immigration regulations cemented those policies.  It took the Conservative government of John Diefenbaker which after passing the Canadian Bill of Rights removed the inherent racism from our immigration legislation and opened up the refugee system.
Jews resided in and possessed the land in Judea and Samaria long before the so-called Palestinians arrived from the Arab Peninsula as part of the great Islamic occupation expeditions of the 7th and 8th century that conquered and obliterated most other cultures in the Middle East. Jordan seized the territory in 1948. Israel then seized it from Jordan when Jordan and its Arab allies attacked Israel in 1967. The current legislation reinforces in law the return of the land to its lawful Jewish ownership. Many countries currently occupy and claim ownership of land in other countries. Morocco in the Western Sahara, Tanzania in Uganda, India in the Maldives, Turkey in Cyprus, Ethiopia in Eritrea, Russia in the Ukraine, are some of the more notable ones. Yet nary a peep to engage in the formal boycott of these countries.
It is relevant. Because she shares his views. Only this time not about the  Jews as he did but about the Russians.  Such a xenophobic person cannot represent me, a Canadian citizen of Russian decent,  as a Foreign Affairs minister of Canada.
I guess he has worked to make Puerto Rico all better? Worked to figure out a way to reduce mass shootings - which happen nearly every DAY in America?   Heck, he's not even on top of Jews being threatened by his emboldened supporters in NYC...   But he sure has time to be on top of what is said about him on late night TV.    Trump - the affirmative action hire for white people.
Don't we follow a guy who was a "Cafeteria Jew"?
You're right.  We need to outlaw atheists.  Clearly they're mentally unstable and prone to extreme violence.  All atheists must be registered and monitored to prevent future tragedies like this in the future.
Surely you jest. No? Then this is the most unintentionally hilarious thing I've read since I received "The Encyclopedia of Jews in Sport" as a bar mitzvah gift.  The National is an obscure program few people watch, typically finishing third in a three-way race.  No wonder.  Its ability to cover breaking news is weak. (If an airplane crashed into CBC HQ, the network would probably botch the story by convening its political panel.) Scoops are rare. Many news viewers prefer competing newscasts​ than contain something the National often lacks: news.  If a lot of people watch The National, is that a good thing or a bad thing? The fundamental issue is that the CBC has never been able to answer this question. Hence the doomed efforts to jazz things up. And the exaggerated claims of "agenda setting" -- whatever that means. (What else can you say when no one is watching?)   I will grant that the few people who care about the succession care a lot. But they are very much a vocal minority.
With all due respect to Mr Milner, it's always very dangerous treading into the waters of defining what sets locals vs haole apart when the writer is a self proclaimed "outsider". The fact that he is Jewish and bluntly inferring that fact sets him apart from other haole, is misguided and self serving.  That aside, there is no magic number of years your duration of residence is that allows you to comment on what the "common belief" is no matter how ingratiating. Here on Maui we have a grossly magnified sense of entitlement from most haole. Most, even those born and raised, have no footing in local ways or perspective when it comes to the white oppression foisted daily, and thru history, upon us or anyone of color.   As far as the suggestion of "being informed outsiders", how about a suggestion instead of a deferential attitude and quit trying to define us with a limited awareness of history. And, in my strong agreement with the writer, stop trying to appropriate a culture not your own.
Monica: I always enjoy reading your erudite comments, even if I don't always agree with them. You are forever courteous and thoughtful.  :-)   That being said: The God-is-love hermeneutic is probably the liberal Christian's (both Protestant & Catholic) singular motto.  I think that evangelical Christians and traditional Catholics go in to other extreme with the God-the-Just-Judge hermeneutic.   Like Aristotle, we probably should seek out the golden mean.
Ha-ha. Ronny can now recall his Jewish ancestors' saying, 'Бачили очі, що купували - їжте, хоч повилазьте! -- Now, [my] eyes, you HAVE seen what you were buying, now EAT it all, even if you have to pop out!.   Effing Lithuanian sod.
No, but I've been fed up with Xtian propaganda in my face day after day, week after week, year after year, for decades. Why can't they keep their religion in church, where it belongs? Instead they continue to try to force their religion down all of our throats and destroy good people in the process. I for one am sick of it all. Time for an atheist pride parade!
In posing a question to you, I was hoping to make you think.  Forlorn hope. Your 'hypo' scenario doesn't need even one of your 'ten atheists', does it? Get it?
Well said and it is important that it is brought to light... It is a problem that MINORITIES fail to understand MULTICULTURALISM  thinking that it means you can keep your old hatred and racist views, Radical Political Views and many more.  As a minority myself I can attest after living for 5 Years in Vancouver. That if you are not part of a MAJORITY Ethnic Community like the North Indians or the Chinese then certain racist views (many Asians are very racist towards each other) are often just swept under the rug.  I can't tell the numerous times wherein a workplace is a majority Vietnamese, Filipino or Punjabi, and the said majority will not hire or will hire with intolerance....  I have talked to numerous hindu Central and South Indians and they refuse to move to Vancouver due to the RACISM from the Punjabi North Indians which do not adapt to Canadian values of tolerance and bring with their traditions also old prejudices.   These are just small examples of a failed Diversity..
In order to understand the term "islamophobia" we must also understand Islam's own misogyny, homophobia, hatred of Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Europe, America, democracy, dogs, free speech, human rights and everything else not permitted (haram) by Islam.
Israel will remain a Jewish state. Palestinians will continue to fester in the West Bank and Gaza due to the intransigence of their leaders in coming to the bargaining table. Palestinians will continue to put their women and children in harm's way by sending them on suicide missions. The Palestinians and now the UN have killed any prospect of two states. The Palestinians will remain stateless indefinitely. Palestinians will continue to enjoy living among Jews in Israel as they do now.
reading comprehension much? "Christian"? "super patriot"?  im an atheist. i.e.; non-believer. that means i don't believe in your cult or cult hero's, not the muslim ones or the christian ones.  where did i accuse you of treason or threaten kill you?  that comment is straight delusional. and you just lost this discourse handily.  your one dimensional arguments don't pertain to me.  ...but they're all you have. sigh  your book is full of embarrassing antiquated patriarchal backward quotes and beliefs. it is no wonder generations of modern muslims have re-interpreted those evil prose to fit modernity. (and failing miserably)  this is fun, lets keep doing it.
Garbage - The calls for violence in the OT are for "Just Wars" (if there is such a thing) for the preservation of the Jewish race during a specific period of time...I said show one verse in the NEW TESTAMENT where Christ orders his followers to kill anybody. Your bias and bigotry is blatant and recognized by all.  Not all Muslims advocate violence but the book does - you are a piece of work...Go ahead -we are all waiting for those verses. Yeah, just what I thought. No I don't remember the Pastor who said that because there is no Biblical command for violence, so it is just him spouting his rhetoric. Your evidence is a joke and anecdotal, and also ignores the numerous times I have asked you for Christs commands  of violence, I know you won't respond because their aren't any.
Ian Buruma is obsessed with anti-Israel and Jewish themes for many years.  Google it.  That the Globe publishes this man's screeds says something sinister about the people in charge of the opinions page.
All English dreaming, All was Developed in Germany, Yes many were Jews BUT GERMAN JEWS !!!!
Actually religion is a protected class. If it's a public business it's open to the public . So if a Muslim business sells wedding cakes they legally have to sell them to Jews or Christians too. The Equal Rigjts Amendmwnt was put in place because of people refusing service to people they didn't like; like Blacks, Jews or Muslims. Imagine that!
He is CNN's PAPA Jew.
Well, it's the belief that something must be proven with scientific evidence to exist that makes your form of atheism, a religion.  Your bible is science and your methodology is the scientific method.  So, yeah, belief has everything to do with your form of atheism at least.
Dear Sarasi1 Today I chatted with Jesus about your two-part post of yesterday on love. He loved it. He asked though that we do not equate THAT He died with the HOW. Of course they are related, and if the indignity and pain help to appreciate the depth of love, then fine. He asked us to remember that by becoming fully human, in time, death was "included in the package". The "how" is of historical significance. Whether He or the Parent foresaw/intended the how, though intellectually open, is essentially theological subtlety.  Immersion into creation, death, and into the depth of earth and rising from the dead is the essence of Redemption.  All creation, all humanity have been into His divine Person and into the unity with His Parent, now our Parent as well as creator, t Identifying "that" and "how" has distorted the message, too much hate, hurt with Jewish brothers and sisters over the ages. "I never was not a Jew, right?" Yes Lord. "And one more thing....." (Cont'd)
The problem with this motion is lack of clarity. The OED defines 'Islamophobia' as "Intense dislike or fear of Islam, esp. as a political force; hostility or prejudice towards Muslims"; Merriam-Webster gives the following definition:  irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against Islam or people who practice Islam.   It is the reference to Islam that is problematic. Islam is not a race, ethnicity, or nationality; it is a set of religious beliefs. Criticism of a set of religious beliefs--Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, or Islam--is not the same as prejudice or bigotry to adherents of those beliefs.   It seems to me that the use of this term is an unnecessary distraction from a very important issue, the growing prejudice and hostility towards Muslims in Canada. This bill should be amended, replacing the term 'Islamophobia' with the phrase 'prejudice or hostility towards Muslims'.
Back around 1991 I got flow to Toronto for a week long computer course. Watching local TV from my hotel room I saw the Ontario Premier sharing a stage with handful of superstition pedlars. That would never happen in BC, then or since.   The closest was when the SoCred party drove another nail in their Party Coffin by affirming their "Christian Heritage" party platform driving out Right Wing Jewish and other supporters from the SoCred Coalition and setting the stage for the so called "BC Liberal" coalition.   "No Religion" (thank you very much -) has overtaken "Catholic" as the largest response when Stats Can pokes its nose into that area of our private lives.   The real No Religion rate is much higher. People tend to give Socially Conventional Responses when asked about Religion, rather than tellign the truth. That is particularly true when the Government is asking, and recording the Response, Name, Home Address and Birth-date for future publication in Census results.
I think those who adhere to the Hebrew Bible's standard for capital punishment should also adhere to the Beth Din's standard of its implementation, including the fact that there had to be two eyewitnesses who did not contradict one another. To appropriate what the Law says outside the context of Jewish implementation is to deceive.
Uller, you seem to be saying that no one makes bomb threats against Jews, so this bomb threat against Jews "has to" be fake.  And evidence that this has happened over 100 times in the US and Canada this year will not convince you, because, again, you're somehow convinced no one does such a thing.  At least acknowledge that it's a thing that must never be done, or you are but giving cover to terrorists.   https://www.buzzfeed.com/mikehayes/bomb-threats-jewish-centers?utm_term=.joEvXRokjj#.yd5x2YBz99
"the Word Incarnate" is capable of philosophizing as much as Marty E is capabable of commenting on Aristotle.  I guess He wasn't a "teacher" either? "The law written in the heart" whether of Gentile or Jew, is first of all reason and is in "the image and likeness of God".
The inaugual speech was almost identical to Hitler's decrying the wreckage of Germany after WWI.  Trump falsely claimed this nation is similarly destroyed and needs a new Fuhrer to climb out of the wreckage.  Hitler's claim was true of a nation in complete economic chaos.  Trump's regurgitation demonstrates his fealty to the policies and artifices of Mein Kampf to gain control of a nation.  So far, so good.  Now all he has to do is unleash the military, border patrol, and law enforcement on all who dissent - women, blacks, latinos, Jews, Moslem, Native American.  All of those preventing the looting of the nation's land, water, and resources by his Billionaire Baron Corporate Oligarchy.  Joining the Russian Oligarchy with the U.S. Oligarchy into a worldwide fascist empire ruled by the Oligarchs from the bunkered board rooms.  Welcome to the U.S. Corporations of Amerika replacing the United States.
Though Jews discriminate no less than others, discrimination alone isn't apartheid. Apartheid occurs when a minority group in a territory, backed by the full might of the government they control, suppresses and abuses a democratic majority in that same territory. And that's the situation in Palestine. Israel calls the shots there, not the democratic Palestinian majority.   Again, the parallels to apartheid South Africa are clear. The SA government would intervene in the black territories if, say, a white settler or corporation wanted land and resources there. The territory's so-called autonomy would disappear, and if necessary the military would be sent in to enforce the will of Johannesburg.  I began the discussion by saying that there are significant human rights abuses throughout the Middle East. But there's only one apartheid state in the region: Israel.  Wishing you a good day, too.
I was not saying that Protestants, Jews and so on do not have problems. What I said was that they have seemed to have solved the problem of married clergy. How about addressing that?
"And I am reminded that Jesus, Mary and Joseph were refugees in the land of Egypt to escape the clutches of Herod."  Since both Judea and Egypt were part of the Roman Empire, wouldn't they have been "internally displaced persons," not refugees? Also, wasn't there a large, centuries-old, Jewish population in Egypt at the time? Is it un-Christian to question whether this particular Biblical analogy is really applicable?
M103 may only be a "motion", but it's going to morph into a law that makes it illegal to things that are obviously true.   This is Orwellian, and it will end very badly for everyone concerned.  By the way, the most vulnerable group to hate in Canada, year after year, with no exceptions are jews.  And the greatest source of this, now and even more in the future, is... well...
Agnostic and Atheist are A word labels, often used as slurs. Non religious people are one of the last groups that the general population in the USA, and some USA courts, still feel free to disrespect and discriminate against. Homosexuals and Lesbians can adopt, but try adopting or getting custody if you are openly non religious.  I prefer the I, R and S word labels. Irreligious, Rational, Reasonable, Sane, Sensible.  It is unreasonable for someone with a modern education to believe in supernatural beings and powers. That is why every developed country except the USA has a non religious majority.  http://www.people-press.org/2002/12/19/among-wealthy-nations/  https://www.irreligion.org/2011/09/16/half-of-canadians-think-religion-more-harmful-than-good-poll-finds/
Two points:  1. I was specifically replying to the atheist-op-ed writer, who, while writing cogently about Jesus Christ's commandment about loving others, didn't mention what HE (the writer) did during the Christmas season as to helping the disadvantaged.  The core message of atheism is that of denial of  God through Christ, without actually doing anything substantive to help the poor.  2. Yes, of course there are SECULAR-based charities that do good work. But atheists have not really organized themselves into ""churches", until recently -- something that would give atheism the potential to do good work as atheists.  The three monotheistic religions  (Christianity, Judaism, Islam) all emphasize helping the poor. On this point, where are the atheists? I mean, really?  Back to the op-ed piece, the writer makes good points, as ideas. But for me Christmas is a time of giving and the sharing of Christian love. -- David Murrell, Economics, UNB at Fredericton
Saunders seems to be concerned only with attempts at bombing Parliament - and forgets the murder of  Ian Gow MP at his home in 1990 - while ignoring the many terrorist attacks, mainly by the IRA, from the 1970s onwards. The worst attack was the destruction of  Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, by a bomb probably planted by Iranian, not Libyan, agents. 270 were killed.  Many of the other attacks were directed at Jewish targets. Jewish schools in the UK, as in France, are all heavily guarded because of the threat of attacks from certain religious groups.  The following is a list of attacks on mainland UK, not including NI, from the 1970s.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents_in_Great_Britain
Actually, we have a long tradition of not establishing a forced national religion. And that includes not promoting any religion in a secular government and it's funded entities. We sometimes fail. But there is nothing that says that the personal religious leanings of a Catholic or a Muslim or a Buddhist should preempt them from serving publicly. There is so much hypocrisy here on both "sides". Dems have zero issues with known secular ideologues being on the bench, and Repubs would be asking the same questions of a Muslim candidate, you just know it. And be VERY careful about taxing churches- that whole "separation" concept goes both ways, and "No Taxation Without Representation". Do we want true religious parties being able to legislate? I don't. No, Dems are out of line on this questioning, they just want their OWN pulpit and biases to rule the day. I would say the same about Repubs and Muslims. And we could talk about this globalist pope all day. The left is OK with that. Politics.
The anti-Semitic hatred has been unleashed by elements of the political left who hide their anti-Jewish bigotry behind the supposedly respectable label of anti-Zionism.
I agree. Netanyahu killed it long ago.   So, it looks like Israel-Palestine will be a bi-national state, made up of Israeli Jews and Palestinian Christians and Arabs, with one person, one vote and full civil and legal rights for all.   Nothing wrong with that.  Or did you have something else in mind?
Who cares ? I wasn't just trying to share random trivia (which has it's place but this is not it) - I cited a fact directly relevant to the topic under discussion. What came before, or after, is not - and honestly why did you bring it up ? Especially since you don't bother to mention whether you consider the Sephardis to be 'true' Jews ?  So instead of addressing the issues raised by the fact - you go off on a long tangent about ethnic heritage ?
Some Muslims want to apply some aspects of Sharia Law (which includes protection of widows & orphans and alms for the poor) in some family disputes, just a Christians and Orthodox Jews have the right to do.  Nothing that contravenes the criminal code or the Charter would ever be allowed to stand in such a resolution. There is absolutely no basis for a fear that Sharia Law will "(replace) our judicial system...".  That's just absurd.
What if the boss is a Hindu?
I feel this whole thread is veering into semantics but I think your first sentence actually defines agnosticism. I think, by definition, an atheist does not believe in God/gods. You're trying to wiggle out of it with "I am only required to not accept the claim that a God or gods exist." How is that any different? I think Roland's point is that the disbelief in God- the affirmative statement that "God does not exist" is based as much on belief as the idea that God does exist. The notion that there is any tie to the scientific method in atheism  is a logical fallacy as science is entirely silent on the subject. In this way atheism certainly bears more than a passing resemblance to a religion as the affirmative statement "God does not exist" (which seems like a reasonable requirement for atheism) is entirely a statement of belief- there are no facts to support it.
There is no issue to avoid. Were it not for the fact that there is vociferous LBGT lobby in the West, there would be no discussion at all.  I’ve been through this exact drill for decades. The rabbis were wrong, the early Church wrong, everyone got it wrong until really really smart people found the mistake. Thus your cohort's ""there is no such think as 'the' natural law".  In reality the moral content of the Old Testament carried over into the NT except where specifically corrected, e.g., Mark 6-12. This included prohibitions against murder, incest, fornication, bestiality, homosexual relations, and so on. The Natural Law, which the rabbis identified but used other terminology in describing, remained intact.  Because the Church’s teaching rests on two pillars - Scripture and Tradition - that “Jesus ... never spoke of it” is irrelevant.  Jesus' audience was Jews, and they did not need to be instructed that marriage consisted of one man and one woman.
True. Although again, I think you'll find the majority of those murdered by the regime are dissenters, who have gone up against Kim, they haven't been killed because they are a specific religion, nor specifically because N Korea is atheist. Also, I have my doubts as to how secular or atheist N Korea truly is, considering the entire country seems struck by a cult of personality, and seems to worship young Kim as a virtual god!
"Recent evidence from Vatican files...." I think it is now your turn to provide evidence of this claim. A url will suffice.  A Catholic/Jewish group have consistently asked for access to Vatican files to find the truth of what the Church did, or didn't, do during the war. They have been refused on each occasion. This is just supposition, a wild stab in the dark, but I'm guessing that there is a reason the Vatican refuse such access. They are guilty as sin.
My point is we were a Christian society at some point. Sunday store closiers is one of the many evidences of that Christian influence. There are many hundreds more examples of evidence of Christian influences in US history.  Many of those customs are faded away just as the moral compass has faded away. We are on a path to a Godless future that will require a police state because people are not guided by their own awareness of the loving God. He is still very much God and many still have personal relationships that guide their lives. I know all about the hypocrites so don't need to tell me that but thank God for the very humble Christlike people like Dr. Martin Luther King for one, Mother Therisa, Red Cross, Salvation Army. etc.  All the first colleges in America were Christian without a doubt.  The examples are almost endless but the brain wasing continues and now Colleges are atheistic for the most part. Someday will be your last day on earth so I hope you get it right. Heaven or Hell
Traditionally, Jews and Muslims are buried in a plain shroud, but the law required a coffin, so there was a plain pine coffin. The male relatives carried it to the grave. The rabbi recited the (four-line) El Male Rachamim, the mourners recited the (fifteen line) Mourner's Kaddish, the coffin was lowered into the grave and everybody took turns forking some dirt onto it. Then the miniature bulldozer finished the job. There was some ceremonial rending of garments, but obviously not real garments, just ribbons provided for the purpose.  No promises, no fantasies, no feudal pageantry, no exploiting the occasion to frighten anybody into being obedient. Nothing left to be said. If there is a God, the rest is up to Him. If there is not a God, the Jews will continue to worship Him, because that's what being a Jew is about.  I was impressed. Much more dignified, I thought. Kind of sorry I have to have the other thing, but of course, at that point I won't really care anymore.
Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot were not "atheist movements".  They used atheism as an antithesis to the power of the deist religionists.  All of it was a means to establish power over others and justify evil acts.  Atheism is the absence of belief in a spirit god.  Atheism is not inherently evil.  These 3 evil human beings set themselves up as gods with followers just as blindly faithful as any other human religion.  Their atheism was merely to supplant other god-beliefs in order to gain absolute power.  You make the war comparison of which nothing in my statemnt supports.  Hitler rose out of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism in Germany providing the basis for his hatred and final solution for Jews.  My statement addresses the blind faith of any who willingly follow either human or spirit gods to the extent they lose their own humanity and respect for human existence.  Body counts have no relevance in discussion of "isms".  Humans killing humans is just a fact of life history.
kpare,  While I wholeheartedly agree that atheists are just as capable of and do perform charitable acts, a greater understanding of Christianity would also inform you that charitable acts cannot be used "as leverage at the Pearly Gates."
I think it's important for Freeland to give public comment to newer released information from Polish government records that reveal that Freeland's story given to Canadians about her families history is false, and her family were actually Nazi collaborators, who created and disseminated hateful propaganda against Jews, and celebrated in the Nazi's killing of thousands of Allied soldiers: http://johnhelmer.org/?p=17016 "The records now being opened by the Polish government in Warsaw reveal that Freeland’s maternal grandfather Michael (Mikhailo)  Chomiak was a Nazi collaborator from the beginning to the end of the war. He was given a powerful post, money, home and car by the German Army in Cracow, then the capital of the German administration of the Galician region. His principal job was editor in chief and publisher of a newspaper the Nazis created." Those are just the start of details of Freeland's family's Nazi alignment. The full list is extremely extensive.
Orthodox Jews and Muslims also believe in the imminent return of a saviour,  blessings for the goodly and punishment for the wicked.    Who that saviour is, what constitutes punishment - these things vary.  No way you could get 41-48% of Americans or Canadians believing in that as the numbers of believers in orthodox Islam or Judaism are simply not there.  Fringe would be secondary in that consideration.  Funny, I thought it was a pretty standard comparison and readily understood belief (rapture).  But then I live in Alberta.
I live in a very white small city of perhaps 43 thousand in BC  We have extremely few black folks and if I met someone Jewish, I would have no idea of  their Jewishness unless told so.  Therefore, when on the rare occasion seeing someone Jewish then being told afterward I met a Jewish person, I struggle to imagine what it was I  was supposed to dislike about them.  As for someone Black, the very rare time encountering one with such a colour of skin, my immediate thought is sometimes simply......I am supposed to be biased and rejecting this person......why? What  is objectionable about this person......then I move on.  I am 63 and still struggle to figure out what it is and why we are supposed to dislike all these 'different' people.  Perhaps I am patherically naive and if so......can someone explain all this to me?
And now the Jews have Palestinions in a concentration camp as the right becomes the wrong, and the left becomes the right. Humanity is not too bright.
I agree with the sentiments expressed in most of the comments. Most immigrants to the west immigrate because of better economic opportunities, higher standard of living, taxpayer funded social benefits and freedom from oppression. Yet Muslim communities seem ignorant to the fact that what underpin all of these benefits is the Western liberal tradition. Muslim communities seem to shun this liberal tradition and wish for its stifling, sharia based view of the world to enjoy recognition if not dominance. I acknowledge that my statements are generalised and subjective, but it is unfortunately the impression created by the treatment of women and the constant hateful bile directed at Jewish people and Gay people by the bulk of the Muslim community. I continue to find it puzzling that "progressives" like the author continue to support the Muslim cause, while most Muslims reject social progressive views on issues like the rights of women and the LGBT community, secularism and the death penalty
He speaks to my wife in English, with a Brooklyn Jewish accent.
two-state solution ... delusions of the Western mind.  "The Palestinians have never accepted a two-state solution because they have never accepted the idea of a Jewish state in their midst. "  "The charter of the PLO specifically rules out any division of the land."  "...hatred of Israel and denials of its legitimacy are part of the Palestinian culture, taught to children in the schools and to adults through the media."  They never do think it; the notion of a two-state solution that would be acceptable to the Palestinians resides only in the delusions of the Western mind.  Excerpts - "Why would anyone ever think the Palestinians would accept a two-state solution?" - Lawrence Solomon - National Post - January 9, 2017
A weak and ineffective gesture.  Just goes to show how powerful lobbies have caused irreparable harm to American democracy, and true US national interests.   For this resolution to have been meaningful, it should have spelled concrete economic and military sanctions that would be imposed if Israel continues to disobey international law.  AIPAC and their Evangelical allies won't let this happen, of course, even though Israel's current policies will inevitably lead to one bi-national state or, as many in the Knesset and Amercian Zionist favour, mass ethnic cleansing.  This is all very sad because--and this is something extremists on both side hate to hear--Palestinians and Jews are the same people.   Their DNA is almost identical.  Palestinians are most likely Jews of old who were forced to convert to other religions.
When Marine Le Pen temporarily stepped down as President of the FN during the second round (and think about that for a second) the party appointed Jean-François Jalkh as interim leader.  A man so close to Jean-Marie Le Pen, he was on record as a holocaust denier.  He lasted 3 days before the public found out and he was forced to resign.  Today's FN is still very much yesterday's FN.  Marine's biggest change was to try to substitute muslims for jews as the 'other', in which she has only been partly successful.  You can believe that the LE Pen minority are all highly principled and the 90% of Parisians who voted against Le Pen were confused and bamboozled, just don't expect a lot of people to share your view.
When did students start praying in school? I still remember all the fuss when they banned the Lord's Prayer.....have we now reversed our positon on banning religion from our public schools? -------------- Position not changed Lord's Prayer, Christmas Nativity scenes still banned in public schools  Anyone knows any public schools where there are evangelical Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Buddhist ...prayers?
You are the classic example of liberal thought process. In one paragraph you have told me twice what I think or should think and questioned my own thoughts.  Her job is to represent all Canadians. She ridiculed those who are devout to their religion. To promote science and it's theories and research is fine but to ridicule the religious people of Canada is wrong, and I'm an atheist.
On of the main reasons you will find some atheists seem to have a militant attitude is that many religious apologists attempt to co-opt ideas that have developed in Western democracies.  I would attribute the 'natural rights' to the magna carta rather than the church.  And while some tenets of the New Testament have had a positive influence (a significant positive influence), there are many that have been negative and most Christian churches have been very slow to recognize the universality of the ideas attributed to Christ. . I enjoy and appreciate the Christmas season for the positive aspects it brings out in general, the goodwill, the friends and family, the feasting.  But it has more to do with the celebrations that predated Christmas and were co-opted by Christianity than anything Christians have done
Atheism is predicated on belief not rationality.  Their is no more scientific evidence to support atheism than their is any other religion.
This is not true.  The Law or Leviticus never actually disallows women priests, it simply tells us who can definitely be priests - the sons of Aaron.    It is sexist for our church to keep women from priesthood because our priesthood is not a  Jewish Priesthood based on the Law and were it one, none of our clergy could be considered validly ordained as they are 99 percent Gentile blooded & Jewish priests had to be of the line of Aaron & Abraham.  A Jewish Levite women is not necessarily a problem as a Jewish Priest as long as she obeys the blood laws but No Gentile would even be allowed in the tent.    Jesus commanded that we treat no one differently than we wish to be treated.  He ordained no one to priesthood according to the Gospels & all the letters of the original 12 apostles.  Not one letter or Gospel declares any type of priesthood exists in the church outside of the Royal Priesthood which contains all believers, male and female, equally.    These are the facts - we are sexist.
There is a song on this new album called "the story of O.J." which has a very interesting line it referencing jews. I wonder what people make of that?
When JFK ran for President, one of the big political concerns was that as President he would receive and follow instructions from the Pope.  There were even cartoons showing JFK bowing below Pope John with the Pope's hand on his head.    The Catholic Church for centuries, starting about 1900 years ago and most particularly through the Crusades and the Inquisition, tortured and killed thousands if not millions of Jews for being 'Killers of Christ'.  How much this religious attitude contributed to the  Holocaust is still a subject of debate.   The KKK in this country hated both Jews and Catholics.  In Oregon in the mid-1920's they nailed American flags across the doors to Catholic churches.     And now we have a Jewish Presidential candidate going to the Vatican to meet with the Pope.  We truly live in Interesting times.
Just remember that Canada refused to take hardly any ( 5000 ) of the jewish refugees in the second world war while the US too orders of magnitude higher.  So, we now have the MSM trying to brain wash people into thinking that the 325 refused temporary entry into the US will be a boon for Canada.  Hell, the US had 325,000 coming into the US every day.  And 40 muslim countries are not on the list.  and germany has banned all refugees from Nigeria.  last time I looked Nigeria was a muslim country..
And many people get angry when their priest preys on them, but the community rallies around their "godly, family man"   Or get angry at the lies perpetrated by church using hell to scare kids into doing the right thing.   Imagine the good that could be done with just the tax money saved from not giving churches tax breaks.   And studies have shown that overall,  religious children are not as nice as atheist children.   Atheists have created better societies than religious ones, with more human rights, more equality, and more societal sharing of costs. Look to Sweden, IcelandFinland, and England for that. They are VERY secular societies.   Religious people make up a higher percentage of people in jail than atheists, even after correcting for population of each.   I grew up 7th Day Adventist. There were some good people but overall they were judgemental and very willing to protect abusive men and parents because... god, or some crap.   False hope and fake friends doesn't improve society.
"Carrier of contagion"? Those phrases were used to describe Jews in the 1930s. A reason why all western countries prevented Jewish refugees from coming in.  And the Jews are semites, like the Arabs. Ironic, right? Jesus was a semite too. So were Mary and Joseph and the 12 apostles. A thought for Christmas 2016.
Thanks for a thought provoking comment.  I am not sure if "secularization has mutated into a militantly anti-Christian and anti-Church ideology" or if Christian ideology has not mutated into a "militantly anti-secular society" ideology.  Both "sides" are battling. .Same is true in Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist societies - the religion is trying to control the secular society.  It worries me that we need the influence of faith based people to know how to live together, to not fall into traps of nationalism, which is tribalism writ larger.   All these faiths do teach us a basic respect for one another, of the God given humanity we all share.  But each faith wants to determine social rules that all must live by.  Maybe they just want villages of their own faith and separation of people by faith groups.    That isn't going to work.  We are in a time of globalism, of movement of people across and around the world, of instant and constant communication capabilities.  Faiths must learn to get along
The Civil Rights Act is clear about firms who serve the public.  No discrimination, especially against a protected class (which the Perry decision makes gays and lesbians).  Private bakers can, of course, select their clientele.  The only thing objectionable to any baker would be the cake topper with a rainbow flag, two brides and two grooms and if asked to do the rainbow flag in icing, I am sure a sincere baker could ask politely to beg off - but they have no right to show moral scorn to the customer.  Ever.  The baker can believe what they want but even St. Paul would say that they must be polite (a Jew to Jews, a Gentile to Gentiles).  Indeed, it is much more fun to celebrate gay people in love.  Thinking is sinful because your tribe disapproves is putting politics before people.
After 10+ years of doing nothing, Europe is facing severe issues of cultural segregation, religious fundamentalism, and broad societal regression- Rotherham child sex assaults, Denmark, Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels, Cologne.  Europe is on the verge of massive civil unrest (lawless rioting is already common in France). Jews are leaving western Europe by the thousands because they are tired of police with assault rifles guarding their children's elementary schools, they are tired of being spat on and harassed, they are tired of the societal decay, crime, and drugs infecting their neighborhoods. Whether the Globe admits it or not doesn't change the reality that no-go zones are real and ignoring issues stemming from cultural segregation only empowers leaders like Trump. Canada is more open than Europe but we aren't immune to the ethnic cultural segregation that breeds extremism and division.  Accommodations such as demands of gender segregation are a threat to Canada's pluralism.
And folks thought we were out of line to draw the Jewish/Hitler parallels....  I don't think so....and we must be clear about this....both Church USCCB hierarchy and Trump folks are associated with groups that the Southern Poverty Law Center lists as Hate groups....neo Nazi, white supremacist, et al.....  None of these folks are nice people.....  Indeed Church support for these alt right folks stems from some pious drivel about protecting the unborn and supporting "marriage"..... In fact these premises have been central in this election....forgetting entirely that abortions are clearly more infrequent when contraceptives are available and marriage between one man and one women is not even remotely threatened by SSM.  I have been married 58 years next week and I know!
You know, a quick DNA test would put such controversies to bed.  As a matter of fact, I would suggest making DNA analysis a prerequisite for scholarships and other social benefits reserved for ethnic groups which have experienced historical discrimination.  If you are ethnically Jewish, a DNA test will confirm it.  The same if you are aboriginal.  Why would you ever take someone at their word on the issue of identity when there's money/status on the line?  It is not the case that identity is mutable and we can all choose our own.  This is where the left assaults the truth just as brutally as the right does.  Despite what the dogmatic would have you believe, there are actually facts in this world, both historical and biological.  People are deluding themselves if they think they can escape the facts by adopting a label.
Really?!  The ADL Director is "so far-left", "typical", & "ignores the threat of domestic attacks against Jews by Muslims"?!  Well, those notions defy logic.    As read by many American Jews, [cf.https://m.facebook.com/TheRAC/], the threat of harm to Jews by Muslims is relatively small-scale, & certainly does not warrant an un-American action of excluding half a billion people.  You'd better rethink reality as it is, not as your preconceptions want it to be.
Indeed. When she visited Ukraine she did not pay homage to the victims in Baby Yar . They were Jewish massacred by Nazis and Ukrainian collaborators.
Paid agitators on both sides! Saul Alinksy, divide and conquer.  Robert Lee, never even owned a slave but Union General Grant did! White supremacists do not equal White Nationalism. Like La Raza & BLM right?   Did you hear them? Saying "you will not replace us!", mass third world immigration on an industrial scale, but only in White nations! Muslim nations won't even take their own in , why? Too dangerous!  Stop the wars for the Greater project for Israel , where Barry dropped more bombs on the ME than GW  Why hasn't the media reported the biological terrorism by Antifa, throwing feces and urine at passers by?  The Trump is a racism doesn't hold water or he is a NAZI either.  Do you not know he is surrounded by Jews, both in his own family and in business.  Long time, famed NYC Lawyer, Cohen,  Not all Jews are of sabbatean variety or support the complete destruction of the white race.    I think Trump is getting closer to the John Pedo Podesta child trafficking ring, and the DNC
Need one read a sentence further after reading MSW's confession that he thinks a writer gains consolation by writing a piece that 'ignites controversy'?  "There are very few things in this life more gratifying to a columnist than to pen a sentence that ignites a controversy."  Wow.  Read no further.  A Catholic writer who lets his intellect "attach value" to such an end is in need of long term spiritual coaching, and should out of charity suspend his writing work for the division & heat and disunity it causes or contributes to.   Rather, I think a well-formed and properly tempered Catholic writer might gain some consolation from seeing people draw closer to Jesus Christ, amending their lives, increasing their self-gift to others, etc by reading one's work.  Yet an even higher disposition than this would be to have a "pure intention", that is, to produce a work for the principal reason of loving God!  MSW is a long way off from such a more Christian approach to the work of writing
Fanatics are created at home   around the dinner table, listening to the elders speak of world events and religion.  Just as young Jews and Christians listen to their parents talk of  charity work and helping the sick and poor people of the world,  Muslims learn to wish death  on Jews and Christians over generous servings of mom's good home cooking.
How much land does Arabs need? It's not about the land but murderous hate towards HaShem's chosen people...The Jews. The Lord has set a blessing(Torah) and a curse(secularism) before us...Choose wisely!
Richard, In 1996, the Palestinian Authority banned the sale of Arab and Muslim property to Jews.  The Palestinian Authority announced it would enforce the law in 1997. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_Palestinian_territories  Regarding:  "What defines apartheid is when a MINORITY group, backed by the power of the state and its laws, systematically disadvantage a group that would otherwise hold a democratic majority"  Palestinians are not the majority in Israel.  Israel is not the government of Palestine, it is a foreign occupier.  And it will remain so until the Palestinian leadership agree to keep the area demilitarized.  Have a look at the security plan suggested by U.S. General John Allen.  Hope you have a nice day, Cheers
Has anyone mentioned that Hillary is not Jewish to our author?
Totally respect your point of view- however as a Jew, talking with concentration camp survivors and meeting the grand children of the Bielski Brothers who fought as guerillas and survived the Holocaust unfortunately reminds us that there's no way of talking reasonably with Nazi's. Fight or flight is one thing, systemic annihilation is another...
I, too, found the inclusion of Hume to be puzzling, given that he was an apostate and most likely an atheist.  Do you know what happens to apostates and atheists in Muslim-predominant cultures?
I've never understood the attack on Jews. I work with Jews, I have Jewish neighbors...dated a Jew many years ago. To me, it's like picking on the Lutherans for no reason at all.   But here we are, white supremacists all emboldened and worked up by Trump, putting their ignorance out into the light for all to see. This is the time when the rest of us, Jewish, Muslim, Christians, gay, black, brown, etc., all come together to fight this disease and push it back into the shadows.
"divisive politics" is  leftist code for stifling free speech. It mean that some delicate topics and opinions  are simply too harsh for delicate ears to hear and for delicate persons to engage in.  Muslims calling for the extermination of Jews however is still considered Constitutional   free speech.
Your response is a false equivalence and the product of sloppy reasoning, as usual. The exact equivalence in response to John Hobson's comment would be: Was ISLAM the U.S.' friend before the election? Which is as absurd a question as: Was Christianity (or Judaism, or Hinduism, etc) the U.S.' friend before the election?
"live" forever in heaven (if you are good), partially true - We live forever because someone else was good (Christ) and his goodness (sinlessness) is attributed tot those who believe. The question of why is there sin (including the 6 million Jews) in the world can only be answered the following way: And that is because God has a greater purpose in mind that the temporal, which could include those children being with him now. Sin is being dealt with and put away, and one day will exist no more. This argument always fascinates me, in that the manner of death seems important, why ? Everybody dies and sometimes a "fast" death is better, I don't see much difference.   Looking at this at purely a rational level, I don't see why anybody would want to believe in ultimate meaninglessness, it doesn't give a person much reason to exist or to even get up in the morning. I will not end with a condescending comment, but will say I appreciate your sincerity and forthrightness. Have a great New Year.
were not Jews banned from that most holy Jewish site when Jordan controlled it?    It's open now to all religions, some may have to accept the fact that security in the form of metal detectors is justified to keep terrorist activities to a minimum.
It would be interesting to discover how many of these folks are nothing more than publicly pious agnostics .... or atheists.
I don’t want my security and safety to rely on the good intentions of a leader who has proven his inability to adhere to international agreements he made with regards to nuclear weapons, who fires artillery shells at his southern neighbour and periodically corks off a missile into the Pacific.  No amount of smooth talking diplomacy with this childish ego maniac is going to convince him to act otherwise.  Unfortunately, the only diplomacy Kim Jong-un is going to recognise comes with overwhelming force. I am reminded of what Benjamin Netanyahu said, “If the Arabs put down their weapons today, there would be no more ‎violence.  If the Jews put ‎down their weapons ‎today, there would be no ‎more Israel.” I appreciate your desire for peace through peaceful means but I believe Kim Jong-un would see an opportunity in our naivete.  I would prefer Standard Missile III as an alternative.
Thank you for writing the truth and shaming the "Joseph Goebbels propaganda Washington Post machine".  Next story please: why is Jew Jeff Bezo's, who owns the Washington Post and Amazon, supporting ISIS and Islamic terrorists?  All who vow to kill Jews and wipe Israel off the map?  Same with many in the mainstream media, especially CNN owned/run by Jew Jeff Zucker.   What is it with these Jews who want harm to come to Israel?
In order to understand the term "islamophobia" we must also understand Islam's own misogyny, homophobia, hatred of Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Europe, America, democracy, dogs, free speech, human rights and now even Canadian open society  and everything else not permitted (haram) by Islam. Open  hatred against white Canadians is now permitted  (halal) and printed regularly in the Globe.
WOW  Jew hater nice
While their is no biblical text per se, I think it's reasonable to argue that atheism has both a system and form of worship.  They form their beliefs on the basis of religion and, thereby, their system is the scientific method.  Ironically, a pure understanding of science and its methods should lead an atheist, however, to agnosticism.

"if a guy came to our Jummah and started spewing hate and being violent, he would literally have 300 brown and black kids jump at him.” --- Where were those 300 when the PDSB faith advisor hosted an imam calling for slaying of the Jews?
Well, I get the impression Jesus was outraged by the poverty of the rural Galileans among whom he practiced his ministry. Apparently they were being crushed by debt, oppressed both by the imperial authorities and their Hasmonean collaborators. We fat denizens of 21st-century  America are very far removed from 1st-century Jewish peasants. We don't go hungry (at least, most of us don't).  I'm struck by the modest appeals of the Lord's Prayer and the imagery of the kingdom. Keep us from hunger, relieve us of our debts, please don't put us to the test. For the hungry heaven is a banquet.
"How is enforcing our borders somehow unjust?" My 4 immigrant grandparents came from 4 different countries. They received their citizenship papers the moment they steeped off the ferry boat that brought them from Ellis Island to Manhattan. Two others whose names you might know also benefited from that policy - especially in light of the recent Independence Day celebrations.  John Philip Souza was Azorean Portuguese, and Irving Berlin was Eastern European Jewish.  What songs are more all American than "Stars and Stripes" and "God Bless America." How many more like them are we excluding?
According to the mythic story, Adam and Eve possessed not only complete adult mental ability but also abilities that humans no longer possess.  But historically, that did not happen.   There were a number of humanoid types.  But only homo sapiens was the branch that was able [and this branch was able to multiply in different places---not just one] to become the humans that we are today.  The early humans were hunters and gatherers.      There was no original sin.  The Jewish people did not believe in original sin.  Jesus NEVER talked about Original Sin.  That term came in with Augustine.    There can be self-knowledge without laying sin and shame upon humanity.  The Gospel of John tells us that God so loved the world....I believe that is why the Word became a Human---a man.  It was LOVE that prompted God to become one with us and of us.  God walks along side of us.
This general election revealed that there are viable seeds and spores of domestic terrorism dispersed within our nation, some firmly rooted. “We cannot solve this problem only through prayers,” the Dalai Lama said as part of a response to a question about how he viewed the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. “I am a Buddhist and I believe in praying. But humans have created this problem, and now we are asking God to solve it,” the Nobel Peace Prize winner said. “It is illogical. God would say, solve it yourself because you created it in the first place.” It would also be unwise to expect politicians to devise solutions too, he added. “So let us work for peace within our families and society, and not expect help from God, Buddha or the governments. The problems that we are facing today are the result of superficial differences over religious faiths and nationalities. We are one people.”
I didn't state that the Apostles were not different.  THEY did not think of themselves as being anything but Jews.  YOU forget that Jesus was born, raised and lived his life as a Jew also.  It was Paul and Barnabas who came to the Church of Jerusalem on behalf of the Gentiles [because people from Jerusalem were telling the converts that they had to be circumcised].  That was when the leaders [including Paul, Barnabas and Peter] met in Jerusalem to discuss this issue.  Show me an instance in the Gospel where Jesus forgave the unrepentant sinner.  On the Cross, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."  Secondly, who is disregarding the Commandments?  And who are you to assume that people are not receptive to grace.  Do you think that the official church gives orders to God?  The Jewish hierarchy tried to do that throughout its history---and Prophets [laymen] came to correct the Jewish leaders.  Our official church is often no better.  Your message is not life-giving.
What a disjointed article.  The headline is "How an atheist celebrates Christmas", and the first paragraph and a half talks about atheism, then the author goes on to espouse he is a "secular Christian" and the remainder and majority of the article is about his respect for Jesus and Christianity as a faith, along with some debatable bafflegab about the history of Christianity.  I am an atheist, that's why this article interested me.  I have respect for Christianity and Christians, and how many Christians have done good for their fellow people regardless of faith in the name of God.  I may not believe almost any of the Bible, and loathe people of any faith who try to impose their religion on others, prefer a secular state, and loathe organized religion but one's faith or spirituality is a personal choice and I respect that choice.  I personally do not celebrate Christmas as a day when the saint Jesus was born.  I look at as a time to enjoy one's loved ones and a consumerist holiday.
There are constant protests in downtown Toronto, and most of them are not mentioned by media here, why Russia?  As for Alexei Navalny, he is a Russian right wing with views of anti Jews and pro nazi. He got sympathized here in media just because he is anti Putin - Let me tell you some truth.
No. Stop feeling so sorry for yourself and take a look at the WORLD around you. It's fellow human beings who can help-you don't need to look at everything in life in terms of how much will it cost poor little you. Do you remember the story of the ship FULL of Jewish children from Europe that the United States refused entry to during World War 2?
Pence is a religious zealot and Trump is a likely atheist.  What a ticket - a little something for everyone.  Christie and Gingrich are both broke - Pence has the big money connections.  Trump stalls the announcement while he dials for dollars so he can pick who he really wants and it ain't Bible thumping Pence!
Understood.  Just as I find it frightening for the 21st century version of Stalin's "Society of Militant Atheists" trudging forward with nuclear weapons tightly gripped in their slimy paws.  Especially when they're looking to aim 'em at me and mine.
The Church now conducts a genuine dialogue with the Jews, thus making acceptable what thousands of years of Christianity said is unacceptable. Dialogue produces conversion.
Presumably, that is what the refugee determination process has to decide. And there are countries that are assumed not to produce refugees. But we accept all comers in the first instance because we don't want to repeat the horrible decision to send a shipload of over nine-hundred Jews back to Europe in 1939 because we refused to take them in. And illegals are in the US for decades at a time because Americans employee them with impunity. There is no attempt to discipline the employers or to regularize their practices. Some of those illegals have probably been much abused.
Pastor Dodd, if you would take a righteous stand against hate and persecution, I beseech you to display unbiased and moral courage, therefore, to speak out from your pulpit on behalf of the Palestinians whose only crime is to not be Jewish, and who for generations have suffered banishment from their homeland under the hateful, racist oppression of the Zionist Jews who run the state of Israel.
Regarding: "They categorized the continued displacement of Christians from the Middle East as "a genocidal project, a humanitarian catastrophe and a plague of the earth's civilization."" - In every way the Muslims in the USA must assist in easing the persecution of non-Muslim religions in these lands. - Men and women of good will, Muslims, Jews, and Christians all must work to free the lands for the exercise of the 4 freedoms, especially for the freedom of worship / religion, and the freedom to congregate.
Bannon will go to war with people in Trump's circle that he sees as Globalists...and Jews. Get ready for a vicious cat fight on the right...grab the popcorn and watch the fur fly!
Protestants, Anglicans, Muslims and Jews also seem to have no problems making it work.
There is a majority of jewish youth that do not support the colonization
There was a net gain of 40 (yes 40, from 429 to 469) religiously motivated hate crimes in 2015 over 2014 according to the infographic. Now we don't know what type of crimes were committed and this stat could be entirely misleading. If I break into a church for example and steal the donation plate, is that recorded as a hate crime? For example, if a firearm is present during the commissioning of a crime, the police will record it as a firearms related offence. Even if the weapon wasn't actually used, it could be sitting in the basement closet for example. Total hate against the religious hasn't seen a significant increase in Canada, just a shift onto another religion. Good to see Muslim groups all of a sudden concerned about hate, now that it's not only the Jewish being attacked.
William Bradford, a Trump appointee to the Energy Department resigned Thursday after being exposed for making racist remarks about black people and Jews.  One more racist out, ...still many more to go.
About 5 seconds of research found the explanation for 907AK's fake news. Alinsky taught you well 907AK:  "The media are targeting Dr. Sebastian Gorka for political assassination. Gorka is a deputy assistant to President Donald Trump and renowned irregular warfare and counterinsurgency expert. A proud anti-establishment figure, members of the media, academics, and his rivals are on the warpath against Gorka.  Leftist outlets have labeled Gorka an unqualified “Islamophobe” and “anti-Semite.” Serious charges to be sure. Though the multitude of hit pieces do not reveal a single statement or word suggesting a hint of anti-Muslim or anti-Jewish bias during his decades-long career, they insist that the White House staffer harbors these malicious thoughts."
I read your link above.  Could you explain how it makes him less a defender of the Jewish?  It appears only to make him more human.
Well Bernier was the conservatives best chance of winning, him or chong, so its how I voted but Scheer is a socially conservative westerner and a jew, so he is going to have a real tough time to win.  He will struggle in Quebec, against the francophone prime minister from Quebec, he will struggle in central Ontario who is really against the socially conservative stuff like abortion.
great point bill - I think it is the end all statement.  as well as what you have outlined...if there had been any way, any way at all, to discredit the fledgling christian splinter faction by the jewish powers that be (they were all jews still), it would have been to disprove this one thing - that the man known as "jesus" did NOT come back to life as a physical being. however....nothing.  surely investigations and attempts to discredit the deed were done.  nothing held up.  and even the slightest hint that this "rebirth" did not happen would have been exploited , BLOWN up....and still used as argument to this day.  this one thing speaks volumes for me.
I’m a former teacher and an atheist but I have no problem if students in a public school, on their own time decided to pray in any respectful way they choose.  While I personally hope they come to the conclusion that there is no supreme being, they need to come to this on their own.  Neither the school system, haters, my fellow atheists nor anyone else has the right to tell a student on their own time what they should do.  Leave these Muslims (and Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists or anyone else) alone.  Some Muslims are terrorists.  So are some Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists or even atheists.  No group is innocent.  And no group is all evil.  Again, leave these kids alone.
It's fascinating that many Canadians of Ukrainian heritage take such offense at the publication of historically well established facts.   I am unsure whether Vichy France or  Polish and Ukrainian collaborators helped send a higher number of Jews to the ovens  .    It really does not matter.  All are complicit.  Today  Jews  are starting again  to flee Europe.   I hope Canada will welcome them .
However, in the areas that Israel has formally annexed, the non Jews do not have the right to vote.  IN the territories, Arabs do not have the right to vote, Jews do.  Please don't leave out the significant parts.  Or maybe you don't know them?
Sorry, she did mention the PKK actually; but only fleetingly when they were the main player after the Peshmerga withdrew. It's quite possible that they don't like the atheist philosophy of the PKK, which is understandable in that part of the world.
Actually, Paul Ryan has said his hero is atheist-materialist Ayn Rand.
1/ <<Does an acorn become a tree?>>  I'm not playing this game. I already told you what I thought.  <<So are you for or against abortion - from the moment of conception - or not?>>  I'm not "for" abortion, though it has nothing to do with the Catholic Church. As a young atheist I discovered I had a visceral opposition to abortion. Call it the law written on our hearts, or what have you. If God is anything God is the life force, so I do think abortion is a sin. However, I have always been pro-choice. As I mentioned previously, I think Roe rightly recognizes the State's interest in protecting human life after a certain point of viability. I'm comfortable that as science deepens understanding this point may shift, and I'm comfortable with the moral ambiguity that often attends a decision to have an abortion.
Perhaps we can focus on what is really going on in the so-called Russian Federation? Here's a recent video clip of a Russian Orthodox priest blaming the Jews for all of Russia's woes: http://nrusw.com/2016/12/30/3190/
The Senator misses the point entirely, something common with most of Mr. Harpers appointees.  These children were taken from their parents - an evil action in and of itself and one that would undoubtedly be condemned by that great Jewish Rabbi Yussef ben Yoseph (aka Jesus Christ) himself.  These were not acts of good Christians, they were acts of racial genocide directed at destroying a whole culture and perpetrated by those who brought also smallpox to this land and then used it to further their territorial greed.  Sorry Senator, time to resign and go home.
<<I have no idea.>>  Indeed.  <<Do you agree with the commenter that Jesus died on the cross to show us how to live a good life?>>  IIRC that's not what Leslie said. I think he said Jesus came to show us how to live a good life, not that he died on the cross to show us how to live a good life.  The earliest Jesus followers believed Jesus was the Messiah. Some might make the argument that a suffering Messiah was anticipated by some Jews, but the consensus view, as far as I'm aware, is that the Messiah was expected to be a glorious conquerer and/or a priestly figure, not a figure crushed by imperial oppressors. As you know crucifixion was the most painful, humiliating form of execution practiced by the Romans and generally reserved for slaves and seditionists. Why did the Messiah suffer this fate? The Jesus followers and Paul looked to the scriptures for meaning. Ah! He was wounded for our transgressions...
pioneer27, glad you think that aspect of orthodox judaism is inappropriate.  I'm not fond of it, either.  Did you criticize Harper and his Conservative backbenchers for praying there?  If not, how do you explain the difference between that day and today?  Do you think I'm here to answer every question you ask?  I'm not.  That said, I have no idea if girls are allowed to lead the muslim school prayers.  If not, they should be able to.  I'm glad we're both feminists together.  I'm not in favour of women wearing burqas, either.  But - and this is the key to it - if a religion's members are willing to have it that way, they have that right.
haven't you guys learned yet that mocking doesn't work ...look at the Tier 1 mocking the left gave Trump ... see what I mean.   Is the holocaust in doubt? lol If you think that 6 million jews dies in the 'holocaust' then yes that number has always been in doubt due to there not even being 6 million jews in all of Europe back then ...I believe the latest number is somewhere south of 1 million slightly fewer than Yugoslavia lost and much much fewer than the 24 million Russia lost.   The real holocaust happened a couple of decades prior to WWII and in that holocaust 40-60 million Christians and Orthodox Russians were killed by the Jewish Bolsheviks
If atheism ever becomes a hugely popular movement, then it won't be long before we get various interpretations and demoninations of atheism.  And, in keeping with tradition, not long before they start whacking each other.
What evidence do you have that a kid with an Italian last name, who went to a Catholic school, was Jewish?
Well, good for us.  I know it rankles some that this was being done "in secret" but it seems that was the only way to help.  Some who helped Jews escape persecution in WWII worked in secret as well - and are now considered heroes.  Does seem a bit short term though - what's the remedy for those still left in Chechnya or being born gay today?
Art: I'm surprised that you haven't found a way to connect climate change to the fact that there are jews in Palestine.  Keep working on it.  If there is anyone who can find a connection, it's you.
There are millions of young men in the West without a father figure and who are exposed to different religions and superstitions of Catholics, Anglicans, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Judaism etc...and don't become suicide bombers. However there is only one superstition that all these suicide bombers in Europe, Asia, Middle East, Israel over the last 20 years believe in. Therefore, there is something very wrong with the belief system of the particular superstition that all these suicide bombers participate in. It's not the young men. It's the belief system.
Ah yes, the imaginary right wing war on Christianity. ASD has been doing this for years, although before this year it was always for the Jewish holiday, but now that there’s a Muslim holiday there, all of a sudden people are triggered. I’ll admit it is strange Anchorage is the only district in Alaska doing this but it’s whatever. It’s Alaska High School football. If they wanted to play all their games on Thursdays I’m sure the parents and few students who attend would be ok with it and the public would be none the wiser.
European Jews are European. Middle Eastern Jews are Middle Eastern. Judaism is a religion, not a race. Why is that so hard for people to grasp? No one questions whether "Christian" is an ethnicity or a religion. Take 100 American Jews, chosen randomly. Run DNA analysis and create a chart showing the bulk results. Take 100 American Christians, chosen randomly.  Run DNA analysis and create a chart showing the bulk results. I bet geneticists can't tell the two groups apart.
Well, it's not just institutional theology that specifies conditions for love and/or mercy. To the extent that we believe the historical Jesus is accurately portrayed in the gospels, or reflected in the Letters, we find that conditions exist for mercy and salvation. I think we have to deal with the fact that Jesus, as a good Jewish man, believed that there are conditions for divine mercy and called people to "reform" as a result.
Well, that's exactly my point.  If religion (theism) is defined (this is taken from Google) as "the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods" and since atheism is the opposite of the belief in a superhuman controlling power, therefore atheism is not a religion.  We agree on this point; I imagine we actually agree on much more than we disagree.
Richard Engel was a leading correspondent in the American war in Iraq. When he met with President Bush at the White House for an interview Bush asked him straight on if he was Jewish. Why? Because it's relevant in the politics of the Middle East.
The Church HAS denied "its own longstanding teaching and tradition" with regard to Jews. We no longer believe they are bound for Hell (as the Council of Florence taught), or that they are "perfidious" (Good Friday liturgy) or that they are "condemned to perpetual servitude" for the crime of "deicide" (Cum Nimis Absurdum 1555, ratified by later popes as well). DIALOGUE brought huge change here and is now doing so in regard to gays as well.
But American immigration policy of the late '30s did implicate this country into the death of Ann Frank, her family and millions of other Jewish people attempting to escape Europe and the Nazis. The fact that we turned around ships loaded with desperate refugees has been as carefully buried as the story of Franks father desperately filing papers seeking refugee status. We rewrite the history of the genocidal killing of native Americans and cover up the uncomfortable truths in our history. Mr. Pitts analogy of a shot to bits sign commemorating Emmett Tills  murder as an attempt to murder history and memory itself is shockingly accurate. As right wing fear mongers now advise us to fear and hate the new waves of immigrants seeking safety and opportunity here in America we need more than ever to keep in mind what we perpetrated against other desperate people. Remember that in the '40s Catholics were as mistrusted as Jews and Blacks in America. We've hated all of us at one time or another.
Russia's advocates seek to make us care. Just read the comments here.  Canada turned away Jewish refugees during the second World War. Is Canada of today anti-Semitic?
Scripture is a wax nose in practice and in most scripture-based traditions. Buddhism and Judaism are quite free with scripture in practice.
Don't make fun of Ruben's name dear he's very sensitive and will get all upset. Something about not liking Jewish people.
Mr. Stacy, The baker refused ANY custom design for a cake. The discussion never got as far as that. The moment the baker heard the couple was gay, he offered them an off-the-shelf sheet cake or cupcakes. That is discrimination under Colorado law. I'm wondering if you would feel differently if he had refused to even consider designing a custom cake for a black couple or a Jewish couple, but offered them a sheet cake instead? And, "artistic freedom"? Would a topiary company be exercising artistic freedom if they refused to trim shrubs for a lesbian woman or couple? Would a home-products warehouse be exercising artistic freedom if they refused to give a gay couple their custom design shelving service? And, is this "artistic freedom" available to people who have objections to serving Muslim couples? Inter-racial couples? Or is this a gay exception only?
oh Tim, you know as well as the rest of us do that you cannot condemn all for the sins of a few. Are all jews guilty for the few that condemned the christ ? are all Germans guilty for the genocide committed by the Nazis or all Americans guilty for the terrorist actions of the U.S. government on dropping atomic bombs on innocent civilians.  Neither can you say that everyone in the entertainment industry is guilty of the exploitation that a few perpetrate. If you have been paying attention you'd know that my position on the exploitation of Polynesian was contained to one specific film produced by one specific studio. Also my stand against the illegal and unlawful occupation and oppression of Hawai'i and Hawaiians is limited to the U.S. government specifically and does not include every U.S. citizen or white person.  If you're going to try to make accusations please try to make the accurate, lol :P
No. Israel will remain a Jewish state. Palestinians will continue to enjoy living among Jews in Israel as they do now, with Arab members in Israel's government, Arabdoctors in Israel's hospitals, Arab professors in Israel's universities, Arab judges in the judiciary, and full participation in Israel's institutions and everyday aspects of Israeli life including Pride.
Roe v. Wade is not going away.  Not even if he winds up appointing a couple of Supreme Court Justices, a not unlikely possibility.     Putin is going to try to take over the Ukraine and keep the US from putting missiles in Poland and other nations next to Russia.   NATO states are the ones who are going to have to accept primary responsibility for the reaction to that position.  The US does not have to be the lead on it either.  70% of the US claims to be Christian; only 15% claim to be agnostic or atheist.  The odds are many of his advisors will not be agnostics or athiests.  Neither are Obama's.  How many of the death's in Libya can we blame on Obama?  He and Hillary went for 'regime change' and caused the deaths of Qadaffi and his sons.  How many Syrian deaths can we blame on Obama?  He said ISIL was JV and could be ignored.  He is the one who drew a 'red line' for Assad and then caved.  Obama is also the one who said we would be out of Afghanistan last year.  What happened?
Points to your argument I didn't previously address:  (1) Usurping other peoples' territories can't be equated with 'survival' except among Israeli Zionists or their American propagandists.  "Annexing" others' lands is frequently rationalized as "legal".  But only by the usurpers.  Never by the dispossessed.  Ask any Native Alaskan.  (2) Assigning 'blame' in a theological context is WAY above my pay-grade.  I suspect your 'comfort' is illusory and temporary.  But I find it noteworthy that "ultra-orthodox" Rabbis have denounced Zionism as egregiously compounded SIN since at least 1947.  Point for them.  (3) Folks are quick to abandon faith not "malleable" enough to appease their selfish, worldly desires.  This in no way invalidates Faith--rather, their own selfish short-sightedness.  What passes for "Judaism" among Zionists from what I've observed seems no more than a poisonous mix of self-worship, atheism, hypocrisy, license and supremacist ideology.
Jewishophobia should be M104 and perhaps Christianophobia could be M105.
There aren't Nazi's silly. Certainly not ones making bomb threats to Jews. The fact you think that demonstrates your susceptibility to propaganda.
Jim Johnson states that the threats against Jewish institutions that I referred to “appear to have been done by: American Neo-Nazis.”However, I do not think the source of any of these threats has been identified, and Jim should be careful not to be fooled by appearances.  Jim also states that I“…conclude[d] that the victim is the perpetrator.” However, (1) I made no conclusions in my letter and (2) the recipients of the threats (Jewish institutions) were nowhere identified as being Zionist organizations. I take this occasion to suggest to Jim that one cannot not equate Jews with Zionists any more than one can equate Americans with Militarists.
Can you wake up soon, please? It's the Chump who's cheerleading the hate by supporting the white supremacists. So noble of you for declaring your hate for hate groups, EXCEPT for your tacit approval of the top HATE Chump.  By the way, do not confuse not liking the Chump and hate. Hate is what he and a large number of his supporters espouse - like killing Jews, Blacks, etc. That's not what the Chump opponents are espousing.
I get that Mr. Caplan is eager to portray the Evil Israel vs Poor Palestine narrative common in leftie circles but he might make more headway by not omitting the bits that don't fit his viewpoint.   Caplan:   "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has flatly said he will never accept an independent Palestinian state"  The Times of Israel  Feb 2016:  Netanyahu told a special Knesset debate on the two-state solution that he was in favor of the idea, but in practice did not see it being possible unless the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state and agree to a demilitarized state.  Not quite the same.
Your viewpoint kind of supports my theory that atheism is just another region, like dadaism is to art, which is why I prefer to think of myself as a non-believer.  It means that one choose actions knowing that there will be reactions and that these have relationships that are fairly well understood, scientifically and does not include concepts like right and wrong or good and bad or the need for complex philosophical words that no-one but philosophers use.
Your suggestion that atheism is a religion makes about as much sense as saying starvation is a diet.
Zut alors!  Quelle surprise!   A Liberal PM invited Liberal donors to a dinner with the Chinese PM.  Who in hell would you think he'd invite?.....the Conservative caucus.?  So a bunch of people who had already emptied their wallets got to do it again.  Really, who cares?   Does anyone recall the last PM flying a  conservative Jewish retinue to Israel as part of his publicly-funded farewell tour?  Did any of that crowd cut a cheque to the Conservative party somewhere along the way?  .......you think just maybe.........???  It's how parties collect money.....all of  them.    If some business executive, who happens to have tossed cash to the Liberal party, is invited to a dinner where he meets the Chinese PM and ends up doing business in or with China, how is the Canadian public being screwed over or how does the Liberal party (in this case) benefit?   Good grief, it's how things have always been done.   Time to move on.
Absolutely.  I am getting very tired of articles that make sweeping generalizations about groups - Jews, Muslims, Albertans and so on and so on.  As Oscar Wilde once said - people are either boring or charming.  We need more nice people, more civil people, more manners and a higher level of discussion.  Now.  Can we talk about how we get there?
You're calling Jesus a progressive? Hahaha. Jesus never forced anyone to do anything but progressives live to force others to do what they say. Progressives see government as a means of hurting people...while "helping" some too, of course. Hitler and Stalin were progressives...brutal big government authoritarian anti-Christian and Anti-Jew mass murderers who provided health care for all and controlled everything and everyone from a central location. Progressivism comes in three flavors: socialism, communism and fascism. What's your favorite?
When have the leaders of PLO and now, Hamas, ever refused to speak with the Israelis?  It is Israeli leaders who have refused to negotiate with the false claim that Palestinian leaders refuse to recognize the right of Israel to exist.  Under Netanyahu that has been ramped up to a demand that Palestinians recognize Israel as "The Jewish State" (thereby denying anyone not Jewish any rights of citizenship).
Dianne Feinstein has been a cancer on this country for many years.    For all who may forgot, Ms. Feinstein has been in Congress during the time the national debt has exploded to total 20 TRILLION dollars.  Of course, this is not 'her fault' and the debt accumulated on its own.  And of course Ms. Feinstein had nothing to do with the fact that Congress voted its self an extravagant pension plan paid for with taxpayer dollars WITHOUT the approval of the taxpayers of this country.  The fact is Ms. Feinstein and her colleagues in the senate and house having been screwing the citizens of this country for many years.  Ms. Feinstein is nothing more than a 'Jew Bxstxard'.  Her and her colleagues should be charged with treason for screwing the nation and held accountable for their actions.  The above comment is made from one Jew to another and in this respect is quite appropriate.
Is a promise to make the poor suffer worth keeping? I thought Jesus cared about the poor. It is ironic that most Trump voters think they are Christians. Unfortunately, the irony is lost on Trump voters. Trump voters remind me of the "good Germans" that never asked where the Jews disappeared to.
That's pretty much the same argument neoscholastics posit to deny the possibility of women's ordination.  The argument goes that Jesus was biologically male, and a priest acts in persona Christi when confecting sacraments, so only a male can be a priest.  I'm more inclined to St Paul's reasoning: "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." (NIV translation.)  Your arguments are based on a reductionist view of biological appendages. St Paul's are based on something much higher ... we humans, after all, are something much more than mere biological machines. We are in the Imago Dei ... whether biologically male or female or intersex, whether straight or gay or any shade in between.  And the higher good is the flourishing both of individual humans and of the collective. Love is the higher good. Loving gay couples do not need to be limited by a proscriptive neoscholastic frame of reference.
In order to define Islamophobia, we must also define "Taqiyya".  Taqiyya is the Islamic practice of deception for the protection and defence of Islam.  Taqiyya translates as " concealment  omission, dissimulation" .  The Ten Commandments tell Christians and Jew they must not "bear false witness" or to lie.  Taqiyya is the Fifth Column of Islam and  tells Muslims they may  tell infidels like us half truths (omission) and  even blame it all on the infidels themselves (concealment) as this writer is doing right now, to defend Islam.   Many westerners have a hard time to accept that such a thing is real.   That's why so much about M103 ( and other Liberal policies) makes Canadians of good-will stop and say "Hey wait a minute ". They can see for themselves the wool is being pulled over their eyes.   She exonerates Islam and M103, and blames non Muslim Canadians  of Islamophobia to defend Islam.
The Green Line is not a border. It is an armistice line, at Arab insistence. Palestinians hoped to move the line west but it was moved east by Israel defending against further Arab aggression in 1967. The Jews won; the Arabs lost. That is the starting point for negotiations.
It started with the Christians, then the Natives, then the French, then in 1960's the Jews came, now we have the feminists, gays, lesbians and even Muslims.  It is a caste system, the rest of us have to obey them and even pay for them. All have special privileges, financial benefits and even laws that prevent anyone from criticism them.
Fort hood was labeled a mass shooting. San Bernardino also a mass shooting. Orlando nightclub....mass shooting. Chatanooga...mass shooting.   U.N.C. ...vehichle assualt. Seattle jewish center....mass shooting. Little Rock recruiting center....drive by shooting. Vaughan food beheading....beheading.  There are many more and they are all classified in similar ways with two exceptions, the Boston Marathon bombing was considered  "lone wolf terrorism" and the beltway snipers, "domestic terrorism".
When you can show me how something you drop falls up rather than down, I will be happy to have a conversation about the reality of natural law.  Until then ....  That most other Americans - Christian, Jewish, and Muslim - believe homosexual behavior is immoral behavior is a demonstrable fact. The majority of Americans say to you and those who share opinion on "it makes it difficult to raise children who are morally straight" and "it weakens the family as the cornerstone of society", "So what?"  At the end of the day every law, including the Constitution, is a matter for a majority decision.  Sufficient arrogance can lead to a practical demonstration of that reality, as the last election did.
There is one irrefutable fact. The whole top of Mauna Kea was, and is, an ancestral graveyard that was only for the ali'i, kahuna and koa, with a few makaaina'na that became worthy.  Otherwise, makaaina'na would have been executed for even being near the base, much less the top. Makaaina'na were only allowed on the shores and needed permission to be in the interior, mainly working for the villages. Only cataloging ahu's that have been found is imposing western prejudice towards other religions as inferior to the jew god religions, that burials have to be in plots. For the pre-contact Hawaiians, the position of an ahu had significance. It's hard to see how an observatory is a conservation use plus it's blatant desecration of an ancestral graveyard. How about finding out your mother's graveyard was being sold to a resort, and they just dug up the remains and used them for fill in another lot? Eh, there's money being made, so what? TMT will take too long to build to be any economic boon.
I never asked you to prove God doesn't exist - just sharing that the basis for your atheism is not FACT but faith, just like mine is. Scientists have proven nothing about the origin of life, they did not observe it, did not repeat it, and did not test it. If they want to have (even well thought out) ideas about it fine, but don't tell me it is proof.
Actually, what is happening is that church membership is light over all in Portland.  Agreed that the liberal churches are shrinking, but overall church attendance is not growing.  For every Portlander that sits in a pew, dozens more sleep in or go for a run on Sundays.  Atheist & Humanist groups are big in Portland.  Agnostics are a huge trend.  So, gloat as much as want that Imago Dei has more new members than the First Unitarian church. I will sit back and watch the lack of church traffic on Sundays.   So no, church ladies are still rare in Portland and Pastor McKinley is far from being a rock star.  People worship the Timbers here.
And Obama Bribed his Attorney General, Gervel.   Have you ever herd of President Nixon's "Saturday Night Massacre" as relating to the wiretap incident at Watergate? Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 was a direct result of the Saturday Night Massacre.   During the Fast and Furious investigation, he became the only cabinet member in U.S. history to be held in contempt of Congress.   Do you find anything wrong with the idea that Nixon hung for a Boy Scout violation, tape recorder incident, as adjust to Obama's Felony Rap Sheet, with the murders on both sides of the border, including a U.S. Federal Agent?  Even Nixon's AG's could read English. That's why they kept resigning?  And his "Jew Boy" Kissinger v. Brezhnev? As adjusted to "Hope and Change" Hillary v. Putin?  You democrats need your brains examined.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Massacre#/media/File:NYTimes_Saturday_Night_Massacre_Front_Page.gif
So in a nutshell Jesus was a Jewish man and had followers.  Clearly you don't think he was divine, was resurrected, or performed any miracles. He was simply a good man.  You don't believe Jesus was the Christ and therefore you are not a Christian.    This begs the question why you regularly post your opinions as a non-believer(thinker) about matters of Christian faith to others on this site.  Is your intention to convince all other that  the Christian religion is a sham?    Are you trying to lead questioning and disgruntled Catholics astray from the true faith and if so why are you doing this?  This site is full of lost and searching Catholics who are close to complete apostasy.  What is your end game?  A world without religion or superstition?  I will never understand why  a Catholic would accept advice about the Catholic Religion from a  non-believer(thinker) of that religion.  I hope you do not have nefarious reasons for doing so.
A Jewish friend told me she wasn't allowed to board her horse at the Lake Oswego Hunt Club in the 70's.
RolandX:  I argue that one cannot believe in the non-existence of something.  One can only believe in the existence of something. In order to agree that this "something" exists, there must be incontrovertible evidence that the "something" exists and that the evidence can be explained in no other manner.  Believers in God postulate that all of existence is the work of God.  Two thousand years ago, so little was known of the workings of the natural world that the supernatural explanation was accepted.  As we learn more about the natural world, through the scientific method, it becomes clear that one does not need to resort to the supernatural to explain the world around us.  The natural world functions according to natural laws and processes that can be determined through experimentation.  The notion of God becomes superfluous.  Atheism is not a belief in the non-existence of God.  It is idea that we can understand the world around us with resorting to centuries-old superstition.
One of the disappointing trends seen in the 20th century was the decline of education in the western world, particularly in those places that, accurately or not, claimed precedence in education, like England.  An offshoot of this is the inability of many from England to truly comprehend what they read, which leads to unfortunate misunderstandings, as exhibited here.  Of course, one might suggest that, rather than spending time posting comments on a foreign magazine, catholics in England would better serve their church by engaging their fellow citizens, many of whom are now nones.
Nope - read the documents more carefully.  The divine truth is revealed in many ways and many paths.  Yes, that means beyond the confines of the Roman Catholic Church.  For example, do you think 500-million Buddhists or 1.8 billion Muslins are wrong?  Of course not!  The deep abiding presence of the incardinate God is on oneness and nonduality​.
Far, far too many self-described atheists arrive at their position in a negative way. They look at religious beliefs, and reject them. Believing that the question has been resolved, that rejection is as far as they take the matter. As such they miss out on the substance and beauty that atheism has to offer.  Atheism is a positive world-view, not a negation of something else. Atheism begins with the premise that a supernatural deity does not pull the universe's strings. From that clear and simple notion, atheism encourages its followers to create their own relationship with the world around them. There is no intermediary as far as the atheist is concerned. It's all on us. There will be neither punishment nor reward in an afterlife for how we behave here. In that sense, atheists have perfect freedom of choice. But with that comes responsibility as well. Atheists don't have dogma to tell us what's right. We must think for ourselves about how to live a moral and ethical life.
I am not a complete bigot against Christians and Christianity. I know plenty that I consider fine people. However, there many I hold in contempt due to their self righteous belief in a book of fairy tales written by primitive tribes(Prove that wrong, I dare you) allows them to treat anyone as less than an equal. A business owner does not have to approve of any of his customers, whether, black, Jewish, homo sexual, Raiders fans, punk rockers, Republicans/Democrats, etc. they merely have to treat all of them equally, and it doesn't matter what their religious beliefs are. You consistently refer to religious beliefs being inalienable rights, which are fine, until they infringe on rights of others. Before the 1st amendment, on July 4, 1776, our founders stated "all men are created equal", and our country strives to hold that right above all, including religious beliefs, and has enacted amendments and constitutionally tested legislation to ensure that.
Canada's Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Ahmed Hussen has said he will not open the door to emergency immigration by Christians facing persecution in Muslim countries.  Apparently Canada has a rigid  secular  immigration policy. No matter how bad it gets for Christianias and Jews in Muslim countries he will not let them come to Canada.  To him, that is fair. However, Muslims crossing the borders  will never be turned away. Christians can be burned alive by ISIS for all he cares.
I was placing the fault squarely on he shoulders of the VII fathers and not Paul VI himself - who I believe came to realize too late what VII had bequeathed him.  Be that as it may, if our churchmen in their present schizophrenia and fecklessness choose not to have a formal mission to the Jews, then it is incumbent upon us to have our own - if we love them as we say.
If you read current news coming from India the situation is getting worst thanks to ascendance of Hindu nationalism, western Indian states like Gujrat and Maharastra ruled by Hindu nationalists are now leading the gender inequality ratio in the nation, basically killing millions of girl child’s. Men are not finding brides so they try to smuggled women from poorer states or poor countries like Nepal. No wonder India nowadays a lot more in news for gang rapes of women in major cities.
Refugees have often had to break laws to save themselves--- Jews who escaped the Nazi extermination camps, Germans fleeing East Germany through the Berlin subway system, Vietnam boat people launching themselves in small boats to reach UN refugee camps---it is of the essence of being a refugee that you have no choice.
Simply put, you're wrong. A country's law may be based on any legal code, be it British Common Law or anything else. It's not the historic basis of the law that defines whether its just or not, but the laws themselves as they exist today.   What defines apartheid is when a MINORITY group, backed by the power of the state and its laws, systematically disadvantage a group that would otherwise hold a democratic majority. That's what South Africa was. A white minority held power over a black majority.  There is no law in Palestine that discriminates against Jews, or anyone else for that matter. The Basic Law of Palestine guarantees equal political, social, legal and economic rights to all citizens, period. But even if there was such a law, it still wouldn't be apartheid. Palestinians are the majority in Palestine, not a minority. Israel is an apartheid state because it oppresses the Palestinian majority in Palestine, to the advantage of the Jewish-Israeli minority that lives there.
There is none, but Christianity retains the ancient Pagan idea that a human sacrifice is/was essential to appease a god. And preaches this idea of human sacrifice in Africa where some may be predisposed to act on it. It would have been better if those who invented Christianity had instead taken the Jewish position that all human sacrifice is abhorrent to God. It is quite horrific to think that a Virgin goddess gives birth for the express purpose of having her issue tortured to death with enough blood-letting to fertilize the crops, etc. That is the old Pagan story. It should have been discarded. Jesus' message of love and forgiveness and repentance should not have been tainted with such. Sure makes God look like a blood-thirsty demon. Of course I don't know how much negative influence Christian ideas of human sacrifice have had on the current situation in Africa. For sure, those who kill the children don't realize that Jesus was supposedly the 'one and only' human sacrifice.
Mr. Kulbis has relinquished his freedom of choice to God.   God told me that if He sees fit to strike me with a terminal illness, I am free to take my own life before the suffering becomes intolerable. I would prefer a pill as opposed to a shotgun.  <--- Is an atheist tbc.
This is deplorable! We should be outraged that people in our community would perpetuate hate!  The Jewish community in Anchorage is one that is welcoming and inclusive of all people.  This community helped raise my non-Jewish children and granted them love and inclusion into their culture. This is the most amazing pre-school, and to think that someone would threaten these children, and these amazingly caring people, is something we should all stand against.
“a hard-line pro-Israel advocate”  A supporter of the Israeli far-right and its racist, criminal policies.  Since such people help to perpetuate the illegal occupation and colonization of Palestinian land and the resulting conflict that poses the only real threat to Israelis as well as Palestinians, they are arguably ANTI-Israel, and this is an important distinction to make.   “the Jewish state”  The Zionist military state of Israel. Referring to it the way its far-right extremists demand only highlights the inexcusable bias of our mass media, which has also helped to perpetuate this injustice for decades.  This is the most blatant, longest-running injustice of our time, and anyone who supports human rights has a duty to speak out & stand against it.  All it would really take to end this is for the US to end its defense of Israel's crimes. The Palestinians have already made round after round of concessions, receiving nothing in return but continued Israeli intransigence and brutality.
Sheep? Your first sentence? You write like the Jewish Sheep, that didn't like free speech, or free religion.  "All four Biblical accounts agree, however, that Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin ultimately condemned Jesus for blasphemy." http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/jesus/jesusaccount.html
"How does a Muslim woman quietly riding a public bus create any harm, or risk of harm, to the broader public good?"  The wearing of a veil is not "quiet", but an expressive and public anti-social message of "dont interact with me", especially if you are male. One could argue that polygamy and genital cutting are also no risk to the "public good."  All these practices, however, share the same extreme misogyny and sexism endemic in Muslim groups and are antithetical to the concept of religious freedom.  A free woman or person would NEVER choose to wear a burka. Like polygamy, and genital cutting, wearing a burka is a manifestation of religious-sanctioned male dominance and control.
I’m not sure this letter needed to be read beyond the headline, but I was curious what the alleged RG bias might be. After reading, I’m still not sure. And I’m curious about the “thoughtful readers who would like to submit an occasional comment” … how does John know what/who has been excluded?  I consider myself a thoughtful reader, but I don’t need to see Jewish-Palestine events covered in the letters section. The issue of guns at home might be more relevant, but I’m at a loss wondering what kind of letter would give that issue whatever attention it needs.  All that said, I hope John is thankful that the RG published his letter, and that the couple of inches of space it occupies was not wasted (at least in his eyes).
This quote is the quintessence of irony:  "His mother, Ann Kopel, describes herself as an atheist. She says she was shocked by her son's conversion. 'Oh my God,' she said to herself at the time, 'where did this come from?'  "
LOL,  feel free to label yourself, if you are not such a special, unique and unusual person that there are no categories that can begin to describe, much less contain, you.   You are, at any rate, mistaken about the Jewish influence   (there have been Jewish Gnostics, but that was most probably the result of Hellenistic influence on Jews after Alexander of Macedonia dropped by).
I suppose this makes it okay for the Muslims, Jews and all others to leave their icons on top of the mountain.  They all served our country, too.
"The Ontario government is likening a proposed Christian law school's requirement... to a bar against Jews that existed in the province's legal profession nearly 200 years ago."  Is this respectful, even to the truth? Hardly, when anyone can attend Trinity University, including homosexuals or anyone else, no matter their persuasion, and become a lawyer there.  This is no ban on anyone becoming a lawyer at Trinity. Here, on this discussion site, we are asked to be RESPECTFUL to everyone, yet perhaps the Government would like to set an example by respecting the facts that NO one is prevented from becoming a lawyer at Trinity. Trinity respectfully asks that the general values of a private institution be respected and that is all and as such the attendee is given the option of respecting the request or not...it is no bar to anyone. If only the Ontario Government would have the same decency and not BAR a college from teaching the law to others. The government's action is draconian overkill.
You might want to consider the notion of "non-duality"  that is being discussed amongst contemplative Catholics/Christians. Non-duality is derived from Advaita philosophy (Hinduism).  I know, I know, it's not "Christian" or "Catholic" but Jesus talked about "truth" not just coming from Judeans, but from Samaritians and Gentiles as well.  What nondaulity empahsizes is the notion of "not two.... but not one."  It is a paradox which could generate understandings of a triune God, christology, but more importantly, ourselves, even physics in our universe.  It offers a creative tension between diversity (difference) and unity.  I'm more interested in news ways of understanding, not so much old arguments going back to Chalcedon (they don't go anywhere except divide people).
What are you talking about?    A Jewish person pointing out Jewish contribution to our country.   The purpose is to break the stereotypes of Jewish people by white supremecis (and their race/religious baiting of all outside of their own clan).     Noble cause if you ask me.    (Did you say you voted for  Trump?)
Yes, but a document completed when there were 2.5 million people in the country (of which only white men who were not Catholics or Jews and owned land were eligible to vote), now affects 300 million of us, and a popular vote that was lost twice in two decades seems to show the dysfunction of our system, especially considering the current president lost by 3 million votes, more than the entire population a few hundred years ago. At least states could change the religion and property mandates and most did so by 1830. It's time that states made another adjustment...
Factual history seems to bother you quite a bit. Fascism is and has been a left wing ideology. Fact according to American progressives throughout the 30's and early 40's. I agree that there have been some right wingers that opposed left wing political movements, even sometimes violently,  if you will admit that left wingers have opposed right wing political movements, also sometimes violently. While we are at it, excellent dissertation about blacks, native americans, jews, etc. You are a very intelligent writer and I may not agree with you most of the time, you do write eloquently and I always enjoy reading your comments, kind sir.
Well, no. Caplan is a Socialist.  There is no occupation.  I am not Jewish.
that sounds a lot like Churchill and others putting a lot of Jewish people into Muslim Palestine, doesn't it? ----------------------- Muslim Palestine? Islam was founded in 7th century so how old is "Muslim" Palestine? and when was there ever an independent Palestine, never  Jews have been in Palestine for over 4,000 years and even in the 20th Century before the  UNITED NATIONS (not Churchill) founded Israel  If Chris knows his history he might not be so sympathetic to those who start wars of annihilation and then pose as victims
Crucifixion was only reserved for treason in the case of citizens.  It was used on non-citizens for other crimes.  And Jesus being crucified to avoid a riot appears in all four Gospels.  Pilate normally wouldn't have cared what the Jewish leaders thought, but he was fighting for his political and possibly literal life. http://www.bethlehemstar.com/the-day-of-the-cross/pilate-and-sejanus/
and did any of these Sunni put up a fight for the genocide against the Christians and the Yezidis? Why are there no Jewish groups there? Has any one read about the genocide against the Armenians Christians by the Muslim Turks in the first world war, where Christian women were striped and had gas poured on them, forced to dance naked and lit in the streets, or 6-7 year old Christian girls raped on Christian Church alters by Muslim men. ( look it up) Why have pity on these people? Their religion is not a religion of peace.  Remember that Syria, Egypt, Iraq and Turkey were once peaceful Christian countries before they were overrun by Muslims
Once upon a time, they were called "communists."  Guilty or not, "they" were black-listed in America, like the Jews, blacks, japanese, germans, and etc.  Have they now become something else?  I get confused by the different names tagged for each group that does not fit into the "status quo."  Now if only I can figure out who the "Status quo" is?
You confuse evidence with typing in all caps. In fact, your evidence amounts to just saying something and hoping that it is true. You provided no evidence, you just appear not to understand what the word analogy means.  An analogy means a similarity in some respects between things that are otherwise dissimilar, or a comparison based on such similarity.  If there is a a strong enough similarity between say Zille offending black voters, and Americans offending Jewish voters, for both saying we should bank on the technological benefits of our horrible past without defending it, the analogy is sound.   This despite the fact that antisemitism is the most common hate crime in America, that there is no realistic fear of reparations for colonialism from an international law perspective, and that being offended does not rely on the amount of people offended.
If the Jews are permitted to have Israel after having been largely absent from the territory for 2,000 years, then the Kurds certainly have the right to a state in their native lands, where they have lived for thousands and thousands of years and long before Turks or Arabs arrived in the region.
The hypo illustrated that if a priest presides over a Mass, there is a Real Presence and a transubstantiation, even if no one at Mass other than the priest believes in the transubstantiation.     Your facts are off. I did not "try to merge" my example of the 'ten atheists') with another and fitting reason for celebrating Mass. YOU were the one who, trying to evade the point shown by the hypothetical, questioned whether it was licit for a priest to say a Mass with only ten atheists present. You failed to see that that's a whole different question. Now, missing the point again, you try to say that I chose a poor example. Now, try to remember: ATF asserted that "For the unbeliever, it is a piece of bread." I responded that the unbeliever is wrong. An apt way of illustrating ATF's error is to show that if a priest conducts a Mass in the presence of ten atheists, there's still a REAL presence---get it?  REAL?---and a transubstantiation.  Your disagreement is illogical on its face.
Another one-sided, simple-minded article from pro-palestinian G&M. This article claims that : "Most countries consider settlements illegal and an obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian peace"...."Most countries" as UNESCO vote demonstrated, also deny historical facts, like the fact that the second temple in Jerusalem was built by Jews and destroyed by Romans, and instead choose to believe alternative history. One that claims that the entire thing was build by Arabs,who did not even appear on that land until about 600 years later.   As for illegality, that's another red-herring that "most countries" derive from barrage of biased resolutions from UN ( which is mostly now run by 57 countries in Organization for Islamic Cooperation) . In real world Palestinian claim of " illegality" would not stand up in any court outside of UN. Even the generally pro-Arab French court in 2013, dismissed that Palestinian claim,  and ruled that Israel has the right to build anything they like on public land in WB.
The resolution at UN have very little to do with true legality, it has to do with political alliances and exchanges of favors.     Two separate French Courts determined what Israel is doing in WB is completely legal in 2013. Even though Palestinians probably chose that court because they thought it would be an easiest place for them to win.    UN appointed ICJ, where judges were hand picked by Arab ran UN, for their political conviction rather than for their knowledge of international law ruled against Israel ten years earlier.  You draw your own conclusion.  If you believe in UN resolutions then you should at the very least follow the UN charter which in Article 80 guarantees the land West of river Jordan to the Jews.  As a direct result of Article 80, the UN cannot transfer these rights over any part of Palestine, vested as they are in the Jewish People, to any non-Jewish entity, such as the “Palestinian Authority.”
I think you are missing the point.  I will support the right of anyone to speak freely. I think that is a pillar of our country. The same group you are saying says things like "You will not replace us", only because they know that "Death to the Jews" is not acceptable and would likely put them on the wrong side of the law. The intent is still there. They want genocide. What compromise is there with someone that wishes death on a group of people, let them kill half of them? So no just as I would not support ISIS having an open rally calling for the death of citizens, I will not agree that is it the right of a group to call for the death of citizens just because they cleaned up their language for the rally.  "even if the words themselves are about the superiority of the white race versus calling for violence against all non-whites." If they were just saying whites good, that would be ok, but they are not. The stated end goal is the death of anyone they are against(ie not white).
"Steve Bannon: 'We're going to war in the South China Sea ... no doubt'"  <<“You have an expansionist Islam and you have an expansionist China. Right? They are motivated. They’re arrogant.

The "we" in these racists studies seem to be mostly about whites in western societies. Where are the studies about racism in Africa. Remember Rwanda? Black racism against whites Zimbabwe. Arab racism against Jews. Japanese antipathy against foreigners. The underlying assumption is that as the dominant race for the past few centuries that whites should have progressed beyond such primitive impulses. Minorities as the object of racism complain about being discriminated against ignoring the racism their own race practices in different circumstances or cultures. Black antisemitism  in the US is a good example. Racism, the us versus them phenomena, is not uniquely a white feature, it is in all humans.
Hey sky, you can criticize globalization and its proponents all you want.  Weirdly enough, the left has been doing this much longer without ever needing to use the word 'cosmopolitanism' as part of that critique.  If you find you can't criticize globalization without using that word, maybe you need a broader vocabulary...or better concepts.  That, or you're happy having people read your statements as attacking Jews.  Me, I can criticize globalization, or even Israeli occupation of the West Bank, without making that generalization.
Unfortunately you sense of history is rather shallow. Jews have lived in Israel for at least four thousand years and had a state on the land for much of that time. If that is not ownership then we must vacate Canada and give it back to the original owners as well.
Brad and others It is not a case of right to land or deserving of land. Israel could have absolute right to all of Palestine and it would not make sense for Israel to be established there.  A Jewish state surrounded by its enemies can only have one conclusion - hell on earth for Israelis and Arabs.
Sorry but this is far from being "speculative projection" on my part. The opinions of alt-right groups on Jews and other minorities are well-known and widely disseminated by prominent members of the alt-right such as Richard Spencer. In short, I'm not making this stuff up.  What's curious is your need to defend these groups and their hateful activities, not to mention your attempts to deny Mr. Trump's widely reported remarks.
"...as moral as the Swill, Germans and French...."  Outside a system of law, there is not much to go on: Bigelow's word against the ghosts of dead Vatican bank employees, whose policy was to destroy bank records every 10 years (until the 1990's). There were no death camps in Vatican City (though thousands of priests were interned in them elsewhere), no executions of civilians at the Vatican as in France and Germany, and no high-powered banks involved in the plunder of European Jews as among the Swiss. So those three countries had reason to cough up restitution funds.  Rome would also say no Christian church suffered more under the Nazis than the CC.   For the reasons above the traces of any alleged moral obligation are a matter of non-legal conjecture. As a non-European, Pope Francis is more disappointed with the future of Europe -- in parts of Europe -- than he is of its past. This case has expanded beyond its credibility to trust anyone, any source, voice, outside a SYSTEM OF LAW.
The very definition of "Nazi" is "National Socialist  German Workers Party"    They were "socialists" by definition.. You can look it up in Wikipedia.  They were basically the 'right wing' of socialism, Communism being the left.   Two sides of the same totalitarian coin.   But you proved my point that, "there probably is some hatred among those on the far left"  Thank you! You just affirmed that which I didn't "show"  The socialist, Jeremy Christian,  supported    Bernie Sanders. Sanders was man enough to apologize for it.  Jeremy hated Muslims, Jews and Christians and  is  typical of the  'confused'  religion hating,  left wing zealots of today. They are volatile, usually un-employed, like most of Hitler's supporters were in the 20's and 30's.   They feed on racial, ethnic and religious  hatred/tensions, exploiting it wherever they can.    Laws  must be upheld.      Those who break our laws,   need to be punished, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or political affiliation.
I'm sorry, but you should question your own assumptions. There was no "Jewish state" for much of the past 4,000 years. There were Jewish kingdoms that lasted maybe 200 years, if that. But just as Jews lived in Israel over that time, so did many other peoples over the years. And Jews lived in many other places over that time, from Egypt to Brooklyn NY, and still do.  So, what is the point you are trying to prove? Jewish people and others lived in what is now Israel for a vey long time; and Jews have lived elsewhere for a very long time, too.  They have no "exclusive" connection to the land.  For a Jewish person who has never stepped outside his or her own neighbourhood in Montreal or Brooklyn, to have an automatic right of Israeli citizenship and move to Hebron,, to the exclusion of the Palestinians families that lived there for generations, simply cannot be right in any moral sense. To give superior rights to one ethnic over another because of race or religion is bigotry, no?
In relation to "the dawn of creation," I would describe the Jewish texts as recent.   The "traditional views" you argue for are common to all the Abrahamic faiths, but among those it is primarily Christianity and Islam that have promulgated them around the world. I was pointing out that when we are able to investigate societal stances towards homosexuality prior to the advent of Christianity and Islam, (Jews not being such avid proselytizers) we find enough examples of the social accommodation of homosexuality (etc.) to prove the inaccuracy of claims of universal approbation. I referred above to one type of research shedding some light on the matter. There are others as well.   And yes, I'm aware that my views are recent.  I wasn't arguing merit, or its lack, based on relative antiquity. I was simply questioning your assertion of timeless universality.
Are you okay with Catholic cemeteries, of which there are many? Are you okay with Jewish cemeteries...of which there are many? Is it just Muslim cemeteries you're opposed to? Why? Are you even afraid of DEAD Muslims en masse?
"That we were founded upon Judeo-Christian principles is unquestioned?"  Only by those who are ignorant of the Constitution and American history.  Thank you, Ms. Moore.
I would like to appeal to Jesus Christ as well who is quoted in 3 Gospels (twice in Matt) that remarriage is equivalent to adultery.   Jesus was super permissive with regard to aspects of the Mosaic law. His interpretation of the Sabbath is FAR more liberal than that of the Pharisees and current Orthodox Judaism. He is also permissive in his refusal to apply the Mosaic law to those caught in adultery. Instead of death he offers mercy, forgiveness and the command to sin no more. The Church follows suit in both cases, lax in its interpretation of the Sabbath and just as merciful to the adulteress offering mercy in the Confessional rather than the death penalty of Mosaic law.  In other cases, like marriage and sexual conduct in general Jesus was FAR MORE RIGID. No divorce, no remarriage. Adultery is broadened to include lustful desires of the heart. The Church follows suit again calling humanity to carry out the Lord's commands. A person must ponder Jn 6:67 "Do you also want to leave?"
Classy statement. You should be proud of yourself. The victim blaming, especially in this case, really brings it home for the win.   Should girls in short dresses, people of color, Alaska Natives, Jews, and the physically/mentally challenged keep a low profile too? What's your take on those groups? Just wondering.
With twice the debt of California, Ontario is now the world’s most indebted sub-sovereign borrower.in the word, the trust is gone!!  Ontario has 1/3 of California's population with more debt load at over $320 billion dollars at a billion a month in interest - during record low interest period. The Liberals plan to pile on more debt, sell Ontario assets and dramatically increase to the Ontario Govt sunshine list.  To say it's not all the Liberals doing is a refusal to recognize the destruction of what once was the economic engine of Canada. A Provence that didn't need federal transform payments to make payroll. 300 hundred thousand lost manufacturing jobs lost  due to outrageous  energy cost. A  market that is now completely dependent on revenuer from an overstimulated foreign buyer housing market  There is an old Jewish adage: "Not knowing the truth doesn't make you ignorant, not wanting to know the truth is what makes you ignorant" I think in this instance it is applicable Dante!!
It is a propaganda piece to demonize Israel and Jews.
The Legend of Trump grows stronger.  First he colludes with Russia to win the election.  Then in his spare time he hangs out with David Duke and the KKK.  When he's not busy conspiring with Putin or David Duke he then hangs out with the Neo-Nazi's plotting how to get rid himself of his Jewish son in law and his Jewish grandchildren.  If that's not bad enough I hear next week he is going to play golf with Kim Jong Un to plot the destruction of America right after he attends a flag burning in Birmingham.  CNN is reporting that next month he will time travel back to the 1800's where he will personally take place in the lynching of a slave.
"that Quebec progressives seem so perversely inflexible on questions of secularism and politics. "  thats because quebecers dont understand there is a difference between secularism and atheism.  The former tolerates all religions, the latter bans them.
Not really an accurate analogy. Communism failed because it is simply inefficient and it just took a while for most of the communists to admit it. They had a range of socialist/capitalist hybrids to compare to. However, 'atheism' has, by definition, nothing to hold up as a comparator other than the lack of a particular something. Much more difficult to work with. Getting right down to basics, 100,000 years ago some neanderthal looked up at the stars and grunted out the idea 'gods make all this'. I think there would have to be a little bit of serious and reproducible followup on an idea that big.  I certainly don't think the onus is on the other guy to prove him wrong.
To me, atheism is, in itself, a "belief system"... It is the belief that no diety exists.  I find it as unacceptable as a "belief system" which is sure a diety exists.  I'm an agnostic......I have no idea whether a diety exists or not.  It's one of those things (as Don Rumsfeld would say) that "I don't know and know I don't know."  Gary Crum
A Protestant, although a Georgetown Prep graduate. Currently the court is 100% Jewish/Catholic. Our separated brethren are making a comeback!
No, actually it doesn't.  I assume this is not intentional but you missed the sentence immediately following what you cite, "That nearly all of the congregations in town turned out to be Christian does not reflect an aversion or bias on the part of town leaders against minority faiths"  Nor the sentence immediately following  " The quest to promote “a ‘diversity’ of religious views” would require the town “to make wholly inappropriate judgments about the number of religions [it] should sponsor and the relative frequency with which it should sponsor each a form of government entanglement with religion that is far more troublesome than the current approach.   What it means that if there are Jewish synagogues within the town's borders it must offer an opportunity for a rabbi to give an invocation. HOWEVER!!!!! If there are no Jewish synagogues within its borders it does NOT have to reach out beyond its border to find a Jewish Rabbi to give an invocation.
You are the one who needs to be educated, civil marriage in most cases is not a sacrament and for Catholics, never can be unless in danger of death or no priest is available for a long period.   Also, it would have to take into account the dispositions of those being married.  Two atheists are not going to consider their union sacramental, nor would members of most other religions.
Roland, you don't know as much about this issue as you think you do.  The burden of proof (so to speak) is not upon atheists.  If you wish to believe in supernatural powers, you are free to do so, but it is not for atheists to prove that gods don't exist.  To the contrary if someone wants me to believe the extraordinary (that there is a supernatural explanation for us and the universe), you need to prove to me why I should believe it.  There is zero evidence for the existence of the supernatural, and the religious continue to fail to show why what they believe is correct.  The evidence we have actually suggests the opposite - that religion is nothing but a mythical story.  And if you bothered to look up the word's meaning, atheism actually means "lack of belief in theism (gods and religion).  Atheism is not a belief system.  It is rational and scientific.   Provide any good evidence to show that god is real, atheists will follow the evidence.
Of course atheism requires proof, if you're going to assert "there is no God" then you need to be able to support that assertion. What doesn't require evidence is agnosticism. Don't confuse atheism and agnosticism- they are not the same.
1. Hate to tell you but neither Jewish NOR Catholic priests are perfect.   2. Jesus missioned the Twelve to PREACH the GOSPEL and BAPTIZE.  He said nothing about running a parish.   3.  Unmarried priesthood is based on remnants of the Gnostic heresy, which believes that the spiritual things are holier than the physical.  This disciple forgets that the WORD became incarnate BECAUSE the physical is as good as the spiritual.  Bodies are not subordinate to the soul.  It would be great for priests to have a wife and children.  Then when he talked about family life, his parishioners would know that his comments are based on the REALITY of a LIVED experience----not a lot of speculation.
The term "Palestinian" in the 30s and 40s usually referred to Jews who had made Aliyah to the Holy Land. It is inconsistent to compare the results of war and population displacement of Arab Palestinians and Middle Eastern Jews with the death camps of the Nazis. During the creation of the State of Israel the surrounding Arab countries, the "neighbors", invaded the territory and tried to eliminate the Jewish population. THERE'S your genocide. Jews throughout North Africa and the Middle East were dispossessed of their homes and property. THERE'S your ethnic cleansing. They made their homes in the State of Israel, which has substantial Muslim and Christian inhabitants as well, alone among Middle Eastern countries. The State of Israel has made peace offers, most notably during the Camp David Summit in 2000. The Palestinians under Yasir Arafat would not even recognize the State of Israel. So why do they deserve recognition? The Israelis evacuated their settlers from Gaza. They got rockets!
If one has given up the Christian Faith, it matters not whether they call themselves Christian.  Atheism under the guise of Christianity is still Atheism. Thus they cannot qualify as "separated brethren." They can only qualify as "separated brethren" if they are, in fact, Christian.   Look at the likes of Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi--they call themselves Catholic, but in fact have little to nothing to do with actual Catholicism.  They are cultural Catholics, not actual Catholics. They may not be atheists, but they are no Catholics. Rosaries and other Catholic accidents don't make one a Catholic. Being Catholic has to do with what one professes, not whether they like statues or Rosaries, or devotions to the saints. When it comes to Protestants you can have the same phenomenon. In the Jewish community you have the same phenomenon. Jewish is a term that can refer to ethnicity or culture as much as someone's belief system.
Bannon described himself in 2014 as a “Leninist.” “Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that’s my goal too. I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment,” Bannon said, according to a a report by Ronald Radosh in the Daily Beast. According to a sworn statement by his ex-wife in 2007, Bannon said that he didn’t like Jews and didn’t want his daughters to go to school with Jewish people.
Dennism, do not feel guilt about your words of criticism.  It is right & just to critique anyone who teaches that people should discriminate & oppress any group of people.  Our Pope's stand on this issue is immoral just as if he had said that it is ok to keep black men from priesthood because of their skin color, as Jesus was a Jew, a white man.  Our church also allowed black slave ownership.    The pope himself admitted that popes are not perfect & that he considers himself a sinner.  He is correct.  So are we all sinners.    I would critique your comment because there is just no feminine equality avenue.  We are equally man - men and women, per God, in Genesis & Jesus does not state that men and women are different creations but one creation & not a creation anymore or less complimentary than black men & white men.  Ordination has nothing to do with gender by the sacrament's obligations.  God could have made us physically incapable-He didn't.    I love Pope Francis but this is error.
The NY Times article is of course comparing apples to oranges with its criticism.    A repeal of a government program that required the purchase of insurance (and then made it free for large portions of that group via expanded Medicaid or subsidies) is necessarily going to result in lower 'coverage' numbers than during the program.   Just like a repeal of the law in Nazi Germany that required Jews to wear yellow stars resulted in less people wearing yellow stars.  The real metrics com from average cost per person to get health insurance if they choose and their ability to actually pay that amount.   The ACA has made that much more difficult while a repeal would make affordable insurance easier to actually afford.     You are right though the utter mess of healthcare goes way back to when a president STUPIDLY attempted to impose wage controls.   Then businesses got into the practice of offering "perks" that were not wages like insurance coverage.
Or Hillary's. Something-something pantsuit. Or the fault of "Soros", since the right has finally figured out that saying "the Jews" is frowned on in modern society.   Or "the media", as if their chosen fake news outlets are not also media, just much more unreliable and unprofessional.
" I watched what happened when the Jews—men, women and children—arrived. The Ukrainians led them past a number of different places where one after the other they had to give up their luggage, then their coats, shoes and over-garments and also underwear. They also had to leave their valuables in a designated place. There was a special pile for each article of clothing. It all happened very quickly and anyone who hesitated was kicked or pushed by the Ukrainians  to keep them moving." eyewitness testimony
Are you seriously comparing the Jewish  Holocaust victims to  homosexual discrimination?
Do you think the Nazis were Jewish? I highly doubt that. They got a lot of assistance in France, Ukraine, Hungary, Poland, etc from Christians in those countries.   World War 2, a war between mainly Christian nations (Japan was a notable exception) took 100 million lives. World War 1, which was only between Christian countries, took over 60 million lives.
Anyone listening to the muslims that say they do not want this? For some of the same reasons us bigoted racist Islamophobes don't want this. Its dangerous, its one sided it protects no one else but muslims. Muslims will have free rein to spew their hate without consequence. And they do in many mosques every week they are encouraged to kill the non believers, to kill the jews.  This motion also had input from MAC which is part of the Muslim Brotherhood. MB is a known terrorist group, and is recognized by countries as such. In fact the MB came up with the word Islamophobia. Why is a terrorist group having any say in Canada's free speech?
What does multiculturalism have to do with it? Most people are religious and many religions, especially Catholicism and fundamental Judaism, are equally misogynous. The unequal treatment of women and men in the Catholic church was one of the factors that lead me to abandoning faith in my teens.
Modern terrorism was started in India/Pakistan in 1947 when centuries old hatreds between Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs caused mass murder, ethnic cleansing and genocide between Muslims traveling through Hindu lands to reach West Pakistan.
The GOP is little more than a white identity death cult these days. The president and his supporters made it very clear that all lives don't matter to them. They are defined by who they fear, hate, and resent. The children in Flint still don't have clean water thanks to the GOP. Clearly, their lives don't matter to them. Republicans remind me of the "good Germans" that never asked, where did the Jews disappear to? Most of those Germans were Christians too.
This isn't about " all faiths and ethnicities". It's about Jews and antisemitism.
Thank you for this.  Loved how you explained it.  God is Great!  And to all the atheists out there. If the Christians are wrong and there is no God.  We will still be okay when we die.  But if we are right and you are wrong.  How will you stand before God Almighty?  A Christian
This is easily the biggest news story of the week, and mainstream media have completely missed it. Essentially, by declaring all settlements illegal, including the Israeli presence in east Jerusalem, President Obama has reversed 50 years of American policy, that final borders must be determined by direct negotiations between the two parties, Jews and Palestinians. This resolution adopts the maximal Palestinian position that Israel must withdrawal to the Green Line set by the armistice of 1949. It is hard to understand why Obama would support such an extreme position, which is impractical and has no chance of ever being implemented. Why would Palestinians be prepared to negotiate concessions, if final status borders have already been determined by the UN Security Council?
Unfortunately, modernists coming after Jesus expanded the priesthood.  Jesus chose only male jews, but some progressive along the way allowed others in and look where that has gone.  As Pope Paul VI understood, God is Male, and can only be represented by Men.  From this we can extrapolate God chromosomal make-up.
"Well, in that case, why stop there?" ============= For the same reason so many Protestants, Atheists, and others go there: The artwork of the building and the artwork inside. It is amazing.  - But you really had no intention of going there at all, did you?
To give you an idea how powerful this can be. During world war 2, there were two Polish doctors who figured out a way to cause the typhoid blood test to return false positive results. German people are significantly more prone to get typhoid than poles, and typhoid outbreaks often happen in wars as it creates conditions where the lice that spread it can easily thrive. They sent the Nazi labs several doctored blood samples - and convinced the Nazis that their town was in the midst of a massive typhoid outbreak, leading to it being quarantined and saving at least 8000 Jews and Poles from the deathcamps. They told nobody else of their subterfuge, and it didn't take long -before there was no shortage of people all over town with all the symptoms of typhoid fever. So much so that when the Nazis got distrustful and did an on-site inspection they left convinced it was a real outbreak.  In the entirety of the war, not a single person in that town had actually had a typhoid fever infection.
Your opinion of his disbelief is itself without merit. Please quote the OP on his errors and refute them for our peer review fellow Atheist.   For those of "faith";   If you need proof there is no god simply use the link you currently are reading my reply with. It's called a keyboard. It just so happens to be a portal to the entire knowledge of the human race. Try using Google, it's your friend. I suggest starting with "A history of god", a lovely film that will engross you from the start.    Using your brain and this tool, within 30 days you will be educated enough to think freely or at least one would hope. The real test here though is would you ever take the time to educate yourself to facts, or do you prefer to remain ignorant?
Who let in a bunch of people that HATE the Jewish people ??? NOT TRUMP !! Trumps daughter is married to a Jewish man so that  lie doesn't work.   Guess again Starts with an O and ends with an A
I would add Left hatred to the list.  Somehow it's okay to give tax breaks to Planned Parenthood and American Atheists, but doing the same for churches is now under fire.
Most leftist Trump bashing articles aren't worth the time, just more biased misleading dribble. There are already regions of the world largely dedicated to people that have certain cultures and religions and that's good for those people/places (supposedly, I don't know the details how they are doing in other countries), this part of the world is more about the different Catholic/Christian and atheist! types, and that's good, the way it should be, maintaining traditional ways in each region it's the healthier proven way for society. That's about it when it comes to this issue.
Here are quotes of some verses from the Qu'ran, the most holy book of Islam. Qur'an (4:89) - "They wish that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve, and then you would be equal; therefore take not to yourselves friends of them, until they emigrate in the way of God; then, if they turn their backs, take them, and slay them wherever you find them; take not to yourselves any one of them as friend or helper." Qur'an (9:30) - "And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah; and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah; these are the words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may Allah destroy them; how they are turned away!” There are about 100 verses like that in the Qu'ran. All Muslims are supposed to follow Islam and the verses in the Qur'an. Isn't that the truth and not a false perception? Are there verses in the Qur'an Muslims don't have to or don't need to follow?
this is an anti-hindu commentary. some of her points are valid, but they are expressed through a lens where only hindus cause the problems. its unbalanced at best, and racist at worst
We're used to being told there are problems with systemic racism and sexism in our society. What Couillard was saying, and what a great many people think, is that there are systemic problems with intolerance in Islam.  The evidence for that is very clear: witness the attitude towards other religions in Islamic countries--the very term "Islamic country" pretty much says it all. So no one is saying that most Muslims are supporters of terrorism, or that they condone terrorism. No one is saying there are more bad Muslims than bad Christians or Jews. What is being suggested is that Muslim community leaders and religious officials in Canada and elsewhere look at what passes for legitimate discourse in their circles—including what they teach youngsters in their schools and what is preached in their mosques—and take responsibility for purging it of whatever bigotry they find.
To put things in context, there are three times as many moslems compared to jews in Canada, yet in absolute terms, there are twice as many hate crimes against jews compared to crimes against moslems.  After the shootings at the mosque, many synagogue members in Montreal and Toronto formed  "human rings" around neighbouring mosques in a show of support.  It would have been a nice reciprocal gesture had the moslems included jews and other minority groups in their request to the government for more tools to fight hate crimes. Instead, they just focussed on their  own requirements..
Believing that we should ensure the freedom  from, more than of, religion,  hostile to all forms of fundamentalism, as much Christian, (born again and Catholic integrist) and Jewish (ulta-Orthodoxy) as well as Islamic fundamentalism (Salafism or Wahhabism), and attached to the right to blaspheme, I am very worried about the consequences of the passing of M-103.  In a recent book, "Un racism imaginaire, islamophobie et culpabilité", Pascal Bruckner expresses his fear that the notion of islamophobia could be used to silence any criticism of Islam itself.  While the personal security of Muslims should be ensured, so should that of people who subscribe to Voltaire's statement that Moses, Christ and Muhammad were three imposters.  Is one who would encourage Muslims to approach their sacred text the way that Thomas Römer dissects the Hebrew Bible at the Collège de France, and who criticises Muslims who refuse to do so, engaged in an Islamophobic act?
So a Christian friend of mine recently died, and his wife went to a Jewish Temple to seek burial.  I wonder what kind of response she'll get.
"In 2030, 2031, and 2032 Ramadan happens in December again!"  Guess what, vivavivaldi, Muslims should celebrate it anyway that they want (short of imposing jihad).  And Jews tend to enjoy the season even though they don't believe that Jesus was God incarnate.  My sister-in-law is an atheist and she celebrates the Winter Solstice.  Why?  Because this is America, where people are free to celebrate what they want (Cinco de Mayo) when they want.  But no one should be told that saying Merry Christmas is wrong unless you support national socialism.
"...take off the Clerics and place laity with survivors...."  Makes sense, rdp46.   But at least -- on a positive note -- in the English speaking world, especially in the US and Canada, we are making some kind of real progress. Australian, Irish and English Catholic Churches are doing well, too. Other non-English speaking cultures and juridical systems, however, will have to learn to deal with this issue in their own way. I am also reminded what German and English friends say about us -- that our American critique of their causes of "failure" is superficial, especially when we forget the different legal, social, cultural, and political factions within nations all over the globe (not only in continental Europe). Just watching how Spain deals with Catalonia reveals this.  They say success depends upon knowing how long it takes to succeed. This is certainly true of sexual abuse. We can only hope the English speaking Catholic world will be a model for all by 2075, including Hindu India.
Don't forget the French Navy at Yorktown. Actual warships, not rowboats with gun-slinging Frenchmen aboard. "Oppressive dictatorships are certainly not overthrown by gaggles of citizens with personal firearms ..."  Bravo to your reply! Sometimes, in a fit of their own importance, some gun-rights supporters speculate what would have happened if the Nazi government had run across armed Jews in Germany when they came to apprehend the Jews. I'll tell you what would have happened: The Nazis would have withdrawn, come back with Schmeissers and gone in, guns blazing. Now, maybe those Jews would have been called martyrs, but they'd be dead, nonetheless.
How do you define a "state" that has no defined borders, has no constitution, and specifically prohibits equal rights between Jews and non-Jews? So much for the "only democracy in the Middle East."
What I am against is tax relief for gigantic corporate churches. As I said I have no argument against tax relief for small neighborhood churches which are often poor, and their pastors who often live in penury. That's not Billy Graham, Kenneth Copeland, Pat Robertson or many other millionaire leaders of megachurches. I don't ignore the atheists, who don't have churches, or the other religions with small congregations. I guess I should include swamis like Rajneesh, but there aren't many of them either.  This is just more of your pointless and gratuitous Eric Norstog bashing. Give it a rest, you're a bore.
Molotov was not Jewish.  He was appointed to his post precisely for that reason, when the Soviets signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany.  So your point was?
actually most of the jewish population in the us voted for him twice and for hillary as well , about 75%
"Trump acted like a great statesman."  Yes, Trump is very good at acting. If you think he's really such a great statesman you should read Jennifer Rubin's latest column in WaPo over his comments about Israel, and she's Jewish and Republican:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/05/22/trump-said-what/?utm_term=.d009d3ae2da4
That's just it...he may not be richer than his Dad was...his Dad's final estate valued at close to $100 million in tangible negotiable assets...and he never went bankrupt, and though reputed to be a racist and an SOB, was never sued for non-payment or f-ing over his employees or contractors....  There are lots of people down here that go to Penn, that are rich and well-connected who are total rednecks...I had a senior VP from a big telecom company come and speak to a management class and he is ALL for Trump...and all for sending African-Americans back to Africa, Muslims back to wherever they come from (he wasn't really sure where the Muslims belong), and the Jews back to Palestine (except his banker)... . If your point is that Trump has broad appeal across class lines, he doesn't...he appeals to those with NO class at all (or as one of my students said, "the ones that have class with a capital 'K'")
He taught bible studies. I suppose that does not show he was Christian but it is suggestive. Why do you say he was an atheist?
Think Does it really make sense to found a Jewish nation surrounded by their enemies, Muslims and Arabs?
Not rebuking?  Not judging?  Not excluding?  Does that mean you will not rebuke me if I say that all Catholics have to vote Republican?  Does that mean you won't judge me if I say that racism is compatible with Catholicism? You don't judge me if I tell you that Trump needs to build that wall; that we need to deport all illegal aliens, especially if it means we have to break up their families?   Does this mean you will not exclude me if I say that the poor should worry about themselves---because no one has an obligation to help them or care about them?   You will love me if I tell you that the death penalty needs to be used more often?  By the way--for someone like Jesus who you claim never rebuked, he certainly did a lot of rebuking of the Jewish establishment.  Once he even overturned tables in a fit of rage.
Genocides happen when people make blanket statements and are unenlightened.  Sometimes it is totalitarianism, other times religion-based.  The world is on a steady move to humanism over other religions especially in the educated West. over 30% of Canadians are already atheists or agnostics.  Payette is a woman of science and science will be her contribution.  People who reject science therefore will not support her.  But, Canada needs to lead with an educated and forward thinking society in a world where our labor is expensive and land vast.  Scheer's remarks are for political purposes to rile up those who still believe.  They are not a show of leadership of any kind.
so lets teach all the Islamic children all about the virtues of Judaism and Christianity and have them recite the Lord's Prayer.  Just learning not teaching - do you think this will work? And Muslim parents certainly would not have issues with this as all religion is fair game.
I did not know who that was.  You really think I should be compared to a Nazi holocaust organizer? I praise a Jew as my God!
It is only by hardening the heart to the point of calling it a "fetus fetish" that such people are able to survive with themselves.  During WWII, such people might have referred to a Jew fetish, or pre-Civil War, a slavery-fetish.  For such people, life itself is subordinate to their selfish will.
What you just wrote there echoes what some Catholic acquaintances say bout the Jews, how they are "tired of hearing" about their complaints. When thousands of vulnerable adolescents die of suicide or bullying every year as a direct result of the teachings you defend so warmly, it is time to ask some questions.
If you are Catholic, you accept the canonical status of Luke, whether he is Jew or Gentile.   The Scriptual evidence nor 2,000 years of Tradition does not point to Judas being saved despite the attempts at rehabilitating him.
I think there are many politicians who set aside their more restrictive beliefs (things that are legal but which they wouldn't do themselves) out of respect for the rights and beliefs of others. In fact I would expect no less from our responsible representatives. Pence puts literal scripture above science, and thus considers the world under God's direct control. This is unacceptable since logic tells us that human waste is changing the climate in dangerous ways. Agnostics, Muslims, Jews and Christians ought to pursue policy that would restore balance to the planet. A belief that "End Times" are near should not sway our representatives to pursue the expediting of the end of the world as a habitable planet for the human species
Not what I said. In 2012 the Democrat Party booed God at their National Convention!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUJE9YfsbNQ  You could say they have become atheist over the years....  And yes, the KKK was formed as an adjunct to the Democrat Party.  http://www.history.com/topics/ku-klux-klan
I was gratified to learn of Ms. Ostrov's candidacy until she indicated that she "fully" supported Donald Trump.  I find it unusual that any candidate would completely support Mr. Trump given that he (Trump} is at odds, on certain issues, with republic national party leadership. The fact that she is a Filipina Catholic, married to a Ukrainian Jew with two children of Polynesia ancestry has no particular importance to me.  Her work life and academic credentials are impressive but the article does not mention her experience in the political arena.  It is also nice to know that she is serious about her candidacy.  Pat Saiki continues to seek out viable candidates for elective office. Fresh faces in the republican party would be nice.
"Jesus died a Jew."  For Christians, however, Jesus rose from the dead; He was more than a great dead Jew, a dead Jewish "Teacher" or Rabbi who taught great things like dead Socrates did, whose grave could not hold out for long against disintegration, emptiness, mortality. Jesus later appeared to an assembly of followers in an Upper Room and elsewhere -- to proclaim the Kingdom of God which was at the heart and center of his ministry and preaching. His followers recruited others to proclaim the same message of faith, hope, love and forgiveness all over the globe. His followers didn't discount the notion of church, recruitment, location in order to proclaim his message, pass it on, live it out, bask in his living Presence at worship. Church is everywhere in New Testament Revelation, stirring among his followers. The Risen Jesus founded a church through them.
Chuck writes:  "Are we allowed to ask what type of message it sends to students when females are forbidden from taking part in prayers during their natural cycles?"  --  Hey Chuck, there's no explaining the odd idiosyncrasies of the various religions.  Take for instance....no Catholic female priests, Jewish women relegated to different areas of the temple, Mormons....well, Mormons are just plain different.  If you start disqualifying religions because of their irrational points of faith, the world will be entirely atheist.  Hey..........
I guess we are lucky the Vietnamese, Koreans, Japanese, Chinese didn't interpret the Americans's interventions there as "Crusaders in Buddhist lands", and create radicalized young Buddhists in our own lands.../s
In Israel, there are Jews and there are Zionists.  One is good, one is bad.  The EU wants Israel to comply with UN Resolution 152, 1967, which is based on the concept of: if you start a war, you do not get to keep captured real estate.  Not even the Camp David five percent. https://www.google.com/#q=un+resolution+242
To answer this "Can a good person offer unwavering support to one of the worst people on the planet."  People I consider "worst people":   Kim Jong-un- No, cannot support him. He had his own half brother murdered. (http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/27/asia/kim-jong-nam-north-korea-killed/index.html)  Hitler- Uh, nooo. He wiped out an entire family, sans one who became one of my closests friends. She was 'fortunate' I suppose- she fit the Hitler Youth mold, blonde blue eyed... she was rescued by American soldiers.  (No, I am not Jewish-but yes, I loved her)  Ted Bundy? Nope. A Bad Guy.  Lee Boyd Malvo "Undocumented immigrant"- (WaPo called him a illegal alien then) No, not him either. http://humanevents.com/2002/11/04/sniper-suspect-is-illegal-alien/   I find our President to be a good man, pre presidency included. So he I can and do  support completely.
Where is Trump's condemnation of THIS outrage?  The same place as Indian leadership's condemnation of repeated rape and killing of women, especially tourists, there.  Didn't happen.  Guess Ivanka didn't get in his ear about this the way she did about desecration of Jewish sites.
Oh, Jesus followed the law?  So why was he arrested [by the Jewish hierarchy] and sentenced to death by the Romans?  To what 'law' are you referring ?  The Law of God, or the law/acts of a narcissistic president which runs completely counter to the Law of the love of God and the love of your neighbor as yourself.  Or do you think that Jesus was just kidding when he based his entire ministry on serving others and us?    Read Matthew 25:31-47 [the Judgment of the Nations] and see what the Son of Man states as the grounds for final judgment.  People who call themselves "Christians/Catholics" but fail to see that their own bigotry and their legalism marks them as hypocrites.  Those bishops who FAIL to speak up as Bishop McElroy did, need to read the entire twenty-third Chapter of Matthew and seriously reflect upon it.
Dogon60,  I too support a secular society and governance, so we are in agreement their.  I would argue however, that the burden of proof falls on anyone that wishes to make a scientific or rational claim for or against the existence of God/gods.  I do not wish to make a scientific claim for the existence of my God, I believe He exists by faith alone.  In fact, I'd argue that scientific evidence of my God would negate the value of faith and would thereby destroy Christianity itself.  So, where I make no scientific claim for the existence of God, the burden of proof is not mine.  However, for atheists (not necessarily you, of course) who wish to claim atheism is in accord with contemporary scientific beliefs, the burden of proof falls upon them to prove it does.  I think that's fair, don't you?
https://www.google.com/#q=how+many+books+of+the+bible  The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, "the books") is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans. Many different authors contributed to the Bible. . Of course, my friends, I really do not think that I have already won it; the one thing I do, however, is to forget what is behind me and do my best to reach what is ahead.-- from the 50th book of the Bible.  Am I the 1 of the 100?
RolandX, how quickly you have descended into silliness. You dodged my question by turning it back on me, with comical results. In shortened form, you wrote - Why do atheists deny their disbelief isn't belief? That's a nonsensical position. Not believing something is the exact opposite of a belief.   It is clear that you have this idea that atheism is a belief system. For some reason, some Christians feel a need to define atheists this way. I'm telling you that you are wrong. For your own reasons, you want to see atheism as a belief system, but atheism is not a belief system. You believe in God and accept the Christian version of what that entails. The fact that I do not believe in your God entails nothing other than that I do not believe in your God. There's no belief system there, only the opposite.
Listen to the debate on youtube Bahnsen vs Stein - I sincerely believe you would find it interesting it is titled "Does God Exist" between an atheist and a pastor who has a PhD in Philosophy. Adam and Eve had perfect genes, lived for 1000 years and were far superior to modern humans, many things were possible that would confuse you.
If  you want to talk about ideological  hate driven action's I'm in the middle of   reading the plight of the Jews of Lisbon at our hands   in the 16th century.....I have to remind myself we're now in the 21st and the worm has turned  and it's pay back time.
Hitler studied the reservations and used them as a model when he was exterminating entire races. Israel, has the Palestinians behind concentration camps while the Palestinians watch the American and British supported Israelis colonize lands stolen from the Palestinians and develop natural gas fields stolen from the Palestinians.. What is your jesus going to tell you all when you all die and, are forced to explain your lifes actions to him? After all you support the genocide of entire races of people, in order to steal their minerals, resources and lands.. Just the same way he was forced to live and eventually was put to death by the invading Roman Empire at the request of the jews..
That's incorrect. Some Jews are atheists.  "The Jewish people are an ethnoreligious group and nation originating from the Israelites, or Hebrews, of the Ancient Near East. Jewish ethnicity, nationhood and religion are strongly interrelated, as Judaism is the traditional faith of the Jewish nation, while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance." - Wikipedia  "Jewish" describes a diverse group of people that transcends their traditional religion. You can't use the term Jewish in the way that we use the terms Muslim or Christian. Muslims and Christians are identified by their adherence to their respective religions, regardless of their ethnicity. Jews may or may not identify with Judaism, but they're still Jews.
@ Register-Guard, the above comment both denies the holocaust, and implies advocacy for ethnic genocide against Jewish people. It is hate speech. Please remove.
Good morning, John. I think there are several issues that explain our several differences. Correct me if I'm wrong. First, I think you tend to give Paul and others the benefit of the doubt when they are portrayed, or portray themselves, as speaking or writing  with pure motives. I tend to suspect that they are attempting to put the best possible light on often ambiguous circumstances. (For example, I think Peter did more than simply "deny" Jesus in the gospels, and that Paul sought the approval of James and Peter largely to deflect criticism.) Second, it seems you accept more than I the traditional portrayal of Jesus as a man misunderstood by his disciples, largely for their ignorance, by the Jewish authorities, for their duplicity, and by the Romans, perhaps for their convenience. I tend to think Jesus was rather well understood by all three groups. (Disclosure: Reza Aslan is a colleague, and we've debated this at length to no avail...) More when I have time...
Just to put the seniority in context.... The Jews first settled Jerusalem about 7,000 years ago - The Christian's sacred sites, 2,000 years - The Muslims, when Mohammad dreamt he rode Pegasus, the winged horse to Jerusalem and God spoke to him, about 1,300 hundred years ago......
Problem is with the earth's population increasing by 80 million people a year, at some very distant date having cemeteries will no longer be viable.  I think Christianity is nearing the point they could accept that and perhaps Jews, but Muslim's I am not so sure.   I say bury all faiths together or allow no more burial sites whatsoever as they are a waste of land space and have nothing to do with Allah and/or God.
Why are you fixated on this?  I've responded to him, and likely will again.  An atheist's 'take' on Muhammad (Saala Allahu alayhi wa Ah'liihi wa Salaam) is no different than his take on Jesus (alayhis-Salaam)--he doesn't believe in either.  And Allah created him free to disbelieve in Him.  Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help extricate you from these vexing, thorny issues.  Sorry for the big words.
By lacking faith in a God or gods I am not putting my faith in the position that a God does not exist.  Whether or not I accept the position that "God or gods does/do not exist" is a secondary questions.    I've heard it expressed this way by others and it might make it clearer for you.  If you have a jar of gumballs of an unknown number and state that there are an even number of gumballs in the jar I can say "I do not accept your claim."  Doing so does not mean that I'm accepting that their is an odd number of gumballs in the jar as that is a separate question.  For that you need to move down a level to gnostic-atheism/hard atheism or anti-theism.  As for atheism being a religion, you and RolandX appear to be the wriggly ones.  Atheism is a position taken on a singular claim - The rejection of the claim "A God or gods exist." (Not necessarily the acceptance of the claim No God or gods exist).  Nothing else extends from that.  A position on a singular issue does not a religion make.
So what you are saying is that there should be a white only immigration policy, like pre-1965? Because that is not "noticeable'. Interesting, since the not-noticeable Irish, Jews, Italians, etc faced extreme discrimination when they were coming in. The Jews were not allowed into Canada or the USA when they were being slaughtered in Europe. While Germans have always been allowed in.
A Public Secular school should not have anything to do with religion (other than social studies), before or after school, full stop.  Why don't these kids go to a local community centre, mosque, or rent space nearby.  Do I really need to explain how a public school is (or should be) different than a catholic school, or Jewish, or muslim or any other faith based school??  I think all schools should be non-denominational, but that's not gonna happen, so if Catholics want to practice their religion at school... then go to a catholic school.... and that goes for every other religion as well.
Robin get in touch with reality, if you haven't suggest you read the exec order in it's entirety, these 7 nations in fact harbor and support ISIS. Why are these muslims seeking refuge in jewish & christian nations vs islamic countries?, kuwait, qatar, saudi, bahrain etc. are not letting them in stating fear of terrorism, effects tourism, costs & expenses of harboring them. Any immigrant seeking refuge in the U.S. should justifiably go thru extreme background checks to insure our countries safety. Non-vetting results 2 incidents in France, Belgium, Nece and others all due to extreme islamic ideology, Read the order all countries will be involved. with 911 & the 50 following islamic based acts we are close to 4,000 innocent lost lives. Give the plan sometime to get fined tuned and to work. It's necessary, those with approved visas & green cards are & will continue to come in. Immigrants of course want to come to the U.S, we will get you jobs, food stamps, childcare, education, etc.
@Sher-e-Hindu  Oh, you love the Germans. They give you"white people are genocidal" talking point. Let's review a few historical facts - events taking place well after WWII:  Rwandans managed to outdo the Germans(rate). With machetes. Half a century after WWII. ( and I have seen your attempts to pin that on Christianity) . Pol Pot  - an undisputed champion. . China (do you need to bring that up?).  . Japan - WWII? . "How about those Serbs?" - I see you post time and again. . How about those Hindus, I'll ask in response. Under that watch of the current Indian PM. 21 century. . How about those millions Bengali - killed by Muslims? ...  But back to your point - or rather your usual attempt to deflect and distort:  Using you example - why aren't Jews blowing up stuff in Germany? Seeking repercussions?  It's not "everybody did" as an excuse. It is world history. But the hapless Left, and the  bigots of color that cherry pick facts and misplace context to justify Islam terrorism.
Portraying liberals as the antihesis of the Bible and Christianity is, in truth, just the opposite.  The liberals actually act on and believe in the basic premises of the religion of peace, human rights, civil rights, inclusion, diversity, human good, et. al.  Only the pseudo-christians of the fundamentalist ilk prefer war, fear, dictatorship, and every other evil plaguing humans and the entire planet.  The Jews created the One God religion of which Jesus belonged until he, supposedly, rebelled against the ruling classes.  The letter writer uses the typical blame mantra and scurrilous vocabular to attempt to denigrate those committed to the betterment of humans and all of the planet.  A completely warped view of the world aided and abetted by the Republican propaganda machines of the Billionaire Barons completely opposed to anything basically humane and moral.  A sad testament to a wasted life.
While on Earth, Jesus's divinity was hidden, even from himself.  This must have been the case or else he could not have been "true God and true man" and was instead playacting at being human,  and playacting at sacrificing himself on the cross.  It's no sacrifice if you know it will all come out OK on Easter morning!   So no, Jesus knew only what any other Jewish man of his time, culture, and education would have known.
Father Gruner participated in the anti-Semitic, neo-Nazi nexus of the traditionalist right.  https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2007/radical-traditionalist-catholics-spew-anti-semitic-hate-commit-violence-against-jews  Or is this comment uncivil?
It seems a little history is required as some reactions disagree with or are amused by  the observation that Jews were not allowed in  the SA(former name of the Brown Shirts  which later became the SS).  It all began in March 1933 when the SA seized Jews in Berlin, soon after Hitler's assumption of power., and sent them off to concentration camps. On March 13,  forcible closing of Jewish shops was imposed by the SA, with killings reported.  Eventually, even if you had only 1 Jewish grandparent, you were a "mischlinge of the second degree" and were deprived of all rights and eligible to be sent to a concentration camp.  On January 17 1939, members of the security service of the SS were not even allowed  to marry mischlinge of the second degree.    Clearly, Jews were not allowed to join the SS and its forerunner, the SA (Brownshirts)
How about the hundreds of Hindu Nationalists who are regular Gabbard donors, some of whom have contributed tens of thousands? Could these donations be the reason she spends so much energy supporting those in conflict with Muslims, and so little dedicated effort on the issues her constituents are concerned about?
Rahm Emanuel is Jewish and not of Mexican "dissent." You've probably never been to Chicago and you don't know what you are talking about: a true Trump supporter.
Christians, even in that first description of  'eucharist' meal in 1 Corinthians seem to have lost the format of a 'Seder meal' rather quickly.  Personally, ever since having the experience of sharing in a Jewish Seder when a University Chaplain, I have thought it would be great if Catholics could introduce a 'Seder-Mass' for Holy Thursday and have the consecration of matzoh and wine in the course of the meal.  It would help a lot towards our understanding what Jesus did at that Passover supper.
Mormon, Jehova Witness,  Roman Catholic and some Protestant denominations are Christian cults. If you doubt me, Google it for yourself. The only "true" Christian faith is directly from the Bible. Nothing more. ..nothing less.
Should the Church be more secular? It depends. Some of my secular friends, which is the current term for atheistic, are so because of the abuses of the Church - not just the covering of child sexual abuse but in how the Church has politicized itself as the handmade of the reactionary movement. Some in the hierarchy seek, under the guise of religious freedom, religious power over both their employees and society.   Newsflash to the Chancery, if you think the woman going for your plumbing contract may be a lesbian, or you are sure because she talks about her wife, you may not reject her in our name for your bigotry. There is no moral reason to do so. You are being partisan puritans, not moral. You are not tainted by paying her to fix your pipes.
The Mormons have an impressive charitable system and don't rely on government funding like us Catholics.
So you, as a Christian, are lecturing people on the semantics of atheism/agnosticism? You wrote:  "Actually, atheism is a belief system as it is predicated on the disbelief in the existence of God or gods."  Disbelief is the opposite of a belief system. Why do so many Christians feel the need to make not accepting their unproveable views a system of belief? Try to get this; I am not defined by atheism. Not believing in your deity is an almost inconsequential part of my existence.
Lots of different opinions on the subject..  Senator's defence of residential schools akin to excusing Holocaust, NDP MP says  Lynn Beyak defended 'well-intentioned' residential school system in Senate speech Tuesday  By John Paul Tasker, CBC News Posted: Mar 09, 2017 2:19 PM ET Last Updated: Mar 09, 2017 2:19 PM ET   An attempt by Conservative Senator Lynn Beyak to paint the residential school system as "well-intentioned" is akin to defending actions taken by Adolf Hitler against the Jewish people in the Second World War, NDP MP and residential schools survivor Roméo Saganash said Thursday.  "It equals saying what Hitler did to the Jewish [people] was good, that he wasn't ill-intentioned in doing what he did. So, that's why it's unacceptable," Saganash said in an interview with CBC News outside the House of Commons.
Agnostics and secularist in Canada should fear the religious right wing, the Christians, the post-Christians, the Jews, the Muslims and post-varieties. They were all raises as such religious people, they have no spirituality, no teacher. They just think they are pious because they own a book. Their teachers Mohamed, Jesus, Moses all dies 2000+ years ago. They have big ego's these followers, pragmatic and narcissistic.   We should all fear the next zealot, the next witch hunt, the next victim less crime laws (against free speech like gender pronouns) the next Drug War, the next War against Sin, War against men. We are not safe as long as "God" is in our Charter of Rights, as long as our tax dollars are used for their religions; as long as we have government schools that teach dogma as fact.
More democrats are outing themselves as Jew haters everyday. No surprise that democrats have endorsed fascism.
Expect more of this in coming times.  Sunni Kaliphate and Jewish finance alliance terrorized Christian West for 13 centuries until the English found the silver bullet - create competing land claims by founding Israel.  Since then no war in Europe. Christians at peace.  Now the payback time. Sunnis and Jews will be targeted everywhere. What goes come around.
He didn't attack a church, he went after a very specific target IN the church.  Again I say, the type of building it was is an incidental!  Where did you get your info about him being a "psychotic atheist"!?/  lmao!  If his target was at a McDonalds, everyday, at 2:00pm, he would have gone there.  Would that have made him, in your opinion, "A psychotic Vegan"!??  SMH
No, it wouldn't.  I'm not particular fond of the totalitarian imposition of force and coercion from any source.  I'm an atheist, but I do believe in The Golden Rule: treat others as you wish to be treated.  It's a rational concept that's survived by natural selection: those who don't practice it tend to kill each other off, which is what you seem to be proposing by limiting population growth by edict.  You're the one playing God here.
Actually, you are incorrect. These are a significant minority Jews living in Iran. For example, the Mizrahi Jews are all over Iran. Toronto's very own controversial developer Sam Mizrahi is a Jew. See: https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2016/09/12/how-torontos-latest-mega-tower-got-the-green-light.html   See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_Jews
There is a simpler, fundamental explanation for the Arabs' intransigence over a Jewish state in Palestine. It is a religious prohibition. A passage in the Qu'ran states that Muslims are forbidden to give up territory that has been made Muslim. Palestine was conquered early on by Arab Muslims and reclaimed from the Crusaders in the Middle Ages, so falls under this prohibition. For Abbas or anyone else to formally recognize a Jewish state in Palestine it would be a serious violation of their religion - apostasy. This they cannot do.   What they could do is quietly abandon hostilities against Israel without official admission of doing that or official recogniing of Israel as a Jewish state, as they have done with Spain, once largely a Moorish (Muslim) land, and more recently in Nagorno-Karabakh and neigboring territory reclaimed by the Armenians from Azerbaijan. If there is to be peace in Palestine, that is what it must look like.
Read the sentence without the word "our." Is it still true? I think not. Substitute "Oregon Ducks" for "Jews" in the revised sentence. Is it still true? I think not. The possessive nature of the word "our" appears to be essential to the meaning of the sentence. Yes, Messrs. Johnson and Loewy, a single word can matter. As I suggested in respect of the original letter, the author may be channeling Ramses II who was sop enamored of "his" Jews that he would not let them go.  Remember the old comment: "Some of my best friends are blacks (You can substitute another word if you like). . The tone of the overall comment is to suggest that there are some (Jews in this case) that are more acceptable than are others. That, in one word, is discrimination, or, in the alternative hate.
You caught me. I confess. I've been lying this whole time. I'm not actually an atheist, of course I believe in a god. I see him in the mirror every day !
Churchill never mentioned even once the Holocaust of the Jews in his books on WW2 published after the war. Neithet did US generals Eisehhower & others. Why?  Were they all anti-semite?
No Muslims love Jews, Israel got it all wrong. Perhaps you should go their and inform them of that fact. Truly you are amusing.
Hmmmm. . .like I said, Pan, now I know that will want to read it myself, so thanks for the un-recommendation. I trust Dennis far far more than I trust you or u, u being neither Catholic nor Christian. Always interesting to see the Rel. Right stroke the atheists and secularists on their way to fighting with LIBERALS.
An atheist is not a bigot.  From Websters: A person who disbelieves or lacks belief in the existence of God or gods.  What on earth is wrong with that?
I wonder if the Jews thought that as they were being prodded into rail cars by men with guns..?
Donald Trumps real name is Ivan Korov  a Russian plant from 1945. He's one of Stalin's sleeper cells that was planted back in 1945. Reference Igor Gazenko file RCMP 1946. The one and only open communist elected to Parliament in Ottawa was Rosen a Jewish kid from Montreal in 1943 and he was good friends with comrade Stalin. King arrested him for spying and served time in jail. Was released in 1950 and received a heroes welcome by comrade Stalin.
Don't call it "liberal secularism". Being against someone because of his religion is not secularism, it is anti-religionism. I know of atheists who are really anti-theists.  Being more against someone for being outside a Christian denomination is even worse. And shouldn't "liberal" mean to be accepting, not rejecting?
You make my point for me.  Disparagement of Hajjar and her son by Christians and Jews is a 'race-based' proposition and nothing more.  It doesn't even have any Scriptural basis.
And you, like many of your ilk, seem to think that the First Amendment gives you the right to condemn every-other religion, and even atheism, instead of just freely practicing your own religion.  Christianity is not superior (or inferior) to any-other faith, just different.
People who commit acts of terror can call themselves Nobel Prize winners but it doesn't make them so.  In the same way, those who commit acts of terror can call themselves Christian, Muslim or Jew, but it doesn't make them so.  To be a Muslim, Jew or Christian one must worship the God of Abraham, and that precludes the murder of innocent people.  'By their fruits you shall know them' and terrorism is the fruit of evil, not of worshipping and serving God.
Here is a list of Atheist commandments I found in a quick search.  Interesting that they make reference to God.  As written, they lean toward positioning science as a religion.   1. Be open-minded and be willing to alter your beliefs with new evidence. 2. Strive to understand what is most likely to be true, not to believe what you wish to be true. 3. The scientific method is the most reliable way of understanding the natural world. 4. Every person has the right to control of their body. 5. God is not necessary to be a good person or to live a full and meaningful life. 6. Be mindful of the consequences of all your actions and recognize that you must take responsibility for them. 7. Treat others as you would want them to treat you, and can reasonably expect them to want to be treated. Think about their perspective. 8. We have the responsibility to consider others, including future generations. 9. There is no one right way to live. 10. Leave the world a better place than you found it.
Give us some examples of morally repugnant manipulations, Outsider77. Is Krugman is a sly, calculating tool of the Jewish cabal? Please enlighten us sheep.
tip2, I do recall. In Grade 5, the Jewish boy in my class had to wait in the hall until the Lord's Prayer was over. We all stood to recite the prayer or listen to it over the PA system. The Jewish boy was joined by a Jehovah's Witness boy who would not sing the national anthem.  There is no War on Christmas. The local schools here still have Christmas assemblies. No one is forbidden to say "Merry Christmas". That's all in your head. If staff and teachers say "Happy Holidays", it's out of courtesy to their diverse student population. Not because Christ has been banned.
Tom Pain; If you think that the bigoted beliefs of Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam are any better than those of the crazy Bundy family, then you really have a twisted vision of our world.  Have you even ever heard Farrakhan speak?   You should sometime.  You will hear him say things like this:  “You see everybody always talk about Hitler exterminating six million Jews. That’s right. But don’t nobody ever ask what did they do to Hitler.”  "White people are potential humans – they haven’t evolved yet."  “The Jews don’t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that’s a good name. Hitler was a very great man.”  The Nation of Islam is a small fringe organization in the USA, with less than 40,000 members.  Yet, Ali was a member and fully endorsed their extremist beliefs.  The renown Southern Poverty Law Center has a detailed article about their well documented extremism and racism.  Take a look:  https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam
Thank you, Alex and TG&M, for an intelligent, informed and sensitive review of what sounds like a striking - and thoughtful - memorial.  Certainly worth another visit to Ottawa.  Too bad the National Arts Centre has recently been "condo-ized"; the two structures (the NAC designed by a Polish/Jewish/Canadian architect) would have nicely complemented each other.
"There are more Muslims in the Israeli Knesset than there are Jews in all Islamic state governments combined" I fail to see the relevancy of that statement.  Are you comparing (so-called) democratic governments only (Israel is often labelled the only democracy in the Middle East)?  Taking into account the percentage of Jewish/Muslim populations in each country?  Who is allowed a vote in each country (are you aware that Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza aren't allowed to vote in Israeli elections but Jewish illegal settlers can)?  What other countries do/allow has no relevancy, IMO.
It seems the truck attack on Christmas shoppers in Berlin, Germany was intentional.   On article says "Numerous German media reported that the suspect, who was picked up about 2 kilometres (1 1/2 miles) away from the crash site, was a Pakistani citizen".  German chancellor Merkel says it was a terror attack.  We'll have to wait to find out what his intentions and goals were.  Nevertheless, some followers of Islam have tried to kill or have killed innocent, civilian, non believers in Europe, in Australia, in the U.S.A., in Canada and in many other countries around the world. And some followers of Islam keep trying.  Why do some followers of Islam try to kill or kill innocent, civilian, non believers in many countries around the world? What leads them to target innocent, civilian, non believers?
I think Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Sikhs. other Christians...etc  should all get funding for their schools if only to shut down the dissidents and malcontents who say "Why only Catholics get funding?" . John Tory offered to extend it to all faiths when he ran for Premier but the Religious-PHOBIC secularists rejected him so don't complain now
I'm sorry, but how does it "come down to dislike/hatred of Jews"?  It's the State of Israel, and its unfair and illegal policies towards the Palestinians, that is under discussion. Making the conflict about "Jews" is anti-Semitic, insofar as it conflates Judaism and its followers with the State of Israel. Not all Jews are Israeli, and not all Israelis are Jews.   And what are we to make of Netanyahu telling European Jews they can only be safe in Israel, and then turning around to tell the world that Israel faces an  existential threat from Iran? What kind of person wold say those things and be allowed to continue in office?   Who would invite his co-religionists to effectively commit suicide by moving to a state under existential threat, in the interests of safety!?
Arabs gave the world the number system. Jews expelled from Spain for working with Muslim Moors. Muslim world took in these Jews Sephardic and they settled in North Africa and Turkey. Muslim religion Jewish religion very close in many ideas both from Mid east Arabia.
Racists are racists. They are in all provinces. The excuses though are mind boggling when it's from the left. Typically, it runs the line of "we need a strict separation of church and state". Wearing a turban is a part of his culture, as is his spiritual beliefs. Who are you to judge? As an atheist, I really don't like it when atheists start shoving our beliefs down others' throats, just like how I don't like it when others try to force me to convert to their religion.
American evangelicals, oddly, seem to love people getting killed.  But only after they're born, of course.
If you read current news coming from India the situation is getting worst thanks to ascendance of Hindu nationalism, western Indian states like Gujrat and Maharastra ruled by Hindu nationalists are now leading the gender inequality ratio in the nation, basically killing millions of girl child’s. Men are not finding brides so they try to smuggled women from poorer states or poor countries like Nepal. No wonder India nowadays a lot more in news for gang rapes of women in major cities than in areas of  any human development activities.
Yup, in your obsession with Muslims you've proved  some of their ancient texts are as hostile to gays as is the  Old Testament, the basis of the Judeo-Christian  moral code.  Fortunately, the majority of American Christians, Jews, and Muslims have moved beyond this level of tribal hatreds and have shown  great sympathy for the 50 dead--   THAT is the solution here- how about you? https://webmail.uoregon.edu/?_task=mail&_caps=pdf%3D0%2Cflash%3D1%2Ctif%3D0&_uid=34469&_mbox=INBOX&_safe=1&_action=show
No one is expecting you to diss the Pope. The point is that when Protestants and atheists start praising the Pope the suspicion amongst Catholics is that he must be doing or saying something wrong.
I don't care what most "atheists" do, I asked you to describe the system of faith and worship of an atheist.  Please present your evidence.
Some said the same about a Jews in the 1930s and look where that got us. You do understand that Muslim and terrorist are not synonymous, right?
As long as he doesn't watch it, he can say: Still haven't actually seen video of the "Jews will not replace us" thing. Sounds like an urban legend. Willful ignorance.
Since the Palestinian Arabs consider all of Israel to be "occupied territory" and fundamentally reject Israel's existence, Israel is entitled to proceed with building in Jerusalem, the historic Jewish capital to which the Jews yearned to return for 1,900 years. The Palestinian Arabs think that if they continue their rejectionism they will do better; they need to learn that the longer they continue, the worse they do. They could have had a state in 1948, 1967, any time in between, or in 2000, 2008 and many other occasions when they were offered one. But they don't want a state next to Israel; they only want a state if they can destroy Israel. And given the "success" of all neighbouring Arab countries in running peaceful democratic states with civil rights and human rights, a "Palestine" would be the same or worse.  Jerusalem and Palestine were ignored backwaters until the Jews began returning in large numbers and rebuilt the country from neglect, desert and swamp into what's there now.
A Christian cannot become president in any Arab or Muslim country, except for Lebanon. Hey, non-Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus, etc, are not even allowed in Mecca. Egypt did have a Christian prime minister, Boutros Ghali, 1908 to 1910. I reckon it would next to impossible for this to happen now. This simple fact is only one indication of the drop in religious tolerance across the region.
He was 'constrained' by his culture.  For instance, he was a practicing Jew (altho' not always a good one).  He operated (almost always) within the structure of the Jewish religion.  Jesus was not a Christian.  (Hate to break it to you.  :-)  )
all the irrelevant stuff - it's...not relevant.."Really pathetic to hear about people blowing money on religious propaganda for the most dominant mythology in the country. Bronze age zombie jew! Like we havent all had this bs drilled into us from our youngest age."   probably wise to tone down the "drama" for this second response...credibility and all.   "And bronze age zombie jew- welp, those are just facts. Except zombies aren’t real!".... so they're not the facts? congratulations.  I have no idea what you studied....I can probably eliminate some things.... and all the best in getting your loans paid off.
U need to be pro industrial military complex, Pro Jewish state, Anti-Russian, Pro-Dictators in Saudi Arabia. Against any right wing parties in Poland, Hungary etc. Then u get the Job....
Answer this one: Originally stated that 6m Jews were gassed. (No one was gassed, by the way). Then on proof to the contrary, revised down to 4.5m. The on further objection revised to 1.6m. Latest claimed to be about 900k, which is still disputed. The downwards revision was done by the Jews.
I'm afraid you miss the point. It's not "minimal" this compared to "that". It's not a scale of misfortune, whereby so many Hindus or Pakistani died here, are more or less worth than the Palestinians who died there,   In their zeal to create the State of Israel, the Zionists did some horrible things, and the State of Israel continues to do horrible things, to the Palestinians who were there already..   This isn't about how many losses are acceptable to achieve self-determination. It's about justice, and, dare I say it, reconciliation.
No there is Palestinian land as geographic area only.However there is no political entity with the name "Palestinian land". We call people who live there  Jews, Arabs, Armenians, Druzs and others - people of Palestine. Other arguments in your comment are absolutely right.
3 of my comments have been removed. All for simply saying nobody is threatening to bomb Jews. The call came from inside the building.   Dont fall for these lies people. Its not true.
Yeah but liberal NCR Catholics think the kind of public witness the Mormons do, if done by Catholics is a bad thing and we should all just dialogue with everyone.
Benjamin Disraeli converted to Anglicanism when he was 12.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli  When an MP made fun of his Jewish origins, his response was - Yes, I am a Jew, and when the ancestors of the right honorable gentleman were brutal savages in an unknown island, mine were priests in the temple of Solomon.
Or what happens say if a Baptist baker refuses to make a cake for a Catholic because they truly believe that theirs is the one true religion? Or refuses to make a cake for a Jewish wedding? I agree, if they are going to discriminate for a gay wedding, then they better have the ten commandments posted and a checklist that each couple must complete. And a sign that says, " No cake for you" if you .........
"If a Catholic wears a crucifix or a Jew a yarmulke, is that a "public declaration of faith?"  The yarmulke is, the crucifix, if it is a small jewelry on a chain around the neck, is ambiguous. Because the latter is often worn simply as jewelry, because people think it is pretty, by people who are not religious. I am tempted to do so myself, but refrain because I do believe it would be misleading as to my religious beliefs. Not everyone feels that way.  As long as it is small and discreet, I don't mind too much, but I admit it does bother me, because I don't think it is a good thing to conspicuously display your religious identity, whatever that is. Nuns and priests who display large crosses are of course doing so deliberately, it is their job.  It is a good thing we got away from that kind of sectarianism. It says, "I am not one of YOU,"  to anyone who does not share that identity. That is not conducive to harmonious social relations. Such sectarian identities are better muted imo.
So while those of us who have attempted to not insult any specific Asian indigenous group through incorrect assumption about their tribal affiliation and thus have generalized, in reference to use of 'Oriental' vs. 'Occidental' it would seem we're about half a world away; when using politically correct terms and not considering the geography and 'real politik' instead.  When did people become so thin skinned about who they are? I recollect some distant relatives whose family path was through Utah and when they arrived in small town Alaska, the locals slurred them, told them, 'go back where you came from'. Said they were 'd**m Mormons' even though "not" was the reason why the family moved from Utah.   Decades later, some mixed tribal person started a 'hate-rant' against them, but they weren't moving back to Utah. Discrimination is why people attempt to find a neutral place to live. Or carve one out of another's territory.   Not unlike those 'asexual' persons being called gay.
I wonder how Henein feels about  Iqra Khalid’s M-103? She is renowned as one of the best in her field so perhaps she can she some light on the issues of criminalizing criticism of religion? Of course there are similar laws in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, beacons of free expression and liberal thought.  In Europe, cartoonists need safe rooms and 24 hour armed guards if they address certain sacred cows. I suppose we should censor the creators of South Park and Family Guy for their regular satires of Jews and Christians? But it's not politically correct to discuss the double standard of how certain religions are off-limits to satire and comedy while others are fair game. How do we draw the line with M-103? We'd certainly have to censor Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. Oh well, Europe clearly hasn't had any issues defending artistic freedoms for satirists and artists... with M-103, I guess certain religions are beyond reproach
Some of these incidents could be hoaxes. Here's a website that actually tracks some of them, http://fakehatecrimes.org/. I remember an incident where a Jewish girl painted swastikas on her dormitory door, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_bK7eW_3v0. Here's a recent example, https://tinyurl.com/jd4mwg5 Agendas can vary at times and some are no doubt spooks for the gov't (or *a* gov't) but in general there's big money to be made for "anti-racist," "anti-hate" watchdog groups - think SPLC, the ADL and PRA - who use McCarthy-like witch-hunt tactics of "links" and "ties" and "guilt by association."  Laird Wilcox was on to this decades ago. His extensive work is archived in the Kenneth Spencer Research Library at the University of Kansas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3nrb69Wr3o. See his well-researched piece, Crying Wolf: Hate Crime Hoaxes in America, http://www.fakehatecrimes.org/Crying-Wolf-by-Laird-Wilcox.pdf. and his book on extremist groups co-authored by late professor, John George.
I have lived in 3 Arab countries, and have a much better sense of what drives the Arab-Israeli conflict. If it wasn't for the Palestinian issue, 99 percent of Arabs would care about the Jews. It is Europe that has been the center of anti-semitism for two thousand years.
Robb Myers, the Bible tells a different story.  When Moses brought the commandments down from Mt. Sinai, he created/God created (depending on your views) a Theocracy.  The Torah was a religious document, but it was also the law.  Jesus made a new covenant with the people, which replaced the laws of Moses.  Jesus spoke against the Sadducees and the Pharisees, which ran the legal system of Jewish communities, even under Roman rule.  He was very political.  He was, in essence, a legislator leading a grass-roots, political revolution, since in his Judaic world, religion and politics were one and the same.
They say St. Mark, an apostle of Jesus, started the Coptic Christian church in Egypt around 42 AD. It is probably the oldest Christian church in the world.   Islam didn't start until around 630 AD.
I am not interested in  a Jewish or Muslim theologian's incorrect view on the resurrection, since they obviously don't believe in the event.   We are on a Catholic website, are we not, albeit a very misguided one.  Your responses remind me of a trial lawyer, trying to get a guilty defendant off of a criminal charge, always ambiguous and never crystal clear.
"the new authority given to U.S. preclearance officers could lead to problems for Muslim-Canadian travellers. "   Really? how? It also could lead to problems for Mormon, Lutheran, Anglican, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Atheists if these other Superstitious Canadians involve themselves with or have links with criminal activity or hostility against the US.
-and cancelled a planned visit by Ukraine’s prime minister; -Netanyahu also said Saturday he would cut off 30 million shekels (US$7.9 million) in funding to UN institutions. - as soon as Netanyahu takes sanctions against humanitarian organizations of the United Nations in the territory of Israel;  -stop all cooperation with the Palestinians on civil cases (while maintaining security cooperation); ...and I say; (and Paf !) “Israel urges Jews to leave...CANADA !” lashing out at countries that backed UN resolution* of December 2016  witch is by the way the same “resolutions” of the International BDS** ! How so ?  *UN resolution; (frustrated by 50 years of fruitless diplomatic efforts, get it ?) The resolution adopted Friday urges Israel to  "stop IMMEDIATELY and COMPLETELY all settlement activity in occupied  Palestinian territory, INCLUDING Jerusalem –  is", claiming that the Israeli settlements "have no legal value"  and are "dangerous for the viability of a two-State solution."
Link to Jones clip?  The SPLC site says:  "refers to the alleged "Jewish origins of bolshevism, Jewish dominance of Hollywood and the media, [and] Jewish control of Congress."  Which of those statements is not factually correct?  Ever ask yourself WHO insisted you believe that "Nazism is evil," and WHEN did that happen?  SPLC labels Catholics evil bcz critical of Jews;  says readers should be sympathetic toward "Jews" and reject Catholics who are critical of Jews.   What if, for example, "Iranian" is substituted for "Jews" in each of the 68 times "Jew" appears on that SPLC page; or "anti-Iranian bigotry" substituted for each of the 41 times "anti-semitic" is used?  Would you still be so angry and still have "Croesus 'pegged', Neko?  Are Iranians not entitled to be defended and their human rights and sovereignty protected?  Are Catholics forbidden to hold and speak opinions critical of Jews, or anyone else? Muslims?  Why are "Jews" entitled to special treatment but Catholics aren't?
RonsterG: I agree that all three "desert" religions are equally misogynous.  I am not sufficiently knowledgeable about other religions to make that claim.  Interesting that you specifically note Catholicism and fundamental Judaism to make your point.  Was that just to add a counterpoint to the constant drumbeat about the treatment of women in Muslim societies?
I don't for a minute believe that more than a handful of those priests joined the seminary just to get their hands on children (why not take a much quicker and easier route, and join the boy scouts?) And they abused the kids after dedicating their lives to god, and their superiors (also supposedly holy men) covered up for them for years. That makes the church evil in my opinion. And yes, communism was a terrible crime against humanity, but the vast majority of those millions you talk about were not killed in the name of atheism, but rather because of Stalin's paranoia (the purges of the 1930s) or because they were dissidents and a danger to the regime. It had little to do with atheism (although communists were atheists) and more to do with protecting the leaders' hold on power. As for your final example, those being persecuted for their religion across the world are being persecuted by other religions, not by atheists, which kind of proves my point about religion being offensive!
I want to both agree and disagree with some of what both brothers say. I agree with Ivo that I also believe there is no God - I'm an atheist.  But in support of the brother Onne I want to draw on the inspiration of Alain de Botton in "Religion for Atheists.  From www-archive.biblesociety.org.au/news/review-religion-for-atheists I quote the following: "De Botton draws on the Old Testament book of Job as a means of contemplating our own insignificance in the face of the size and mystery of the universe and the awesome fact of existence. He argues for a secular space where we are able to meditate on our smallness and avert the sense that we are the psychological center of all things and the masters of our destinies. De Botton laments the tendency of modern life to trample on the rhythms of the earth, to deny death and shy away from the harsh edges of reality."  Non-believers can learn a lot from religion, without having to give up atheism.
(...CONTINUED FROM ABOVE)  How you twisted this around to my saying ALL JEWS committed war crimes is incomprehensible according to any logic other than that which passes for your own.  Both the bible and Qur’an warn that entire NATIONS will be held to account for their crimes on the Day of Judgment, but that those who opposed, resisted and denounced those crimes may be absolved of them.  As al-Qur’an clearly states:  “…to them what they have earned, and to you what you have earned.  And you will not be questioned concerning their deeds (on the Day of Judgment).”—Sura Baqara 141.  So however you chose to misinterpret what I said, you can see that according to the dictates of my own Scripture I wasn’t attributing the crimes of a (relative) few to an entire people—ANY people.  You said: "Simple fact is, Jewish people have inhabited that region since the dawn of history."  It may be “simple”, but it’s certainly not fact.  (CONTINUED BELOW...)
Richard, Apartheid is a political system.  The Palestinians have a political system and it can most definitely be classified as Apartheid.  Firsts read this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_law  Notice Article 4 section 2: The principles of Islamic Shari'a shall be the main source of legislation.  Jews are not treated equally under the law in Palestine.  Instead they are kept separate under the law... they are are separated... they are apart.  It's apartheid.  Weather you choose to call this type of discrimination Apartheid or some other equally horrific synonym is irrelevant.
No, Jesus was following the Jewish Law. Look up the requirements for a condemnation and stoning for adultery.  Jesus could say to anyone but his mother "sin no more".
The antifa stuff isn't true, but he was a member of an anti-Trump group, and seemed to harbor a lot of anti-religious views according to classmates and his "likes" on facebook.  He was a member of at least 2 atheist groups.  The case looks to be an insane case of domestic violence that spilled over onto innocent people, but I can't help but think he was emboldened by this "anti Trump" political climate. The media is always talking about how desperate things are, and you have groups promising to "resist" the "fascist" "regime."  While I know that these are weak people, spewing empty words, how many people like this might get caught up in the rhetoric?  We're living in some dangerous times...
Jews have fundamental problem and that is democracy. It is based on equality and if they accept it they will be quickly overrun by Palestinians and other nations over there. They will simply be lost in the sea of others. Democracy has no answer for that kind of situation and therefore all tools politicians have will not help resolve that.  Fundamentally new thinking is needed if they ever want to live in peace.  Democracy means ruling of majority and respect to minority. That is just an  illusion since human race is simply not at that level of development, so majority, or who ever has the power, simply cannot care less about  minority when push comes to shove. So, nobody wants really to be a minority no mater what propaganda says. Until that real and true answer is found peace is an illusion and will remain to be for future to come.
In plan terms can you tell me what you think that Israel, or maybe you believe the Jewish people, want?  What is their goal?   Please understand that I don't have a strong bias for Israeli interest.   I have had a friend stay many months in Palestinian refugee camps and who told of the fear and very real harm they suffer at the hands of Israel. I can also site violence in coming from Palestinian sources  but I'm not making them equivalent.   Clearly power heavily favors Israel,  I don't think Israel has genocide in mind or they would have done it long ago.  I do believe there are many forces at work in the international field of play, much of which remain unknown or misunderstood by the majority of us.    I also know there are authors who live on creating conspiracies on very thin evidence and a lot of bias.  Thanks for the reading suggestions, it's not a topic that's high on my interest list, but always glad to read your work.
Interment of the dead is a practice that is at least 100,000 years old, possibly older.  Perhaps it began as a hope that human life would echo the pattern of the natural world in the vegetative cycle (a motif we still use to explain our modern spirituality: "unless a grain of wheat falls to the earth and dies...") or the natural world of animal reproduction where the earth is identified with the womb (a motif we also still use to explain our modern spirituality: born again).  There are other dignified methods of treating dead bodies w/respect-some of great antiquity.Consider the urnfield culture which practiced cremation and interment of the ashes -which the CDF recommends. Stripping the bones and consuming the flesh of the dead. Sky burial. Maybe even Freeze Drying? Is it just a quirk of history that the Jews of Jesus's time practiced burial? Would our story, practice,& belief be different if they practiced cremation and scattering, and Jesus rose from the ashes rather than the tomb?
Image if the Jews ran Yemen, Lebanon and Egypt; people would go there for vacation or to retire like Miami, : good food,  4 star hotels, nice beaches, and malls with lots of wholesale shopping. There would even be a golf course or two. (Watch out for the sand trap. it's a doozie heh heh) But for Islam, that is not to be.
Islamaphobia is a left wing term created to imply systemic racism.  Notice in M103 that they also use the term Islamaphobia and imply that it is systemic therefore legislating guilt onto Canada.  This now paves the way for Social Justice Warriors to vent their outrage and demand that their left agendas be met without even an attempt to resist.  There is no such thing as Islamaphobia.  People may know little or perhaps even know a great deal about Islam but, what the left wants to do is force you to like it.  The mere fact that you might even think that Islam is not what it claims to be (The religion of peace) opens you to their vitreous attacks.  They make complex issues out of what is really quite simple.  Would you accept the doctrine of a warlord-pedophile who talks to angels, believes that he has the final word of god, wants to kill atheists, homosexuals and anyone who either leaves or turns their back on Islam?  If the answer is no then you don't have to like or accept Islam.
Jewish priests were MARRIED.  John the Baptist's father, a Jewish priest, certainly was.  You don't know WHAT Jesus did before his public ministry began.  He could have been a Widower.  The Gospels don't include any information about marriage.  But Jewish customs have Jewish parents securing a wife for their sons between their seventeenth and nineteenth birthdays.  That was a DUTY of Jewish parents.  Mary and Joseph followed Jewish Law in everything else---why not here?   Jesus never, never, never, called himself a PRIEST.  The church tagged him with this title. He was of the tribe of Judah, of the House of David [kings], but he was NOT a Levite nor was he of the House of Aaron.
No Christian says "The Messiah is the son of Allah."   No Jews say "Ezra is the son of Allah."  Jesus Christ said, "I am the Way, the Truth and the Life, no man cometh to the Father but by me."
Majority of Hindu nationalist support Trump. Google those words.
Young men radicalized. A radical Mormon will leave you a book. A  radical Buddhist will meditate on universal harmony A Radical Catholic will pray for you soul  A radical Protestant won't talk to you A radical Hindu will burn incense A racial Muslim will...well just read any newspaper on earth. .
It is not the act of leaving or removing statues that's the issue. It the motives and beliefs behind the acts. In that sense, ones who want the Lee statue remaining in place share the same hateful ideology as the terrorist groups that want to destroy symbols opposed to their views. Hate is not about leaving or destroying physical structures, it's all about willingness to kill another human being to promote one's hateful agenda. Hate is about believing Jews and Blacks or any other groups needing to be exterminated or subjugated to your rule.
technically the bar was not against Jews since Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists would have also been prevented from taking the oath   but somehow this particular argument   has been conflated to  a bar just against Jews   as Canadians we were all required  to say the Lord's prayer in public school  right until the 80s (85 to be exact)  people could choose not to participate if they so wished  so this whole "equivalent to" argument gets you nowhere since opting out is always an option  the real issue is whether a person who graduates from this school can uphold the law without recrimination or prejudice  assuming they have passed the bar ..... a lawyer is a lawyer a lawyer  whether they are christian, muslim, jewish or atheist
Just as Jewish groups woke up to the festering Jew hatred of the 1930's albeit too late, it won't be long before Jewish groups come into the fore to resist the current tidal wave of Jew hatred, and it won't be pretty.
Jesus was great at turning the tables on his enemies.  In John 8:2-11, the scribes and Pharisees think they have come up with the perfect trap.  Jesus would either have to either abandon his teaching on forgiveness and have a woman caught in adultery stoned to death [according to the Law of Moses---the Canon Law of Israel], or set himself up as being above the law.  With one amazing sentence, Jesus redefines the game.  The focus moves away from the woman and onto the accusers, who cannot deny that they, too, are guilty of sin.  The humbled Jewish religious leaders leave in silence.  Bishops are often too quick to notice the sins of others, while minimizing their own guilt [which often they don't even acknowledge].  Jesus tenderly dealt with the woman, whose dignity and reputation had been trampled upon.  But this bishop has not respected the baptized dignity of those in the LGBT community.  He acts like a Pharasee, who law is his god.
untrue. there is nothing defiled in either the jewish or Christian scripture. your founder claimed many things- who bears witness they are true?  who bears witness to his statements? Gabriel, the angel of God? God would not have him refute himself. as far as debating with you, the Lord Himself said to those that witness to wipe the dust from our feet when faced with those that would not accept Truth.
Congress is made up of mostly old KKK Christians.  White House has there's too.  They call themselves gods. Its always been that way and it will always be that way.  Mazie and Colleen, and other Asians are few wealthy Buddhists who has to vote with their party line or else get punished.
not really, fact is atheist dont reproduce and radical muslims, Jews, Hindus  and christians do. More religious u are the more u reproduce just look at Israeli and Saudi Arabia compared to secular non religious Denmark............
Right; and my neighbors I grew up with that survived the camps were in on the conspiracy.  They weren't even jewish; both Christians who opposed the regime.  They watched their friends disappear month after month at these camps; but you are so sure they are lying.   Their pictures of the camps they took when they went back 40 years later are all fake; right? Oh; and their parents were killed on kristallnacht defending a storefront.... they are just in hiding since 1938.  Bobby Groth; stop lying to yourself.
So it is ok to target jews in North America if one doesn't agree with Israeli policies?  You are confirming then that anti zionism is synonymous with anti semitism.  Who is more likely to target jews if they don't approve of Israeli policies.. the right or the left?
M-103 has been very enlightening. Even more clearly than did the murders in Quebec, it's revealed the degree of Islamophobia in Canada. Richard Roskell ----------------- ask why Islamophobia and not Sikh-phobia,  Hindu - phobia? Buddhist phobia?  what is the Root cause?  Could it be something to do with lack of integration, assimilation, too much accommodation?  it is not so one sided
This is a highly charged topic. It seems inappropriate for the school to invite just anti-abortion groups to present. Students should be developing their critical thinking skills in High School - not dogma from extremist groups.  As for equating abortion to the death camps that is red meat to anti-abortion extremists. A doctor who conducts and abortion procedure is not a Nazi killing Jews. And a pregnant teenager having an abortion is not comparable either.
There was a "golden age" of the Moors in Spain, yes, but it didn't last. By the 11th century, the Almoravids and the Almohads had destroyed it, and the Jews and Christians were forced to convert or emigrate.  The Spanish and the Portuguese were particularly violent conquerors, yes, but they also were reacting to the previous Moorish conquest. It was a time of conquests back and forth, with civilisations basing their identities on religion, a bad idea that transformed ordinary conquest into religious wars.  The overseas colonial conquests started...The Christians killed more because they had access to more overseas territory,if the Muslims had gotten there first, it would probably have been them.  The new movie Silence depicts another religious conflict, this time the Japanese reaction to Christian missionaries, and that turned bloody too. The Japanese were not welcoming of new religions...
"Police have identified the 22-year-old terrorist suspect: Paul Heatherington Smith, a devout Quaker and a fanatical supporter of Jimmy Carter. When his home was raided early this morning posters of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela were found in his bedroom, along with several copies of the Buddhist Sutras. A video recording was also recovered in which Smith declares his intention to join Doctors Without Borders."
Why do you perceive an attack when all you’ve been asked is simple questions?  I do notice that in your disdain for replies you avoid the issues.  From my reply it is obvious I would like to know that, as a non-believer, on what do you base the assertion that “Jesus was born a Jew, lived as a Jew and died as a Jew. His apostles, disciples and all his followers were Jews and never left the Jewish faith. Jesus would not even have known what the Catholic religion was.”?  Have you had some bad experience growing up with people who identified themselves as Catholics?  Do you have some reason to think that saying such a thing to a believer will lead to a positive outcome for you?  If so, what benefit would that be?  Are you familiar enough with the sacred texts of those whose beliefs you attack to explain what they mean and from whence they came?  Take your time ... we have basically forever for you to answer.
The slur that "The church was aligned with Hitler" has been debunked so many times by Catholics, Protestants, Jews, in media, on television, in books, in articles that even repeating the slur pegs one as at the very best poorly informed.
So let me get this straight: the WH wants to avoid overhyping the Jewish people in its definition of the Holocaust? Out of respect for diversity? Okaaaaaaaaay.   I would like to know the reason too, Neko.
Incredibly easy thing. Simply put the word "atheist" in a headline, and stand back and watch the maelstrom rage.
In the United States, the richest and most powerful supporters of the Democratic Party have been Jewish Americans. The Republicans are well aware that if they sway the support of the Jews, they can dominate the Democrats for generations. This is why they are very pro Israel.  Donald Trump is torn between different goals. He can support the hawkish Netanyahu government but that would further devastate America's relationship with the world's Muslim community. The moderates in the State department are trying to rein him in.  I've noticed that there has been a shift in the attitude to Israel and the Palestinians. Decades ago, the Palestinians were invisible to North Americans and nobody cared about them. Nowadays, most people agree that they exist and they deserve some form of fair treatment.
If you are an atheist then you don't have any spiritual beliefs.
As an atheist I do not have to hedge my bets in the afterlife. I live my life knowing that all people, Christians included, are atheists. Some of us just take it one god further.
I can't decide if this is satire or not. If it was satire then the target is those who equate Texans with Nazi's. If THEY are equating drowning Texans with Nazi's then it is editorializing at it's most vicious. But they are free to do either, and people will believe what they want to believe, as usual. They wanted attention and they got it. Now how about a clever cover about all those "peaceful Buddhists" in Myanmar engaging in genocide of Royhingya Muslims. THAT would take some courage.
Hitler's fascist movement in Germany was founded on the delusion  they were the victims of the Jews and International Zionism.  Because he played  the "victim" so well, they came to believe no degree of revenge, no matter how horrific was sufficient to punish the Jews for what he had to suffer. In post-modern politics left wing Antifascists and anarchists call themselves "victims", and believe  there is no limit to the violence they have a right to use against their enemies, who are simply the rest of society.  The Antifascists are fascists; they just have an ironic and deliberately deceptive name.   PS This does not violate Godwin's Law.
Trump will give special consideration for Christians. Jews are on their own.
Not accurate. Bernie Sanders may very well be President today if the Clinton camp hadn't played dirty. Bernie Sanders had his Bar Mitzvah at 13. His first marriage was to a Jewish woman from a prominent Baltimore family. Just because he fathered a son from his Christian girlfriend and then married a Catholic doesn't make him any less of a Jew.
IN 1900, Jews made up 8% of the population in greater Palestine (Israel, Gaza & West Bank).  The Palestinians just want to live in the homes their fathers and grandfathers were ethnically cleansed from.   It is bigoted beyond belief to claim that the Palestinians do not deserve "self determination" because Yemenis have a state.  Palestinians are not Yemenis.  In fact Palestinians have been genetically tested and the results connect them to biblical Jews.
I've heard that one before "I have a lot of Jewish/Black, etc. etc. friends. " And they are almost as good as 'real' people"  is the sub-text.  "Shanty Irish" and "Lace Curtain Irish"  equals the "N-word".    Pure Bigotry.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lace_curtain_and_shanty_Irish
Jay you must believe that the ME would give  respect to Trump becasue he is male.  Considering how most of the ME is anti American I doubt Trump would get any more acceptance than Clinton. However, Clinton would not pout; then get on her plane and go home. Donald indicated he would never allow any country to treat him the way they did Obama so he would just leave and not attend any meeting in his reaction to being treated badly. You've picked a bad talking  point to use in support of Trump.  NOTE: many of those same countries would not accept: a Jew, a christian, a American or, anyone not of the same sect with the same level of disrespect.  Its  a cultural thing you'll never comprehend.
Unlike many, I've actually been to Burma (now called Myanmar) a number of times.  The level of hatred by the Buddhist majority (88% of the population) against the Rohingya is unparalleled in the universe. There is no chance the Buddhists will ever allow the Rohingya to live in peace, and the Rohingya can't stand up for themselves as they represent only 4.3% of the population.  Once the Rohingya are gone (either killed, or fled) the Buddhists will start in on other groups like the Christians (6.2% of the population) and the Hindus (0.5% of the population) and other minorities.  The Burmese Buddhists just don't want anyone else there. Full stop.  Burmese State Counselor Aung Sung Suu Kyii has little power there and she has even less power over the Burmese military. If she speaks out too loudly, she'll simply disappear and no one will ever see her again. The West should stop pissing on her, as she can still facilitate some matters for aid organizations working in the country.  Cheers! JBS
Kpare,   Clearly you disagree, so please illustrate why.  If you are an atheist, should you not be open to a spirited scientific debate about your belief system?  Also, please note I have provided my working definition of religion in another post.
You oppose "thought-through ideas"?  "And in particular I agree that accepting Syrian refugees doesn't solve any problem" It solves the problem of the refugees being killed by their government.  We turned back a ship full of jewish children back in the 30s.  They all died in the camps.  Their return didn't do Germany any good.   I agree driving out a large portion of your nation's population by trying to kill them is bad for the economy and social infrastructure, but then we aren't doing anything to address Assad's actions, and our current president seems to want to cozy up to the people supplying Assad with tools for killing his people.  I don't see how denying those people a refuge helps the country that will kill them if they are forced to return.
Bravo Julie! It does not matter what branch of a religious faith a person identifies him- or herself with - and it does not matter whether this faith claims to be very peaceful, very humane... it's still about medieval fears, a hate (hidden or open) to other faiths - especially to atheists (we are always a target). Our world would have been a much better place if not religions and religious wars. We are in the XXI century, we know what drives the Universe and a gene in our bodies ... enough is enough ... we really have to pronounce things clearly and unambiguously... and if someone gets offended, let him or her think what good their faith has brought to people on the long run.
Interesting how MSW will often link to jews such as Mark Silk who criticize the Church on a regular basis, I guess this isn't a problem, nor are the non-Catholics here at NcR, who use this platform to try to destroy the Church. MSW it seems lacks principles
I had the pleasure of working in the health field where diversity was just a given. I've got friends who, although full Canadian citizens, are Sikh, Hindu, Muslim (Sunni, Ismaili and Shiite), Jewish, and everything in between. None of them has ever tried to convert me or even get me interested in their beliefs, other than explain to me what the background was to some religious holiday when they seemed to be celebrating some event. Some Christians (and only a minority, but a vocal one), on the other hand, have hounded me about my religion (more accurately, my lack of religious beliefs) and some of them have hounded me so much that I finally had to tell them to stop pestering me. I'm just saying...
JimmyJ:  We all need to speak-up against and to stand-up to the hateful rhetoric and actions of the ault-right, the white supremacists and the white-nationalists.  Simply "ignoring" them is to give tacit approval to their actions.   As Martin Niemöller so famously put it:      First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a Socialist.      Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a trade unionist.      Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out — because I was not a Jew.      Then they came for me — and there was no one left to speak for me.  At the same time, we, as well, need to condemn any violence from the fringe left.  the Antifa as the most obvious example.  Gary Crum   BTW: here's a good link on this issue....http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/14/us/what-is-antifa-trnd/index.html
Priesthood is a call to servant-leadership.  It is a call to both serve and lead.  Women's ordination is not an attempt at power-grabbing.  Why do (some) men feel that priesthood cannot be shared?  Surely, they're not worried that they'll no longer be able to serve?  Are they worried they'll no longer be able to lead?  Why are they so scared? Jesus called followers.  Some of them were apostles (those "sent out").  Most of them were disciples.  None of them (at least initially) were priests.  Jesus ordained no priests.  There were plenty of fully functioning priests in His devoutly followed Judaism.  Priesthood as we now know it is a construct of sacrificial ritual and administrative duties.  Nothing a priest does requires male genitalia.  The institutional church is committing the sin of sexism by denying half its members all seven of the Seven Sacraments.  Please don't try to blame Jesus for that.
This is true, but that's not why President Putin has an almost Buddhistic calm pervading his public appearances.  Here's why:  He's rich-rich-rich beyond our wildest imaginings. He's politically untouchable. Every oligarch in Russia bows at his feet. His public image is honed to a degree that makes God envious. He owns Patriarch Kirill lock, stock, and barrel, and--by extension--every Orthodox believer in Russia and every Russian Orthodox believer overseas. He faces no challenge to his absolute control and domination of the Russian government. None. He never will. Prevailing winds blow west to east, and North Korea is really, really far to the east. No nuclear fallout will touch anything precious to him.  and, most of all...  He now owns and controls both the President of the USA, and the People of the USA (by manipulating their public opinion). Democracy in the USA is his to manipulate, just like Russia's.  Why wouldn't he be calm?  Not bad for an old KGB spook. Not bad at all!
You must be a socialist because the typical socialist mentality is to blame the victims. In this case you simply create your American Strawman to burn in evil effigy to support your fantasy argument. Hitler took this same approach to make the Jews appear as evil to justify their wholesale destruction and murder.
No-one would hold it against her what her grandfather did so long ago. ==================== Really? And why so? Because she is not anti-Jew but only anti Russian?
Trying to fit complicated, nuanced, emotionally charged, broad perspective ideas is difficult in such a limited space.  I should of labeled Israel as a race-based apartheid state with religion strongly influencing the political system. Both Jews and Arabs are semites, Jerry. Ask any of the Palestinians how free they are in East Jerusalem, the West bank, or in the gulag of Gaza. Shalom through justice and equality.
Dogon60,  I'm sure you're right that we probably agree on much more than we disagree.  The argument wasn't really intended to be focused on semantics so much as I think it is important for atheists to acknowledge that science simply cannot confirm nor deny the existence of God/gods.  It is only when atheists claim that science or rationality actually proves God/gods doesn't/don't exist that I am compelled to regard atheism as a religion.  Sadly, however, this fallacy occurs very frequently within atheist arguments.  Though, to be fair, their are also some equally fallacious arguments stemming from intelligent designers who are now also claiming that science proves the existence of God.  I promise you that I am equally, if not more harsh on intelligent designers in this regard.  :-)  Cheers
The numbers game is rather obscene. Let's just say that the demonization and taboo-ization of homosexuality has had deeply deleterious effects, very comparable to those produced by an equally mistaken and hateful church discourse on Jews. As to stds, don't forget that in absolute terms the humber of non-homosexuals who have died from them is vast -- consider the death toll from syphilis historically, or from Aids worldwide today.
And what else would you expect in a western society whose culture developed based on 2000 years of Christianity?  Would you be shocked to learn that Middle East societies are steeped in a Muslim ethos and Islam is the assumed normal, or that East Asia is steeped in a Buddhist ethos, or India in a Hindu ethos, etc.? Of course their cultures reflect their history.  And just what is wrong with that?  But culture, while heavily influenced by religion, is not religion.
Edith Stein was deported to Auschwitz because she was a Jew. A martyr must be killed "in odium Christi" -- in hatred of Christ. Under that definition, Stein was no martyr.
It would be difficult to find anything remotely accurate in this bizarre, rambling diatribe against Israel, but I will restrict myself to the following points:  The myth of Arab Muslim victimhood is cheap propaganda stemming from the failed Arab attempts to destroy Israel, and drive its Jewish population "into the sea."  The anti-Israel left continues to pander to the irrational, bigoted demands of the Middle East's Arab Muslim majority to suppress the region's only non-Muslim state, in favor of yet another Arab Muslim country.  That blatant disregard for the rights of anyone who is not an Arab Muslim is precisely the reason why the Jews of Israel had to fight for national independence.   The mere existence of Israel proclaims the national rights of the Jewish INDIGENOUS population of Israel; a country and a people that predate Arab colonialism and will outlive it as well.
The 'silent' plaque has been removed according to a story in the Guardian. But, here's a phrase from this story "almost a million people, including 900,000 Jews, were murdered there."  "Including" is not the same as "almost all."  Lots of prissy squirming through these comments.
"How are either of these scenarios different?"  You don't know how they're different? Seriously? It's obvious.  Do Jewish or Muslim "food places" normally sell pork products? No. You can't force a business to sell a product they don't offer. It's nothing at all like a business refusing to sell their normal product that they sell to everyone else.  Designers aren't in a business of public accommodation. If you don't know what that is and why it matters, then that's probably why you don't understand this issue.
Yes, there were indeed some great prophets and leaders who were women, in pre-Exilic Israel. To Deborah and Miriam are attributed perhaps the oldest long texts in the OT. And Huldah has a major role in 2 Kings 22. After the Exile, though, when Judaism took off, that sort of thing stopped. Note how in Exodus, Miriam's role as author of the Song of the Sea, "YHWH is a man of war" (in fact quite masculinist, with an aesthetic related to that of both Mesopotamian poetry and Homer), which we sing at the Easter Vigil, was obscured, thanks to the post-Exilic recension of Torah.  Let's also note the stone of scandal you carefully lay in our path: "God has no gender" is fine, but "He has revealed Himself as the masculine principle," etc., is hardly a necessary interpretation, and betrays a lot of theological brainwork of a sort that calls for examination and questioning. I know it's not original with you, but anyway it's not very promising.
Gary, Since the VP is a politician, I think he is going to try and legislate as much of his beliefs as he can get away with; same as an agnostic, muslim, jew, atheist, whatever.  Its up to the rest of us to support/temper/stop that ability.
One thing I don't understand in Canada's support of Ukraine. Ukraine was made by Lenin and Stalin from Ukraine itself, parts of Russia, Poland, Romania and Hungary. At least five different cultures (and one more - jews), several languages. But Kiev says - one land, one nation, one language, speak Ukrainian or die. But in Canada, as far as I remember, there are more than one official language. I think Canadians should first put the end on their French separatism, make them all speak English or go to France, and only after they can support unity of the Ukraine.
Please find out the statistcs from the police data across the country. To give you some information. The hate crimes committed in Canada target the following;  Highest hate crimes committed are against jews which is 29%  and lower close to he bottom you have 11% hate crimes committed against muslims. As you can see, the real victims are the jews.
Great comment.  Examples where the imaginary 'alt-left' has threatened to kill black people and jews or anything similar?  Didn't think so.
The fact that Trump has some Jewish backers, son-in-law or whatever, does not excuse the racism he has inspired with his rhetoric. Unfortunately there are also Jewish racists and bigots, particularly against Arabs and Muslims,  who didn't learn from their own history. Nor does your post convince me that I should tolerate Nazis.
You are forgetting that the documents of Vatican II are  binding upon the Catholic church as much as the Council of Trent was binding upon the Church until  Vatican Council I [1869-70].    The Church MUST deal with the world in which it currently exists.  Jesus wasn't loved by all when he lived upon this earth.  Why would the Church expect to be treated better than it's Head?    The 'conversion of these souls' is not done by denigrating their religious faith.  Secondly, we have much more in common with these religions than we do with the 'so called Christians' who refuse to open their hearts to the Gospel of Christ and his call to conversion [conversion of conscience and heart].  Too many of these folks hold onto doctrines and practices [just like the Jewish Pharasees did at the time of Christ].  Instead of being enlivened and energized by the life of the Holy Spirit, the Catholicism/Christianity they offer to others is like dead leaves and sticks floating in dirty water.
As an atheist I despise all religions as artifacts that are inimical to human consciousness and wellbeing.  It is my right to think this and to say it, but Trudeau's pandering Bill M-103 would selectively impinge on those rights in defence of one particularly virulent denomination. It's wrongheaded and unacceptable.
All through the middle east Muslims have forced Christians and Jews and other minorities from their homes, burned their Churches and Synagogues and the UN and their 'human rights' bodies do nothing and say nothing.  Burma who is under attack from muslim rebels and terrorists say no.  They will not be subjected to the terrorism and violence that has followed wherever muslims go.  And they are pillared by the so called 'civilized' world.  We should be thanking and supporting them.
The slaughter of European Jewry began after WWII started; the ships carrying Jewish refugees were turned away from North American shores before WWII started, long before it was clear what the Nazis would do.
Yes, he did try to backpeddle from "There will be no Palestinian state on my watch", but the world knows better, and actions speak much louder than words.  The Palestinians, long ago, formally recognized Israel. Extremists like Netanyahu added the untenable "as the nation state of the Jewish people" in order to scuttle talks.
the Nazi and the Vichy French were involved with the killing of jews
Bottom line:  Foreign Jews had the same right to Palestine as Irish Catholics and Mexican atheists, i.e., none whatsoever. Therein lies the root of the conflict.
Please return to my original comment. I said that too many 'atheists' arrive at their belief by rejecting the beliefs of others. They don't start with a premise and build on that. Their world view is a negation of someone else's belief. That's the sense in which I use the term "negative."  If you're stuck on the way I worded my premise, by all means go with the Big Bang and physical causation. We're expressing the same thing I believe, but in different words.
"When his supporters start to be disillusioned, Rodrik fears Trump may react to any criticism by intensifying his identity politics. "  Of course he will. That's what fascist leaders always do when things go awry - scapegoat some unpopular group: Muslims, Mexicans, gays, you name it - whatever works. That way the (white) rubes who foolishly believed that Trump would save them from the "evils" that a Hillary Clinton presidency would bring won't have to look in the mirror and blame themselves when blaming an unpopular group is so much easier. Hitler had the Jews, Trump will have, well, we'll just have to wait and see. But mark my word, there will be scapegoats one way or another. Anything to avoid confronting the real truth: that the GOP is all about propping up the 1% at everyone else's expense and Trump is all about lining his own pockets with as much gold as he can possibly stuff inside them. The rubes were played for fools and we'll all have to suffer for it, some more than others.
Atheism is NOT a religion or a belief...it is the LACK of a belief in a supernatural, controlling power. Neither Stalin nor Mao killed in the name of Atheism...stop repeating that tired old lie. It was only when religious orthodoxy was overthrown that the modern world was possible...logic must always overrule blind faith and belief.
"Atheism is, in the broadest sense, the absence of belief in the existence of deities.  Less broadly, atheism is the rejection of belief that any deities exist.   In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities.  Atheism is contrasted with theism which, in its most general form, is the belief that at least one deity exists."  These are all unproven and unprovable 'beliefs'.     You have to 'believe' to be an atheist; you have to 'believe' to be a deist or a Hindu, or a Muslim etc.  Without this  'belief system' athiests' do not exist.
I would rather people choose science over religion too.  However, as long as Christians and Jews are given their days of prayer off completely, it's only fair that Muslims are accommodated during break time on Fridays.
Charles Darwin was a myth He never existed outside fairy tales This is my belief therefore It is Fact that shall NEVER be challenged. Yep I'm An Atheist.
You DID NOT say anything about JESUS [you sound like The DONALD---make facts up as you go along].  JESUS was not a priest---never called himself a priest.  Why would he? The Jewish priesthood was basically corrupt.  Secondly, Jesus KNEW and STATED that the Temple would be destroyed---and the Jewish priesthood would come to an end at that time, which it did.  Jesus had no intention replacing a corrupt system with an identical system.
READES: Alaska is known to be a diversified State. Meaning Cultural Diversity, Equality and each Individual's beliefs to support a religion or not is our own constitutional civil right as a Citizen. Americans use adultery with laws protecting it - and Muslims use Sharia that does prescribe harsh punishments for acts like adultery. "You shall not commit adultery" is one of the Ten Commandment yet most churches usually excuse that sin with forgiveness. Now, the Jew I know doesn't eat pig meat, bread, and has Saturday Sabbath. Yes, all these traveling immigrants are still coming to America and about the First People, we've always been here.
You are right Oftenconflicted, it has been said by several Supreme Justices that Roe is settled law, just as marriage equality. It would take a case coming before them, and they would have to decide to even take the case. My belief is that any good lawyer could argue that it can not be changed based on religious freedom....the same thing the Bishops want so badly for only Catholics, will hurt them on this issue. I have done some research on this, and other religions have varying opinions and beliefs on when life begins. For example Jewish believers have a very different take based on ancient scripture. You can look it up...but it is not conception. I also think most Congress and Senators know this, because many are lawyers. I think Trump may even know this, he can appoint his conservative, say he did his job...and watch it play out, without ever overturning Roe.
No hope.  Don't even expect it.  Just like the battle between Jews and Arabs.
Again Mr Trump appears to be making foreign policy on the fly. "One-state, two-state,... I don't care as long as everyone is happy!"  You can have a two-state solution with an independent Israel and Palestine based on pre-1967 boarders, or  one democratic, secular state but no one wants one Jewish state with disaffected, disenfranchised Palestines - that is apartheid. It has taken decades to get the parties to the point where they agreed a two-state approach was best for them.  PM Netanyahu has been an impediment to peace since he was reelected. It is clear he can not control the ultra-conservatives in his coalition. I don't believe any peace can be achieved while he is PM.  President Obama had the appropriate stance - polite but no bromance.
Thank you, sir!  Judaism and Christianity were splitting apart when the Gospels and epistles were being written down over a 40 year period -- starting 30 years or so after Jesus of Nazareth's execution.  That split caused animosity in both religions. Which is reflected in St. John's Gospel and elsewhere.
So you have a religious state Saudi Arabia (Sunni Muslim), Iran another religious state (Shitte Muslim) and a Jewish created state named Israel. What year is it  2017 its not 700 AD. Canada and the west should have a serious talk with all three parties and progress to 2017.
President Trump did not excuse Neo-N*zis. That is just plain false. He said (1) N*zism and white supremacy are wrong but (2) the law in this country is that they have a legal right to hold demonstrations and it is illegal to assault them for doing it.  Real Americans understand how both of those statements can be true. It has to do with the Constitution and the way the courts have consistently interpreted it.   And let's lose the fake concern for the Jews, while we're at it. Jews have just as many enemies on the left as on the right. Trump has denounced David Duke; when will Obama denounce Louis Farrakhan? Vladimir Putin rebuilds synagogues and Jeremy Corbin cultivates Hamas.
I for one, welcome Putin and Russian action in Syria and Ukraine to counterbalance U.S. regime-change efforts in both these countries. The U.S. is power -drunk and its Middle Eastern foreign policy is spoon-fed to them by Israel. The Ukranian coup was mounted by Jewish Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland (Nudelman) under "Artillery Hillary".  The conflict in Syria was going nowhere with Qatar, Saudi Arabia financing ISIL, with tacit U.S. blessing and tacit U.S.  support from Turkey. The U.S. funded White-Helmets are just another covert U.S. force disguised as an NGO.  Russia patiently waited until 2015 before committing action in Syria and the results were apparent in just a few months.  We need Russia to counter U.S. hegemony.
I don't think the orthodoxy is the issue, it's the exclusion of input from Jewish folks who are not living in Israel.(diaspora)  For most of us it would seem any nation has a right to make its own decision.  But the 'nation of Israel' has implied all people of Jewish heritage.  Not hard to see that helped the Nation of Israel in funding and support worldwide.  I think Friedman feels that world support is being eroded by Netenyahu's narrow nationalistic party.  The diaspora would like a voice if the Zionist faction is taking their monetary and sympathetic support,(as well as our nations support)
Muslims need to be fearfull while living at the U.S., since they are required by Islamic Laws to Support the Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam (especially the Imams at the Mosques), and to join the Jihad against the Christians, Jews, Unbelievers (Kafir) to prove that they are Muslims.  example If an Imam demands that a Muslim do a Fatawa, a death penalty sentence, of a U.S. Citizen, the Muslim Must, or he or she and all their Families Relatives Friends are added to that Death Penalty Sentence to be accomplished by anybody.  2006 President Bush Ordered the U.S. Department of State to coordinate activities to cut off the Mandatory Islamic Tithes given by All Muslims from reaching the Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam ("Muslim Terrorists").  2009 President Obama's U.S. Law, "Material Support to Terrorist Organizations", ended up convicting many U.S. Muslims, yet President Obama gave Iran's Hamas Terrorists $900 Million and Clinton gave $400 Million of U.S. Citizens Money.
Maya87 writes:  "one example - his regular declarations that he is a feminist yet his apparent fondness for accommodating the planet's religion that remains the most patriarchal and oppressive towards women everywhere."  --  Which one would that be?  Christianity, Judaism, Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Shinto, Tenrikyo, Cao Dai, Bahai?  They could all fit that description.
Stalin killed off  around 7 million kulaks and imported ethnic Russians to control the Ukraine because of its agricultural importance to the USSR.      That was back in 1932-33.     That's why that portion of the Ukraine 'wants to be under Russian control'.  Having said that, the facts on the ground are the facts on the ground.  The ethnic Russians aren't going to leave.  The ethnic Ukraine aren't either.    It's like Israel; the Jews aren't going to go back to the ghettos of Russia, Poland, or Germany, either.   Do we have a dog in this Ukrainian fight?    http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/stalin.htm
A couple of things interested me about this case. First the plaintiff. I googled her and took a look at her social media. I agree if she is an agent for the RCC, they couldn't have picked one so far removed.   According to her FB profile, she is Jewish. She is transgendered and works for an LGBT newspaper in Chicago with EXTREMELY liberal views. I mean so liberal they make the NYT look like Breitbart. Seems to have thrown herself into her job too. According to her Linked In, she won four journalism awards for investigative reporting. I had to look twice at this but her paper published an article where she describes donating one of her kidneys to a reader. Other stories written about her suggest she is known for social justice activism.   That said outside of her Linked In I found absolutely zero information confirming her employment at SNAP. If she was involved in fundraising you'd think there'd be some electronic footprint. Interesting IMHO.  Cont...
Radcliffe's emphasis on Olympic style lifting, hanging upside down, hindu squats and other oddities is just Jazzercise with a bar. Consequently, Oregon has never been a physically strong team and it showed on the field. Coach Taggart and members of his staff spotted the problem right away. Winning starts in the weight room.  Taggart is demonstrating attention to every detail.  I couldn't be more optimistic.
I briefly read a bit about this religion, but that was a long time ago.  Aren't they an off-shoot of Hinduism?
It's all legal in France until Hebdo makes fun of the Jews. Then it's off to jail.
I don't recall anyone being forced to recite the Lord's Prayer at school in Ontario in the 60's and 70's.   Jewish students who comprised many of my classmates did not. I don't have any issue with these prayers, Christian or Muslim, but I can see for for some that the expansion of accommodation to the Muslim religion is coincident with the denouncement of anything Christian, especially Christmas.  I would suggest there needs to be a restoration of  balance.  Christmas doesn't need to be celebrated for all of December but  allowing one or two schools days when people can say "Merry Christmas" instead of "Happy Holidays" would help.
If you study history you will understand the future.  Jews are very, very small part of the global population.  Eventually they will push the pendulum so far out of order that they, and their minions, will be exterminated by the masses.  Time is the only thing holding back the inevitable.
Trump's actions are going to harm a lot of American businesses and institutions.  The US is a major site for international conferences.  I'd bet many that could attend may choose not to, in disapproval of the Trump actions and the fallout thereof.  There are likely many individuals, myself included, who don't wish to travel there, not because I'd be subject to any bans, but because a discriminatory racist policy applied in a heavy-handed and menacing fashion by border security agents, allowing me through but banning many peers and leaders, is an enormous and ugly disincentive to attend any kind of meeting in the US.  Not to mention that Trump didn't strongly denounce the murder and attempted murder of two men from India  in Kansas, because they were mistaken for Iranians by some wingnut, and has apparently claimed that Democrats may be responsible for vandalism against Jewish cemeteries, to make him look bad.  Who'd want to visit the US these days, if they didn't have to?  Not me.
I think we have to remember that this Motion is a long way from mandating behaviour. We should also remember that for some reason every year there are a number of instances involving the Jewish faith and people , but there is no Motion on this before Parliament.If people are discriminated against be they Muslims, Jews, etc we have laws to deal with this, without adding a further layer for a specific group. Every year, someplace in Canada, Christian cemeteries are vandalized, which seems on par with the graffiti at mosques across this country. We deal with this without divising a specific strategy for a specific group. As I said from the outset mandating behaviour towards a specific religion, is not I believe the goal of this committee. If it is, it will change before it ever is finalized.
Yes. My mother-in-law, half Jewish, with dark hair and a Semitic last name, born and raised in Portland, couldn't go to her own graduation party in high school. Held at the MAC in the mid-50s, because someone's showy father had a membership. Trust me... She still remembers being excluded, being the Jewish girl who wasn't allowed to go.
Um- "anti-semitic?" That same Pepe icon is used by Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos: both Jews. Let me guess- you also think they and Steve Bannon are white nationalists, and let me guess- you think that because this paper/WaPo (same thing) told you so. Congrats- you're the reason this paper is going out of business.
Anglicans, Jews...indeed, many denominations...number the Commandments a bit differently, combining and distinguishing some a bit differently, but they're all covered.  I impugned nothing....and typing 9 instead of 8 was most assuredly a mistype...I'm not sure what you mean by calling it what it was elicits gladness on your part "anyhow".  There was no reach....And you still have not answered my original concern.
At least your consistent in being abysmally wrong.  Islam is as much a western tradition as Judaism or Christianity--between the three the latter was subject to the most 'eastern' influences (mostly Hindu).  I'm a product of western culture.  I like it just fine.  That doesn't mean I'm incapable of acknowledging its warts and rejecting its moral failings, any more than it means I'm incapable of denouncing crimes perpetrated by those identifying themselves with my Faith.  Your problem is you can't conceive anything other than lockstep acceptance of ALL western 'cultural precepts' and rejection of all others, therefore you're incapable of seeing anything OTHER than 'one-dimensionalsim' despite the reality I accept what's positive from many human cultures and traditions (including this one).  In short, when you bleat "projection" you accuse me of that which you yourself are most guilty.  And as for feeling 'inferior', once I stop pointing and laughing I'll try to respond to that.
Interesting article.    It isn't the first time I've heard from Jews who are not in support of current Israeli policy.     But it's more personal and connected when we get to hear this from a Jewish writer.
No Fuad, they are just traditional holdovers from the past we do not celebrate these religious holidays - only a few crazies believe the christian myths. The media is over-respresented in believers versus rest of population in the majority. You misunderstand, they are not accommodations to some non-existent god for us, they are just DAYS OFF from slavery or school. that's it.  We do not believe in any abrahamic ruler over us because those things are just lies by the powerful over others. You must become secular become good neighbors keep your crazy beliefs to yourself or at least OUT OF SCHOOL! We demand that as secularists in order to not go to war as e have for centuries over these things. Keep it away from school muslim, christian jewish zoroastrian whatever so we can have peace. Your position Fuad is simply warfare against the rest of us. You must submit to secularism in this country. We all do or we face war internally and eternally.
Tolerance? Atheists tolerate religion all the time. It was tolerated in Berlin the other night and recently in France and Florida. It is tolerated 7/24 in India where 'untouchables' have few rights. It is tolerated every time some god reference is used to disparage gays. And when was the last time you had a non-believer knocking at your door trying to convert you? I've had dozens if not hundreds of the reverse. Tolerance by non-believers of the belief in spooks isn't easy but I would say atheists are generally better at tolerating believers than the various different believers are at tolerating any disbelief.
Mr Murrell, You obviously don't know many atheists or at least have never bothered to get know them.  I and many of my fellow atheists give generously not only during the holiday season but all throughout the year.  We not only donate financially but also donate our time.  We do so not because we believe we will be rewarded in the next life, but because we believe helping others is the right thing to do.  We don't feel the need to proselytize when we give or crow from the top of the mountain  that we are atheists doing good.  We don't wear t-shirts saying :ATHEIST HELPING.  We go about our charity without fanfare for the most part.    Maybe if you stepped outside your church and did  some charity for some other organizations like Red Cross, Doctors without Borders, Amnesty International, Oxfam, etc - all secular charities - you would see atheists doing good work for others.    For someone with a PhD, you should know better than to make blanket statements without any proof
Qualify this bizarre post.  How does a man with Jewish grandchildren "literally sympathize" with the Nazis?
I hope for your sake that you aren't LGBTQ, Christian, Jewish or female. Many of your new neighbours that Trudeau and his government are welcoming into Canada by the tens of thousands might not like the fact that you are a bit different.
While Muslims excoriate us about supposed Islamophobia, we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched homophobia, misogyny, Judeophobia, Christiophbia, Buddeaphobia Europhobia, Americanophibia, democratiophobia, Bibliophobia, iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other.
Very unfortunate secular progressives are no longer making people feel safe in their own country.  The same people attacking students on university campuses.  First they went after Christians and Catholics, then the Jewish, now Muslims.  Unfortunately your situation is far from unique.
Thanks for the elucidation, Monica.  Now let's examine your statements here.  I would suggest that Jesus  was a fervent and practicing Jew, hence regular attendance at Sabbath meals and synagogue services each week.  Early traditions and writings (Justin Martyr) would suggest that the Way maintained those ritual practices, however moving the "meal" to Sunday, the Lord's Day, and ultimately bringing the synagogue service there as well, when they were refused entrance into Jewish communities.  As rituals were set from times before Jesus, were practiced by Jesus himself, and followed directly into early Christian practice, so has the Tradition continued.  Thus, I would agree that the Church evolved into a community dependent on rituals, but I would aver - more! - that Jesus' practice in his Jewish life and the practice of The Way continued the "attachment"  even though the gospels do not capture Jesus giving us such "shoulds."  see my next reply
Jerry Falwell, Jr. Says Trump Had 'Inside Information' On Those Very Fine Nazis In Charlottesville   When booking guests for this Sunday's shows, ABC reports that the White House offered up D-List speaker and fake Evangelical leader, Jerry Falwell, Jr., to be the best defender of thrice married and serial cheater, Donald Trump.      Presumably, Falwell would prefer for us to not remember that his father founded a segregated college.    Fake grifting immoral evangelical, fake grifting immoral president.  Winning.  The right must be so proud of their family values Party now.  Make America Grab Em What ?  Jerry Falwell.  Jerry Falwell.  Other things Jerry Falwell Jr wants us to forget about Jerry Falwell Sr.  On his evangelist program The Old-Time Gospel Hour in the mid 1960s, Falwell Sr. regularly featured segregationist politicians like Lester Maddox and George Wallace.  In 1999, Falwell Sr. declared the Antichrist would probably arrive within a decade and "of course he'll be Jewish"
"No, the real way modern civilization actually shares values and ideas is through WORK, through natural, ordinary day to day exchanges of products, services, feedback."  RD, it sounds like you have been converted to Ayn Rand the atheist/materialist favorite of Paul Ryan and the Republican Party.
Expect more of this in coming times.  Sunni Kaliphate and Jewish finance alliance terrorized Christian West for 13 centuries until the English found the silver bullet - create competing land claims by founding Israel.  Since then no war in Europe. Christians at peace.  Now the payback time. Sunnis and Jews will be targeted everywhere. What goes come around.
"Why, then, the continued fear-mongering about sharia law...?"   What are some of the sources of Islamophobia?   The Clarion Fund has produced three flagrantly hate-mongering Islamophobic DVDs: Obsession, Iranium, and The Third Jihad http://tinyurl.com/bp57hue. The latter was shown, according to a New York Police Department report, to “at least 1,489 police officers, from lieutenants to detectives to patrol officers..." http://tinyurl.com/chpg6bm. In 2008, some 28 million copies of Obsession were circulated in U.S. newspapers. These are also distributed by right-wing billionaire Sheldon Adelson to participants in Birthright Israel http://tinyurl.com/93878bn, an organization he helps fund that asserts American Jewish rights to live in Israel while excluding indigenous Palestinians.
I certainly do not wish to imply anything adverse about Jewish religious practice but it strikes me as a liitle unhinged to be singling out Islam for its treatment of women when women in synagogues are required to sit apart, Roman Catholics require priests to be male,  Fundamentalist Christians place males as the head of the household, etc.  Remember that Charity is one of the Five Pillars of Islam given a more prominent place than in any other religion - and be more charitable.
What he said seems rather tame, to be honest. Look at the way Democrats implied during the JCPOA negotiations that Jews had dual allegiance and that the Jewish lobby formed a fifth column foreign body in the US. Now that was antisemitic!   A lot of people have ideas about the 'appropriate' amount of influence that Jews should have, but most of these people couldn't give a principled explanation for why.
The people of God are not the Magesterium.  The Magesterium is the bishops in union with the pope.   The Magesterium can, indeed, be wrong, and they have, indeed been wrong in the past.  It is a huge leap of logic to conclude from this that Catholic teaching on sexual ethnics and a whole host of other important issues needs to change, is in error or could change.  It is also a huge leap in logic to conclude that Church teaching should change because lay people, influenced by liberal, secular, humanist atheism think it should.  Church teaching is not determined by the whims and fads of pop-culture.  This is something liberal dissidents do not understand.  Church teaching is also not determined by the whims, fads and trends of Science.  What Scientist teach one day they change the next.  This is not to say that the people of God or Science has no role in determining Church teaching, only to say that it is not the final arbiter.
I have posted below the system of faith more atheists generally follow.  I agree it is not required, but most atheists ascribe their faith to contemporary science and the scientific method, though perhaps, you do not.
Ideally people need to find a way to get along, but if I look at the shared values of egalitarianism and respect for separation of religion and state, I have to listen to the Israelis first.   As much as people have the right to believe in whatever religion they want, this inability to deal reasonably with secular issues of territorial separation and peaceful coexistence through multiple attempts to find solutions.  I think when Ehud Barak tried to negotiate an agreement with Arafat in 2000 and failed, it's quite clear, the palestinian leadership was not interested in peaceful coexistence.  I look at Israel and I like the fact that just like Toronto, an atheist can walk among their most religious sites and expect to be left alone.   But in Israel's neighbours, the same atheist can't even let people know that they don't believe in a deity.  It could get you killed in most of those places if you told anyone you have serious doubts about  god's existence.  So I pick Israel.
I see so many comments posted on the NCR comment sites that reflect a total unfamiliarity and/or an outright hostility towards what the responders think is Catholic teaching / doctrine.  Therefore, I think that it is high-time that NCR asked responders to identify themselves as:  1) practicing Catholics; 2)former Catholics; 3) persons of another religion; 4) agnostics / atheists. At least that way we would how much "explaining" we have to do when replying to what appears to be 'invincible ignorance'.
a muslim calling out canada for misogyny. thats rich. who are "whites" anyway? do they include the halfbreeds running the mmiw, jews, "white" syrians? a vacation to india, any muslim country, or africa usually shuts these snowflakes up pretty quickly. i think these mulsim women are projecting their own oppression.
seems some are echoing the ghosts of the past when official government policy when asked how many Jews fleeing the Nazis Canada would take, the official position was "None is Too Many."
It is ironic that in responding to an article about the reality of the Holocaust you persist in an equal myth of framing the Jews (Ashkenazis)  who were the victims of the Holocaust as Nazis. The Jews as a people were destroyed under the Nazis, the Arab Palestinians, by loss of war, were not destroyed, at worst they were displaced. They are very much alive, and most of them are living in Jordan. Many of them are living in Gaza, adjacent to their original homes in modern Israel, and many in the West Bank are still living in their original homes.  An equal number of Jews across North Africa and in the Mideast, were displaced during the founding of Israel and its war for independence, and found homes in Israel. Their original homes and properties are being tenanted by others.  You can lament it all you like, as is the reaction of any displaced people. But it shows you as a partisan, quoting what individual quotes you like, even made up, not in any sense of the word 'accurate'.
In answer to the atheist bigots!  "As a candidate, Obama delivered the keynote speech at a conference organized by the liberal evangelical minister Jim Wallis. "Secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square," he said. "Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, Williams Jennings Bryan, Dorothy Day, Martin Luther King -- indeed, the majority of great reformers in American history -- were not only motivated by faith, but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause. So to say that men and women should not inject their 'personal morality' into public policy debates is a practical absurdity. Our law is by definition a codification of morality, much of it grounded in the Judeo-Christian tradition."
Life of the Lay, I believe you misunderstand the foundation of Senator Feinstein's questions. She addressed the specific ways in which Barrett has referenced and acted on her Catholicism in her legal career. Barrett has made her Catholicism part of her legal and professional record. Thus, her professional and legal record as a Catholic are appropriate subjects of evaluation for legal and professional jobs. The Senator "pre-judged" nothing. She did not arrive at the hearing knowing only that Barrett is Catholic. The Senator researched Barrett's professional legal work and discovered through that work that she prominently identifies herself professionally and legally as a Catholic legal thinker. Feinstein, to my knowledge, does not prominently identify herself professionally and in her policy work and votes as a Jewish Congresswoman.  Feinstein's Judaism is immaterial here. Barrett has made her Catholicism a material and prominent and influential part of her legal work and  life.
Gosh, let's blame it on foreigners.  Sure, xenophobia is the solution! . It's the modern-day equivalent of blaming the Black Death on Jews, and then being surprised when murdering all the Jews in pogroms didn't cure bubonic plague. . Why don't you prescribe solving the problem by bleeding with leeches?  Or burning witches? . The fact is that immigrants have made Canada, and themselves, vastly richer, and without them income inequality in Canada would be even worse. . The ageing of our workforce is a demographic and economic time-bomb.  Countries such a Japan and Italy (and even China) are already seeing this effect. .. To cut immigration in an era of a rapidly aging population would merely assure old-age poverty for the great majority of Canadians. .. But sure, let's blame foreigners for causing us to follow suicidal tax cut policies.
It wasn't until much later when I did my own research that I realized that thousands of Arabs were driven off their land. wkl - they were not driven, they fled the war 20 % of Israel now is made up of Israeli Arabs how come they were not "driven" - by the way 800,000 Jews were driven literally from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Libya etc that was in the 1950" (more with population growth) does your bleeding heart drip for them too?
"the form of a sovereign Jewish state in a tiny slice of the Middle East where Jews have lived continuously for three thousand years"... is not a valid argument for the state Israel. The descendants of the Ashkenazi Jews of Europe, like the current Prime Minister, were converts and not descendants of the indigenous Jewish population. Yet they are the one's who continue to invade and displace indigenous people.  The North American democracies are founded on religious freedom and the complete separation of church and state. Our continued support for this Jewish State anachronism, based on historical half-truths and the manipulation of the post-war British governments in 1922 and 1947, should end.
Trump calls for unity? I guess that means that all Americans should just accept the white supremacist Nazis, shouting "Jews won't replace us", "blood and soil"?  Capitulation to these lowlifes hopefully will never happen.
Sanctions should have been imposed on Mainland China decades ago because of the fact that there are no human rights whatsoever there. Public executions are still being tallied by the hundreds and extreme forms of torture are common place. Western media and governments ignore these facts and choose commerce over conscience. The major victims of vicious treatment by the blood-thirsty CCP are the tens of millions  of innocent Falun Gong practitioners who live in China. The evil CCP became jealous of the gentle practice in 1999 and began an attempted genocide. The CCP considers the practice a threat because while the Party preaches atheism and brainwashes its people into believing that it is the highest power, Falun Gong practitioners believe in God. Commerce over conscience, shameful!
Your argument to invalidate Ashkenazi Jews by saying they are not Semites is race-based, hence it is de facto racist. You wrote that Koestler pre-dated Watson and Crick. WRONG. (Don't you fact-check yourself?) Watson and Crick's pivotal research on DNA occurred in the early 50s and Watson's book "The Double Helix" came outt in 1968. By the way, the fact that they wrote a book doesn't make it science. Their research, published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, additional research by other scientists, and the acceptance of the scientific community, THAT makes it science. The book "The Double Helix" was a popularization, a very 'popular' one. It said nothing about Jews and Khazars. Zero.  Koestler’s book “The Thirteenth Tribe” came out in 1978. It was not science. It was not scholarly. It was a popular book based on some ancient writings. It did not involve peer review, and was controversial, which it was meant to be.  There is no DNA research that proves Koestler's theories. (cont'd
Pat Robertson, like any other politician on television, is saying what sells to his audience.  Hillary, Trump, Jesse Jackson, Sr., Schumer, Pelosi, Cruz.  Much the same.    The 114th Congress had no fewer that seven (7) ordained ministers.    And 99% of the Republicans claimed to be Christians and 81% of the Democrats.  (19% of the Democrats claim to be Jewish, and one of the Republicans)  No wonder ISIS calls us "Crusaders"!
Here's an idea:  let all religions hold their own services and prayer sessions in the school's prayer room. In the spirit of inclusion, tolerance, and brotherly love, sharing the space  will bring people together and build the a better world.  No peace loving Muslim could ever object to  praying in the same room as Jews. Would they? Let's all share.   It is public property after all.
The only slippery slope to authoritarianism is the racism that is displayed by groups like BDS that single out one ethnic group for contempt and loathing, while overlooking and giving a pass to those groups seeking to eliminate and eradicate the Jewish presence in the Middle East and denying their inalienable right to self-determination in their historic homeland.
You forget that there were Palestinian Jews still living in their homeland, a Jewish homeland that predates Islam, Arabs and all that. Israel came out of them and immigration from Europe of Jewish refugees of the Holocaust. Palestinian Arabs painted their own downfall when they initiated war. Everything else you wrote is rather long but immaterial. If you want to say that people on both sides...did bad things, why not? That is war, eh? Even in all the wars our nation fought, we committed our shares of war crimes. Maybe what you should do is explain why no other Arab nations wants to take in the Palestinians? They were rejected from Lebanon, Syria and Jordan......Saudi Arabia nor Egypt wants them. One must wonder why Palestinian Arabs are so disliked and distrusted by their fellow Arabs despite of sharing the common faith. First step for the Palestinian people to do maybe is to acknowledge Israel's right to exist. From there, something could be done?
nope..Judaism is the old testament, Christianity is the new testament and they are related.  The other show up in 624AD because someone did not like the established religions and decided to do something about it.
In the 1940's with the division of Pakistan and India, how many millions of Muslims were victims of Indians and Hindus?
Saying Atheism is a religion is like saying "not collecting stamps" is a hobby.
Negotiate?   North Korea is the most hostile culture on earth; the supreme hater and destroyer of Christians, who are hung on a cross over a fire, crushed under a steamroller, herded off bridges and trampled underfoot. There is extra-judicial killing, extermination, enslavement/forced labor, forcible transfer of population, arbitrary imprisonment, torture, persecution, enforced disappearance, rape and sexual violence, and other inhumane acts. On World Watch List Rank: 1.   Main Religion: Atheism. Government: Communist dictatorship. Source of Persecution: Dictatorial paranoia. North Korea is a sea of diabolical godlessness.  Negotiate?
Not accurate. Bernie Sanders is Jewish. He may very well be President today if the Clinton camp hadn't played dirty. Bernie Sanders had his Bar Mitzvah at 13. His first marriage was to a Jewish woman from a prominent Baltimore family.
We do have some extra-bibical mention of Jesus from, if memory serves, Tacitus and Josephus. But the main sources are the gospels, which can be used for historical purposes, even if that is reading against the grain. Pontius Pilate and Herod are known historical figures, who are described in other sources much as they appear in the gospels. The genre of the gospels has been a much discussed topic, but to me they seem to represent ancient historiography. They present narraives with thier own theological purposes, but all agree in Jesus being the Baptist's disciple, on the shared perception of his ministry, on his death. .  Which does not validate everything they say by any stretch of imagination. Some are clearly created without any concern for historical facts, like the disciples picking grain on the sabbath, while others are more rooted in the history we do know about Second temple Judaism. Analoguously, if we cannot rely on Buddhist scriptures, we would not know if he ever existed.
Why does it have to be all or nothing with the alt left?...Don't support homosexual marriage? You hate homosexuals. Think the USA is a nation of laws which need to be followed and enforced? You hate Mexicans and Illegal Aliens.  Israel is free to threaten holocaust on everyone else,[4] but it is antisemitic to even protest their right to destroy other people and if you do then you obviously hate jews? I come from a Christian upbringing where we loved the sinner and hated the sin. Isn't it more likely that most people would disapprove of any group of people who are hell bent on genociding the people who's land they stole ... and anyone who has racked up the long list of war crimes, theft and deceit as the pseudo country of Israel.
As an atheist, I would profoundly disagree with Evangelical Christianity. But I also believe we should allow anyone to decide for themselves whom they wish to deal with even where such decisions are irrational. It is just as wrong for the Ontario government to prevent someone from hiring a lawyer from an Evangelical Christian law school as it had been in hiring a Jewish lawyer.
The poor ordinary citizens of the West Bank, Gaza and Isreal. Between the horrid Rock of Netanyahu and the hard place of Hamas. Even more tragic, and likely true, is Mr. Caplan's pointing out that a Two-State Solution is not in the cards, and that a one-state solution with equal rights for jews and arabs is not likely either.   Such a tragedy.   And really, the only decent fellow amongst the leadershp is Palestine Authority Head Mahmoud Abbas, who has consistently worked for peace, and whose position is continually weakened by the hardline positions of Netanyahu and Hamas.   Interesting to note that while Hamas still hasnt gotten around to changing its charter to recognize Isreal, Likud the Party of Netanyahu refuses to admit that a palestinian people exists, or that the Palestinians have the right to self-determination.   And so many Canadians take wholly one sided positions on the conflict, and endorse or rationalize violence by one side committed against the other.   For shame.
Jesus didn't "gift the sacrament of orders" to anyone, man or woman.  Jesus ordained no priests.  There was already an active priesthood in Jesus' time and Jesus was a devout Jew.  What we have today in the Seventh Sacrament is an institutionalized form of servant-leadership with decided emphasis on the "leadership" part.    As I see it, we can either junk the whole current form of sacerdotal clericalism and start over based on strict Gospel values, or we can remodel our current requirements to include all those God calls, married and single, male and female.  After all, we are ALL created in God's image and likeness.
I wouldn't say he's thinking outside of the Hawaii bubble at all.  The Democrats actually do live in an information bubble (to be fair, Republicans do too).  Inside of your bubble, Trump is the "dangerous" candidate even though your candidate was advocating war in Syria (and possibly Russia) just 1 week before the election.  Even now the President is sending troops to Poland, expelling diplomats and their families, adding sanctions, and for what?  Some bogus story about Russia "hacking" the election?  Give me a break.  As soon as Trump is in charge of the "intelligence community" you're gonna see this whole "Russian hacking" narrative evaporate and your religious blind faith in "the intelligence community" will magically become a skeptical atheist.  I didn't trust the "intelligence community" under Bush, I don't trust them now, and I won't trust them under Trump either.  Professional liars.  James Clapper should be indicted for perjury.
right on, but privileged haoles moving to hawai'i maybe have more in common with colonizers than they do with an historically oppressed people like Jews.
Like everything else, we play fast and loose with words, assigning them beneficent or sinister meanings never originally intended.  Many of our disagreements arise not from differences in concept, but from differences in definition or understanding of what is meant by particular words.  Can anyone define what constitutes "terrorism" nowadays?  It seems to have come to mean any violent action whatsoever whenever the government wants to use its non-democratic powers.  Or "racism", even where the action is practised by members of the same race (e.g. whites v hispanics).  Or "anti-semitism", even when practiced by an Arabic semite against a Jewish semite (or vice versa).  Same with "populism".  It's not inherently good or bad.  It just means something arising from or supported by the general population.  We should be careful about making the word yet another pejorative, which would preclude consideration of its positive attributes.
Not so.  The Vichy regime was as as anti-Semitic as the occupying Germans. They rounded up Jews and transported them into the occupied area.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/genocide/jewish_deportation_01.shtml
There are 3 races. Caucasian, Mongoloid (Asian), and Negroid (Black). These are their scientific names. Anthropologically, they refer to relative frame size & shape of the head. Everything beyond that, including soft tissue, brain and other body systems, are exactly the same, just changes in melanin in the skin. They just look different because of environment.  Mexicans are both Caucasian and Asian, as are most Central and South Americans. Many American Blacks are Caucasian and Black. Judaism is a religion, just like Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism. If you're Jewish, there are ethnicities. It's just like being Italian or Irish.  Askenazi, Sephardi, etc. If you're Ashkenazi, you are most likely at or within 2% of being 100% European, mostly living in colder climates. Being European, to most white supremacists, means white. So basically, I bet if they did a side by side study, you'd find most Ashkenazi Jews are as "white" if not "whiter" than most supposedly "white" supremacists.
Is that the same faith that tells it's followers to chop off the alternating hand and foot of Atheists?
Actually, the DNA testing shows that Palestinian Arabs and Jews (at least Sephardic Jews) are ethnically  identical. This makes sense if you consider that most indigenous Palestinians are the descendants of "Arabized"  indigenous Jews
Please provide citations for your implied assertion that the Constitution and Supreme Court have not rejected the concept that America was founded on Judeo-Christian principles.
"faith based voting machines"?    Which denominations do they come in?  Catholic? LDS?  Orthodox Jewish?  Lutheran?  Baptist?  Which conference(s)?  Which States have adopted them and which denominations?  Paper ballots?  Stalin is alleged to have said:  ""You know, comrades," says Stalin, "that I think in regard to this: I consider it completely unimportant who in the party will vote, or how; but what is extraordinarily important is this — who will count the votes, and how."   Or he may not have said it.   Still true, however.
See, if I'd seen a red star, I would have instantly associated with communist China or Socialists (Soviets, etc.). No way I would have associated it with Israel or the Jewish people.
What's more important - what a book says or what the followers do?  Christianity has massacred far more people than Islam. Violence has been a key factor in its success for converting people. Islam was a little more gentle - and that is why it has ruled over other religions like Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, etc.  In Catholic colonies, it was either conversion or death. A major reason why not a single Muslim or Jew was left in Catholic Spain, Portugal or Italy(or any non Catholics in all of of South America) in the 16th century. Whereas I can't think of a single country where Muslims wiped out the entire local religion.
Israeli settlements have always been one of many roadblocks to peace and have always taken legitimacy away from Israel's occupation of East Jerusalem and the West Bank.  Growing up as a Jewish Canadian, we looked down on the settlers as religious zealots. Sadly, they are a potent political force ion Israel and the US and the rest of the West. Not only that, but decades of public pressure against Israel, which often has anti-semetic undercurrents has made even the least religious Jews more prone to defend the settlements.   Other posters are correct to point out that Israel returned the Sinai peninsula in return for peace and would do the same for the Golan Heights. Occupation can end if a partner is found, but Israel should take the first step and stop new settlements, and dismantle the existing ones.
Still haven't actually seen video of the "Jews will not replace us" thing. Sounds like an urban legend.
What is it with Buddhist countries, anyhow?  I can't think of a single one I'd like to live in, and the number that I'd feel safe visiting can be counted by one thumb on my right hand.
It's difficult for a reasonable person to dispute with the Trumpy the Clown worshipers because Hillory the Blood Cuntess is even a worse nightmare than Trump.  She represents the interests of the Zionist entity, and ONLY its interests.  Anyone who thinks those are compatible is encouraged to read "The Assault on the USS Liberty" by former Navy Lt. James Innes, who was duty officer on the day of the attack.  Or consider the Zionists' deliberate irradiation of 100,000 of its own JEWISH citizens because they weren't the right "race", then tell me they'd hesitate to do the same to us given the opportunity.  Hillory will drag us into a nuclear war for the sake of her Zionist masters.  We don't have a viable choice--fascism is here.
I guess that was a primary reason Canada didn't allow Jewish refugees during World War Two. It was very hard to cross check with Nazi records if any of the applicants was a mass murderer or a judge!
Cy, the real historical Jesus of Nazareth, if he was typical of his times, would not have considered himself a human sacrifice, because Jews of that time knew that Yahweh abhorred human sacrifice  It could be that Christianity was designed to put a stop to a practice of human sacrifice (then perhaps resurgent in the backwoods of Turkey??) with the idea that a mythical Jesus was the 'one and only sacrifice.' However Christianity carried forward the (non-Jewish) idea that God is demon-like, demanding human sacrifice, and assumes God is unable to transform the world except by violence and blood. Not a fit message for those Africans already predisposed to think in such terms  Put "pagan gods who died" into Google and you get: "The concept of a dying-and-rising god was first proposed in comparative mythology by James Frazer . . . associated the motif with fertility rites surrounding the yearly cycle of vegetation . . .  cited the examples of Osiris, Tammuz, Adonis, Attis, Dionysus . . ."
Your comments demonstrate your own bigotry towards Jews, Muslims, and certain Christians when you state that "Freedom of Religion in Eugene appears to be applicable primarily to the Christian religions of a particular class (which class?) and, currently, to the Jewish and Muslim religions."
Some Muslims have suggested that 'anti-Semitism' is a rough equivalent of 'Islamophobia'--  in that it puts Jewish people into a separate category regarding bigotry towards them.  Anti-Semitism has come to mean discrimination against Jews, but is somewhat of a historic misnomer. Semitic languages include Arabic, Amharic,  Hebrew, Aramaic, Maltese and others. Further, recent studies have revealed DNA links among the peoples.  To satisfy those Muslims who have suggested the Jews have been given 'special status' with the anti-Semitic term, perhaps we could blend the two in the interest of fighting bigotry and promoting brotherhood: how about "Islamo-Judeophobia"?
There's always Scientology.
The Lord's prayer doesn't mention Christianity; nonetheless, it is a Christian prayer, although I think Jews and Muslims could recite it unchanged without running afoul of their religious doctrines. On the other hand, atheists, agnostics, and followers of all non-Abrahamic religions could not.
I responded to your post not to the OP. Your post was "Try getting a plot in a Catholic or Jewish cemetery if you are not of that faith.". I demonstrated (if you take my word on it) that you can get a plot in a Catholic cemetery.  "There are Catholic cemeteries which will not sell plots to non-Catholics" might be a fact.  Your first post was fake fact. Admit it and move on.
A few weeks ago, I asked readers whether German Chancellor Angela Merkel was Islamophobic for wanting to ban the burqa and niqab in Germany. I asked if Theo Van Gogh was Islamophobic for making a film about the mistreatment of women in Islam. The answer, according to some (few) readers was, yes, the above are examples of Islamophobia.  So, is this article about child-marriage in Islam an example of Islamophobia?  If this article is Islamphobic then this article must be condemned, according to M-103, along with racism and bigotry against Muslims.
The GOP goons would have Swiftboated Bernie just as badly if not worse than the character assassination campaign they waged against Clinton. He has a lot of baggage that the Karl Roves of the GOP held back hoping he would be the nominee rather than Hillary and the Clinton campaign was so far ahead throughout the primary that they didn't need to dig out the oppo research. The American people were not going to vote for a socialist jew who promised them that their taxes would be raised to pay for other peoples health insurance and college tuition. I know that is a gross minimization of what Sander's campaign was all about but he was making promises that he could never have kept because he only had one Senator in his camp and five progressive house members. I really didn't want to see the good and decent guy subjected to the rank vilification of the GOP slander machine and figured Hillary could handle the abuse after being subjected to thirty years of it. Never counted on the FBI aiding DT
O wise one! Did I say the Muslims were not fighting each other? They were. But they didn't kill the Jews by the thousands or millions either.
"people will always fear Death"   Not me this old atheist is not afraid of death at all.
All this is truly terrifying. And the ripple effect of this whole tragedy can be felt in Europe already, where far-right and nationalist n*ts are celebrating and feeling emboldened now that xenophobia, mysogyny, antisemitism, racism, homophobia and bigotry have 'officially' been declared acceptable by the US election result. Just one particularly ugly example from Germany (where I live): A neo-Nazi group published on Facebook a list of 70 Berlin Jewish institutions with the caption "Jews among us!" on 9th November - which incidentally also happens to be the 1938 Kristallnacht anniversary.
CONT'D For it was not the countries of the middle east that were hostile to Jews prior to Zionism. Yet somehow European colonialists felt they could take this land without repercussion.  As Ilan Pappe said, Zionism is a noble cause, creating a safe haven for a persecuted people. The problem is colonizing someone else's land to do so. Somehow, pro-Zionists believe this problem is the fault of the Palestinians. How that logic works is beyond me. as many Zionist supporters, you just seem to be oblivious to what the Israeli regime has done to Palestinians from 1948 through today. Your case, like that so many other Zionist supporters, ignores the oppression of the Palestinian people.  One article you should read is about the plan of Ethnic Cleansing that the new state executed in its formation. The Expulsion of the Palestinians Re-Examined http://mondediplo.com/1997/12/palestine\the Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine
Trump's choice really is now between the destruction of Israel or siding with anti-Israel and anti-Jewish haters and extremists bent on Israel's elimination from the region, or standing up to these genocidal forces. Good over evil, and Israel and world Jewry are confident that he will make the proper choice notwithstanding his predecessor's folly.
Harris is the daughter of an Indian-American Hindu mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a breast cancer specialist, who immigrated from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, in 1960,and a Jamaican-American father, Donald Harris, a Stanford University economics professor.
You're not speaking about the man whose daughter converted to Judaism, and whose grandchildren and son-in-law are Jewish, are you?  Because that wouldn't make any sense at all. Perhaps we should be looking instead at the radical element of a certain group of people whose leaders regularly call for the annihilation of the State of Israel.
It also stated that all non-Catholics are doomed to hell.  Pope Eugenius made the proclamation at the Council of Florence in 1441.  It reads "The Church firmly believes, professes and proclaims that those not living within the Catholic Church, not only pagans, but also Jews and heretics and schismatics cannot become participants in eternal life but will depart into everlasting fire.....even he who has shed blood for the name of Christ cannot be saved unless he has remained in the bosom and unity of the Catholic Church."  So, there are some among us, in their fervor for Church infallibilty, would hold those beliefs as well.
You are in error.  Jesus chose the original 12, only Jewish men, to be his apostles to fulfill a blood promise to Abraham & Jesus told them that they were chosen apostles to represent the 12 tribes of Israel, along with him, as judges not priests.  There was not even one Levite present among the 12.  This is stated clearly by Jesus in two different Gospels.  Women do not pass down their blood so were not picked as one of the twelve because generally males who can pass down their blood represent tribal lineage.  Mary Magdalene is equal to the apostles like St. Paul because in all other respects she is accorded to have done everything else the apostles did.  There were other women disciples recorded in the Gospels too.  No Gentiles were picked even though Jesus had some gentile followers because they also could not fulfill the prophesied blood promise to Abraham because they have the wrong blood.    If this standard is that by which our church ordains, all Gentile clergy are invalid too.
"The form of the Mass was well established in post-apostolic times both in the East and later in the West."  Nonsense... show me one shred of evidence to support this claim, especially "times" which are in close proximity to the actual apostles. Whatever similarity you might find is a holdover from the practice of the Jewish faith, which was an "approved" religion in the eyes of the Roman overseers. Do some research on *actual* church history before you spout off next time with such ahistorical nonsense.
Abortion is the end to a developing human, whatever we call it.  The Catholic Church prohibits abortion. It always has. It excommunicates those who obtain them, those who perform them, those who procure them, those who participate in them.   Within a Catholic context, then, abortion is a moral evil.  Under current American law a pregnant woman is not guilty of murder if she aborts her unborn. If the law were changed to forbid it, it would illegal. If the law were changed to make abortion murder, it would be murder. If the law were changed to allow the State to murder her and the unborn were she Jewish, and it did, neither would be murder.  As a citizen it my choice to oppose abortion, to seek a constitutional amendment allowing states to forbid and regulate it by law, and to enforce those laws.  And that is every citizen's choice to make.
Not "all" religions worship the same god.  There is definitely a relationship between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, as they're all largely from the same area.  The eastern religions definitely have a different take on what their gods are than the 3 western religions.  BTW, the Buddhist gods come from people.
In a previous post, I said to ATF:  "The reality of Christ's Real Presence in the Eucharist exists independently of anyone's believing in it. If any one those ten atheists consumed the host, his non-belief would not prevent him from consuming the body of Christ. The atheist would not consume bread. Bread is no longer there."  Which of these assertions do you disagree with?
LOL.  My university classes include a significant representation of International students from India.  There are chronic problems with blatant plagiarism.  So I was amused to read that the Hindus claim to have invented the airplane, cosmetic surgery and stem-cell technology.  Now I understand where my students are getting it from.
The assailant, Mr. Boris Grits is a citizen of Israel, a Jewish activist. He travelled to Moscow from Israel to carry out the attack. Read his blog! He warned the journalist that he was fed up with her reporting.   Blame Putin, of course!
Thomas Friedman, whose writings are far above you, said that if the Jews were living in Muslim countries in the 1930s, there would be 6 more million Jews alive today.  There is a reason that many Jews get dual citizenship of Israel. They are never sure when their gentile neighbours will turn against them.
I know of many couples in mixed marriages.  All involve a spouse raised Christian and the other raised Jewish.  None of their children are Christian or Jewish; they're nothing.  Maybe this is why so many people now identify as "nones."
i thought boston was an all americle town, 1776 and the brits ya know--  who says get the f out of our town-   i reserve those words for murderous communists   (look at their history they really kill in massive numbers)    what does that mean-  by equal standards then can those in virginia last week justifiably say to bostonians get the f out our my town too and lose another election   ---   and then shouldnt we both then be able to civilly by the same substandard say to the jews get the f out of our town/ country and take your memorials with you (they have their own country and boy their hands are in no way spotted- just look at the way this apartheidist state has treated poor palestinions as onions in recent decades  uh huh im speaking to you too dear)--    or do we all remember this is americle for once and be thankful for each other and sit and have a spot of tea-    or swill we fight because he drinks tea, and bostonians drink you guessed it sam adams    and i drink rolling rock
Larry:  Much of what the disciples wrote was put down decades after the fact - at a time that they were in effect "inventing" christianity (i.e., changing it from a Jewish sect to a new religion).  What we know today as the New testament wasn't really settled on until centuries later at the Council of Nicea - when Constantine and the Bishops decided what was in and what was out.  Who knows what ended up on the cutting room floor?  Certainly there appear to have been Gnostic Gospels which testified to Jesus being married.
Augustine was trying to explain Genesis without being told Eden was a myth.  The disadvantage of non-Jews interpreting the Torah.  Anyway, what does post have to do with mine?  I was referring to how the Pharisees et al treated the Lord and related it to how some Trads treat anyone speaking in the Spirit of Prophesy about maybe adapting some of our teachings to reflect scientific reality that was unknown for 2000 years.  We have the Paraclete for a reason and She (Shekhinah) is needed now more than ever.
Putin's Russians read? I do recall how Russian neo-fascists burned Ukrainian and Jewish language books in Crimea in January 2014. You give us all hope by suggesting that maybe one or two of those Ivans has since learned to read, even if it's not Ukrainian poetry (perhaps you can recommend they read a history of Ukraine, so they could learn how Ukraine's history predates Muscovy's).
deflect deflect deflect  and then deny your heritage, your history and your agenda  Ukraine, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia all had their Nazi collaborators eg the SS Galicia division truth is many ordinary Ukrainians collaborated with the Nazis - see the tragedies of Babiyar and Lviv if you  are interested Even the holodomor which Canadian ukrainians NOW claim had 10 million victims - as if if they are in competition with the Jews for the best genocide - had its collaborators Such mass killings are not possible without collaborators Vichy France is one - Both France and \Germany have offered official apologies Perhaps Freeland can apologise on behalf of Ukraine
Now please tell us in what other instances you apply observing a few people of a group behaving in a way you dislike as "proof" of the whole group being bad? You do this to black folks, Jews, physicians? Or do you, like so many other seethingly hateful leftists who view cops as the jackbooted enforcers of the bourgeois class, single out cops for these pathetic moral double standards as a gambit to get other people to hate them like you do?  I know, you keep trying to place yourself on a pedestal by bragging about being a CPA. The way you astutely stand against assaults from pencils and paper cuts on a daily basis must frequently drive you to Nicoletti-Flater for counseling.
@Progressive  Menachem Begin, who was later awarded the Nobel Prize for peace, is the same man who planned the destruction of the King David Hotel and the massacre of Deir Yassin (1946). Ex prime minister, Shamir, was originally a member of the Jewish terrorist gang called Irgun, which was headed by none other than Menachem Begin. Shamir later moved over to the even more radical "Stern Gang," which committed many vicious atrocities.  Shamir himself has defended the various assassinations committed by the Irgun and Stern gangs on the grounds that "it was the only way we could operate, because we were so small. So it was more efficient and more moral to go for selected targets." The selected moral targets in those early days of the founding of the state of Israel included bombing of the King David Hotel and the massacre of Deir Yassin. "many vicious atrocities", got it guys ? and that one="...it was the only way we could operate..."  hard to take, eh ? (yes! more to come)
And that is the reason most former Buddhist countries have been taken over by groups that had no problems with violence!
Aren't all statues "graven images", prohibited by the 2nd Commandment (Jewish and Protestant Version).
Bill, I have a confession to make.  You bare a striking resemblence to my father-in-law who passed away a few years ago.  I miss him terribly: he really was a terrific guy.  He was also an atheist, and the two of us used to have some very interesting debates.  Despite our differences we had a great relationship and shared a mutually deep respect for one another.  Just because I disagree with you certainly doesn’t mean I don’t respect you, and I do thank you for your cordial remarks.
I know this because I have followed Fr Gruner for years.  As far as SPLC they will soon be labeling any group that opposes same sex marriage or Gender Identity  due to religious reasons as a hate group.     In regards to Fr Gruner the article you referred  to above does not promote hate,  anti- Semitism  or nazism.     Quoted from said article  "Satan also spreads perplexity and disorder in minds by introducing confusion between Anti-Semitism, which is the detestable hatred of the Jews as a race, and the duty incumbent upon Catholics of combating valiantly for the integral rights of Christ the King and opposing Jewish Naturalism."  You may not agree with the author's view but that does not make it hate speech either.   Please provide me one anti-Semitic, pro-nazi  or hate speech quote from Fr Gruner.
@JVys + Progressive +MacArthur & their "semblables"; Are you Canadian or Israeli?  (the Jewish religion is a “sect” back then of the Middle East) If you answer Canadian then you must conduct yourself as a Canadian citizen  in accordance with its foreign policy on the territories occupied by Israel and not recognised by the international community (more than 130 countries/ there are 192 member states in the United Nations) Both Canada and the UN's security council's position on this matter is that the Israeli occupation and settlements in Gaza and the West Bank are ILLEGAL under international law and violate the Fourth Geneva Convention. Again, it's hard to "swallow", eh guys ?
It's a progression, is it willful - that is yet to be determined. What I mean by progression is Trump and co. alienating their base and any others they can co-opt into it, from established structures. Be they the media, any foreign born Americans, and now the lawfulness of the previous administration. There is so little reported now about the Trump Administration crime list, being compiled weekly in sanctuary cities, to identify any (considered to be, but not proven) illegal ( read Latino) who has committed a crime. This mirrors the mid 30"s Nazi propaganda lists of any Jewish person accused of a crime. the continual destabilizing of public and voter opinion of the "establishment" is leading to a very frightening result. Add this to the accumulating list of mis-truths, alternate facts, and Trump's desire to use the National Guard for deportations is an executive takeover of the military. If I were an American in the US, I would be seriously concerned. No tin hat here.
Originally you asked for evidence that the basic form of the Mass was the same today as in apostolic and post-apostolic times. I furnished that evidence. Now you have gone off on another tack about sacrifices of the Old Law.  Rome did not invent the Sacrifice of the Mass. Here we are talking about Christ's offering of Himself to the Father for the sins of the world.  He made that offering on the Cross on Calvary. At the Last Supper He made that offering sacramentally and bade his apostles to perpetuate it throughout time which the Church has done faithfully since then. I don't see what Rome forbidding Christian worship or not differentiating it from Judaism has got to do with the basic form of the Mass? The early Christians celebrated the Mass regardless of whether it was legal or not or whether the Romans knew the difference between Christianity and Judaism
I shouldn't be mixing topics, but how do you reconcile your strict humanitarian standards with regard to treatment of prisoners and disapproval of the death penalty with your frankly GUSHING praise of the former president of Iran - a terrorist supporting mass murderer (and responsibly for MANY executions) - who died a few days ago?    In short, horrible to execute a murderer, but someone who supports the killing of six million Jews in Israel - a "great man" - was likely responsible for the bombing of a Jewish community center in Argentina.   It's mind boggling.
"Do something" about global warming, all nations should have open borders, even to Jihadists: don't have big families like rabbits,  but don't use contraception:  all atheists go to heaven:  "throwing food away" is stealing from the poor: trannies likened to nuclear weapons:    Roma locuta, causa inepta
OK... and what is your point? Call them by any other name, they are still the indigenous people of the region. Zionism was a European political philosophy, and it was Jewish emigration from Europe to Palestine (yes that was its name) in the 19th and 20th centuries that led to the creation of the modern State of Israel.   For example, one Benzion was born in Poland in 1910, where the family had lived for generations with the family name Mileikowsky.   On immigrating to Palestine, they changed the name to "Netanyahu". Benzion's son is now PM. What long, Jewish connection to the land does that family hold, compared to a Palestinian Christian or Arab who has lived there for generations?
In order to understand the term "islamophobia" we must also understand Islam's own misogyny, homophobia, hatred of  Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Europe,  America, democracy, dogs,  free speech,  human rights and everything else not permitted (haram) by Islam.
As for Canada being a 'currency manipulator', well, tell that to the NY Jews who actually DO manipulate our currency on behalf of the US gov't. They will laugh themselves silly.
Let us be very clear about the Crimea annexation. It used to belong to Russia in the first place. 95% of Crimean's voted to rejoin their motherland of Russia. The Crimean's are all Russian anyway and speak fluent Russian. The west has this all wrong. Crimea voted democratically to go back home to their motherland Russia. The Crimea was given to the Ukraine in one of Nikita Kruschev's drunken stupors.  Eastern Ukraine is primarily Russian to. The whole of Ukraine also belonged to Russia for some 300 years until they reached self-determination and broke from the former Soviet Union. In so far as Western Ukraine they are run by a bunch of Nazi's.  It should also be remembered that 2 million Jews disappeared in the Ukraine during World War 11. One can only wonder if  Ukrainians participated in that.   This  Trade Minister, for Trudeau, the Putin hater, better her get her facts straight and join Donald Trump in having more friendly relations with Putin and we will have World Peace at last.
(Part two of two)  Digging deeper, from the Jews, “The LORD” as distinct from current ruling politicians “comes, he comes to rule the earth.  He shall rule the world with justice and the peoples with his constancy” (Psalm 96:13).  There is more relevance in John 1:1-18.  “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word WAS God. . . . the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. . . .The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world” by means of the Faithful this day.  “ . . . full of grace and truth . . . grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.”  Very little ambiguous about that.  Black Catholics, with more than the usual mainstream Muslim relatives and friends, especially have plenty special offerings for the whole world today.  More: We have to stop thinking of the Church in terms of priests and nuns.—Monicadeangelis  and start thinking with the Church in terms of the Liturgy of the Word.
Are you saying that there were no Jewish senior scientists on Manhattan Project?  Well amuse us with the "real" story then...
When the British and others decided to give the land that is now the State of Israel to the Jewish people,  it left the Palestinians who were already there completely in the lurch and essentially stateless. While I commend the creation of the current State of Israel and support its right to exist, the job should have been done properly - rather than simply carving a chunk out of British Palestine, a Palestinian state with well-defined borders should have been set up too, if that had been done, everything would have made a lot more sense politically and decades of grief averted.
all citizens of Israel have equal rights. residents may not have all the same rights as citizens, but that is the same in any country. and Palestinians in Gaza and PA-controlled "West Bank" have their own governments and rights, where Jews have none.
Why should the majority of America move to Canada? Make Putin's Orange Poodle and his followers move to Canada. Better yet, make Congress resign and move to Israel since Congress funds Israels government run Single Payer Health Care Insurance Program, and funds the colonial jews theft of Palestinian resources and lands, putting American security and health care. behind Israels security and health care
and yet it is the arab world desiring to  cleans that area of jews
“continues to relay a message of disparagement” to Muslims. If you have  a religion that preaches they have the right to kill infidels, and if someone is a Christian or a Jew they can only live if they pay a special tax, would it not be reasonable to relay a message of disparagement?
"Everyone has a right to go one whatever websites they want to go on, generally speaking, so the fact that people are on websites that happen to be — whether they're white supremacist, anti-Jewish or neo-Nazi, or Islamic radicalism — until they do something generally speaking, all law enforcement can do is watch," Kelly said.  That statement, right there should scare the absolute BEEJEEZUS out of anybody in this country that cares even a little bit about the First Amendment and individual Rights in general.  The day we let government start regulating information (on the Internet or anyplace else) based on CONTENT and what THEY think is "bad"... Well, brother, that's it. GAME OVER MAN.  These people need to be reminded THEY are there to enact the will of the People, not enact their will ON the People.  Yep, we get it. Law enforcement isn't easy.  Too bad.  Stop trying to take the EASY way out by infringing on MY rights. Save that stuff for the criminals.
Try this one on for debate:  "Catholic Bishop Denies Funeral Rites to Jewish People."
You jewish las name and zionist background explains your anti-Muslim attack insulting the only democratically elected Muslim leader who is still in power, Erdogan, of course, following the failed coup which Israel, US, Germany and other Nato countries were behind. You are the same people who supported the coup in Egypt against another democratically elected president "Morsi" who is now behind bars while you installed, recognized, and supported the dictatorship installed in Egypt led by Al Sissi. Who do you think you are fooling with such bigoted and racist articles? When is Israel going to leave Palestine and give the land they stoke with the help of the Brits and the Americans back to the Palestinians is the bigger question and the only question that must be addressed and answered. It is time for you and liers like you to leave the Muslims alone and look at your own savage actions before you criticize anyone else in this world.
I read the opinion article with great interest, as I share the author's life experience growing up in a Berlin suburb since 1929. In my childhood I had to show two different faces , my normal one within the family, my neutralized one to the outside world, every day I was warned never to mention anything of what I heard discussed at home, because terrible things would then happen to the family. On my way to school in the morning of November 10th 1938 I had to pass the burning synagogue wondering why no fire engine was there, instead SA Brownshirts  were throwing stuff in there to make it burn better. We were three girls passing , shocked to our bones and started running.  At the Catholic school  our teacher had always reminded us on Saturdays to be quiet and respectful when passing this "Jewish Church" where people worshiped on Saturdays.  I could add many more experiences up to the end of World War II, that made our life hell and costing my father his liberty and life.
Similarly,  a pollster deliberately choosing 12 Clinton Democrats—or 12 Trump Republicans—to poll tells us nothing about the constitution of preference in the population. However, given the ratio of Democrats to Republicans in the population, we might be able to deduce whether the pollster deliberately picked his or her sample rather than drawing them randomly. In the case of the Bible, this deduction cannot be made with statistical significance, because the Bible's heavy preference for mentioning males makes the choice of 12 males just as likely to be without any deliberate intent as intentional.  An interesting side note is that the Bible's very heavy bias mentioning of Jewish people makes the argument that Jesus intentionally selected Jews for apostles also without statistical significance.
Though I am not a supporter of building the settlements, I do not believe giving back the land and towns would lead to a change in the Hamas/ Palestinian doctrine that preaches destruction and death to Israel(genocide). The Jews in Israel are left to fend for themselves for now.  Why is this different from any other night?  Obama and Kerry did what the felt was just.
Jews and Palestinians are both Semitic races. The hatreds and conflicts are real but they are not race based. Blame religion.
The reaction from conservatives to this is fascinating. During the Soviet era groups like the Ukrainian nationalists were the darling of the right (who didn't look too closely at their attitudes toward the Jewish population) because they were anti-soviet. Now, apparently because their god in Washington says so, the Russians, even the old Stalinist Soviet variety, are above reproach and the Ukrainian nationalists they once revered are now the enemy.
Their intent is admirable and reflective of some of the good to be found in any institution.  Unfortunately, this christian institution was founded on mythology and pieced together from the other religions known in the Middle East/Asia by a Pope 300 years after the supposed birth of its namesake.  Combining the new religion with the existing, one god religion of Judaism to eliminate the multiple gods of Roman/Greek religion to simulate the Roman Emperor, one man rule.  All performed at the behest of a Roman Emperor to aid in quelling uprisings within the empire.  The U.S. was formed by deists rejecting christian religion ruling Europe at the time.  Humanity has suffered from the religious dictatorship wielded by tyrants since the establishment of collective societies.  Christian, Islam, Judaism, et. all. their purpose is to for small groups to control the larger groups for the small group dominance.  All of the good works could be done without religion.
What is this about a "new Mass"?  While the Ninevites did repent of rejecting Diving truth, the Ninevites were neither Israeli not Jewish.  I guess, in that sense, all truth is Divine.  But such is not the point of the pericope.  The plain message is from "Lord, you are merciful and gracious" (Psalm 89:15), the Responsorial Antiphon for today.  Jonah did not like the idea of going out and preaching of the need to repent, prophesizing gloom and doom, then, by the grace of God, having the Ninevites repent, thereby avoiding prophesicized gloom and doom.    Sacred Scripture is nowhere mentioning dogmatic truth.  Dogmatic theology only began between 800 and 1200 with the beginning of scholasticism.
How can someone be "half jewish/half Egyptian"?  Jewish is a religion, Egyptian is a nationality.  Is a jewish Canadian "half jewish/half Canadian'? Or all jewish and all Canadian?
Most of the Jews in the Middle East moved to Israel already.  I have plenty of Jewish friends who have volunteered in kibbutzes in Israel. Victor Ostrovsky, the former Israeli Mossad agent, who wrote the book "By Way of Deception" which exposed a lot of Mossad operations, was a Canadian born Jew who moved to Israel.  After writing the book he moved back! he wasn't too popular with the Israeli government!
The Jewish population in Nazi Germany didn't look for conflict and look what that got them.
As a Christian, I can tell you that truth does exist, but I can't make you believe it right now. It's like if you had heard about bears but never seen one, even on TV or photos (which is true for a lot of people before TV and cameras). You might even have hiked in the forest a lot and never seen one. But the moment you do, especially when you realize it sees you too and starts coming for you, you will never question that bear's existence again.  The thing about agnosticism or atheism is that without believing in truth, neither can you believe in justice, because justice depends on truth and an ultimate arbiter of truth, who is God. And obviously, each person making their own "truth" does not qualify. So don't ever let me catch you saying something is not fair! The very statement testifies for God's existence.  If you are willing to fully let go of truth and justice and accept that any truth is only from whatever man can enforce it, then you are an atheist. Agnostics just won't decide.
Let me see if I understand you. You think Islam should be banned because Sharia Law violates the Constitution, i.e. the document that protects freedom of speech and religion. How does that work? How can the government tell people what [not] to believe "to protect them from Sharia Law" when the Constitution says the government is not allowed to tell us what to believe?  By the way, many forms of Christianity and Judaism have rules that would be unconstitutional if the government enacted them. But since we have freedom of religion here, if you don't like those rules, you are free to avoid those forms of religion.I'm divorced, which is banned by the Roman Catholic Church. And I eat pork, which is not allowed in Judaism or Islam. But I'm not Catholic,Jewish or Islamic. My Constitution says the government can't make me follow the rules of any particular religion and I like it that way. Sharia law is not taking over our country any more than the RC church is banning divorce for non Catholics
Each of the high and mighty commentators here, accusing the Jews of removing the "Palestinians" from their lands, is in Canada living on property that was owned by the Native peoples of this country--and you have taken away their lands and you are now living on it. Why is that an acceptable thing?
Well, let's see: what party was the president from who tried to impose his liberal, secular, atheistic, humanistic views on the Catholic Church?  What party of the two parties tends to trample religious rights--except of course when it comes to Muslims?  (The Democrats love Muslims) It certainly isn't the Republican party. It is not the fault of the Catholic bishops that they support religious freedom while the Democratic party does not.   The Democratic Party is obsessed with abortion--so---that makes them the party of death.  Suppose we had a president who supports slavery, but otherwise wants to help the poor, and do everything else you claim the Democrats do. Would you say "Well, yes he supports slavery, but look at all the poor he wants to help! We should support him!"    Same logic: abortion is fundamental.  When the Democrats support the destruction of innocent human under the guide of women's rights and "choice" the rest of the good they stand for is irrelevant.
According to mainline Christian myth "the fix was in" beforehand anyway. If their god knew all this was going to happen, why do they affix blame to mortals?   I remember a movie about WWII (forget title) about Jews being saved by a priest, I think. The casual way they used the term "Christ-killer" actually made me flinch. Those kinds of attitudes are what enabled people like Hitler.
I don't suppose your position has anything to do with the chunk of the 1 BILLION DOLLARS the Federal Government is handing out to take care of these refugees? Money that if spent in their homeland would help over 500x as many people? What would Jesus say about using our God-given resources so poorly? What would He said about spending money in a way that doesn't help the refugees left behind in these other countries? What would He say about participating in the spreading of Islam, an apostasy? This whole effort is misguided and shameful.
So....Jewish kids should be blown up in their school...is that your point ?
HATE is the mightiest force on earth . . . Abbas et al., THRIVE on it, PROPAGATE it, PREACH it and WALLOW in it.  You'd think the 'smart ones' like Dershowitz woulda figured that out by now . . . it ain't EVER going to happen, and there will be NO PEACE in the Middle East until which time there is a clear, decisive VICTOR.  NO PEACE until these Arabs recognize the RIGHT of Israel to exist as a Jewish state and decide to stop using the poor Palestinians as a pawns in their hate-filled world.   70 years . . . generations of humanity squandered by these Arab 'leaders'.  BUT, it's NEVER enough hate, is it . . . as we've seen for decades!
Well, let's stop and change then lens of how we are viewing all of this.  First, you are leaving out some particularly vital Gospel passages that give full support to regular attendance at Mass.  Jesus Himself told us that whenever two or more are gathered in His name, He is with us.  I know this doesn't just pertain to a Mass, but the Eucharistic Celebration is the Church's most public communal prayer of all of its rituals, and the Church itself recognized this as it progressed and grew in its second millennia. The symbol of joining as a community in observance of our shared beliefs has it roots in the earliest human groups when a number of those primitive peoples lived together in caves, and shared meals as part of their daily routine.  The Exodus story of the Jewish people's liberation from Egypt is full of accounts of shared meals and of course, manna from heaven to save them from starvation.  This all formed the basis for Jesus and His disciples (continued)
and unfortunately there are murders from all religions.  Check the Buddhist on Hindu violence in Burma.  He who is without sin should cast the first stone.
Why exactly do Muslims need to accept criticism of the Prophet to be viewed favorably by you?  Do you think no other religion/culture is intolerant?  Do Jewish people accept criticism of their religion, or more importantly, any negative commentary regarding the holocaust?  Of course not.  And yet your double standards don't seem to apply to that.
Jews are God's chosen people.  How dare the UN or anyone else tell them that they have done wrong!
"The CEO and most of the Brass are Liberal, elitist Jewish boys from urban backgrounds."  Your comment would still make some valid points even if you hadn't mentioned that the CEO and top administrators were Jewish. So, why the necessity to bring their religion into it? Elitism is not confined to any one religion. Being city-slickers pretending to be humble folks is a common publicity tactic not confined to members of any one religion. Just look at Ocean Spray ads or Blue Diamond Almond ads.
The problem is the Charter of rights can be over written by laws. As we see with Trudeau and Harper, the Charter is nothing but paper these days, a joke. We have already seen speech criminalized. The Charter was suppose to protect us from Harper's and even Trudeau's! Save us money, save us time, give us freedom, real freedom. What it did was give special rights to 'god' the Christians(jews and muslims), The French and the Natives. Pushing the rest of us as second caste citizens.
“While Israelis are “overwhelmingly well-intentioned, well-informed, and non-hateful,” the Palestinians “teach their children to hate and”  Someone with so much experience with the fanatical settlers certainly knows better.  The excellent Canadian documentary, "Lessons In Fear" shows that, while Palestinian animosity stems from what they experience under Israel's brutal,  illegal military occupation, Israeli schoolchildren are fed a revisionist version of their own history in state-supported schools, and this breeds hatred and misunderstanding.   New legislation makes it illegal for Arab-Israeli schools to teach about or commemorate the 'Naqba', where over 800 thousand Palestinians were driven from their homes by Zionist gangs and the fledgling Israeli military when Israel was founded.  It ends on a hopeful note, profiling an interfaith Muslim-Jewish school operated by a Christian group, which shows that through dialogue and education, this animosity can be overcome fairly quickly.
What is the Organization of the Islamic Conference doing?  57 Muslim countries  -  must the Christian West now fight Buddhist Burma to protect Muslims?  -  Christians (NATO) already fought Christians (Serbians) to protect Muslims in Bosnia and Kosova what thanks?  -  now let Muslims fight to protect Muslims
Women have often accepted the teaching of their male religious leaders, whether Catholic, Muslim, Hindu, or other, and accepted that they were inferior and should be relegated to the back of the room, etc.  Women accepted that they were secondary to men and shouldn't have the vote or go to university or be doctors, etc., that it was their responsibility to make sure they didn't get raped.   Women accepted that Mohammed wanted them to be "modest" and not show their face or hair, or interact with unrelated men.  It took modern feminism to change that.
Can you explain why you postulate, in your term : " God loves us ".   According to UNICEF - About 29,000 children under the age of five –  21 each minute – die every day. During the Black Plague in the Middle Age, some 75,000,000 to 200,000.000 infants - toddlers - teenagers - adult men, women, pregnant women, deacons, nuns, priests, RCC hierarchy, as well as Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus as well as all other Religions were killed. The Spanish Flu of 1918 killed from 50,000,000 to 100,000,000 of the above. According to HHS, in 2012 some 21,000,000 fetuses worldwide suffered miscarriage and died.   Why does your God so torture and prolong the death of so many who are suffering so horribly - especially the children ?  Could it be He isn't the loving God Christians believe Him to be ?
As usual, it is Christians and Jews helping their fellow man.  I pray for the day when atheists, Moslems, etc will also begin to do something positive for others.
1. Are you disappointed that the only one to 'like' your post, is yourself? So sad.  2. Your post is a non-sequitur so hardly surprising you had to up-vote yourself. Just because you have the freedom to worship whatever imaginary sky-being you wish, does not mean that he/she/it should have a role in electing a party leader. Why  do I think that if it was muslims or buddhists or janists influencing a vote, you would definitely not be in favour?
All Christians, regardless of denomination, believe Jesus is the One Way to God. It's why we're called "Christians".   St. Justin Martyr (d. 165) said that there were “seeds of truth” scattered about in the teaching of the great philosophers. St. Paul honored the Athenians for their pious worship of the “unknown” God (Acts 17). Catholics, unlike many/most protestants, believe there are “other sheep” who do not travel with the flock but who do belong to the Shepherd. They may be devotees of Mohammed or Buddha because their hearts have recognized some sparks of truth and goodness in the teaching of those men. If they die good Muslims or Buddhists and are saved, they are saved not by Mohammed or Buddha, but by Christ.   (Your sarcasm and misrepresentation of Christian and Catholic teaching is tiresome)
Please, I don't want to hear anything from the so-called "religious right" about anything after their support of Trump.  Not the evangelicals, Mormons, and especially the Catholic hierarchs.  To have embraced the election of this racist and misogynist as president betrays all of their supposed moral rectitude.  I just can't tolerate any of their moral condescension.
We can agree on many issues my Friend, But the Diety of Christ is where we will part ways:   “For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form.” Colossians 2:9   “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” John 1:1   “I and the Father are one.” 31 The Jews took up stones again to stone Him. 32 Jesus answered them, “I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?” 33 The Jews answered Him, “For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God.” John 10:30-33   “Jesus said to them, ‘Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.'” John 8:58   “Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!” John 20:28   “And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.” John 1:14
Many of us have had our names mispronounced, but if we wrote about a non-native Ango doing it, we would be called racist. For many with Anglo names or those from other countries have had our names mispronounced, read the comments on this article, about "Geoffrey" "Justiin" etc.   The non-native hostess called me for my table three times saying  'MORON"  but it was after she reading "MORIN" written by the other non-native hostess my name is: Maureen. It was Sibohan uses "SUE" in restaurants who made the connection, glad she did!  So i suggest state your name, Boluwaji once, it's not picked up.. just say you can use "Bo" for short. Get real!  Also, i have some Jewish friends who's parents/grandparents changed their surnames when they emigrated, like Gold from Goldstein, but my favourite was O'Barr - so they tried to be Irish... you don't have to do that today!
Racial hatred and violence is not more important than your free speech. The Germans in the 1930's proved that and so did the Soviets, where speaking ill of Jews led to their demise and eradication. May I send bomb threats and advocate violence against your community in the name of free speech?
This really is a useless article there is no 'ban' on cemeteries people were given a vote and they don't want another one in their area and the local Muslims don't want to share one - why this comes down to race and hate is really irksome as in Muslim communities they don't want a Jewish one in their neighbourhood but that's OK apparently and the 36 people had a vote which politicians want to overrule in some way ? Imam says "what are they afraid of" - it's not fear of anything they just don't want ANOTHER cemetery with all the traffic etc it brings...
How exactly does it threaten free speech? a) it is just a motion b) we have had past motions on anti-semitism yet I see lots of criticisms of the Jewish state and c) even if the motion passes I personally do feel at all constrained in what I can say provided it doesn't cross into hate speech about which we already have laws.
Your excuse building for Trump was compared to the excuse building by Christians for the glaringly wrong prognostications found in the Bible. If I were you I'd drop the agnostic label and go with atheist. Take a stand. However, your conservatism fits in nicely with the religious. Not so much with the non.
"Guns didn't preach atheistic hatred." No, but plenty of overly-righteous Christians try to blame atheists for everything bad. Consider this: the majority of Americans identify as being Christians, which means a majority of killers are also Christian. Perhaps a belief in an imaginary, worship-craving vampire leads to somebody becoming a killer because it sure doesn't stop them.
Completely different than Hitler. Hitler hated Jews and wanted to kill them.   The residential schools were set up to train the indigenous community to become good British citizens with a modern education, They did not understand the negative consequences of residential school at the time.   Its hard to judge people in the past with modern ethics. At one time even slavery was considered acceptable.
The Israeli Palestinian population is growing at a faster pace than the Jewish sector so more housing is needed to accommodate the Palestinians. A great and thoughtful move.
And yet German Christians were allowed to immigrate freely, before and after the wars where they killed more Canadians than anyone else in history.  My point was that Buddhists weren't treated fairly. Due to their race. I am sure a blonde blue eyed Muslim also gets a lot better treatment at airports. Due to his race.
Apples and oranges Scott.  A bakery and a restaurant are not the same.  A better question would be does a Jewish restaurant owner have to accept a contract to cater a pig roast for the KKK because they enter into contracts to cater a bar mitzvah?
Israel is the most destabalizing country in the middle east.  No other state would get away with stealing land from its neighbours without serious censure from the community of nations.  Lets not forget that it is a war crime to move ones population into conquered territory.  Don't believe the Israel Firsters out there who tell you that it is not an illegal occupation.  The International Court of Justice gave an Opinion in 2004 confirmed Israel was breaking international law.  Even the US (Jewish) and  UK Judges on the panel agreed with the substantive part of the Opinion.  It is time for the World Community to freeze out Israel for being a chronic abuser of international law.
I know many Muslims, Jews and others that dont celebrate.
Jesus also said ton the Pharisees who wrestled trying to trip him up on Jewish law: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’  Doesn't seem to be too many folks following the second one in here!!
Your original scenario was that Mass was being celebrated for 'ten atheists'. When I asked you why the priest in your scenario was celebrating Mass for ten atheists, you then changed the basis of your example (because you realised that you had made a mistake) to: your priest celebrating Mass because he 'desired to do so'. Your use of capital letters, in various of your 'replies' (and this is now your 18th), has only been to yell. And you are indeed repeating yourself - yet again. The 'point under discussion' between us, was the point that I chose to raise with you - namely, the validity or otherwise of a priest celebrating Mass without a minister or lay faithful present. The validity of your original scenario (or 'hypo', as you call it). Your general GIRM-lessness [General Instruction of the Roman Missal] has been evident throughout this discussion. I will leave it there, as I can see that there is no end to your desire to have the last word. Please feel free to have it now....
From what I understand, the Old Testament applies to Jews. This is their law. The Council of Jerusalem (50 AD) determined Gentiles could be Christians and weren't required to follow Jewish law.
Are you implying that an atheist is not as charitable as someone who is religious? Because that's what it sounds like. I'm an atheist and I am also charitable, and I'm not giving just to get me some points to use as leverage at the Pearly Gates.
Ok, that led me to a fascinating trip through Wikipedia. Not sure I can embrace a religion that relies on mediums and the vision of a few.   For me, what Krishnamurti said about religion holds, “So if you look to a priest for your guidance as a teacher, I say he is your destroyer or exploiter. Please, I have nothing against Christian priests or Hindu priests – to me they are all the same. I say they are unessential to humanity. " and "“Religions, with their beliefs, dogmas and creeds, have become tremendous barriers between human beings, dividing man against man, limiting him and destroying his intelligence.”http://www.kinfonet.org/articles/33-j-krishnamurti%E2%80%99s-critique-of-religion Hugh Massengill, Eugene
Don't be too hasty. Jews and Muslims don't eat pork.
Your attempt to put it all on the Western or White races is racist in its own right. Go to China and their attitudes towards those who are not "the same" are similar... and have been for most of recorded history. Or Africa.  Some people will pint to teh Islamic states and say "you see,  blacks are accepted here"... which is perhaps true, ut tehn see what their attitudes are towards Jews or Christians... there will be "racist" elements to their  thinking on those criteria. Every religion somehow magically thinks that they are superior to the other religions..  it is all learned responses, but it exists in every society, of every colour, every race, every culture. The fact that babies don't seem to have any problem dealing with the differences is proof enough that they are learned cultural responses rather than innate.
(continued - 1/2)  who gathered together for meals and prayers and talk, but always meals.  Jesus ate with all of those He could, even those we shouldn't have by Jewish custom like Roman and lepers and adulteresses and no-Jews, and so on.  Jesus not only inherited and followed ancient Hebrew perspectives on eating and drinking, He also expanded and stretched the symbolic meanings already created for meals (found in details in Matthew and Luke) to include the outcasts of Hebrew society such as tax collectors who served the Roman occupation.  So His meals became the fundamental symbol for what would come to be the basis for the community that was to be known as Church.  The Mass is the symbolic re-experience of a meal with Jesus, with the ancient symbols of bread and wine.  There is no reason for us NOT to attend Mass weekly or more often.  It is the direct outgrowth of how Jesus greeted and taught those that He loved and called to service.  The Church offers it for our spiritual food.
Au contraire, Motley. Not all Nazi swastikas were on an angle; the officiial standard of the Führer und Reichskanzler (i.e., Hitler) was parallel to the horizontal. So were the parade banner of brownshirt brigades. They did, however, have this feature in common: the crooked arms all bent to the right, not the left. A Buddhist or Hindu swastika typically bends to the left.
. the sack of garbage trump goes ahead and totally repudiates his forced apology. he has shown who he is.  he is a racist and he is an anti-semite - even if his daughter converted to judaism  his daughter put on a big charade the Sat night before the election with her visit (all frummed-up with a hat) to the Lubavitcher Rebbe's grave. The Lubavitcher Rebbe was one of the few in his extended family to survive Hitler. Jared Kushner has played the "my grandparents were survivors" long enough His fatehr-in-law defends Nazis. His father-in-law condones torchlight marches with grown men shouting "jews cannot replace us" his father-in-law is a racist - started out as a racist landlord then graduated to racist noisemaker his fatehr-in-law is either an anti-semite, or he just loves and defends them because they love and defend him  The "cutesy" couple of wealthy jews have to either take a stand or get the hell out of public view
This ban does not effect people from India or China, Phillipines. Programmers from Iraq and Syria (sounds like a fairy tale) Best programmers are Indian (Hindu) or Chinese. Dont believe me go to Waterloo University.
One Muslim will never criticism another. They will blame the Crusades, George Bush, Trump,  Jews, but they will never say  there is something wrong with their religion.  You will  be blamed for Islamophobia before they admit 9/11 was done by Muslims for Islam.
Better do some research on the Mormon Church history before making such a brash comment.  And by the way, God has nothing to do with this or any other murder.
I was referring to your assertion that there are Catholics who like ISIS and the Taliban want to see other Christians and non-Catholics murdered, tortured and physically punished. Are you serious about this? If you are, where is your evidence for it? 'Taliban Catholicism' is a term coined by John L Allen jr in opposition to George Weigel's 'Catholic Lite'. Allen goes out of his way to stress that he is not likening such Catholics literally to the real, murderous Taliban. You have obviously taken him literally, that is what, perhaps uncharitably, I found funny.
Part 2 More important than all of this, is the context of Mt19.3-12. At the time of Jesus, there were two views about divorce contending with one another. One, the then modern Pharisaical opinion, was that a  man (but not a women) could divorce his spouse, that is, obtain a "git," a certificate of divorce, "for any cause." Therefore, the question the Pharisees asked in Mt19.3, was whether Jesus supported their view..."Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife 'for any cause'?" The Greek here (kata pasan aitiav) is a reference to this new fandangeled Pharisaical opinion.   Jesus disagreed, supporting instead the traditional view in Leviticus, the opinion of the conservative Sadduccees, that both men and women may obtain a divorce for the single reason of "porneia."  The upshot--it is not true that Jesus absolutely rejected divorce in the NT. Mark suggests he did, and Paul states that he did, but Matthew provides the full Jewish context of relevant teaching. The magisterium is wrong.
Protestants? Jews?
Harry, This is America where people are free to worship whomever--Tom Brady, Russell Wilson, surgeons like Sid Schwab, or evangelists like Billy Graham, Jimmy Schweigert, Jimmy and Tammy Fay Baker, or our latest scam artist, Donald Trump. America is not a Christian Theocracy which you want to impose on everyone.   Not all of us take the Bible literally like you and other gullible people who believe Jesus was born from a virgin and deliberately had himself tortured and executed because he couldn't think of a better way to forgive the theft of an apple, committed at the instigation of a talking snake. Ronald Reagan, Jr. (who lives in Seattle) is a highly moral and ethical person who happens to be an avowed atheist.  He had good parents. Some of my Christian friends believe we are close to "End Times".  They believe Donald Trump just may be the Anti-Christ.   Harry, who do you think is the Anti-Christ?
Violent attacks against jewish people should be universally condemned as should attacks against any other group. However there is growing frustration against the policies of Israel that violate international law. Recent Ekos polls (this Feb and March) investigate the attitudes of Canadians to our governments pro Israel policies and the governments condemnation of the Boycott/Divest and Sanction movement. It appears majorities do not support pro Israel policies while Israel continues to violate international law by continuing to build settlements on Palestinian land. Also a majority of Canadians think that the BDS campaign is a reasonable measure to counter the Israeli actions. Why is this not a matter for news?
About  99% of all the UN resolutions are ignored by every country the resolutions have ever been passed against.....Why would Israel listen to that jew-hating circus called UN when nobody else does?
i am using this correctly. Jesus is of Jewish culture. Knowing this you would know that homosexuality and other 'choices' were not acceptable. He would never have condoned it, even though liberals love to trot out 'He never condemned it'. He didn't have to.  We have many false teachers- as I have pointed out.
As this attack was by Islamic State against Egypt, not by Egyptians acting out of bigotry in the face of indifference from the government, unlike some other recent attacks, it doesn't put the legitimacy of the Egyptian government into question.  Hopefully, Copts and Muslims can live side-by-side peacefully in Egypt; if not, giving the Copts of Egypt the same ability to protect their own security as is enjoyed by the Jews of Israel, as the unchallangeable masters of the land should not be off the table. Somehow, the message has to be sent that the existence of Israel is no excuse for terrorism, in a loud, clear, and convincing manner.
A quick addendum to the foregoing: After expelling the Jews from the Old City of Jerusalem in May, 1948, Colonel Abdullah Al-Tal told his superiors: "For the first time in 1,000 years not a single Jew remains in the Jewish Quarter. Not a single building remains intact. This makes the Jews' return here impossible."   The Hurva Synagogue, built in 1701, was blown up by the Arab Legion. During the 19 years that Jordan occupied the Old City, all but one of the 35 Jewish houses of worship in the Old City were destroyed. The synagogues were razed or pillaged and stripped, and their interiors used as hen-houses or stables.
In think let Biko also know that his sons Andile Mngxitama and BLF are obnoxious racists and antisemites who makes fun of the Holocaust and how Jews were "turned into soap" by the Nazis. But would you expect of an intrinsically and explicitly racist ideology.
I am very sorry that you and your son were the victims of an ignorant verbal assault. No one should be subjected to that, especially a child. I am interested that you both practice as psychologists and wonder how you reconcile your work as psychologists in Toronto with core values informed by Islam. How do you treat your gay clients? How about any Jewish or Christian clients? Muslims wishing to leave the faith? What about the slurs that come from Muslim children towards others in the playground, especially towards non-Muslim girls? More detail is needed about how your Muslim values are totally compatible with Canadian values and I would genuinely be interested in reading another piece about this.
"Which is your 'faith' which is unprovable, but must just be accepted without proof."  Yes, and I told you I can't prove it to you right now. But that doesn't mean there is no evidence upon which to base a decision for yourself. God exists or he does not, those are the only two possibilities. I believe one way, atheists the other. You choose to be wrong no matter what by not accepting either possibility and living it fully! Faith, according to the Bible is belief in what cannot be seen. You do that every day if you think about it. So which of the two is the better way to live? Is fairness from God, our made up by man?  If God exists, whatever he does is by definition "fair." Even bears eating mockers. Nowhere in the Bible does it say slave owning is fair. But it does recognize the practice exists in this fallen world, and has recommendations for both slaves and slaveholders that will matter far more in the long run. Jesus was far more concerned with our own self-imposed slavery to sin.
You know this was an Obama supporter, ... how? Because conservative anti-Semite thugs are always so respectful of Jewish synagogues and cemeteries? And, ... don't get upset when people call Trump derogatory names.
Atheism is the only rational point of view.   Anything else is subjective.   Jesus as recorded (much after his "death") is the same as all other figments of the creative human imagination.
A final few words... as the writer constantly lumps all aethists into one homogenous group, let me speak on behalf of fellow atheists... we are NOT "angry at God". We do not believe in the existence of your "God", therefore it makes no sense to claim we have any emotion towards your construct.
I couldn't care less what FFRF's letter says. Especially when they're wrong. I care about case law.  The Freedom from religion is not whom I would get any information on as to what discriminates against a religion, they wish to discriminate against ALL religion. They are a biased source.  You are accusing me of a limited knowledge of case law, but you misrepresenting Greece v Galloway. Greece v Galloway  supports Kenai. The city of Greece had a very similar policy. Greece v. Galloway held that the City of Greece had NO obligation to go out side its borders to find minority faiths.  It also did not say a word about Atheism.  "The District Court found no authority for the proposition that the First Amendment required Greece to invite clergy from congregations beyond its borders in order to achieve a minimum level of religious diversity."  As long as the Borough allows invocations of all congregations within its borders, their policy is legal.   Greece V. Galloway support Kenai not you.
Since you have copied & pasted this same ridiculous comment all week, I am compelled to point out your exaggerations.  In the history of the planet, the CCP would not make the top 100.  In the past 100 years, they probably wouldn't make the top 10.  Perhaps you have heard that Saudi Arabia still allows public floggings, amputations & beheadings.  Canadian companies have a contract to sell $15 Billion worth of armoured troop carriers to the Saudis and the public has hardly batted an eye.  Even Justin could not reverse that deal.  The CCP will not permit a public debate of human rights, so we need to eliminate this issue from trade talks.  We will have far greater influence on these issues in private discussions after we have forged political & economic alliances.  I am appalled at their treatment of the Falun Gong, and the oppression of Muslim Uyghurs in the western provinces, and of course the Buddhist in Tibet.  Name a country that has NOT oppressed its minority  populations.
no one should hold responsible for grandfather wrongdoing, unless you are doing the same. Current regime in Ukraine is openly Nazi regime ( Polish parliament condemned it) and any support from Canada to Ukraine will be like repeating mistakes with Jewish refuges all over again.
Twice now Muslims have worked harder than just about anyone other than the Jewish victims themselves to repair the damage to graveyards.  I've taken to Facebook on each instance, both on my own page as well as in groups, to highlight this.  Speaking as someone with a number of Muslim friends and acquaintances, as well as someone who has traveled in Islamic countries, the actions by Muslims in solidarity with Jewish victims represents the true spirit of Islam that I have encountered.
sylvia, All the Palestinians and Arabs had to do was not attacking Israel. Now the Jew-haters continue their terrorist tactics instead of negotiating. A topsy-turvy world, too difficult to research an issue when you can just ignore reality. Ever wonder how trump got in?
When we see Muslims agreeing to burials next to Jews, Catholics, native Indians, etc. than we'll know they are serious about integration.
Have Catholic students asked for a room for praying and fasting?  (A room for fasting?) Have jewish students? Or are you just making up problems?  So many questions.
Imagine using the adjective "toxic" in front on any other cultural group.  You wouldn't get away with it!  Toxic Islam; Toxic Jews; Toxic Christians; Toxic Homosexuals;  Toxic Feminists; Toxic Chinese... and on and on.  I suggest that there is no good reason that you should get away with saying Toxic Masculinity!  It's as inappropriate as all of those other categories listed above!
DoninKansas, So sorry Don.  We all are with you, our spirits are one and with total compassion for you and so many others. Here is or might be a comforting thought. I have a friend who is a now retired Protestant pastor. He and I have talked about this issue. The Protestants and the Jews deal with this issue as well. BUT - BUT both faiths deal with the issue way-far more effectively and efficiently than our Catholic Faith.  Those faiths deal with child sex abuse immediately and permanently. Any pastor or Rabbi is banned forever from ever having another congregation. Sooo, if they can do it so can we -- no one has to reinvent the wheel, but only to learn from those others who do so with great fortitude and in proper spirit. Don, many thanks for sharing your experience with us a making this problem very REAL for us all.    All the best to you and yours-- bob
Saw your reply to my other post giving the same link.  Again, the Nazis did disarm the Jews, who they wanted to reduce their ability to defend themselves.  Popguns against the government and police?  Again, incidents in Iraq shows the effectiveness of armed populace (even if you don't agree with who is armed) against a heavily armed government and its police.  Second, nothing guarantees that all of the police and military will side with the government.  Historical incidents exist where the military sided with the citizens instead.  But, none of it applies to me.  I'm in the process of leaving here and moving to Taiwan, where their citizens actually respect each other, unlike here.  You can keep this mess, and I don't care what you and your government does with its guns.  I'm going to gladly leave mine behind, as I'll have zero use for them since their culture actually has morals, unlike this selfish culture.  I'm just posting to facts, which you seem confused about.
Kuroiwaj - You are fooling yourself.  There is no law that specifically says a person can't be prejudiced.  There is no law that specifically says a person has to treat everyone else equally.   Even if there are, there would be no way to prove/enforce them.   Do you really believe that blacks, asians, foreigners, handicapped, poor, ugly, muslims, buddhists, etc. were/are treated equally?  Wake up or open your eyes.
Who are the so called 'alt left' and have you proof that they hate jews? We already know what the alt right thinks don't we? As far as setting up Trump. He doesn't need help. His words have reverberations; cause and effect. I find it worthy of noting that the rise of anti-semitism and hate for anyone not white has suddenly risen with the ascension of Trump.
"Many radical environmentalists can accurately be labeled “nature mystics.” And many of them express affinity with religions they generally consider more nature-beneficient than occidental religions, such as those originating in Asia such as Buddhism and Daoism, religious beliefs or practices surviving among the world’s remnant indigenous peoples, or being revitalized or invented anew, such as PAGANISM and WICCA. Paganism and Wicca are considered to be (or to be inspired by) the Aboriginal nature religions of the Western world, which have been long suppressed by imperial Christianity and Islam."
Actually the slippery slope to authoritarianism is singling out Jews for bomb threats and violent Jew hatred. The authoritarian Soviets attacked Jews and targeted them for racial harassment as did the Germans, both groups falsely claiming that Jews were the source of their unjust economic circumstances.
Jesus was more like Pope Francis, oops. I mean Pope Francis is more like Jesus, in so many ways. Jesus reintroduced ambiguity, reflection and discernment into "being Jewish".  It's like advising/counselling: "stop, think, reflect...there just be more to this situation than knee-jerk rotism". That's what Jesus meant "to be taken seriously", I think.
It upsets me every time I read something by Alan Dershowitz implying that the UN partitioned Palestine in 1947, such as his sentence here: "There is a widespread but false belief that Mahmoud Abbas is finally prepared to accept the two-state solution proposed by the U.N. in November 1947 when it divided mandatory Palestine into two areas: one for the Jewish People; the other for the Arab People."   The UN did NOT divide mandatory Palestine into two areas. The UN General Assembly, which passed the Partition Resolution (Resolution 181), cannot make binding resolutions. Only the UN Security Council can make binding resolutions, and even then it can make them only under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which has to do with maintaining peace between nations. All other UN resolutions function only as recommendations. Surely Alan Dershowitz knows this.   Why, then, does he persist in this historical falsehood?
They are a registered charity and we're unsurprisingly not audited during evangelical Stephen's charity inquisition.
(...CONTINUED FROM ABOVE)  You said: "You know well as I do that it is not ethnic differences that is creating the havoc today but religious difference. Palestinian Jews and Arabs are divided by faith, not race. So it really don't matter who was there first."  Then why do you keep inaccurately arguing that Jews continuously inhabited it "since the dawn of time"?  You said: "Who do you think the Zionists are.....Ewoks?? They are Jews, Freddie...Zionists are Jews."  Sorry, I've known many Zionist Christians, and quite a few anti-Zionist Jews.  And you've again contradicted yourself.  Don't feel bad, Zionists Jews do it all the time.  Is “Jewishness” determined by faith, or by ancestry?  You claim the former in arguing that both peoples in this conflict are Semites.  Your problem, then, is to explain how your criterion applies when (1) 70% of Israelis are ATHEISTS, and (2) how Israel’s ruling cadre—the Ashkenaziim—are NOT Semites.   (CONTINUED BELOW...)
The trouble is, liberals would shove tea party whackos into the "other", conservatives would push the "liberalism is a mental disease" liberals into the "other", fundamentalists would push gays and lesbians, bis and trans (and maybe questioning) people into the "other", racists would want black folks in there, and maybe some jews would also be turned away and forced to use the "other", and while we are at it we'd put the homeless, the fatties, vegans, Tesla-drivers, man-bun wearers, and chicken BBQ pizza eaters.  In short, the "other" would end up pretty crowded.
What is worrying and why this sort of misdirection by the ANCYL must be sorted is that this could be the thin end of a wedge. Now it is illegal immigrants who are being targeted. Next it could be the legal immigrants, then the permanent residents. Then next in line are those citizens who are not of African origin. Remember the run up to Hitler's Jewish pogrom! All it takes for evil to succeed is for good people to do nothing. Richard - go for it.
"Putin Regime"!?  Shame on the Globe and Mail Lugenpresse. And shame on Freeland for covering up the truth and then looking to the old  Cold War scapegoat - Russia.  Ralph Goodale has also beshat himself with the claim that "Russia hacked the DNC servers". There is not a shred of evidence to that effect but there is an eyewitness to the 'leak', a past UK ambassador who actually received the LEAKED, not hacked, information.  How insane is it to have a FM who is on the sanctions list of a world superpower?  'Irresponsibility' and 'appeasement' of the Canadian Banderist Ukrainian community is a shabby way for PM Trudeau's 'regime'  to seize and keep power.  More interesting still is that the Jewish Zionist lobby must have known about this and agreed to keep it quiet.  I wonder what secret deals were cut at Canada's expense?  Russia and Russian Canadians deserve an apology.   Trudeau must be told that the Cold War is over, no matter what Freeland may think and wish.  Freeland must resign.
You do know that natural Jewish is determined by one's mother and not one's father?   Jesus spoke these words to Nicodemus: "Believe me, no man can enter into the kingdom of God unless birth comes to him from water, and from the Holy Spirit. What is born by natural birth is a thing of nature, what is born by spiritual birth is a thing of spirit."   Jesus chose only Jews because He came as their Messiah. His choice of twelve was symbolic. However, He chose only men as His Apostles after a night of prayer: "It was at this time that he went out on to the mountain-side, and passed the whole night offering prayer to God, and when day dawned, he called his disciples to him, choosing out twelve of them; these he called his apostles."
I still believe and feel that there really is no difference between Catholicism and Protestantism since Vatican II and that's why many people left the Church over the past 5 decades. I remember the RCC before 1962: It had a STRONG identity and most Catholics believed it was "THE TRUE CHURCH." Not anymore. That's why people left. Why should I remain Catholic and follow all those rules when I can get to Heaven just as easily as my Protestant, Jewish, Muslim, or atheist neighbors who don't have to follow these rules. To leave is very logical, and that's why most did.
The problem with the extreme Ukrainian Nationalism of WW2, is that it still exists today. The Globe deleted my link to a torch-lit parade days ago, held by extremists in western Ukraine to honour Roman Shukhevych, a OUN General. The.OUN was involved in the mass murders of both Jews, and Poles. They were directly supported by the Nazis.  In modern-day Ukraine there was the Odessa Massacre of Russian-speaking Ukrainians just two years ago. To this day, no one has been arrested despite it being on social media.  Sure, Just like Russia isn't responsible for the sins of Ukraine, Freeland isn't responsible for the sins of her grandfather.  Instead of training Ukrainians how to kill, she should be pressing Ukraine on its Human Rights record, and bringing reconciliation between the Ukrainian-speaking West, and the Russian-speaking East.
The foreign aid comes back to the West. Switzerland kept billions of dollars of Nazi gold, jewish assets (which were not claimed by their dead owners), etc. Drug money from Colombia went there too.  The Swiss have been doing this for decades. The only time they stopped is when the US clamped down on terrorist funding.
he wasn't a Christian. he also was an Atheist.
If there is a "line" drawn, that we all as humanity assembled agree we will not allow, it should be the purposeful mass-murder of children and worse do it this way, with an internationally banned agony-causing chemical weapon should be AND IS, a crime.  If these violations (of any thread of decency)  just continue of their own volition without the intervention of civilized nations or even the US and it`s allies, then we are the less for it, and will be seen as turning the other cheek to mass chemical child murders.  Sometimes your hand is forced.  I think the President see`s the layout of the land..sharp businessman that he is.  Just my two cents.  The country who`s uniform I wore wouldn`t stand for this.  Not after Auschwitz and Hitler, and the gassing of millions of the Jewish faith. No sir.
A Jewish woman pre-judging a Catholic woman about potential prejudice.  I think Feinstein should have recused herself.  Her own religious motives prevented her from being fair-minded.
The Jews were persecuted and fleeing for safety. None of them wanted to fly planes into buildings or blow people and things up.
Come on George, everyone knows what you can buy for real money. At the governor's palace early one morning. Pilate, the Roman governor, examines Jesus and decides he is innocent; the Jewish leaders and the crowd demand Jesus’ death; Pilate gives them the choice of saving Barabbas, a criminal, or saving Jesus. (see; Democracy definition) In response to the screaming mob Pilate sends Jesus out to be crucified. According to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas, the betrayer, is filled with remorse and tries to return the money he was paid for betraying Jesus. When the high priests say that that is his affair, Judas throws the 30 pieces of silver into the temple, goes off, and hangs himself.
When my Jewish neighbor passed away, I was asked by his family to read Kaddish in English at his graveside ceremony following a reading in Hebrew by a the local rabbi.  With only my neighbor's immediate family, my wife, and another neighbor standing before the casket over an open grave during a beautiful California morning, the beauty and power of the Kaddish prayer resonated with its simple acknowledgement of "the One".   I have two Jewish sons-in-law, one of whom was raised in Israel.   One of my final wishes is for them to read Kaddish at my funeral, both in Hebrew and English.  Hopefully this request would be deemed acceptable from both Jewish and Catholic perspectives.
One wonders how many of these French are Jewish, escaping the rising wave of Judenhass that has swept France. Regardless, the result is to the betterment of Canada and PQ. Bienvenue, et Santé!
I have twice noted issues between my family and SA Indians in my life. When Muslim businessmen refused me a seat in their offices, despite requesting business mentoring. Also, my son and an Indian colleague were refused, by her parents (northern Hindus) permission to see a movie together or to share coffee together after work. The lass was locked up to keep them apart and had her mobile phone and computer taken away; she obviously lost her student job due to the extreme punishment. There was a disparity between those who came to SA. It was mainly Muslim traders who paid their own way, seeing trading opportunities here. Indentured labourers arrived under completely different circumstances; some had their berths paid for by the sugar cane companies for whom they worked and some brought entire families with them. The debt had to be paid back from their salaries; rooms and salaries were meant only for single men, causing great dissatisfaction. I grew up among Indians...
In historical terms the whole of Jerusalem ( founded  1000 years ago) was  Jewish...it has been destroyed twice, captured and recaptured 44 times...Arabic speaking people first  conquered it in 638 AD...since then it has bennconquered and reconquerd  with Crusaders massacring both Muslim and Jewish inhabitants in 1099.  Despite everything, the Jewish people gravitated back to it time and time again.
2.2 million Orthodox Jews who are indeed Orthodox around globe. 1.6 billion Muslims.
So if a jewish lady ran a bakery and a Nazi skin head wanted to celebrate Hitler with a cake should she be forced to make it? And whats the difference? Im no nazi just pointing out that we shouldnt be forced to do anything in America. If you dont like the service go somewhere else.. Its that simple! The pc world now is a joke! Placing anyone group over another isnt what it should be about..
Atheists tend to be atheists because the claims believers make are made with out strong evidence to back them up.  It is a quite justifiable view point and a far cry from blind faith belief with no evidence as you characterize it.
The parable emphasizes the potential holiness of those society rejected. It is apt. No one persecutes Samaritans anymore (although in Europe their Romany cousins due face hate).  God's teachings occur within history. If you don't understand that history you have turned them into an icon.  My main point is that scripture is tangential to natural law discussions. It is pulling the authority card, usually badly because the scholarship on Leviticus shows it to be about national building for the Jews, not discerning the will of God.
“Eichmann”, “Eichmann” ... where have a I run into this as an epithet before?   Just like him, except Eichmann was a radical anti-semite, and he is following the Jewish carpenter from Galilea.  And Eichmann was a raving racist, while he is following the teacher of brotherhood.  And Eichmann was a practioner of violence, while he is following the Prince of Peace.  And Eichmann followed illegal orders from a rogue government, while he is following the teaching of the Church Christ Himself commanded to teach and bind.  It would appear that he would only be like Eichmann if he followed you rather than the Church.
Jade: That is not how it happened.  I am going to use this response to pose a question.  How is Jesus's empty tomb explained?  The Romans had no reason to take the body.  The Jewish leaders were complaining that somebody might take the body.  Roman soldiers were facing death if they let anybody take the body.  They were also facing death if they fell asleep.   There were reportedly  500 people that saw him alive, some repeatedly.   How is that explained?
Don't read too much into that.  Note the quotation marks implying what I've clearly stated elsewhere--the Zionist entity's usurpation of this holy name is a spiritual crime in and of itself.  As for other "arguments":  (1) Failing to immediately mention something during ongoing discussion doesn't constitute tacit approval of it.  Should I castigate your for "implicitly praising" US cops getting way with murder of black folks because you haven't mentioned it? (2) I'm Shi'a.  I have repeatedly protested atrocities perpetrated by Hamas, the da'esh ("ISIS") and their ilk against noncombatants REGARDLESS of 'religious label'.  Unlike you, I don't make excuses for atrocities by minimizing them as "squabbles" or "internal ferment".  The Zionists DELIBERATELY and FATALLY irradiated 100,000 Jewish CHILDREN!  How loudly would you scream had this been done by Arabs?  Hypocrisy. (3) And no, it isn't a 'plus'.  Praising it as if it somehow 'balances' mass-murder of children is morally repugnant.
Now, if this was a true test, you would have brought 2 STOLEN grocery carts full of crap, 3 STOLEN bikes, 2 tents for one person (the other is for passer by's to visit) and LOTS AND LOTS of garbage.  Let it blow all over the streets that's ok now.  Plus you must defecate in the bushes, (seen it done on Stark St.)   No one is FIXING the problem of homelessness.  They are just pacifying it.  "let's just set-up another illegal homeless camp"    Rule One:  MAKE PANHANDLING ILLEGAL.  If someone really needs help, they can go to a homeless shelter, Salvation Army or more.  Plus, Religion needs to stay out of it.  No one should be forced to listen to a sermon to get food or they don't get fed by being the following: Practicing atheism, agnosticism, religious dissidence, and secular humanism.  Rule Two:  NO CAMPING ALLOWED ON ANY PUBLIC LANDS.  Nuf' Said.  Rule Three:  Have a Registration fee of $2.00 added to Auto's to help pay for REAL work for the homeless. (elect cars are not void!)
The commenters posting here seemingly have little knowledge of Islam.   I estimate there are only about 5-10% of Muslims that I consider friendly.  The friendly include: 1. Kurds, who treat women as equals, include Jews in society and commerce, and field all-women infantry battalions.  I have read that when Daesh (ISIS)fighters see them coming, they flee and scatter. 2. Ismailis, the only group (eg. "denomination") with a leader, the Harvard-educated Aga Khan IV. 3. Ahmadi, of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.  A much loved Ahmadi Shopkeeper in Glasgow, who sent Easter Greetings to his customers, was Executed by a Sunni (or Shia) Muslim extremist. 4. Sufi, found in all Muslim societies, but in large groups in Turkey and Indonesia.  Jones is a Sufi.  An American Sufi leader visited about 200 U.S. Mosques and then testified to Congress that about 90% were advocating JIHAD, "peaceful", as in Germany and Sweden, the Rape Capitals of Europe, or violent, like the Saudi Sunni Salafis of 9/11.
She "nailed" nothing. ======== Let's say I walk into a Jewish Bakery, a Gay Bakery, a Muslim Bakery, and a Buddhist Bakery because I didn't know they were Jewish, Gay, Muslim, or Buddhist.....and I ask them to decorate a Christian Wedding Cake with "crosses" and "May Jesus Bless Our Marriage" written on it......and they decline because doing so goes against their religious beliefs or same-sex values. - Sure, I might be sad. But wouldn't I just find another bakery that (1) wants my business (2) will gladly create the "edible art work" I want? Of course I would.
Yes, notice.  And compare with where the Democratic Party has traveled over the past 50 years . . . . the party of abortion, gay marriage, and general disdain for traditional American and Judeo-Christian values.  Do notice.
Asute political analysis, Chad, to notice the direction of the pistil dangling, as it is a political weathervane as to the direction of Gabbards' political stance.  When we see her displaying campaign pictures with the pistil dangling conservatively to the right, we know that she is feeling the pull of the religious right and their biblical missionary position.  If the pistil is pointing to the left that means Tulsi is in the libertine groove and ready for some multiethnic, metrosexual partying to a secular beat. If the hibiscus pistil is sticking straight-up like a tantric Hindu god, political pundits have speculated that the upward direction will indicate a radical departure from the past "Narcissist-in-Chiefs" and signify a universalist crusade to populate any planet the human race can get to before planet earth serves humans an eviction notice.
I don't recall nazi's being only concerned with jews. The holocaust alone was 2 mil pols, 6mil jews, 7mil russians....goes on. I could argue with nazi sympathizers all day, but thats not the issue.   Those people have a right to say that as do the others whom disagreed. Their views are not excluded under the non-absolution of our freedom of speech. The failure to understand our rights has led to the removal of hundreds of monuments, not just confederacy ones. Which by the way, southerns pride their right to rebel not the right to own a slave. I just think the entire thing should have been done diplomatically, not with an iron fist leading to the "facism" the one side seeks to abolish...which we don't have currently.   We're headed down a slippery slope to the battle of defending rights and liberties against the dynamic mainstream morality on a large scale.
No, I don't this so.   The problem with Palestine was that it did not belong to England, or the UN, both of whom had no right to partition anything, let alone Palestine.   And it sought to "accommodate the right of the Jewish people to self-determination and self-government" at the expense of the people already there--Muslim and Christian Palestinians, who formed the vast majority of the existing population. .  Moreover if the partition of India (a British colony) caused such displacement and loss of life, why would anyone think it was a good idea to submit Palestine to the same treatment?  "Colonialism" is exactly what it is about. As for "Euro centric conceit," that describes the founding of the State of Israel quite aptly. It's ironic you should use it against critics of Israeli.  The two-state solution has failed. Let's see whether Israel-Palestine becomes a democracy for all the inhabitants, or continues on the path of treating the Palestinians as untermensch.
There is no basis to blame "Jewish people" at large, and that statement is deplorable.   Not all Jewish people support Israel.   Yes, their leaders are to blame when nationalist pride crosses into ethno-religious supremacy and fascism. And the Israelis who support those leaders also are responsible. But the issue is the policy and conduct of the modern State of Israeli, not Judaism as a religion or Jews as a people..
I find this very troubling but on the flipside I also have extreme concern with most of our media outlets and this Liberal government intentionally trying to downplay and hide information from the public when actual hate sermons and requests to kill Jews are being delivered like we saw in Toronto and Montreal.
(CONT) Twenty Grand was a race horse. When homesteaders like Glenn Briggs and Raymond Tedrow first started subdividing and developing Eagle River in the 1960s or 1970s, there was one part which contained a series of streets named after horses. It's the subdivision just east of Homestead Elementary and a little ways north of Walmart.  Back to Tony Dimond, I dunno why we make such a big deal out of "led opposition in Congress to opening Alaska to Jews threatened by the Holocaust", an extremely minor episode in Alaska history but evidently justification for a recent pop-culture thing, namely that book. When Dimond left Congress, he moved to Anchorage, where he became a federal judge and was then in private practice during the last years of his life. From old maps, Dimond Boulevard was originally Campbell Road and/or Sand Lake Road, but I've yet to discover why the road was renamed after him.  Finally, Wohlforth offers no expanation for why we should rename roads after his liberal heroes.
When our first grandchild died an hour after his birth, a Jewish couple who are friends of ours came and recited the Kaddish with my wife and me. They reminded us that we have to remember our faith in God even when we mourn. Their doing so was a comfort to us.  When my wife and I went to Auschwitz some years ago, I put on a yarmulke and prayer shawl and recited the Kaddish for my Jewish mother's parents who were killed there, as well as for all the others murdered in that hellish place.  My mother died recently, and donated her body to a medical college. When they are done with it, it will be cremated. My wife and I intend to return to Auschwitz with her ashes, so she can be with so many of her relatives who died in the Holocaust.
Paul, you say it's just very hard to quantify just how successful these (Israel's) lobbying efforts are. Think $$$...! In addition to the 38 billion Memorandum of Understanding, US Aid to Israel over ten years as explained here https://tinyurl.com/zs7aqqs, Israel Affinity Organizations, as defined by 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status and that must "actively and unconditionally support Israel as a major function" received $3,672,087,969 in 2012, and are projected to make $7,301,020,938 by 2020. Grant Smith divides 336 IAOs into four categories: Subsidy, Fundraising and Political Action, Advocacy, and Education in his well-documented book, Big Israel. These IAOs are also listed on his archive website, http://israellobby.org/. Some of the organizations Smith mentions are active in Eugene, like the JCRC, considered a "mini AIPAC" within Jewish Federations to stifle public support of Palestinian rights. This is why Netanyahu can state, "America is a thing you can move very easily."
1. Ok, I'll go out on a limb and we'll see where it goes. In my view, the Twelve remained "hidden" for many years after Jesus' death, while Paul and his companions proclaimed a highly theologized and minimally historical Jesus as Messiah, savior and Lord. When Paul dies (in Rome?), the unknown author known to us as Mark writes his narrative, filling in the blanks Paul's proclamation had left and, more importantly, answering questions posed by those who challenged the validity of Paul's version of the gospel. Among those questions was why Jesus died as he did, executed as a common criminal, charged with rebellion -- a description that could easily have applied to John as well, especially if we take Josephus half seriously. Mark "cleaned up" their reputations, portraying them as exclusively spiritual, and therefore as misunderstood by their companions and especially by the Jewish authorities and Romans. When Mark's gospel was only partially successful, Matthew and Luke took up the cause.
1/2 Mussolini was not Hitler.  Mussolini was not anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic, or a Nazi.  David Kercher in "The Popes Against the Jews" argued that the Church provided the groundwork for the Holocaust.  Unfortunately his selective history reads like a polemic:  http://www.catholicleague.org/david-kertzer-the-popes-against-the-jews-3/  https://www.firstthings.com/article/2002/02/002-case-for-the-prosecution  "Although an excellent and well-written piece of historical research, The Popes Against the Jews goes out of its way to magnify the role of anti-Semitism within the Catholic Church. Indeed, it greatly magnifies the importance of the Jews for the Church, and compounds this by viewing every aspect of the Church’s attitude towards the Jews with post-Holocaust eyes."  "But The Pope Against the Jews is a one-sided case for the prosecution, distorting the central antimodernist ideology of the Catholic Church in this period into something that it clearly was not. "
In the context of the "protests" sweeping the nation at the moment, we need to be aware of the fact that ALL of these "protests" are being masterminded and paid for by George Soros, the "majority shareholder" (over 90%) in the Democrats. In short, they are his local US version of his "color revolutions" that swept Eastern Europe, and his "Arab Springs" that swept the Arab world. They are not genuine grassroots uprisings.  He is trying to overthrow the Trump Administration by a supposedly "popular uprising". He better be warned, White, Protestant Evangelical America will not stand idly by and let this happen. Too much Godly prayer has gone up for Trump. Also, Trump's principal reason for winning was his position re Israel:  Clinton: Establish Jerusalem as the "capital" of a Muslim "Palestinian" State. Trump: Transfer the US Embassy to Jerusalem as the undivided Capital of the Jewish People and the Jewish State. Gen 12:2,3 & Matt 25:31 to 46 applies here.
You mean Islam? There, I named it. While I'm at it I'll mention Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism as well. Is something bad supposed to happen now? LOL
Once again your penchant for pedantry doth seem at diametric odds with your apparent lack of comprehension for arguably pedestrian discourse... Alceste. To paraphrase you paraphrasing someone else - What about Judeo-Christian Type do you not understand. Don't omit the word Type in your attempt to grasp my prose. It's there for a reason. I used the term Judeo-Christian to make a point which was clearly lost on you, however, you cant spell Judeo-Christian without Christian, and that would be the half of that term that I would best identify with, and so, for the sake of your enlightenment: no, Christians do not condone the segregation of males and females in our holy houses, just as Christians don't condone the diminishing of women's social status whether that's in the bedroom or the boardroom. It seems to me however that YOU, do exhibit some sort of odd proclivity for seeing the promulgation of archaic practices that would shut women up, in one way or another. I love women.
TAQIYYA  is the Islamic practice of deception. The Koran says it is a moral duty to tell falsehoods to infidels, Jews, and Christians to decisive them to promote Islam. Taqiyya is as basic to Islam as charity is to Christianity. No other religion has such a thing and so it is hard for non-Muslims to understand that it actually exists, and is used regularly in Islamic propaganda.   The worst part is that liberal media like the Globe, are now giving us taqiyya, doing Islam’s dirty work.
In common with all Protestant or Jewish cultures, America was developed on the idea that your word is your bond. Otherwise, the frontier could never have been opened, 'cause it was lawless. A man's word had to mean something. Orson Welles oh I'm sure he copied Melania... "Work hard for what you want in life." Now Michelle and Melania both copied my dad on this one.
Don't use a capital G in God for atheism xbt. It doesn't exist just like your "Church of Fake god". But keep posting your nonesense as it gives all of us something or should I say someone to laugh at!!
The Church's moral teachings on sex are based on the word of God from Genesis to Revelations.    Before the one God that we know today spoke to the Jews first, people worshipped many gods and sex was essentially an act of domination based on the principle of  'doing something to someone'.  So pagan sex was basically a free for all between false gods and false gods, false gods and men, false gods and women, false gods and beasts,  men and women, men and men, women and women, men and children, women and children, men and beasts, and women and beasts.  The Jews were the first people to deviate from the popular consensus about pagan sex by making sex meaningful between men and women exclusively within marriage until death do them part in line with their deeper understanding of God's command in Genesis after  the fall for a man and a woman to become one sacred flesh in marriage.   But eventually, the Jews' hearts hardened so even Moses was forced to allow them to divorce.  (1 of 2)
The majority in Quebec and probably in TROC actually favoured the CPC's proposal that people of all races and religions while taking the oath of Canadian citizenship should not cover their faces and hide their identity with a burka or any other face covering.   The Liberals are as out of touch with majority Canadian opinion on this as they were when the PM tweeted that Canada is open house for anyone from anywhere anytime and the resulting dramatic increase in phony refugees - about half with criminal records - crossing into Canada illegally and having their bags carried by the RCMP began and continues.  But enlighten me on this - Egypt is over 90% Muslim including president el-Sisi and yet the Egyptian parliament under his direction is now banning the wearing of the niqab, burka and other face coverings in pubic places.  Is this anti-Muslim dog whistle politics, is el-Sisi a secret Jewish agent, or is it  that el-Sisi hasn't yet met and learned (LMAO) from The Clown Prince?
Dershowitz seems to think it's a good thing that the Kurds refuse to mix races with other people in the countries they live. Jews and Palestinians don't seem to want to mix either. How's that working out? In America should we be so proud of whites who refuse to mix with other races that we give them their own country? Should we have Blackistan and Hispanicistan as well to make sure the races don't mix? The only hope for a future without racism is for all the races to mix together. Encouraging borders based on race sounds a little Trumpy. Turkey was going to be carved up by European powers (perhaps into different races) before it fought to create a country where every race had equal rights and as a result it was the only decent democracy in the region. We should concentrate on having all countries (including Turkey, Iraq and the US) treat all races more fairly. We shouldn't give up and say "OK each race gets its own country!" By the way, Erdogan is rotten to all races, not just Kurds.
Yes, Paul was a Pharisee who never left his old  "conservative" ideology behind even when he converted. It is very disheartening to live with the fact that the Catholic Church has not learned its lesson. For centuries it demonized and dehumanized the Jews. The Nazis used the same tactic in their horrific "Final Solution". Now the Church is targeting the LGBT community with the same demonization and dehumanization of the past making them somehow "less than human" just as the Jews were "less than human". All reputable and peer reviewed medical and scientific sources regarding homosexuality are NOT in accord with the opinions coming from the Church and its conservative allies. So straight people have the option of getting married if they refuse to be single. Gay people have NO such option except to remain celibate their whole lives if they want to be "saved".
30 years of 'Kicking the can down the road'; has resulted in the "Chickens coming home to roost" (Geoffrey Chaucer used it in The Parson's Tale) and  the Buddhist concept of "Karma"; in this case the current Legislature and the Local taxing Districts, Cities, Fire Departments and Counties are reaping the 'Karma' of their predecessors' decisions.  TANSTAAFL.  "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch".    You have to pay for what you get; either now, or later with higher costs happening later.  Wimpy:  "I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a Hamburger Today!"  It's Tuesday.
The best line in this piece was the one about the holocaust (yeah, Godwin's law, I know). Imagine the tweet saying "Rocket science, medical breakthroughs and jet engines. The legacy of the Nazis wasn't all bad". But of course, being Jewish, it would never cross her mind to tweet that. I'm baffled that people who support her and agree with her in this matter can't see the parallel. And I'm baffled that she can't understand why it's a serious political problem for her to tweet her white 80s ideas in 21st century SA.  Technological advances are independent of conquest and subjugation and most of the technical advances that we enjoy today happened centuries after colonialism started. It's not like the VOC had an independent judiciary. Heck, the Brits barely had piped water when they took over. And neither the Nazis nor the colonists used their scientific breakthroughs to benefit the people they conquered, except when it was expedient.   So Musi, meet rock & hard place. #ThanksHelen.
The fact is that unthinkably huge reparations were and are being paid to holocaust survivors. Post-WW2 antisemitism "fell out of favour" among whites, because of sympathy for the new settlers in Israel. This was true until the role of  Jews in the rise of  communism became more widely known, not to mention the various oppressive policies by Israel against the Palestinians,. But please, I don't want to open the Pandora's Box here.
Regarding: "...Anglican priest "converts" to the RCC..." - Baptism in the Anglican communion is considered valid by the Latin Church so when Anglicans 'swim the Tiber' they are received into communion and union with the archbishop of Rome, currently Francis. - One converts if one is changing religion from say Hinduism to Christianity (though usually via a Christian church like Anglican, Orthodox, Melkite, Lutheran, Catholic ...).
If Gary is writing about religious intolerance then why doesn't he write about religious intolerance closer to home in Gary's own country of Canada?: the Imam in Montreal delivering hate filled sermons against Canada's Jews.
It should be noted that France always has been very generous with dual citizenships.  Many of the European countries and across the world, are not so easy.  Austria, The Netherlands, Norway and for the most part Germany, whom Saunders is a great admirer of, do not allow dual citizenship.   Dual citizenship is a very complex issue and is regulated to the 9s.   Most countries also forbid any federal service if you hold two citizenships.   Still, changing laws like Le Pen is proposing is a step towards castigating Jews in France.  As a group they have always been important in all walks of life  and the rise of anti-semitism in  Europe is appalling.  Still, as can be seen in the US with many Jewish people with dual American/ Israeli citizenships, there is a divided loyalty and it can play a negative part while forming a national policy as regards to Israel.  That said, millions of Europeans hold dual ones without it causing much trouble.
The Mass is not Jesus at the Passover Meal but Jesus the High Priest in the Heavenly Holy of Holies.  The fact that one reads about the Last Supper and 1st century Jewish accoutrements when what is being made present is the High Priest according to the order of Melchizek described in Hebrews makes clear what is being restored: the proper conception of the Mass as Sacrifice not Meal.
Ah, and here you go, lying again.  He said he wouldn’t make their cake because it was for a gay wedding.  In a letter to the Denver Post he wrote:  “I’ll sell anyone any cake I’ve got,” he wrote. “But I won’t design a cake that promotes something that conflicts with the Bible’s teachings. And that rule applies to far more than cakes celebrating same-sex marriages. I also won’t use my talents to celebrate Halloween, anti-American or anti-family themes, atheism, racism, or indecency.”  That ISN’T denigrating or humiliating them, it’s how he believes he’s taking a principled stand. Compare his case to one involving another Denver-area business, Azucar Bakery, that in 2014 refused to bake cakes with anti-gay messages and imagery, actions that the Colorado Civil Rights Division later ruled as not discriminatory.  I certainly support that bakery’s decision too.  You can’t have your cake and eat it too, Lying John Hobson.  The law must be applied equally.
Far right politicians like Geert Wilders, Pamela Geller, Marine Le Pen, Donald Trump, et al. conveniently overlook the fact that extreme Islamic fundamentalism as practiced by ISIL, al Qaeda, etc. is not that far removed from the stated goals of extreme fundamentalists in both Christianity and Judaism: return to a strict patriarchal system in which women are completely subject to men and sexual deviancy of any sort is not tolerated. True, we've been fortunate enough in this country never to have been subjected to a Christian or Jewish theocracy, but if people like Mike Pence and a host of others in the Trump administration had their way we'd find out soon enough if they were left to their own devices. So, rather than demonizing one entire religion, perhaps the time has come for moderate adherents of all the major Abrahamic religions to come together and oppose the one enemy we all have in common: religious fundamentalism. I believe the time is long overdue for this to happen.
Trump, addressing religious leaders in a signing ceremony at the White House, said: “We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced any more”.  I assume this includes Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Daoists, Catholics and any other religious belief system as it rightly should although it is more likely that he is pandering to the Christian right and his idea of targeting, bullying or silencing is likely far from the ideal that all faiths should be free to practice their beliefs without persecution.    The line between church and state should be clearly drawn to ensure that religionists of any stripe cannot impose their personal beliefs on others and it is certainly troubling that he intends to allow them to participate in political activity.
Why don't the 'Traddies' REALLY study the Bible?  Remember, everything that we have in the bible was written by humans, trying to describe in human words THEIR impressions of God. The Bible is the word of God.  But the only WORD of God is Jesus.    What went on in Sodom is contrasted by Abraham's gracious treatment of the THREE guests who came to his tent [Gen. 18:1-9].  Lot, also was gracious and hospitable to the three men [Gen. 19:1-4].  In the Gospel of Matthew [Mt. 11:20-25 also Lk. 10:13-15] Jesus states that at the Last Judgment, the people of Sodom will find it more tolerable than for the Jews in the cities that not repent even after they had witnessed his 'deeds of power.' [Chorazin and Bethsaida].  Were these Jewish cities engaging in sodomy?  I think not.
"Christians and Jews have at least let go of their murderous teachings." Now that, right there, is hilarious! Why? because it's so out of whack with the obvious reality. ALL of the desert religions have murder at their heart. For a simple example, christianity nearly completely ignores Jesus's prime directive - love. The poor guy's ideas just got co-opted into something that had a long precedent.
There is something radically wrong with the "radical fundamentalist" Christian/Catholics. IF the author's reporting and observations are correct then the foundations of this cadre are: a) privilege - of wealth and/or position; b) a self-identification with traditional markers, i.e., idols, of institution rather than with the person/message of Jesus, and c) the reciprocity of (a) and (b).  Seems rather clandestinely "cultish".
"... women's groups and others who deride the importance of religious liberty..."  Except maybe for some militant atheists, derision of religious liberty seems to be rare in American society. What I deride is the bishops' and fundamentalists' use of the term "religious liberty" as a pretext to impose on society views of morality that conflict with rights of other Americans. Perhaps this is what the bishops should ponder at their meeting.  With respect to the contraception mandate specifically, perhaps the bishops could also ponder whether providing a simple form stating that an organization has a religious objection to contraceptive coverage really does make the organization "complicit" in moral evil.  It seems quite far-fetched to me.
Lamont Cranston laments. "I have had two long term relationships with hard-core atheists. (I am not particularly religious)  Biggest Christmas supporters I have ever seen. Insisted we set up trees decorate the house, you name it..  I could never figure it out.."  Lamont...did you ever consider they simply wanted any opportunity to brighten up the otherwise dull and gloomy environment they found themselves a long term part of...Christmas desperation maybe?
“Understanding the key questions about Trump’s Israel agenda” ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  In all matters, Trump’s agenda is influenced by personal gain – what’s in it for him and his family. His position on Israel is guided by his son-in-law, who is Jewish, and his daughter, Ivanka, a convert to Judaism. So much for separation of Church and State!
Like a good chunk of the Russian population did.  And the Dutch population.  And the Jewish population.  And the Norwegian population.  And the French population.  Etc, etc.
Stephen did you deny that the Nazi concentration camps with their murdering of the Jews ever existed? If you did then the value  your opinion is worth  ZERO I would say.
Sharia law can be defined as the Law of (a) God for Muslims.  The Ten Commandments can be defined as the Law of (a) God for Jews and Christians.  Note that they were all written down by men, and presumably match the writer's opinions.
Very true and we must never forget that. However, there is a legal exception to that which is the right to assemble and speek your beliefs does not include intimidation. The people who had to flee to their church behind locked doors the night before the events on Saturday feel that the group carrying torches and chanting hate messages against them-- referring to them as Jews-- were intimidating (probably does not meet the legal standard). The Nazi militia groups carrying AR type semi- automatic weapons and those carrying visible holstered pistols and sheathed knives were probably over the line-- in fact, the law disapproves of marching as a militia in an intimidating manner-- police say in any future demonstration they will not allow militias, armor, or guns-- even with Right to carry (they can be kept in a secured and fenced area). DOJ/Jeff Sessions looking at both the church goers and the armed militia.
It's like you people don't read. Trump's son-in-law, daughter, and some of his grand kids are Jewish. He's been given awards from a Jewish organizations. He went to the Wailing Wall in Israel, wore a kippah, and prayed. Netanyahu called him a great friend of Israel.  Because you make things up and are uneducated on the subject does not make your lies facts or reality. They are the antithesis of truth.
Let's say I walk into a Jewish Bakery, a Gay Bakery, a Muslim Bakery, and a Buddhist Bakery because I didn't know they were Jewish, Gay, Muslim, or Buddhist.....and I ask them to decorate a Christian Wedding Cake with "crosses" and "May Jesus Bless Our Marriage" written on it......and they decline because doing so goes against their religious beliefs or same-sex values. - Sure, I might be sad. But wouldn't I just find another bakery that (1) wants my business (2) will gladly create the "edible art work" I want? Of course I would.
I'm atheist and I'm not offended by the greetings either. Why would I be? Because I'm not Christian? That's silly - many of us celebrate Christmas as a secular holiday. It was pagan anyway before Christians decided the birth of Jesus should be moved to coincide with pagan celebration of winter solstice to get more converts.   So "Merry Christmas" from this atheist to you, and enjoy the time off, regardless of how you decide to celebrate.
All Christians, Jews and other religious denominations are angered and will retaliate every time another Muslim demand is made and honoured. This is beyond ridiculous that Muslims are allowed to force their religion down our throats. This is a very serious situation and there will be more violent attacks when our government refuses to curb this activity. Muslims can take time from their days at school to pray, yet our Lord's prayer has been dismissed as being controversial. Yes, this is going to get very ugly and could easily turn into civil war. That comment is not outrageous. Muslims have come from that very climate and they didn't leave that on the shores behind them. This is just the beginning of a rally.
Yes, a "grass-roots meeting of citizens" that Rise Canada just happened to show up to with camera in tow. Rise Canada is not "alternative media", it's not any kind of media.  It's a hate group, one of whose tactics is to blow on the cinders of historical hindu-muslim antagonisms from South Asia.  And then you bring it here, to an article on the Dutch election.
It is interesting how the author suggests that anyone on the "other side" is absolutely irrational and wrong, and their speech needs to be monitored and regulated. I am sure Kingwell will be the one to perfectly judge what is good and bad, right and wrong. Obviously, no one exists on the right side of the spectrum who is enlightened enough, intelligent enough, to have a civil discourse with a liberal. From this article I can see how filled with hate and rage, so ready to condemn Jews, Republicans are. Not so with Kingwell. Mark is more than read to reach forth his sausage like fingers to silence the dog-whistles and ethnic demonizing he claims ALL members of the opposing side demonstrate. He would NEVER generalize half the population into all being racists, or bigots. Clearly from this writing, he is the only one who can speak rationally and calmly, like an adult, to the children on the other side.  Let us all not be carry the bigotry, or generalizations of THEM. Mark sure doesn't.
That is all opinion and that's well and good but is historically unrealistic. The Simha Flapan quote is a fatuous accusation that can be backed up or dismissed depending on who you quote. As for the Gypsies, they and others were victimized by the Nazis and maybe they did deserve some German property. Go look into it. A Jewish homeland was already in the works courtesy of Theodore Herzl and Balfour and Jews had a less than pleasant experience in Germany and in Poland many Jews who tried to return to their properties were murdered. Furthermore, as I mentioned above in reply to someone (not you) an equivalent number of North African and Middle Eastern Jews were dispossessed of their homes and properties and settled in Israel. Maybe the Arab nations surrounding Israel could have done displaced Arabs the same favor and we'd have avoided four wars and a lot of terrorism.
Given that a previous anti-Islamophobia motion passed on Oct 26/16, I find it hard to believe that M103 will have the impact that you claim. Did similar motions against antisemitism also have a similar affect? Do you think that islamophobic comments were somehow acceptable prior to M103 passing?  I do understand your concern, I just feel it's misplaced.
God is all knowing so therefore there is no free will. There is perceived free but no free will. So half the argument is declared invalid because God is all knowing and to claim that believers in the scripture has free will makes no sense and by default means that there is disbelief in god because it clearly states he is all knowing all of the time. So to believe there is free will is the same as not believing in god at all. I am neither atheist or a believer, I am secular and believe that it all should be kept in the privacy of your own home or sacred spaces.
"how many OTC and pharmaceuticals are sourced from plants. aspirin, pain relievers, heart medicine..?"    About the same as are sourced from petrochemicals?   Actually I have no idea and quantity and effectiveness and safety and price and availability are all considerations for whatever one puts in your body to either reduce pain or just to get high.  So far, the only drug claimed to be completely absolutely, totally safe (by its users at least) is marijuana.  But as Lynn pointed out, above, peer-reviewed research is a little hard to come by on a substance which can result in a Federal jail sentence.   All the opioids are 'plant based', (Poppies, anyone?)  but I wonder if the Jewish 'God' you are quoting really thought opium smoking was a good thing?   Or Heroin injections?  Or peyote barfing if all plants are good?
Please take a look at  the direction of the Liberal party - Do we want our country run by MP's  that follow the beliefs of Islam - Or the beliefs of Judeo/Christian values that our country was founded on ? In the past election we elected 10 MP's that were Muslim (and the Prime Minister hired a Muslim for his Press Secretary) . When he takes a vacation he visits an island owned by a Muslim . If you read the Quran 5:51  "Do not take Jews and Christians as Allies ".  Do we really want our country to go in this direction ? Why are we bringing in more Refugees from the Middle East when we have not seen assimilation from the current group ie; One year later in the CBC article regarding a family in Windsor , Ontario - They don't have a job - the only thing that changed is that they have another Child !
Israel will be a Jewish state in perpetuity. God has given the land of Israel to the Jews and His covenant with the Jews is eternal.  The obvious way forward is for Israel to annex the parts of the West Bank that include the larger blocks of settlements and the Jordan river valley. Arab residents who have collaborated with terrorist organizations will be transferred to Gaza or allowed to relocate to Jordan. The rest of the West Bank can eventually be reunited with Jordan and, the Egyptians will be persuaded/bribed to administer Gaza. This leaves Israel with a secure, defensible Jewish democracy.  Everybody who matters is at least tacitly on board with this solution. The Palestinians had fifty years to negotiate peace but all they wanted to do was murder Jews.
"This over-representation [of Indigenous children in the child welfare system] is symptomatic of the structural discrimination that these First Nations children and their families have experienced since Confederation,"  The problem with this arugment is that it takes away agency and responsibility from the indians. if blackstone says the indians cant even be partially responsible for their high crime and poverty rates, then what CAN they be responsible for? The jews experienced a true genocide in europe decades after the cdn govt came up with the residential schools to try and get the indians out of poverty, but looking at the two groups today, the differences in how they responded couldnt be more profound. Does the pregnant indian woman who makes the decision to go to the bar tonight and drink until the wee hours while their kids play outside bear no responsibility for the consequences of that decision, or am I and my next door neighbour, a recent immigrant and canadian, responsible?
I'm a progressive Jew, and I agree with you completely. They take a few lines here and there from the Psalms or from the Epistles, et voila! God wants me to be rich and God wants you to help me. But, I've read the Gospels, and Jesus of Nazareth would say the "prosperity doctrine preachers" laid up their treasures in this life. Afterwards, ... their fate may be wildly different. Jacob Marley's ghost in "A Christmas Carol" has the perfect reply when Ebeneezer Scrooge reminds Marley's ghost that Marley was good at business.
I agree that Nostra Aetate is not a development but an actual contradiction of what the Church previously said about the Jews. That is why the Lefebvrites shook the dust of Vatican II from their feet. Of course, a deeper motivation was sheer antisemitism as shown by the case of Bishop Richard Williamson.
Inventing "enemies of the people" to justify aggressive action (and sometimes violence) is standard in the fascist playbook.  Hitler used the Jews, the liberal intelligentsia and the Allies to justify seizing power (after being elected without a majority).  T rump uses immigrants, the liberal intelligentsia/the media, and China to justify his aggressive behaviour and self-aggrandizement.
That's a dream world. Atheist and humanist meet-ups are tiny. Those groups have almost no regular gatherings of any size. Beg to differ? Show me the numbers.  If you look even at just Portland proper, there are still 10-15% of the population in church every Sunday, and even higher numbers if you include Portland metro. The hispter style churches, of which there are many, are doing well in Portland. I love progressive churches, but nearly no one goes. It's all old folks. Yes, the smaller churches are dying out, but evangelical churches are holding steady. Seattle had until recently 4-5,000 attending multiple locations of just one church, which was in the Imago mold, more or less. Tim Keller's church in NYC is huge, over 5,000 per week. No gloating, just the truth.  What would make you happy to see no one in church? Perhaps to you it's all fiction, great! But if other people get something from it, what is that to you?
I would say that Mr. Mulcair is correct in his view of Mr. Trump.  I would also disagree with Mr. Clement when he states that no one will listen to Mr. Mulcair because he's in 3rd place.  Most Canadians I talk to would agree with Mr. Mulcair's view of Mr. Trump.  What Trump is proposing vis a vis American Muslims is analogous to what Hitler started in Germany with  the anti-Jewish Nuremburg Laws, i.e, discrimination on the basis of religion.  How can anyone not see the similarities?
This "Jewish star" thing is getting out of control. Now they are slapping it on the photos of prisoners, and they can't even get the number of points correct!
Bible teaching is Bible teaching.The 10 Commandments, and much of the Bible, serves Civilization very well. Some teachings were directed to the Jewish people. What business is that of yours? The Church belongs to the Lord, warts and all. I think He knows how to handle His bride.
Of course you can... unless you're as dogmatic an atheist as any fundamentalist believer.
The "buddhists" were put into camps because they were Japanese, a country with which Canada was at war, and not because they were buddhists.  German christians  were also put into camps because they were german and not because they were christian, for the same reasons.  You can agree or disagree with whether they should have been rounded up, but this doesn't change the fact that they were not rounded up for being buddhists.
NO! said that one Muslim...and I answer by= François Jourdan, French islamologue; “...Islam (and Jewish add by me) is very frozen for many centuries and basically lack of freedom - today, it must be said clearly that we cannot build a society of one religion, Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist... or atheist.  This phase of human history is now overtaken by religious freedom and human rights. Secularism requires not the ban but the discretion of all religions in the public space as other citizens have the right to have another way of life.  This isn't the Koranic trend where Islam does not consider itself as other religions and must...DOMINATE !...” So, He said; “...Secularism requires not the BAN but the DISCREATION OF ALL RELIGION in the public space...as others Citizens have the right to have ANOTHER WAY OF LIFE”, oui ? "Islam does not consider itself as OTHER religions and MUST... DOMINATE" !... get it Canadians ???...
[up until it calls openly for the death of other people] Let's get this straight.  There is a difference between shouting out hateful speech and speech that incites violence?  That speech that arguably predicates on violence is different from speech that suggests it?  For example, is there a difference between "You will not replace us" and "Death to all jews?" [So yes if you defend the words the Nazis are speaking then you are a nazi sympathizer and are equal to the nazis.] That appears to be a no.  It seems there is no difference between defending a Nazi's right to speech, even if the words themselves are about the superiority of the white race versus calling for violence against all non-whites.
The 'illogical thinking' is not by me. It was you who raised a hypothetical scenario. I then questioned you on it. Despite your numerous replies to me (it is now 14 replies that you have made) you have not once been able to justify your hypothetical scenario. I am fully aware of Canon law in this matter, and also the GIRM. Are you now saying that the 'ten atheists' (in your example) were/are completely irrelevant to the point that you were trying to make?
Do you believe in the existence of God?  If the answer is yes, then what scientific evidence or proof can you provide me that he actually exists? Are you an atheist, and if so why do you spend your time on a religious website? It is simply a matter of faith.
No it does not. You are confused.   I would suggest the first item on Mr Sigh's agenda should be to educate Canadians about his religion, and religions in general, most Canadians are totally ignorant of other religions (and often don't even know much about their own).  Too many people confuse Hinduism and Sikhism, or Sikhism and Islam, and don't realize Sikhism was actually founded in reaction to Islam and Hinduism, rejecting caste and female subjugation.   Although demanding a rather austere lifestyle from practitioners, it does not attempt to convert others, preaches love and tolerance, and social equality.
Lots of lies in your post....One hundred years ago Jews made up nearly 15% of the greater population of Palestine which at that time included what is now Israel, West Bank , and Jordan. ( source wikipedia)  When the land was partitioned in 1948 Jews made up over 30% of the population but got about 10% of the land which they accepted, despite the fact that Arabs got all the arid land and Jews got land that was 70% Negev desert.  Even then, 7 Arab nations did not accept existence of Israel, and agreed to ethnically cleanse the Jews from it. Since then Arabs have launched war after war on Israel, all of which Israel won, while Israel offered at least 7 full ( 3 in last 20 years) peace offers all of which Arabs rejected.  It was Abbass who walked away from most recent US brokered peace negotiations few years ago (not Israel,) despite the fact that Israel has agreed and meet all of PA's prenegotions conditions.  It is PA who is committing a crime against it's own people, by rejecting peace.
Mr. Rubinstein offers a rational comment on irrational views and behavior.  The hatred toward Jews, like the hatred toward any racial, ethnic or religious group, and like the hatred toward those with different sexual orientation, etc is an emotional, not a rational belief and, unfortunately, is seldom subject to change based on rational debate.  Bias, by definition, is an irrational antipathy..      Gary Crum
Rich,    Did you read the article?   I don't begrudge refugees their hand outs, but Nabel's family have been treated very well in Canada. Hotels, clothes, friends everywhere, all their needs met.     As a middle class family having had an easy life in Syria, middle class Canada cannot seem that strange or scary.  And Nabel had the help of a housing counsellor (lol) to find a place to live within a few months.   There are tens of thousands waiting five or ten years for a subsidized place in Toronto.   I very nearly became homeless trying to find an apartment in Toronto in 1985. It was cutthroat. I warned Torontonians, the new global economy was leaving many Canadian-born folks behind.    I wonder what hundreds of thousands of Jewish Canadians think about thousands of Syrians in Toronto, knowing the horrible things Israel has  been doing in the Golan Heights and Syria for decades, including bombing Syria from time to time.   Best refugee program: a strong peace movement demanding peace.
I guess fair is fair......since a lot of Conservatives lump Democrats, Liberals, and Progressives into "hate groups" who hate God, who hate Jesus, who hate the Bible, who hate Jews, who hate Christians, and who hate the idea that there are Absolute Truths and Absolute Right/Wrongs that exist......as opposed to whatever moral ideology fancies them this year.
As an agnostic, I find your religious bigotry and language offensive.  I also disagree with your idea that you have some right to object to what anyone gives their own money to support just because you do not support it.    That is pure arrogance.    That very attitude toward other Jews resulted in the Holocaust, one of the nastiest events in human history based entirely on scapegoating and hatred of those who had different views.   Have you read enough of Descartes to get to his Causal Adequacy Principle?  "So, in the end, Descartes claims to have deduced God’s existence from the intuitions of his own existence as a finite substance with the idea of God and the Causal Adequacy Principle, which is “manifest by the natural light,” thereby indicating that it is supposed to be an absolutely certain intuition as well.  Perhaps you need to re-read all of his works.  He maintained his Catholicism based on the above Principle.
(Part one of two) Support for Democratic candidates during the same period, on the other hand, has come from "Hispanic Catholics, the religiously unaffiliated, Jewish Americans and African-American Protestants," he (Robert Jones, of The (Pontifical) (administratively censured) Catholic University of America) said.   This slight to Black Catholics is unseemly.  As of 7:23 this morning, Steven Shea, xswzaq9, 2Be4Peace, extend the unseemliness to non-white immigrants and Muslims .  As Philippians 3:6) remonstrated, “in zeal I persecuted the (Black Catholic) Church.”  “In just the same way, I tell you there will be rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents” (Luke 15:10).  The problem rests in what hearts seek.  “Let hearts rejoice who search for the Lord” (Psalm 105:3b).  Liturgy of the Word, Reading 488, Thursday of the Thirty-first Week in Ordinary Time II for the feast of Saint Martin de Porres.
Why can't the Jews living the West Bank live n a future Palestinian State? Are there no Arabs, Muslims, Christians living in Israel with full citizenship?  Netanyahu is the current PM.  Previously, there were may Israeli leaders who offered to leave the West Bank (and already left Gaza).  What of the Palestinian side?  When are the next Palestinian elections?   This article is ridiculously biased and serves no useful purpose.  it continues the false narrative that the settlements are at the heart of the problem.  There was no Palestinian State prior o the settlements. I am not saying the settlements are helping but they are not the obstacle to peace.  Only another convenient excuse.
Lindbergh was all for an American victory as soon as Pearl Harbor was attacked and the AFC voted to disband.  The AFC and Lindbergh identified three groups leading America to war:  the Roosevelt administration, the British and the Jews.  Not just the Jews.
There are approximately 66 books that form the Protestant Bible, depending on the religion, 39 in the Old Testament and 27 in the New Testament. The Catholic Bible has 73.  Now that is eye opening. There is nothing wrong with gaining knowledge. The more you read the Bible do you not gain more knowledge.
Eliza Kashinsky, you are a sorry, sorry case. Are you so unsure of your dogma that you have to hide your identity?   I have no financial interests in Eugene real estate other than the single-family home I bought when you were just a pain in some parents' eyes.   Yet, in contrast to your ignorance about Eugene development practices, I could qualify as a real estate genius. The redevelopment of the SW-SAZ, _against the will of the community_, would displace working folks in affordable, single-family homes with higher cost condos and apartments.   Please go back to defending the poor, downtrodden atheists (like myself), as you were doing before you moved to Eugene.   -- Paul
Hebrew is an ethnic group. Jewish is not.
"Atheism is not a *belief* predicated on rational thought. Atheism is simply rational thought." - Earthmamooo  Though they take opposite sides on the question, religions and atheism are both systems of belief. With no evidence to prove the matter, the religious believe in deities. And likewise without proof, atheists do not.  Whereas it's possible to prove that something exists, it's never possible to prove that something doesn't. For no matter how hard you search for it, there's always somewhere left to look. So one day religious believers could be proven correct. But because atheism is based on deities not existing, it can only ever be a belief.  Some atheists don't like to hear that. The strident ones will likewise take offence at the author's affinity for Jesus Christ. As an atheist I too admire the human Christ, I just don't believe that he was a god. Again, I can't prove he wasn't- I believe he wasn't.
you statement that Hawaii has hate even though they don't have hate groups is not what the study purports.  believe the study was limited to hate groups.  you need to understand that even those states with hate groups, have many individuals who hate others because of their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc, that don't belong to any hate group.  organized hate groups are more egregious than some individuals who hate other people for one reason or another.  you mother had publicly stated on this blog that she despises jews and Filipinos.  is she not one of the "haters" here in Hawaii?  is she not contributing to hate in Hawaii?
If you want to know what Jagad Guru Siddhaswarupananda, teacher of yogic/Vedic wisdom, actually teaches — instead of just hearing from bigoted Hinduphobic commenters here who hate practitioners of Vaishnava Hinduism, visit https://sif.yoga/
Hi Lumen, I just mean that there are different theologies in different scriptures in the NT: Matthew and his Jewish Jesus, John and his mystic Christ, Colossians and Ephesians and their adoption of Greek cosmology. Sometimes knowing the theology at work enables us to understand the text better, as two or three weeks ago with that man without a wedding garment being cast into outer darkness. It helps to know that Matthew sees the church as a mixture of good and bad, but always needs to have a final reckoning to separate sheep from goats -- however inelegant and confusingly he does that.
"For example, a recent poll by Forum Research indicates that Muslims, First Nations people, South Asians, Asians, Jews and blacks are the most likely to suffer bias by fellow Canadians, in that order."  By itself, this statement says little. What, for instance, are the actual levels of bias expressed by those who were polled? And some in the identity-focused political community might be upset. Some activists have tried to convince us, for instance, that anti-black racism is a problem that apparently eclipses other forms of discrimination and must be addressed as a priority. But could their premise be wrong, as the ranking the author provides suggests to be the case? And I wonder what the poll's rankings would look like were it to include homeless people and the disabled, the two groups that realistically are the most marginalized in Canadian urban society (i.e. excepting First Nations reserves)?
Totally agree, what's all this closed for Christmas, Easter, Saturdays and Sundays business?  Why are kids who observe Jewish holidays allowed to miss school when class is in session?
Francois Cardinal1, as you probably know, the Jewish community in Montreal and Quebec both still actively promote their Jewish-only cemeteries.  As they have every right to.
Jesus didn't start a Church. He was Jewish and started a movement (Jewish sect) based on the Kingdom of God.  "Authentic Catholicism" can't seem to understand this historical fact. Paul later started communities in area of modern day Greece and Turkey.
François Jourdan, French islamologue; “...Islam is very frozen for many centuries and basically lack of freedom - today, it must be said clearly that we cannot build a society of one religion, Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist... or atheist.

Islam does not consider itself as OTHER religions and MUST... DOMINATE !... DOMINATE, don’t you get it Canadians ???...
Ah so you've 'converted' to Judaism now, Homer?  I think you were better off as a Christian.  Well, in some respects.  And the 'god' of Zionism isn't HaShem, it's HaSatan.
So then my grade-school teacher was a Nazi? But she was Jewish. Wait a second, didn't the Nazis do more than make people stand? Wasn't there something about rounding up people based on ethnicity and executing them wholesale? Hmm, I guess asking someone to stand during the national anthem, which has been routine for decades in the US, is maybe slightly different. Maybe you're a snowflake?
there were two partition plans in 1947....one was the partition of India to create the Muslim state of Pakistan to accommodate the right of Muslims in that area to self determination...14 million Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs were displaced in the largest mass migration in history, and hundreds of thousands (and maybe millions) of people were killed...the second was the plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and Arab (mostly Muslim) state, to accommodate the right of the Jewish people to self determination and self government in the form of a sovereign Jewish state in a tiny slice of the Middle East where Jews have lived continuously for three thousand years, including places like Libya, Iraq, Tunisia etc where they predated the Muslim conquest...the Muslim worlds seems okay with the first partition, but treat the second as an unthinkable crime..and by insisting on the "right of return" have rejected the idea of a Jewish state.  The "colonial" argument is a Euro centric conceit.
Part 3.  Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria, was drawn into the fight. Cyril had a sharp intellect but violent passions.  As a young man he participated in the railroading of John Chrysostom. He hated heretics, Jews, Platonists -- in 415 a Christian mob attacked Hypatia, the head of the Alexandrine Neo-Platonist school, and literally tore her to pieces. It can be argued that Cyril incited this mob, and he certainly fostered the atmosphere in which it occurred. Cyril kept his chief hatred for Nestorius. "As bishop of Alexandria he disliked Nestorius as bishop of Constantinople (that upstart see); as an Alexandrine theologian he disliked him as an Antiocene; and as Cyril he loathed him as Nestorius." (David Bell, A Cloud of Witnesses, p 108)  Cyril said Nestorius destroyed the basis for salvation. He said that Nestorius did not call Mary “Mother of God” because he did not believe Jesus was God, which is untrue. Nestorius never denied Jesus’ divinity, he was emphasizing Jesus' humanity.
The founding fathers at the constitutional convention were asked (by Ben Franklin) to open their meetings each day with a prayer.  The delegates, with the exception of two or three people, felt that opening with a prayer was unnecessary, and the convention went on for 4 months without opening prayers being held.  I guess those founding fathers really showed us secular humanists what a Judeo-Christian nation this was founded to be, huh?
The problem with the extreme Ukrainian Nationalism of WW2, is that it still exists today. The Globe deleted my link to a torch-lit parade held days ago by extremists in western Ukraine to honour Roman Shukhevych, a OUN General. The.OUN was involved in the mass murders of both Jews, and Poles. They were directly supported by the Nazis.
Emma Lazarus was Jewish Social Worker and writer. One of her best friends was Rose Hawthorne. They befriended each other after Rose lost her only child, a young boy. She and her husband eventually divorced after being separated for a long time. Emma worked in the NYC tenements focusing on the Russian Jewish immigrants. Rose helped out as well. Emma developed breast cancer but was not allowed to be in the hospital. At that time, cancer was considered worse than what many people in our day thought of AIDS ( and some may still fear.) After Emma died, Rose went on to establish the FREE cancer homes with her new order of nuns. I am not sure when she became Catholic. It was a major swerve for her and her family. Her father was Nathaniel Hawthorne, the great American writer from Bowdoin College And as a fyi - he changed the spelling of his family's last name because he was appalled that a relative of his  was a judge during the Salem Witch Trails. All of his short stories are good reads now!
Yes the conservative ideology of hate 24/7 is so endearing.  Of course ISIL are conservatives, Evangelicals are conservatives, Boko Harum conservatives, Ezra Levant, Trump, Saudi's....all conservatives and all steeped in hate.....hmm.  Enjoy your pendulum swing low effort haters enjoy it...
Political correctness has deeply infected our rhetoric & thinking.  Critiquing the mega-banks' negative influence on life in the free world deals with behavior - not race or culture. Not all bankers are jewish, not all looters are black, etc.  Here again, we see the race card thrown in to obscure any discussion of negative behavior.
Hmm we allow an a Orthodox commenter, a Protestant commentator, we've had a Jewish commenter, I'm sure folks would welcome a Muslim commenter, but a sedevacantist commentator is just a bridge too far. So much for dialogue.
All the Twelve received the keys and the power to bind and loose.  But the Sacrament of Penance did not appear until after the time of the Apostles [Saints Ambrose and Augustine never received it].  Secondly----God didn't set up any form of Government in the Wilderness for the Jewish people.  It was Jethro, Moses' father-in-law who gave him the idea for setting up Judges for the peoples as a type of unified form of government.  When Israel wanted a king, God spoke to Samuel and told him to anoint a king for the people.     GOD DOES NOT SET UP GOVENMENTS FOR PEOPLE.  God leaves that to humans to do.  Do some reading of church history about church governance.  It is not the same in the beginning--Apostolic Age and the Age of the Patriarchs, as it was in the Middle Ages---when the Curia was set up, as it was in the Reformation, and beyond.
A quick scan of a dozen commentaries, Catholic and Protestant, seems to indicate my take on this is well-accepted, while yours appears nowhere.  Btw, the context is Jewish law, not "rules of evidence".
It gets a bit confusing when people discuss "Jews" and "Israel".. They're are, clearly, two very different concepts.  I don't accept the conspiracy "false flag" idea that the desecration of Jewish cemetaries and vandalism of synagogues is an conspiracy perpetrated by either Jews or Zionists to garner public support.  I'm a fan of Occam's Razor and, absent some evidence supporting such a "false flag" allegation, feel these acts are the work of "good old American anti-semitism"......there's no shortagate of it today and, unfortunately, after the election of Donald Trump, such actions are significantly more common.  BTW:  I also agree that Israel is, arguably, the most xenophobic county in the world.  On the flip side, however, given it's location in the midst of the Arab world, such paranoid-appearing supernationalism is also understandable.  Gary Crum
There are many verses in the Qur'an, the holy book of the religion of Islam, that call for jihad (struggle) and many verses in the Qur'an that call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers.  Are people saying Muslims are extreme and  radical when they follow those verses and directions in the Qur'an?
Might as well ask Hitler how he felt about Jewish people.  She is a rad-fem.  You need more science...here are some videos that reference scientific studies:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erexuu8PTo8&t=36s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmXZ65992Ik&t=5s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i6apmxyMlE&list=PLZuyBKL5RsyQwJViudaVUWf-g2kEVJAiN  Not that it will matter to people that have already made up their mind.
Douay-Rheims Bible, Galatians 3:28: "There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus."  What about that don't you understand?
All this is true. However, the "Jewish Question" in Britain, 1936, was about refugees from Germany and a bit about "Jewish bankers" in London City. Mosley was high-profile but not a real mass leader. In the USA, isolationism was partly driven by German-American sympathies + rural anti-Semitism. The Jewish Question, in Canada, was about the relative weight of the homeland francophones of Canada in their own communities. Arcand was a nationalist-fascist, but had pan-Canadian ambitions. Groulx was a traditional Catholic sectarian who would keep the flock away from modernism and linguistic taint -- by establishing what he called The French-Catholic Nation of Quebec. I'd love to know how Peladeau spends his time these days and whether he ever recovered his kids from Mlle Schneider.
Not to minimize your experience, but it sound to me like you are talking about war, and if I'm right about which one, a particular World War.    A few things:  War is rarely just about one thing, and even if it is, that one thing is almost always economic in nature. That argument can, and certainly has, been made about our Civil War, and rightly so.  I said "an individual with a gun". War incorporates many other ways of getting people's attention.  What percentage of Rebel soldiers do you think truly hated slaves?  What percentage of German soldiers do you think truly hated Jews?  What percentage of American soldiers truly hate(d) (pick from the list):  The British The British Mexicans Southerners Phillipinos Haitians Guatemalans Nicaraguans Cubans The Japanese Koreans Vietnamese Thais Cambodians Middle Easterners/Muslims Gettin' tired of typing now . . .  If you go to war because you hate someone you've never met, then someone sold a young fool a bridge somewh . . .  Wait.  Uh-oh . .
How is it arrogant and rude to expect an interviewee to answer a direct question, which Singh repeatedly waffled on?  If anything is rude, it is the refusal to respond to a direct and very straightforward question.  Nobody outside the Sikh community cares about the intricacies of their relationship with Hindus, but they do care when the convicted terrorist responsible for the Air Inda bombing is lauded by the Sikh community as a martyr.  Singh also said, in that same interview, that he "unequivocally believes survivors" in "gender justice" cases  (the new buzzword for sexual assault), meaning that he has no respect for the presumption of innocence, since reflexively believing the accuser or plaintiff means in effect that an accusation is considered a proof of guilt.  Both he and Nikki Ashton have zero credibility on that score alone.    Watch the NDP slide further into the oblivion they so richly deserve.
Trump's parents were both born in Germany. Remember what they did in WWII? Remember what they did to 6 million Jews? And no, the majority of Americans do not agree with Trump. This will become clear to you come November.
Neither God nor Moses wrote Leviticus and assuming it as the source truth is affirming Jewish national identity, not divine teaching. You are defending Catholic group dynamics at the expense of people created as gay by God in the first trimester of gestation and cooperation with that evil leads to both bullying and depression by teens that causes suicide. Get your facts straight and repent for joining this evil.
This issue came up before when Mr. Sajjan was running initially. The Hindus always have to write up something negative. For some reason they want their puppets like Ujjal Dosanjh, the Hindu cat among others to paint a negative picture as possible of the Sikhs. In short these types of articles are an example of subversion which has been going on since 1984.
I am an agnostic.  Have been since college (50 years ago).  But religion has been my main interest since that time too, along with all the sciences.  ////  I'm pretty sure a God exists, but I would hesitate to define God.  What Christian, Jews, Muslims, etc., have done is create a God in their own image and likeness.  Because I think, with the Taoists, that "The God that can be spoken of is not God."  The best we can know about God is from a good (basic) book re physics.  As a Franciscan I knew in HS used to always say (and he was very old and quite wise):  "All I know about God is that he loves babies."  It took me a few years (of growing up) to realize that he was speaking about everything wants to replicate itself and live.  Even The Universe is expanding, stars are 'born' every day -- EVERYTHING wants to stay alive, grow, replicate,'continue'.
If Islamophobia is perfectly understandable, then so is Mormonophobia, Amishophobia, Buddhistophobia and so on.   The DSM-V says a 'phobia' is a psychological disorder. Does M-103 say what physicians may diagnose Islamophobia?  Islamophobia is a meme constructed to carry forward special consideration, and to silence criticism. If you flip over the Islamophobia card, the other side says "Victim".  Bigotry is bigotry, and is ugly-- regardless of the parties involved.  It is relevant, however, to name the perpetrators, reveal their agenda, detail the facts of the case, and identify the target group.  While targeted groups require our outrage, and our compassion, no special treatment is allotted to any group.
There is only one problem. And it is a huge one. Science proves those who call themselves “Jews” are not Jews! DNA Science has confounded the Christian evangelicals by proving conclusively that most of the people in the nation of Israel and in World Jewry are not the descendants of Abraham.  Those living today who profess to be “Jews” are not of the ancient Israelites, and they are not the seed of Abraham. In fact, the new DNA research shows that the Palestinians actually have more Israelite blood than do the “Jews!”  The nation of Israel today is populated with seven and half million imposters
3 of your posts were deleted because you attempted to say that the people doing this were not Nazis and you attempted to say the person saying they were had bought into propaganda, which you gave no explanation for, then you defended Nazi's saying it wasn't them that was doing it.  So what facts do you have that nobody is threatening to bomb Jews? Multiple graveyards have been hit and the calls were real. It is a country wide terrorist type action.
Like the Alaska Dispatch, most of those involved with the Black Lives Matter organization are radical Marxists. Furthermore, Black Lives Matter is funded by the Hungarian billionaire, George Soros, who was a Hitler Youth that helped roundup Jews during WWII. He pays everyone at BLM at least $15/hr to stir up trouble and create racial tension in the U.S. Of course, ALL LIVES MATTER, and anyone who doesn't think so, is by definition, a racist. According to the USDOJ, Cops kill about 250 black people a year, but kill over 600 whites and hispanics a year, and in 99.9% of those cases, those people posed a genuine threat to the life of the officer, or they wouldn't have been shot. In a nation of 320 million folks, there's always going to be bad people and bad cops. We don't live in Utopia. More people a killed by slipping in their bathtubs than are killed by police officers each year, so this is all much ado about nothing, which is what radical Marxists specialize in.
pure Jewish propaganda! - La Presse/ Montréal, le 03 mai 2016; (the American author Michael Chabon, Pulitzer Prize in 2001) "...That a people which was persecuted as long as horrible as take such a shift and eventually oppress another people to such a level of bureaucracy of mass is for me in a way much more appalling than apartheid, as awful that was apartheid, and I'm not there trying to play it down," he added. -
The cartoon you posted on and what your are insinuating in your comment.  Two died on a Portland train defending a young Muslim woman.  AM radio and Fox pump out fear and loathing at an alarming rate. A Muslim girl gotten beaten to death in VA this past week but no one says anything about that. A black soldier was murdered in Maryland and it is being investigated as a hate crime.   The "Democrat" was an angry white man and domestic abuser who shouldn't have been able to buy a gun.   Alex Jones says HRC was a demon.  Coulter said NYC would be better without Jewish people.  Palin put targets on people's heads in a flyer. Trump invited Nugent to the white house.  Spare me with the pearl clutching.
And in my lifetime, men who wore belts that said "Mitt Gott" systemically killed 6 million people, by name, number and religious identification as Jews.  And they went to Catholic and Luthern churchs on Sunday and there were Nazi flags on their altars.  I wish it were not true, but it was. My father helped to liberate Dachau.    He was in military government and one of his assignments was to take the German citizens of the village of Dachau through the concentration camp so that they could never say they did not know what happened there. He was a devoted Catholic and had majored in German in college. What he saw tormented him his whole life as he tried to make sense of what he knew happened and what his faith was.   Speak no more about a "war" on Christianity in the US.  Don't bear false witness.
And read the "Book of Mormon" in between frames...
What possible evidence do you have that Islam (or Hinduism or any of the 10,000+ religions found in recorded history) is a false religion but that Christianity is not?  It can't be from your God since you have no evidence that your God exists.
Singling out Israel for contempt is beyond mere criticism. And promoting her boycott, divestment and sanction is certainly more than mere criticism. Demonizing and delegitimizing Israel by way of the hateful  BDS is the slippery slope towards totalitarianism, just as was the hateful activity engaged in by Germans and the Soviets in their boycotts of Jewish enterprises, both countries having slipped towards totalitarianism.
What about Mexico? Mexican illegals are by far the largest number of violators. The fictitious 11.5 million number didn't just bottom out in 2003. They kept coming at the rate of 1 million per year. I guess his Jewish handlers do not want to put a stop to that. Balkanize the U.S. & destroy what ever there is is of the white European Protestant Peoples.
No occupation No settlements if - "There would have been no occupation, and no settlements, if Egypt and its allies hadn’t recklessly provoked a war."  "Or if the “international community” hadn’t fecklessly abandoned Israel in its desperate hours."  "Or if Jordan hadn’t foolishly ignored Israel’s warnings to stay out of it."  "Or if the Arab League hadn’t arrogantly rejected the possibility of peace." . "Arab states tried to annihilate the Jewish nation, yet Israel remains unforgiven for its crime of self-preservation" - Bret Stephens: Special to National Post | The New York Times - June 5, 2017
I would add that the Ontario government appears to be blind to the irony contained in the article's first sentence:   "The Ontario government is likening a proposed Christian law school's requirement of no sexual intimacy outside of heterosexual marriage to a bar against Jews that existed in the province's legal profession nearly 200 years ago."  Hello?  Ontario in recent years has been wanting to ban the licensing of the Christian law school's graduates, and yet it wants to somehow try to paint the law school (?) as akin to those who would bar Jews?  Hello?  The Ontario government needs to peer into a mirror to see the deserving recipient of its Jew-barring pot-shot...
I would hardly describe an interview of Kellie Leitch by Mark Steyn as wonderful. She's a divisive figure and he panders to the far right. And I certainly wouldn't describe anything they said as being TRUE, CIVIL, or DECENT.  I have no problem debating. But that requires one concedes what is FACT and what is OPINION. That one cannot distort the truth and make up facts or set up Strawmen. If you cannot admit that the Muslim teens at this school have a right to practice their religion, you shouldn't be commenting.  The question hasn't been about them setting up another separate school system. It is whether they can take a 15 minute break on Fridays at the school rather than simply skip Friday afternoons to attend service without being called Truants. Jews get the Sabbath off. Christians get Sunday off. Why do you feel so hostile to giving Muslim teens what amounts to a coffee break off on a Friday afternoon?  Sheesh! My Canada includes accommodation. Sorry.
The phrase "Kingdom of Heaven" is used in Matthew, while "Kingdom of God" is used in Mark and Luke. When Pilate asks Jesus, Jesus remains silent in the Synoptics. He does not wish to confirm the mistaken impression that he is a revolutionary, which is the text the party of the High Priest is peddling to Pilate so that Jesus can be executed as an enemy of Rome, but to deny his Kingship of the Jews would be to deny his very mission. John is clearer, perhaps for the reason you suggest.
I don’t want my security and safety to rely on the good intentions of a leader who has proven his inability to adhere to international agreements he made with regards to nuclear weapons, who fires artillery shells at his southern neighbour and periodically corks off a missile into the Pacific.  No amount of smooth talking diplomacy with this childish ego maniac is going to convince him to act otherwise.  Unfortunately, the only diplomacy Kim Jong-un is going to recognise comes with overwhelming force. I am reminded of what Benjamin Netanyahu said, “If the Arabs put down their weapons today, there would be no more ‎violence.  If the Jews put ‎down their weapons ‎today, there would be no ‎more Israel.” I appreciate your desire for peace through peaceful means but I believe Kim Jong-un would see an opportunity in our naivete.  I would prefer Standard Missile III as an alternative.
Faithful,  "What the Holocaust was to the Jewish people, abortion is to the unborn." And what Hate and Trickle-down does to the born is also done to the unborn!!!  When you damage society in any way abortion is just ONE of the outcomes you get. Viciousness and hate do NOT work. Only healing over a period of time will work.  My dear friend the bishop said there were many in his diocese that hated abortion. I said: isn't that good? He said yes but for the wrong reasons. They hated abortion for economic reasons, for racial reasons, because the poor made bad choices -- all wrong reasons. He said it was his job to teach them the correct reasons why.  He was not successful because they accused him of 'being soft on abortion.'  You can imagine that, I cannot.
We are obliged to keep forgiving. The individual seeking forgiveness must ask for it, be it from God or fellow human.  Judaism teaches those who have done wrong  seek forgiveness. The offender must sincerely ask pardon and seek to correct the wrongs he has done. After a certain point-- three sincere apologies, an attempt at restitution, a clear indication that the person has changed - it becomes the obligation of the wronged party to forgive.   The rabbis agree that teshuvah (repentance) requires five elements: recognition of one's sins as sins (hakarát ha-chét'), remorse (charatá), desisting from sin (azivát ha-chét'), restitution where possible (peira'ón), and confession (vidúi). The tradition is also quite clear, however, that  if they are done without desisting from sin, they do not constitute teshuva.  What Jesus changed was the number of time we should forgive. The rest reads like a manual for the sacrament of Penance.
If you carried a torch with those Nazis, if you marched alongside them as they chanted "Jews will not replace us" and "blood and soil" you are not a "very fine person", you are, at best, a Nazi sympathizer. At worst, you are a Nazi. If you stood and chanted with men and women who wore hoods emblazoned with confederate flags you are a KKK sympathizer. If you stand up for these people's good intentions and walk in solidarity with their "defense of cultural heritage" you are at least a fellow traveler in white supremacy, more likely a white supremacist yourself. Nobody marching with that crowd is a decent person, nobody. And they all had a hand on the steering wheel, as did Trump and his entire group of supporters, every one.
Finally, clear and sensible voices on a subject non-aboriginals are afraid to speak to.  The problems are real, evidence of pain and suffering are everywhere. Root causes of the problems can be addressed but aren't. The harsh reality is life is unlikely to change if the majority of Aboriginal Communities remain isolated from the opportunities offered in Canada by clinging to land that simply cannot sustain life.  Canada today was built on the success and failures of people trying to make life better for themselves, their families and their communities.  When land or conditions didn't allow that, they picked up and moved somewhere where they thought times would be better.  It's happening in Alberta. It was a magnet for opportunity. Today, less so. Many there have decided to look for greener pastures.  The Aboriginal Communities would do well to follow the same path. Worried about assimilation? Look to the  Jewish Community for the best example of how to get it right.
My granddaughter attended a march in Orlando. Not one hate chant told hold. All was peaceful. They were there to say this man does not represent my values, along with their gay, trans, Mexican, black, Muslim, Jewish friends.
Well, perhaps you SHOULDN'T be so confident.  If you read Article III...the "judges" violate that article on a daily basis.  Hmmm..it apparently was OK for other presidents (including obama) to ban entire countries.  And during the Cold War era, Presidents allowed Jews from Communist Russia to enter, to the exclusion of others.  If a "failed state", or a nation that sponsors terrorism is on the current list (which they are)..those states are either UNABLE, or UNWILLING to provide what's necessary to adequately vet those wishing to come here.  These people are foreigners, in a foreign country and HAVE no Constitutional protections.  They can be excluded either by "class", "country" or any other reason.  How many "nazis" were allowed in from Germany during WWII?  Are we taking in North Koreans?  (What does "Death to America" mean to you?) The judges decided on elements that had no bearing, or standing in the question at hand.  They apparently DON"T know the Constitution, or the law.
Barry O is gone. This was his last vindictive move against the Jewish state. Thank G-d for President Trump.
That's like saying a racist doesn't hate black people, he just hates the color of their skin. Or an anti-Semite doesn't hate Jews, he just hates their religion. Or a misogynist doesn't hate women, he just hates their gender.
Very well said, Richmond.  Let me know where I can sign the petition with other vegetarians, Hindus, etc.  against The Keg when you get a chance.
No, everyone is entitled to their personal philosophy, i.e. how they conduct their personal lives, whether it is based on some religious belief or from some other source. And I'm fine with that, quite religiously tolerant, in fact. You want to spend your life in a Buddhist monastery? You try to avoid temptation, i.e. bars, pastry shops, etc. based on your weaknesses? Fine with me, none of my business!  Plenty of people probably have similar personal beliefs, for a variety of reasons. They want to protect their intimate relationships, or they want to protect themselves against accusations of harassment, etc. They avoid pastry shops, or bars, for similar reasons, i.e. avoiding temptation. Their personal choice.  The problems arise when you demand society be reorganised in order to accommodate your extreme religious beliefs. No, we will not reorganize our society so you aren't "tempted" by women, or alcohol, or pork, in schools, universities, workplaces, public spaces, etc.
If a person wants moral certitude today, then they need to become either a Mormon or an evangelical Christian.
The definition of apartheid is any system or practice that separates people according to color, ethnicity, gender, caste, sexual orientation, etc.  That definition is straight out of multiple dictionaries and it is why the majority of states in the Arab League are Apartheid states.  Also, by your definition of Apartheid, Canada could easily be classified as an apartheid state for the decade we were "calling the shots" in Afghanistan.  As I said, you're splitting hairs regarding your definition of apartheid vs mine.  It's irrelevant... the important issue is state sanctioned systemic discrimination, which you have acknowledged is rampant throughout the middle east.   Your claim that the constitution of Palestine doesn't discriminate is puzzling, given the basis of the entire constitution is Sharia Law.  This is a fact that is spelled out in the constitution itself.  Are you going to tell me that Women, Jews, and Homosexuals are not discriminated against under Sharia law?
National Socialist sympathizers still deny the extermination of 12,000,000 + non combatants in their extermination camps (half being Jewish with 500,000 Roman not even included in the Nuremberg calculations) Dachau etc.,  The Germans kept very good records ...easier to trace ones relatives in their records.  Communist sympathizer still deny the Holomodor, the Gulag, Norilsk, Kolyma etc. 10,000,000 + killed   The Soviets kept very poor records ( reasonable only between '34-'43) 7,000,000 Ukrainian, , 2,000,000 Muslim Chechens, Ingush, Tartars, Bashkirs , Kazakhs ....then million + of Russians, Don Cossacks, Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanians, Poles....very poor ability to trace one's relatives there ...the window opened slightly during the Soviet collapse but quickly closed.
Currently, over 1 million Palestinians are allowed to live, vote and run for office in Israel even though they do not always live there peacefully. Meanwhile in Gaza, which has been unilaterally turned over to Palestinian rule, no Jews are allowed and they would be killed on sight if they went there. So yes, balance is needed, but in precisely the opposite direction of what Jerry Ragan thinks. Only when Palestinians demand leadership who will disavow their current policy of the annihilation of Israel and every Jew in it will there be any opportunity for peace. Israel has every moral right to protect themselves and defend their territory.
Since Gallup found in 2016 that 73.4% of Americans claim to be "Christians" of one kind or another, that's a fair argument that we are indeed "a Christian nation".     The figures from the PEW researchers only put it at 70.2% in 2014 but that's still a pretty fair majority.    Only 18.2% are agnostic, atheist or none of the above.  The rest believe some body else is turning the crank.    Worldwide:  33% are 'Christians', 21% are Muslims, 14% are Hindu and only 16% are non-religious--and that includes the 'deists'.      http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html
Catholicism also used natural law and Aristotelian logic to determine its views.  It did not only accept Jewish law and Scripture.
In Judeo-Christian-Islamic system inherently draws a line between believers and non-believers. It is so strongly held in the Islamic faith; hence millions -- in the Balkans by the Ottoman and the marauding forces from the Arab world into the sub-continent to far-East-- were commanded and demanded into the faith system. And millions fell to the sword as noted above. German people did that only 80 years ago by just believing a Jew- the Christ and disbelieving the other Jews. And the Jews not believing Him.  Essentially all religions have loaded the societies with untold hardship.  But here we are now - a modern world. Keeping the scorecard is not going to bring peace. However, adherents of Islam insisting on their total acceptance whilst retaining them to be in a closed society within an open society is inherently built with fault-lines. Great minds have to bring some sanity for the future.
We can't even know if there was a Jesus of Nazareth. But if you subtract all the stuff that is similar to Pagan imagery, such as virgin birth, human sacrifice, anointing, resurrection, drinking blood, bridegroom, etc., then you are left with Jesus' message of love, forgiveness, repentance, and presumably his mistaken belief the world was about to end. Probably most would agree Jesus was some sort of itinerant preacher and healer. I don't agree with the book 'Zealot' which has Jesus as an ordinary rebel in the civil strife of the times, with oppressed Jews fighting against Romans and their wealthy Jewish collaborators. Jesus seems more special than that. But it is important to know something of the mythology and the politics of the times to understand what may be factual in the New Testament. Jesus' message of a loving 'Abba' does not seem to be compatible with passages that make Jesus into a human sacrifice. And Vaticanism is not going to tell us much about Jesus with any accuracy.
Actually, it's a Jewish group, using internationally-respected source material. The website you reference just republished the primer they created. And the ADL isn't exactly an impartial source either, so the comment is rather ironic, just like your use of Oren.  All you're really saying is that you can't find any impartial sources to back up your statements, which are gross misrepresentations of the facts, meant to defend the indefensible.
Excellent article.  I think we all know that Israel never really wanted peace. When you run an Occupation for decades, its been almost 50 years now....and bring in hundreds of thousands of Jewish "settlers" on expropriated land every year it's beyond conjecture what the end game really is. It is the expropriation of the lands in question for religious purposes.   I do not think that history will regard what Israel did as being moral or just nor what various elements of the Jewish diaspora has done to suppress debate or present disinformation or to deflect criticism by continually bringing up past transgressions against the Jewish people (as though acts of the past somehow gives you the right to commit immoral acts now in return ).  The other conclusion we can draw from this sorry and regretful situation is the role that the Jewish and Muslim religion has played in directing immoral behaviour. There can be no doubt that religion makes otherwise moral people commit immoral acts.
Not sure I quite follow, Monte. But the political aspirations (social justice passions) of 1st Century Jews were very much tied to flesh and blood suffering at the hands of the Romans. It wasn't simply theoretical injustice. By any rational standard, Roman oppression was the overwhelming cause of Jewish want and suffering.   I think Christian social justice combatants have to grapple honestly with the theological significance of Jesus failure to endorse political solutions for social injustice before urging the church to engage in divisive political battles. To repeat myself, Jesus' refusal to seek political reform or avail Himself of political power are like "the dog that didn't bark."
Geert Wilders accused   opposite of failing to stand up for Christians, and said resisting Islam was a matter of survival for the Netherlands. He has stated the following:  ‘Political Correctness and Islam Will Destroy Our Nation’ Why,Islam and democracy cannot coexist. And you can see that in, literally, every country in which Islam is dominant. We can see a total lack of freedom, you can see widespread violence and oppression, whether you are a Christian or Jew or whether you are an apostate or a critical journalist" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma2Tbkk8lZc ==== This as Justin Trudeau’s call to the world that Canada could be the first ever “post-national state” with “no core identity”.!!!!!! Talk about worlds apart,
“But you were perfectly fine with it when Obama held multiple closed door meetings with Black Lives Matter at the White House?” That’s quite an assumption out of nowhere. No! I wasn’t ‘perfectly fine with it’. I don’t know what was said in those meetings, do you? Maybe Obama told ‘em that the radical factions/people in that group need to cool their jets. I could see that.  I’m not ok with those cop killings or with cops killing people for no good reason & getting away with it. Not ok with some whackjob shooting Congressman. Not ok with the many instances of far right fringe whackos, KKK, neoNazis, etc bombing & burning Jewish synagogues, Mosques, & predominantly black churches. It has been documented that the great majority, pretty much all, of the homegrown terrorist acts have been committed by people that share the same views as those groups I mentioned. Unless you get & believe all your “news” from some so called alt-right, conspiracy theory, web sites you know this.
I don't believe that Raymond is inferring what you imply at  all.  Sex trafficking of underage girls and boys is abhorrent to all ethical humans whether they be Catholic, other religions, agnostics or atheists. Seems that Catholic clergy were involved in their own form of trafficking when Bishops simply passed offending priests to other parishes.  Perhaps we could call it trafficking of abusive clergy.....
No myth is HISTORICALLY accurate.  But this story is the basis of the teaching that 1) Eve [and some Fathers/Doctors taught that Eve stood for all women] tempted Adam---and all men 2) That all humanity 'fell' from God's grace 3) That Original Sin entered the world [although the Jewish people did not believe in Original Sin 4) That Jesus had to die to 'expiate' God's Wrath over this sin ------------------- There was no Garden, there was no Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, there was no fall.  But the official church is still teaching this as if it was not a myth.
@ Register-Guard, putting someone's name in triple parentheses is a white-supremacist means of targeting jewish people. It is hate speech. Please remove.
The 2004 International Court of Justice Opinion.  The US (Jewish)  and UK Judges on the panel agree that the settlements are illegal.   How's that for for 1 source.
Just wondering why you refer to the architect as "Polish-American", omitting his Jewish ethnicity?
there is only one group that has documented their hatred for Jews and infidels.  Pretty sure that group does not consider themselves "trump supporters"
The headline indicates an atheist would celebrate Christmas. Why would you celebrate or even entertain thoughts of Christmas at all? You're an atheist, we understand. No harm no foul.
Henry Ford also bought a newspaper, the Dearborn Independent, and proceded to use it to publish really nasty anti-Semitic propaganda. For months. Jews and others started boycotting Ford cars. Eventually, people persuaded Henry Ford to stop publishing the idiocy. But, my dad died in 1999, and he NEVER purchased a Ford car. Many people in my extended family of the same generation as my dad didn't purchase them either.
As an atheist, I hate that they’ve made this into a Religious Freedoms issue.  Governments should never discriminate.  However, individuals cannot truly be free if they are forced into doing business with others.  I believe the Left wanted this to be a religious issue, because they know the courts will be less likely to rule in favor of “religion”.  Individual rights will lose, which is exactly what the Left wants.
There are good Muslims and bad Muslims.  There are good Christians and bad Christians.  There are good atheists and bad atheists.  Hate speech is illegal, whether uttered by Muslims, Christians or anyone else.  Police prosecute those engaged in hate speech.  It is generally seen as a good thing when people report instances of hate speech.  I haven't seen the video; however, I glean from the G&M's article that the reward is offered for those showing someone engaged in hate speech.  Since hate speech is illegal, and since reporting it is seen as a public duty, I fail to see why someone offering a reward for the public to report an instance of hate speech is such a bad thing.
Keep in mind: these refugees are coming from failed cultures and societies. They are not like the refugees of the past, who came from advanced societies in Europe and Asia. The Jews, as so many like to bring up, were from the highly educated classes of Europe, noted scholars and business people. These refugees will require decades of support, and that is if they do not go rogue like they have done in Europe, and just drift into crime and civil unrest. Canada is making a big mistake.
It took some stones to write this leditor.  For such an effective hunter in the past, the ADL has brought forward few names and faces. To shortstop righteous reaction,  I have a Jewish spouse and grandchildren. Their lives and safety are dear to me. I don't believe or trust anti-Semites. I don't believe or trust Israel(is).
When I was growing up, the Palestinians didn't even exist in Western conscious. The creation of Israel was subtle portrayed as giving empty land to the Jews after World War 2. It wasn't until much later when I did my own research that I realized that thousands of Arabs were driven off their land. It was one of the last acts of Western colonialism when Europeans drove off the natives from their land.  Today, the Palestinians do have a voice and I believe that many people in the West do believe they deserve their own homeland and the right to chart their own destiny. We see the growth of the Israel apartheid movement and economic sanctions.  What's left unsaid is one of the primary reasons for the 9/11 attacks is the brutal treatment of the Palestinians. In one of his speeches, Bin Laden said he planned the 9/11 attacks for the Palestinians. As long as they remain humiliated, we will see violence in the Middle East and the rest of the world.
Harper also ran a candidate that would come to your home and pee in your dishes.  Doesn't mean Harper was really tolerant of that - at least for his own dishes.  At one time Harper wanted a party of Theo-Cons; all the orthodox religions of the book (Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist) holding hands and hating progressives and gays like Baird.  Baird wisely never "came out" to Canadians or his constituency; he just enjoy the benefits of all the progressives who fought for his rights.  BTW, Harper specifically attacked refugee programmes and had Kenney cut health care to vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers.  My MP sent me dog whistle note asking if I approved of refugees "getting better health care" than me.
There is a major lie in this article and it is a very  serious one too. The killer of Robert Kennedy was not a drug crazed youth. Sirhan Sirhan killed Robert Kennnedy because of Israel. Sirhan stated many multiple  times over the years and he never waivered on his declaration, that he did it because his Palestinian relatives were killed in an Israeli bombing raid, and Kennedy was a supporter of Israel and was at the  time of the shooting out stumping for US Jewish votes. To put out such a cheap brazen piece of propaganda is beneath contempt for the Globe.
Nonsense again. You are the one conflating people's religion with their race. No one has grudges against Buddhists for being Buddhists, because Buddhism is not a threatening religion. There have been times in the past, as now, when a particular nationality was at war with us, and was suspected accordingly.  Blonde blue-eyed Muslims have been islamic terrorists, everyone knows that, which is why people are afraid of the religion, not the race. The only difference is that they are less likely to be Muslim, so unless they wear the visible garb that identifies them as such, it is reasonable to assume they are not, just as it is reasonable to assume that a little old lady or a woman with young children or a young child isn't.  But since those assumptions have been proven wrong, that is why we have stringent procedures to check everyone, likely or not.
Ecumenicalism made a great leap forward in 2011 when a  a new rite was made for Anglicans and Methodists coming in to full visible communion with the Church.   Especially since there is a sense among faithful Catholics that this rite is a fuller expression of the Faith than the Ordinary Form, at least in the typical way the latter is offered, despite its its origin in (notorious schismatic and heresiarch) Thomas Cranmer's Book of Common Prayer.   This is new in the history of the Church since the beginning of Protestantism: belief, put into practice, that developments after Protestant schisms can be authentically Christian and have a place in the universal Church.   Also not to be missed: the interest by Catholics in Plantinga and other Protestant scholars, and that many leaders in the Church, an outsized proportion of writers, academics, ministers, and evangelists, are former Protestants who did not leave Protestant spirituality behind when they came over.
I immediately caught the tongue-in-cheek tone of this piece and, even as a liberal, actually applauded a little.   Except the part about lack of religious belief (the Christian religion, even) being a drawback.   93 percent of the National Academy of Sciences - the cream of the crop of American scientists - claim to be either atheist or agnostic.    No religious belief is a good thing for this country and the fewer who continue to cling to these divisive ancient ideologies, the better.
Mr. Trump's already begun implementing his stated goals to (1) create a Muslim registry in the U.S. (much like what happened in Germany under Hitler with Jews, Hungarian gypsies, & intellectuals); (2) isolate America by reneging on trade agreements with nations, which will raise prices here (we don't produce everything); (3) break up NATO alliances which provide mutual security and limit nuclear weapons; (4) squash the free press and dissent; (5) abolish Obamacare, leaving millions uninsured, many of whom will die without care; (6) resume the Keystone & Dakota pipelines; (7) deregulate car and air pollution standards & deregulate  controls on risky Wall Street trading; (8) deny climate change and the erosion of the ozone layer; (9) privatize Medicare & Social Security & eliminate Medicaid.(Not enough space for more.) If Americans are passive and remain stubbornly uninformed until something bad happens to THEM, then it will be too late for us all.  We get the government we deserve.
Dear Muslims;  Welcome to the community of progressive left wing religious intolerance.  You are joining a group of Christians, Catholics and Jewish who for decades have been shunned, scorned, ridiculed, mocked and marginalized by the secular progressive community in Canada.  These leftwing progressives have worked very hard to shut down religion and religious practice in public spaces and public institutions.  So this act of inclusion, by joining this prestigious club of the hated, will help support your struggle that so many religions in Canada have experienced before you.     Pay no attention to our social justice leaders, who are using tragedies to ram though pet personal agendas that seek to further divide through inequality and prioritizing which religions are more important then others.  Stay strong, be of good courage and you will succeed beyond the hate.   Thank You;  Freedom of Religion
Would you have a problem if the 19-year-old elected representative were an atheist or a Marxist?
Just for the record, I'm now an atheist, but I spent a number of years actively involved in my church, leading bible studies, and was an active part of the pastoral team (though a civilian; I wasn't a pastor per se).  You'll likely find that many, many atheists either grew up in religious households or came to religion on their own and then found their way out of it, as I did.  There's even an organization created exclusively for leaders in the church community who have concluded that they are atheists: http://clergyproject.org. It's a large and rapidly growing organization.
I remember First Saturday devotions during my childhood, when there was great fear of  a thermonuclear Third World War with Russia.  We were encouraged to pray for the conversion of atheistic Russians and the consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of  Mary. In retrospect, it's debatable whether those voluminous prayers have yet been answered.
In general you are correct. The problem is that humans have a need or desire for companionship. That companionship entails necessary factors like protection, values, traditions, and commonality. As much as each individual is different, humans group together with those factors as a sort of magnet. They become uncomfortable when an "outsider" tries to undermine the core factors that "glue" the group together. Mind you, these factors help the society or group function. For example, a United States citizen may have no problem eating Chinese food offered by their Chinese neighbor, but that same citizen does not want their Christian values and religion undermined by Buddhism. Likewise, he or she does not want the English language to be superseded by the Chinese language. The food is not a core factor, but the interference into the core factor of the society's values/religion or language is a problem. So...in this respect science can definitely be applied to people.
yes, but there is a reserved seat in the Iranian parliament for Jews.  Be interested in your source as the only ones I see are in Farsi
In an otherwise good essay, a couple of things don't ring true: <There is no evidence that the president harbors racist views.> Except for a life-time of racist behavior, crowned by a presidential campaign rooted in the racist drivel of birtherism. Is MSW trying to distinguish between racist behavior, which we can observe, and private thoughts, which we cannot know? It's a useless distinction: behind racist rhetoric and behavior there lurks a racist. <I did not see a man who was acting out of racist instincts. I saw a man acting out of reptilian instincts> These two sets of  "instincts" - racist and reptilian - are not mutually exclusive; indeed, they are entirely congruent. <He apparently did not hear the Charlottesville racists chanting, "Jew will not replace us.">  The only way he did not hear that chant is if he chose not to hear it. Or the guy who said we need a president just like Trump, except one who wouldn't "give his daughter to a Jew." Trump needs to heed Gore: Resign.
["First, they came for the socialists...] I think we can apply that more directly to the White House. First, Trump fired Flynn, and I did not speak out.  Then Trump fired Yates and Comey in the Department of Justice, and I wasn't a Justice official, so I didn't speak out.  Then Trump fired Scaramo- Okay.  Maybe it doesn't work so well.  Maybe I'll revisit the poem if Trump fires Comey. [Michael D. Cohen, the president's longtime personal lawyer, who is Jewish, denounced hate groups but defended Trump in response to a reporter's question on Wednesday.] As someone with a legal background I could help but smirk and shake my head a bit when I read that one.
"First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist.  Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—  Because I was not a Trade Unionist.  Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—  Because I was not a Jew.  Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me."  ------------ You can substitute Bannon targets for this Holocaust warning....perhaps "immigrants for Socialists"  "Gay's for Trade Unionists.  They ARE coming for Jews right now and if we don't wantGermany in the 30s we must speak up....and the bishops have established that they are incapable...so think it's up to us!
The demonization and delegitimization of the Jewish state is a clear contributor to the Jew hatred that is being perpetrated against Jews and Jewish institutions today and you are amongst its contributors.
Neoplatonic argument, not Christian. Only pietousness denies sexual pleasure is itslef a worthy end. No Jewish Rabbi, including Christ, would demand that kind of sexual perfectionism (or rather, asexually based perfectionism). The desire for union is not just for children.
Technically the bar was not against Jews since Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists would have also been prevented from taking the oath  But somehow this particular argument has been conflated to a bar just against Jews  As Canadians we were all required to say the Lord's prayer in public school right until the 80s (85 to be exact)  People could choose not to participate if they so wished so this whole "equivalent to" argument gets you nowhere since opting out is always an option  The real issue is whether a person who graduates from this school can uphold the law without recrimination or prejudice Assuming they have passed the bar ..... a lawyer is a lawyer  is a lawyer  Whether they are christian, muslim, jewish or atheist
The land that Israel is "occupying" belonged to a Jewish state at one time. Therefore one cannot "occupy" one's own land. Palestinians have been give billions of dollars from countries around the world and the UN. They could have built new towns and villages.  Where is the money? Peace and prosperity is at hand for the Palestinians. They merely have to sit down and negotiate.
I'm sure those Imam in Canada who suggested killing Jews and non believers were prosecuted for hate speech?
If someone repeatedly posts notes saying people like me should be wiped out, I'd like to know who it is, so that I can avoid him and inform my friends to do so too. It can be a matter of life and death.   Its not just exposing someone who posted a stupid video of Trump.  Its someone who has repeatedly expressed some pretty vile thoughts, and we have no way of knowing how serious he is about them, or how much they influence others to take action.  Please don't make out its only about the video. Its not.  He also posted pictures of all of CNN's jewish staff, with stars of david.   He demanded extermination of muslims.  He demeaned blacks. This was not merely someone who wasn't nice -- it was someone many of us would avoid in real life, if we knew who he was, and we'd do so for fear of our own safety.
Sorry to burst your bubble, but Court of Appeal of Versailles, France  had ruled in 2013 that the building of Jewish communities and the governing of the region of Judea and Samaria (aka West Bank)  by Israel is unequivocally legal under international law,
Alceste : Can you really tell me that there are Imams that publicly state that homosexuals, women, and Atheists are equal to Muslim men?
In general I'm ok with this.  No need to force someone into something they do not believe in, and as someone has posted, make schools completely secular.  That said, make darn sure that kirpans, burqas, hijabs, skull caps and any and all associated religious acts associated with other religions are admonished from the school system just the same.  Try that and watch the riot begin.  Another important point being raised here is one of what are schools for in the first place.....they are places of learning, NOT places of opinion and bias.   Some may not desire the teachings of a Jewish nomad....that's fine, but then there ought not be teachings of moral leanings of any sort.....I trust all know what that means...
This is deplorable! I disagree that this is Steve Bannon or anyone else associated with the current Presidents party.  However there is a party and its followers that have been notorious for their antisemitic views.  I will give you a hint.  It is the party and its followers that populated the KKK in its heyday, it is the party of a now past president that hated this country and what it stands for. It is the political party and its followers that have great interest in importing to this country people that openly hate the Jewish community and the Jewish state. It is the political party and its followers that used to say they were for tolerance and now are anything but tolerant. And it is the political party and its followers that used to protest FOR free speech, but now are so afraid of anyone else's view that they will burn their own universities to the ground before they let an apposing view be expressed.  2012 DNC Convention. Take a look and see who.    https://youtu.be/cncbOEoQbOg
Janhoi, as I wrote above---abortion was permitted by the Jews until "quickening" occurred.  In the Midrash writings, vinegar and 'absorbants' were to be used.  Did Jesus know about this----probably.
A lot of Jews around the world, even in western countries, keep strong ties with Israel. They don't know when their gentile neighbours can turn on them. It has already happened once, with terrible consequences.
"You were meant to think that 'just and reasonable cause' could not possibly mean 'ten atheists present' (per your initial and very odd 'hypo' scenario)."  ********* My "initial" hypo didn't change.  So your use of "initial" is misleading.  I never did think or say that the presence of ten atheists was "just cause," although I don't see why it can't be, depending on the priest's intent.    I didn't switch ground rules.  You asked me what the just cause was, and from the beginning, I said, I said the priest's desire to say Mass was just cause.    Note what lies between the quotes that follow; this is the THIRD time now that I'm saying:  "I didn't say that the presence of ten atheists provides 'just and reasonable cause.' I said 'THE PRIEST'S DESIRE TO SAY MASS---as is 'earnestly recommended'---IF it is not possible to have other faithful present, is 'just and reasonable cause.'"  You not only kept forgetting the contents of the thread, but couldn't keep your train of thought.
“The Palestinians want”  Are legally entitled to …  “areas Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war”  Seized through military aggression, in a war Israel started strictly for the purpose of obtaining land the Zionists desire as part of “greater Israel”, an idea akin to that of Hitler’s Lebensraum.  The 1967 War and the Israeli Occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Jews for Justice in the Middle East http://ifamericansknew.org/history/origin.html#1967  That’s why its continued military occupation and colonization is illegal.
"During the contest, Ms. Lin spoke about the plight of Falun Gong practitioners in China. When she attempted to travel to Hainan for the Miss World pageant, Chinese authorities formally barred her from entering." - Why not the plight of the Tibetans instead of the Falun Gong stuff which is something like Buddhist meditation.
"Why is it so difficult to believe in a God that created us with a purpose in mind? I guess I'd ask, why did God create Hitler that led to the gassing of thousands of innocent children? I figure the answer is partly that those children went up to heaven and so it's all ok in the end.  I don't dismiss there is a higher being. I just don't believe we are under its influence. I don't believe in miracles and I don't believe Jesus rose from the dead. I do believe when we die that's it. Most religious people can't handle that and so religion says you "live" forever in heaven (if you are good). If that provides comfort, fine. But I believe 6 million Jews suffered and there is no final thing that made that justifiable. The only justice will be to make sure it does not happen again. I also don't believe the Bible is the word of God. And I don't believe were were placed here by outside intelligence.  Cite the quote re: Dawkins.
And it works- in an idealistic world where all your decisions only affect yourself. In the real world that description is true of very, very few decions. Those few - yes they belong entirely in your own realm. That's why we liberal lefty types defend gay rights, atheists, want drugs and prostitution legalized. Those are matters where government serves no useful purpose, so keep government out of it.  But a great many decisions affect other people. When it's ONE other person - it's often best to let you two just sort it out amongst yourselves, at that point the market concept is mostly good.  The only role of government is to ensure you're not somehow forcing, blackmailing or extorting the other person to agree. But when it's thirty people ? Three hundred ? Three thousand ?  Those versions break down rapidly - they cannot scale.   The man who employes 3000 people invariably has massively more power than any of them, and extortion and duress become unavoidable.
Comparing what happened in Charlottesville to the Holocaust is a bit of a stretch if not dishonest. One person died in Charlottesville. 6,000,000 Jews died during the Holocaust. It may be that some people want to see the "same hatred," the "same bigotry," the "same racism"......but the fact remains that they are not "the same." In Charlottesville, the people, the police, and the government have arrested the criminal, will have a trial for justice, and - hopefully - justice will prevail. That did not happen in Germany. The German people were part of the problem. The German police were part of the problem. The German Government was the problem. And, unlike in Charlottesville, NO ONE in Germany lifted a finger to stop the madness that would lead to the Holocaust, the death of 6,000,000 Jews, WW2, and the deaths of millions more.......simply because Germans tolerated a Nazi Psychopath. That did NOT happen in Charlottesville. The Nazi Psychopath is in an American jail.
Your comment could have been found in any British newspaper after Jewish extremists exploded a bomb in 1946 at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem killing 90 people and injuring others. The Japanese would have said the same thing after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Muslim extremists didn't corner the market on atrocities.
bull. his relatives are Jewish- and Ben Carson supported him. you are wrong.
You don't know what you are talking about . There are hundreds of thousands of Arabs  with voting rights in Israel and guaranteed seats in its Parliament .  There is no apartheid in the Arab countries  because the Jews that once lived there in peace for centuries  have been driven or or killed..
Kushner is a perfect fall guy. Bannon's glad to blame a Jew, Priebus is glad to blame an outsider, and Trump would love Ivanka to be single.
As usual, one person has become a newspaper's sacrificial lamb, asked to justify his existence and epistemology on or near Dec 25. As these things go, this none was not too bad.  But also as usual, the effort at dialogue and understanding has been dragged down a slippery slope by some people trying to parse the definitions of and prove the superiority of atheism and agnosticism, relatively speaking. How sad. Me? I am the Pope of the Atheists, sworn to strive against make-believe and to champion respect amongst all people. Happy merry to you all.
If you truly want to respect history, you must acknowledge 1) The land is and always was Israel's 2) Any Islamic presence in East Jerusalem, or anywhere in Israel is nothing more that a concerted indignation towards the Jews and the continued intent to wipe out the Jewish population 3) The Israelite ancestors are indigenous to the region, and their descendants deserve every right to claim land there.       If any of that can't be understood, then two state solutions are an impossibility and war is imminent.  Moving the capital to Jerusalem will only start whats going to happen anyway.  May as well get it over with.
No, Layla4, the same groups that used to hate jews, switched to hating muslims.  Best example, the Front Nationale in France - from Le Pen father to daughter.  The important thing for them is to have an 'other' to focus hatred.
I have met and taught in adult classes a few converts from Protestant churches.  In the 16th century those who left the Catholic church did so because they thought it needed reform. It has crossed my mind that today there are some converts from the Protestant Churches who are coming into the Catholic Church and trying to reform it from within.
This is a very welcome article by Mr. Lynk, and not just because it points to the grave abuses that Israel is committing against Palestinians. What's most worthy of praise is the author's citation of Theodor Meron, former legal adviser to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He recognized Israel's abuses long ago.   Mr. Meron is a survivor of the Holocaust. He has my deepest respect because he's willing to transcend his Jewish identity and the injustices inflicted on him because of it. Instead of ethnic revenge, he seeks universal justice for all.  For over 2000 years, eminent Jews have remarked that a wrong can't be rectified by inflicting a further wrong on someone else. No matter who you are, or what your ethnicity, you ignore that observation at your peril.
Conservative Christian churches like Garret Hashimoto can freely ignore the IRS rules because they think they can get away with it, and they are counting on the Republicans in Congress to rein in the IRS. Look for the possibility that the Republicans will rewrite the rules to permit politicking by Christian churches but not Jewish synagogues and Muslim mosques and even amending the Constitution making the US a Christian nation.  A truly frightening prospect.
The only difference between the plight of the Palestinians and the plight of native peoples in Canada is that there are no Jews involved in the latter circumstances. If there were, the national and international outrage would be deafening as it was at the UN.
Where is there any  Hindu,  Jewish,  Shinto etc in the schools?
Why not mention that? There is no evidence of white people in Canada. You have no right to be there. Plenty of evidence linking Israel to jews.
Native Canadians-- First Nations-- have full legal and civil rights, including the right to vote for the Canadian government. While there were errors made in the colonial era of history, steps were, and are, being taken in the interest of reconciliation, including compensation for past wrongs.  Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are governed by Israeli military law, and have no civil or legal rights under Israeli law. Jewish Israeli settles in West Bank and Gaza are governed by Israeli civil law, under which they have full rights.  The majority of Palestinians were pushed out of Israel as part of the state's creation. Those remaining-- 15 to20% of the original inhabitants-- are second-class citizens, with vey limited rights within Israel proper.  The comparison between the treatment of native Canadians in the 15th to 19th centuries an treatment of Palestinians from 1948 to date is not only inaccurate-- to attempt to justify Israel's treatment of Palestinians on that basis is sick.
There's only one problem with your analogy Mr. Oshiro - the Jews never committed acts of Terror. And I would liken the imprisoned German citizenry to people fighting against tyranny within their own borders.  If this is Nazi guilt on behalf of Merkel, it is definitely misplaced. There are marches on the streets with throngs of Muslims advocating for Sharia law in Germany. Muslims interviewed in Germany haughtily state that they will out populate the Europeans and dominate the land.  German citizens are beaten in the streets, German women are raped.  And our American Press speak nothing of it. This is what is propagandistic- deliberately depriving American citizens of knowing the whole of the truth that is going on in Europe presently and I find it shameful. I abhor power politics and violence in all forms regardless of where it comes from. And, unfortunately, it is coming from Arab states. Muslims themselves need to fight against this hatred and violence.
I'm not in the least unfriendly to such alternatives. I just don't think think a Buddhist connotation was intended by the designer of the image in question. Of course, I could be wrong.
Paul, buddy, you're quibbling. The WN's in Charlottesville defined THEMSELVES as fascists by using the actual historical rhetoric, symbols and gestures of fascist political movement such  as the Nazis: "Jews will not replace us": "blood and soil"; swastikas and Nazi salutes.  There's nothing subjective or figurative about calling people like that "fascist". They themselves insist on it. It's a term of pride,  not a pejorative.   The primary way in which you'd determine who is and isn't fascist would simply be by applying federal anti-discrimination laws. The fascists in Charlottesville clearly embraced white supremacy as the defining part of their identity, as it was for historical fascism.
Perhaps the idea of choosing an inhabited land, ethnically cleansing half of its people and oppressing the rest is the source of that instability and those murderous thugs.  For it was not the countries of the middle east that were hostile to Jews prior to Zionism. Yet somehow European colonialists felt they could take this land without repercussion. Which I still can't believe.   I trust just about every country in the world more than I trust Israel ...Israel who did 911 Israel who regularly sells our nuclear secrets, our advanced weapons systems and our drone technology to our enemies. Israel who won't join the nuclear non proliferation treaty by signing it, Israel who is the only country in the middle east who regularly threatens to blow up the world if anyone tries to put a stop to their plundering and killing. Sorry I will take Iran over Israel every single day. Israel who bombed and killed our servivement at the King David hotel, the USS Liberty, and the USS Cole
Are you suggesting that Jews were not among the senior scientists of the Manhattan Project?  Then enlighten us with the "truth", go ahead, amuse us...
An Israeli acquaintance sarcastically said that communism was created by European Jews.  Perhaps the RO priest was referring to that historical event resulting in Russia's woes since 1917 .... ya think?!!
A Jewish Deli does not have Ham, your parallel is fundamentally flawed.  If the church carries their signs into the gay bar, I would expect the bar staff to refuse service, as they would be creating a public nuisance.  In this case, a business, one who carries a contract with the city or township (in the form of a business license) has decided that some citizens are worthy of his product in violation of the civil rights act and anti-discrimination laws.  What is the difference between deciding that homosexuals violate his beliefs and cannot be served, and deciding that people of different color or inter-racial couples do not qualify?  What about those asking for the star of David on their cake?  Does this same cake maker demand a counseling session with the happy couple to put his mind at ease that this marriage will not end in divorce, as it is also counter to the teachings of the Bible?
The "Violent Left" only attacks the Violent Right. Unlike the Violent right, who attacks everybody else. Quick question for you Duffer: Were the Jews who fought against the Nazis in WW2 as guilty as the Nazis they fought against?
Er, they were Jews who lived by the Mosaic Law as interpreted by Pharisees. Catholics understand the operation of grace and our need to cooperate with God. And, do remember, Zacchaeus didn't expect anything from Jesus. He sought sight of Jesus, responded when he was called, repented his past transgressions and. so far as we know, amended his life.
Right, isn't some grand poobah Muslim currently under investigation for preaching in a mosque the assignation of Jewish folk. Then there's the muslim lady in jail for trying to kill people with a golf club in CTC, she didn't show up for her trial date. It 's all publicized and festers the concern about muslim people
graykeeper. Err... no. The Bataan Death March was an atrocity of war, not genocide. And while the Japanese did treat the indigenous Filipino population cruelly and killed very many, they did not try to destroy the entire population (genocide). In fact the Japanese considered the Philippines as part of their "Greater Far East Co-Prosperity Sphere." Think colony, like how the British viewed India. Except without the overt violence. Genocide would better fit what the NAZI's did to the Jews during WWII or what the Turks did to the Armenians during WWI. More examples, but I don't want to bore you. But you shouldn't try to change history to fit your views. It does an injustice to history and the people who died making it. Carry on......
trump HAS NO CHANCE of winning.  His own party wants NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM.  He's insulted and alienated:  blacks Hispanics women asians muslims jews gays you name it...he's offended them and LOST THEIR VOTE.  He only has the LOON VOTE.
Do what? How unAmerican! Spying on your neighbor for any government agency is moving closer and closer to that idea of Hitler's nazi regime paying or using the German people to narc and turn in their neighbors for supposedly deportation (it was Jews, any who disagreed, elderly, sick and unfavorables then) which ended up murdering millions to secure Hitler's and his annointed murderers determination for  power in Germany to try and rule over Europe. There were also those who snitched to get their neighbors property for free from Nazi's for spying for government.  The stinking nazi druggie killed himself before answering for his and his generals drug induced satan supported dreams of being GOD and controling the world. Satan abandoned him to die in disgrace when Allies came for him.
I think anti-racism is already being taught to death in our schools. The teachers will simply have to explain: there are hindu whack-jobs, christian whack-jobs, sikh whack-jobs, muslim whack-jobs, jewish whack-jobs..not so many Zoroastrian and Buddhist whack jobs, and some regular garden variety whack jobs.. Kids simply do unto others...
Your thought process is child like.  Its exactly the same thing.  The waiter doesn't want to be part of the sinning.  Your analogy makes no sense because the jewish  restaurant probably doesn't have pork the on the menu and serving it to everyone else.
Perhaps “anti semitic” should be included as well, it is likely Jews face as much discrimination as Muslims. Perhaps “Islamophobia” should just be left out of the bill which would then apply to all religions.
Gary:  If you were totally against racism, you would have a complaint about only black people being chosen to speak at the rally.   Were there not white people and others with similar stories?  Maybe Jews?
It's mostly Jewish people behind destroying America like Berstein. From the top of many news operations to the bottom. They are the enemy from within.
Lamont:  Your first sentence is meant to be facetious, right?  As for the rest, religion is an attempt to explain the world around us.  It resorts to the supernatural to do so.  Atheism rejects the supernatural, relying instead on natural laws and phenomena to explain the world.  It is not simply the rejection of gods or God.
You've forgotten Atheists, Sikhs,  Buddhists, Pastafarians, and the Lions Club. And what's a good conspiracy without the Masons and the Jesuits?
Babi Yar (Ukrainian: Бабин Яр, Babyn Yar; Russian: Бабий Яр, Babiy Yar) is a ravine in the Ukrainian capital Kiev and a site of massacres carried out by German forces and Ukrainian  collaborators during their campaign against the Soviet Union. The most notorious and the best documented of these massacres took place 29–30 September 1941, wherein 33,771 Jews were killed.  Victims of other massacres at the site included Soviet prisoners of war, communists,  nationalists and Roma.  It is estimated that between 100,000 and 150,000 people were killed at Babi Yar .
"proposing that muslim women could not wear religious garb as a lesser public forum.."  You are missing the point. Objecting to the niqab isn't because it is "religious garb", it is because it is the most extreme form of erasure of women from social space, something anyone who claims to care about the status of women in society should oppose.  Sikhism, BTW, is a very egalitarian religion, founded in reaction to  Islam's treatment of women, and Hinduism's caste system. It actually explicitly forbids the face veil as demeaning to women.
Not so sure about Antifa or civil war, but it is becoming apparent the guy was an atheist leftie.
Islamophobia and Antisemitism are not going away - for another 13 centuries.  Mohammed, with Christian help, defeats Big Business, Bankers; sets up a secular Socratic republic in Medina with rights for all, especially women. Anti-Christian Kaliphate just after him reverses all progressive gains - was anti-poor, anti-women, anti-peace, anti-trade.  Kaliphate, sitting smack on East-West Silk Road, lived on Tariffs (Arabic word of Kaliphate origin) for easy life of languid pleasure for few at the top. 100 famines in Europe straddling 1300 AD. Christians, malnourished, prone to plague, population fell to 40%.  Kaliphate fells Constantinople 1453, blocks routes altogether, starving over-populated Christians further. Desperate Christians find new routes and new lands, destroying 3 Empires - Spain, Ottoman, Mughal.  Jews were allies in Kaliphate's nefarious entreprise. Finally, Christians find a Silver Bullet - Israel to pit them against each other. No war in Europe since then. Lord is Just.
Yes, well recognized by the Israeli far-right and radical Zionists, recognized for his bias by everyone else. Calling the facts 'jihadi propaganda' only underlines the emptiness of your position.  Especially when the group who put together the primer reinforcing that Israel started the war, and most importantly, why, is Jewish ..  The 1967 War and the Israeli Occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Jews for Justice in the Middle East http://ifamericansknew.org/history/origin.html#1967
The 6 million number is a very old Zionist trick.  http://balder.org/judea/Six-Million-140-Occurrences-Of-The-Word-Holocaust-And-The-Number-6,000,000-Before-The-Nuremberg-Trials-Began.php Once I find someone lying about something I must ask myself what else they are lying about.  And I must ask myself why they are lying.  Which leads us to how Zionists justify their longstanding criminal behavior against the non-Jews of The Middle East.
No matter where YOU live on this planet EARTH  and regardless of the COUNTRY  YOU're going to make US* pay (siphoning/extort) for not helping YOU out of the mess of the Holocaust & aftermath PTSD (...and still on ?)  (PTSD is a mental illness/ often involves exposure to trauma from single events that involve death or the threat of death or serious injury).  And above all, WE (YOU) have banned the entry of all ships loaded to refuge Jews in our Western countries (the Boat People of 1940’s). It's hard to take, I admit... And still NOWADAYS WE pay HEAVY high prices but... how long are WE, Westerners, going to pay for your “PTSD” ? Till the end of time ?...And until the end of time comes how you would like to be called ?  “PTSD’s people”...“PTSD’s country” ?...or...Israeli ?...

"we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin, 10as it is written: ‘There is no one who is righteous, not even one'" -- Romans 3:9-10
Ex 3:6, Mt 22:32,1 King 18:36, Act 3:13 and 7:32. No one is disparaging Hagar and her son. It is simple truth: the Jewish and Christian God claims Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob followed their God. The other faith claims another path. They are vaguely similar stories, but with different actors, different outcomes.
Yet centering prayer is (or tries to be) a Catholic spirituality based, in part, on the Hindu spirituality.   Thank you for the discussion.  I appreciate the way we can have this talk without bile and verbal violence.
It seems real and potent sectarians lived in Québec and nowhere else in Canada. Well, maybe it was so: The private clubs of Montréal applied membership quotas until the late sixties to the Jews and the French-Canadians (ex: Montreal Athletic Club).
Some of the comments on this thread are blind to logic and international law.  There is no dispute as to whether Israel is illegally occupying Palestinian lands.  And these lands include East Jerusalem.  Canada the US and the UK, as well as the rest of the Western nations, all agree that Israel is illegally occupying Palestinian lands.  Educate yourselves.  Take a look at the International Court of Justice Opinion on this matter.  (An opinion of this sort is akin to a Supreme Court Reference.) Note that even the UK and the USA (Jewish) Judges on the panel agree with the substantive part of the Opinion. http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?pr=71&code=mwp&p1=3&p2=4&p3=6
Since 9/11 our politicians and media have been inundating us with religious issues related to Islam, Christianity and Judaism.   Religion, for the rich and powerful, is always about social, political and economic control of the masses.   In the 1980's, Christianity was so powerful it almost destroyed liberalism. The powers that be wanted to  destroy anything to do with the secular social revolution of the 1960's. They were so successful, the US and Canada have been pushed relentlessly and ruthlessly to the right wing. Democracy, incompatible with religion, has shrunk. Corporations have grabbed ever more power over governments. Now corporations and politicians want to distract folks from their economic woes with endless religious issues.   Our democracy has shrunk under corporate ownership. We are faced with the daunting task of separating corporation and state to save democracy from Consumerism. Now religion is undermining it.We need a strong movement for freedom from religion.
Saunders also needs to be taken to task for religion-baiting with this line: "public employees who were “Globalists and Islamists” (terms that, in Mr. Higgins’s ideological circles, generally refer to Jews and Muslims).  Yikes, how did that pass the G&M editorial sniff test. Doug Saunders clearly knows that the first 2 are economic and geo-politically driven ideologies and the second 2 are religions. Certainly most Globalists are not Jews and relatively few of a billion or so Muslims are Islamists. But for some reason he wants us to conflate the two. Why?
Saunders implies that for more than a century France has been multicultural with Jews and Muslims. Significant Muslim immigration only started in the 1960s.  Her argument that the Vichy round-up of Jews was not done by France is the same argument used by Mitterand to defend this. The argument is that the real France was represented by de Gaulle in London. Le Pen is only repeating the evasions of one of the biggest liars in French history.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LhMVdCmZiQ
The question arises: why are you changing the subject?  The NPR interview with David Kertzer (not "Kercher") concerns his Pulitzer Prize-winning book "The Pope and Mussolini," a carefully researched study that draws on previously unavailable material from the Vatican archives. I've read this book (you clearly haven't); it's very well written, scholarly, measured and illuminating. So anxious are you to discredit Kertzer that you appeal to an earlier volume concerned with Catholic anti-Semitism.  I skipped the Catholic League link (why bother), but read William D. Rubinstein's review at First Things of this earlier work, "The Popes Against the Jews." While highly complimentary of the caliber of Kertzer's work Rubinstein complains that a book devoted to Catholic anti-Semitism too closely scrutinizes...Catholic anti-Semitism. He also accuses Kertzer, un-persuasively, of distortion through "post-Holocaust eyes." But regardless, this book wasn't the subject of the broadcast.
It wasn't any shadowy international ghosts who have been trashing Jewish graveyards here.  And the white nationalist lingo identifies you as one of the tribal followers.
What does Colorado and Texas have to do with it?  He was a rabid atheist.  That's what drove him to shot up a church, specifically.
Id suggest doing some research, as most reformed Jews would refer to their Synagogue as "temple", I come from a more traditional background though not to the point I'd call it a Schul.....
Many Jewish Lawyers have become Judges(D). Posner would have done well in Rome with Pilate(D), and his enslaved Religious Fundamentalists who hung up Jesus(R) for his 1st Amendment Violations.  "A free people [claim] their rights, as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their chief magistrate." Thomas Jefferson(R)..."In questions of power, then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution."
I was not referring to WW2.  I was referring to what has been happening in those European countries in the past 3 decades.    And I reject strongly your comparison of the brave young men of the Western Alliance who fought heroic battles with the Nazis to overthrow a brutal dictator and stop the slaughter of millions of Jews to Islamic terrorists and haters of Liberal Western democracies.
If Trump didn't mention Jews in his Holocaust Remembrance Day statement because he's not into history and doesn't quite know what the Holocaust is, OK, no biggie, just Trump being Trump.  If Trump didn't mention Jews in his Holocaust Remembrance Day statement because he let Steven Bannon write it and Steven Bannon is a Holocaust denier, that is not a good thing.  But the first explanation seems much more probable.
“But you were perfectly fine with it when Obama held multiple closed door meetings with Black Lives Matter at the White House?” That’s quite an assumption out of nowhere. No! I wasn’t ‘perfectly fine with it’. I don’t know what was said in those meetings, do you?  Maybe Obama told ‘em that the radical factions/people in that group need to cool their jets.  I could see that.  I’m not ok with those cop killings or with cops killing people for no good reason & getting away with it. Not ok with some whackjob shooting Congressman. Not ok with the many instances of far right fringe whackos, KKK, neoNazis, etc bombing & burning Jewish synagogues, Mosques, & predominantly black churches. It has been documented that the great majority, pretty much all, of the homegrown terrorist acts have been committed by people that share the same views as those groups I mentioned.  Unless you get & believe all your “news” from some so called alt-right, conspiracy theory, web sites you know this.
Kindergarten Christians deny Noah did, but current research suggests that Moses, Jesus and the rest of the Hebrew clan, most likely did.  http://zzco.org/chris_bennett/christ.html
As well as atheists, agnostics and humanists.
The only thing malignant is the Jew Bernstein.  Before you start screaming anti-Semitic, better check my background or you will find yourselves in very impressive litigation for libel or slander.
Nope. Sermon of the Mount. He fulfilled the criteria for the Judaism covenant and began a new covenant, called Christianity.
Absolutely incorrect. What was removed was the exclusivity and promotion of Christianity as a state sponsored religion.   And any Christian or Jewish or other group can ask for accommodation for their religion as well. However it's unlikely that will be necessary since there's no school on Sunday is there?
A black man was killed by a black man in Africa and yet Rep. Frederica Wilson wants to make this an issue of "race". This isn't Rep. Frederica Wilson's first offense: she also ginned up the Trayvon Martin killing of a 17-year-old black boy by a Hispanic/Jewish man as "racially motivated" when clearly, it was not. This is the politics of division, not unity. A President voluntarily called to console family members. What they shared should not be made into a political controversy.
In response to "Dude was an atheist who hated Christians." you wandered off to talk about conservatives and Muslims and 'people of color'.  'Deflecting' the conversation.  "trying to steer the conversation in a different direction."
.....many of those killed were Jews  and the hotel received warning call to evacuate that was ignored. British have been encouraging Arab to attack Jews, causing hundreds if not thousands of Jewish lives....and since this was British headquarters, it was used as a retaliation point.
First issue: I am not sure about those "pure motives." but I do generally credit an author when he reports his own past experiences. Paul surely sought the approval of the Jerusalem community when he was negotiating his Gentile mission, since it did depart from Jewish practice and identity. Yet I don't see how anyone can get behind the text and read Peter's denial in broader terms. There are just too many silences to do more than a very skinny historical portrait, which leads me to trust the tradition of Jesus; teachings, death and resurrection, however one interpret resurrection. I am at base traditional, although I have many differences from the clerical teachings of all the churches. We can have deacons, priests, and bishops without installing a dichotomy within the church.
Anti-Christian hatred has no place in my Canada. Anti-Women hatred has no place in my Canada. Anti-Jewish hatred has no place in my Canada.  Islamic people, are you doing any accommodating?
Yet another example of failure to follow Poitier's Law: "ASSUME just makes an @$$ of U, not me."  I am a linear descendant of Stonewall Jackson (no big deal, a lot of folks of various colors were.  Stonewall got around).  My parents, both sets of grandparents and all but one of my great-grandparents were US born, as am I.  The single exception was a Sephardic Jewish immigrant from Syria.  My great-grandmother (a Jackson) wasn't allowed to marry him until he "converted" to Protestantism and weren't happy about it even then.  As for the Islamic Republic of Iran, you argue according to what TV tells you.  I argue from personal knowledge and experience.  Start with the fact Iran hasn't invaded another country in over two centuries.  Have I proved you wrong about enough that you're willing to start over and try to learn something, or will you opt for the "rationale" of "why expend effort learning with ignorance is instantaneous"?  Apologies to Bill Watterson.
Your post disrespects the very real South African victims of Apartheid. Apartheid means you can't go to university, you can't work, you certainly can't vote (let alone serve in government), you can't even use a water fountain. None of this is true for non-Jewish citizens in Israel. There are Israeli Arabs in the Knesset. Omar Barghouti, the founder of BDS, got his master's degree at Tel Aviv University. None of this would have been possible under true Apartheid. There is racism in Israel, most definitely. Please name one country where there isn't a minority that is discriminated against. There is much to legitimately criticize, but when you bandy about falsehoods you undermine your own position.
There is no reality in which that will happen. Withdrawal from Gaza was a hard lesson for Israel that no good deed goes unpunished. The Green Line is not a "boundary." It is an armistice line.  UNSCR 242  does not require Israeli withdrawal from territories that it now lawfully occupies. What part of those territories -- if any -- might become Arab is a matter of negotiations. The only relevant law is the Palestine Mandate a confirmed by UN Charter Article 80, leaving the default status of the territories sovereign Israeli land.  Managing Palestinians will be Israel's cross to bear (ha, ha) for some time to come but there is no alternative. Israel does that with compassion considering that the Arab goal is eradicating a Jewish presence from the region.
Racist Apartheid : Colonies for jews and for jews only. Trump's complaints about illegal immigrants are hilarious by comparison.
Well, you very cleverly elided the point for the moment.  But the point you missed is that the reality of Christ's Real Presence in the Eucharist exists independently of anyone's believing in it.  If any one those ten atheists consumed the host, his non-belief would not prevent him from consuming the body of Christ.  The atheist would not consume bread.  Bread is no longer there.
Not all atheists are adherents of science.   The two are separate.   Just because a lot of current scientists are atheists, it doesn't mean that one requires the other.  And, by the way, Einstein characterized himself as being essentially agnostic.   Not atheist.   He believed in a patheistic God in the vein of Spinoza.   He did not believe in a personal God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.
I love it when people compound their slurs..."many traditionalists are reactionaries".   It makes it easier for them to distance and separate themselves from others with diverse views, doesn't it?  Maybe "thinking" about morality shouldn't evolve.  Ever think about that?  Have you ever "opened up" yourself to that idea?  Or have you been "close-minded" about your endless 'evolution about morality'?   Jesus himself "corrected" the "evolution of thinking about ethical matters" when he corrected the Jewish understanding about divorce and marriage..."but was not so from the beginning...it was only because of the hardness of your hearts...."
You can cite thousands of studies; thousands of tests; thousands of pages of documentation debunking that belief and the avowed racist will dismiss them as "fake news" or part of a "liberal/Jewish race mongrelizing" conspiracy.   This is NOT a rational, reasoned debate.    I know two young men who truly believe the earth is flat.  I don't bother arguing with them....I just smile and shake my head.  That's fine,....they're harmless.  Racism is NOT harmless.  It is just as baseless that that "flat earth" theory, but, it engenders actions which greatly harm individuals and which destroy the very fabric of our nation.  Standing up to racism is crucial , and we all need to join in doing so.....and, importantly, we need to refuse to be intimidated by the violence and threat of violence the white supremacists proudly celebrate and parade.
Come on. First of all, I did give you a quote "from the priest himself." Second, the article I linked to, from Fr. Gruner's own outfit, is "based" on the writings of Fr. Denis Fahey, and whether or not it was a direct quote, it's presented as "brilliant" and worthy of emulation.  Fr. Fahey sought to distinguish between unacceptable antisemitism, Nazism, and acceptable Catholic antisemitism, "Jewish Naturalism," the "disorder of Jewish naturalistic opposition to Christ the King." A skunk by any other name.
Which evidently does not include you given your poor grammar. Please go move to North Korea. Religion (or at least Christianity) is outlawed. It's an atheistic state. I am sure you would be happy there.
Are you saying that accepting discrimination, humiliation, being treated as inferiors are all things that should not get in the way of our ultimate goal to live with God in heaven for Eternity? Women are not sheep who should accept the fate you believe this male dominated version of Christianity is the ultimate truth. If you listened to Pope Francis's speeches and kept up with the media reporting on extremists reaction to his liberal views, like that Fundamentalism is the evil that should be deleted from religion, you know that he received death threats for his public declarations. He does not cond emn women who have had abortions. He has been called an Anti-pope, a sinner for befriending the devilish Jews, for supporting inclusion of all religions and genders. He is afraid now of  stating his support for equality for women and not be able to continue ridding Christianity of its cruel , evil and controlling political Fundamentalism.
I love how critics of this policy suggest we have poor boarder control without offering concrete and humane alternatives.  We used to send back refugees like the boatload of Jews in the 1930's - that didn't turn out too well.  We are fortunate to have oceans separating us from conflict regions. As a result we have VERY few refugees making it here. The last large influx was the "boat people" in the 1980's and American draft dodgers in the '70's. Even then, it was not a lot.  I say if you can make it from the horn of Africa to Canada - you must be very motivated. Kick your shoes off, rest a while and stay.
Evidently "good people" chant "Jews will not replace us," and carry torches, Nazi flags, and confederate flags. His presser on Tuesday was an all-time low, even for him.
> THEY did not think of themselves as being anything but Jews. YOU forget that Jesus was born, raised and lived his life as a Jew also.  You are assuming too much both in what the apostles and I think. You have no evidence of either. You are trying to discern a state of mind by economic observation in the first case, and wishful thinking in the second.  > On the Cross, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."  How can one be an unrepentant sinner when they don't think what they are doing is a sin?  > Secondly, who is disregarding the Commandments?  Those who are entering a second marriage when they know they are not free to do so. Those who continue to commit adultery or when they are told their marriage is not valid.  > And who are you to assume...  Why would God give us the commandments if we were not allowed to evaluate our actions by them?  > Your message is not life-giving.  Allowing people to compound grave sin with more grave sin is what is not life-giving.
Well, to the Jews, the Samaritans were 'the pits', heretics, and worse than the detested Romans.  Jesus' listeners would have understood (and probably have been appalled by) the qualifier, 'Good',  because to them there was no such thing as a good Samaritan.   Tell you one thing: the word 'Good' here would have got the attention of Jesus' listeners pretty quickly (along with their ire). Jesus knew how to command (and usually tame) an audience.
sadly they are better off than their brethren in most Arab countries. The Israeli Arabs I have met  are doing pretty well.  Good education , jobs, healthcare etc. Many wouldn't leave Israel if they had the chance.   It is not indoctrinated in Jews to hate members of other religious backgrounds.  The true apartheid states are the Arab countries. Know any Christians from Syria Jordan or Egypt?? The are discriminated against and  live a life of segregation. They live in fear of being beat, raped, murdered. Go celebrate Christmas in Egypt and see what happens.  Arabs in the occupied territories and Israel proper are free to practice their religion without fear.
Very true. That is how the British and the French took over Buddhist ruled countries. With extreme violence.
By the 1970s, about 800,000 Jews, perhaps more, had been forcibly exiled from Arab countries, their property seized.  . According to the World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC), they lost property now valued at well over $100-billion.  . A modern hatred with a long pedigree  Robert Fulford, National Post · Saturday, Aug. 28, 2010
"Prior to the British Conquest of New France there were officially no Jews in Canada because when King Louis XIV made Canada officially a province of the Kingdom of France in 1663, he decreed that only Roman Catholics could enter the colony. One exception was Esther Brandeau, a Jewish girl who arrived in 1738 disguised as a boy and remained for a year before being sent back to France after refusing to convert.[9] ] The earliest subsequent documentation of Jews in Canada are British Army records from the French and Indian War, the North American part of the Seven Years' War. " .............  "The law requiring the oath "on my faith as a Christian" was amended in 1829 to provide for Jews to not take the oath. In 1831, prominent French-Canadian politician Louis-Joseph Papineau sponsored a law which granted full equivalent political rights to Jews, twenty-seven years before anywhere else in the British Empire."   Wikipedia
Many of us compromise our styles when going to work.  Because the boss wants it that way.  Or society wants it that way.  So is it such a high price to pay to leave the face covering at home to enable oneself to work in public service in a new home land?  As we know, islam as a religion does not dictate the use of face coverings.  So it's a cultural style of dressing.   The vast majority of Canadians do not want faces covered in our public life so get with it.  When in Rome do as the Romans.  What exactly is the attraction of wearing face coverings?  I think a lot of us would like to know the real truth.
I suspect part of what may be it at play here is an understandable confusion over the mixed messages we receive over religion.    For the past 20 years or so Christianity, or at least overt or public Christianity, has been strongly discouraged as civic Canada has further and further refined its secular governance.  I don't think it was Christianity per se which was the target in as much as it was the idea that religious beliefs should not be a factor in public policy - and that's fine.    Islam comparatively young religion is therefore still very fundamental in its practice and, at a time where we have accepted a post-Christian state,  it seems to have become a badge for progressive accommodation of the 'other' and people are no doubt confused  as to why must be discouraged and the other encouraged.
As usual, one person has become a newspaper's sacrificial lamb, asked to justify his existence and epistemology on or near Dec 25. As these things go, this none was not too bad.  But also as usual, the effort at dialogue and understanding has been dragged down a slippery slope by some people trying to parse the definitions of and prove the superiority of atheism and agnosticism, relatively speaking. How sad. Me? I am the Pope of the Atheists, sworn to strive against make-believe and to champion respect amongst all people. Happy merry to you all.
In some aspects you are right, but you should actually brush up your history of communism. A lot of people know that the Rotschilds were "also" Brits.  You are also right about the difference between about anti-semitism and anti-zionism.  Yet initially as I said before, a lot of people sympathized  with the new Jewish state of Israel, precisely because it offered a solution to anti-semitism and its dire consequences. There is a lot you don't know about why certain things have occurred and why. It is true that it is unfair to discriminate against Jews just because  Israel's policies, but there is a lot in the background that people who only read about the "official versions" in the "not-so-biased" media.
Sparrow can file a complaint regarding his/her mistreatment directly with the church and the pastor can't they?  So what if a candidate for any position belongs to Imagio Dei or a Jewish Synagogue, is Atheist, Buddist, etc.  There are expressed laws in City Government, State Government, and Federal Government which prevent the people in those elected and non-elected public service jobs from engaging in religious, racial, or other forms of descrimination while performing their duties.
OK folks, it's high time we put our emotions on hold and look into facts. Just facts. No name calling, no presumption, no phobias.  The fact is until there is a fatwa placed on taqiyya, honor killing, killing homosexuals, etc., there is a stark polarity between Islam and freedom.   I'm not saying any individual had anything to do with the issues I bring up. I'm not calling out the man and his wife as perpetrators of Jihad. I just don't know them. Neither do most of the commenters in this thread.  Christians and Jews have at least let go of their murderous teachings. When there's a crazy fool, they are called out and ostrocized. I do know Islam is behind the terror that grips the world. Of course i know that muslims are most likely to be the targets of Muslim terrorists, but that's not a point of security. Rather the opposite.   It is up to the imams to lead their 1.6 billion followers to a path of world peace.  I suggest you read the Qur'an, see what it is that concerns us.
THatcher... The world through the UN agreed in 1947 that the Jewish people had the right to political self determination through a sovereign state...that the Jewish people have the right to govern themselves....at the same time India was partitioned to grant the same thing to Muslims in Pakistan....the hypocrisy is in the rejection of one partition by the people who advocated for and accept the second.  You may be right that in the future, states based on a common culture or religion will be anachronistic....but the entire Middle East is comprised of such states....and you want the tiniest one to go first and give up the protection of sovereignty....you might want to see how well the Ahmadi are treated in Pakistan, or the Kurds in Turkey, or the Yazidis in Iraq....etc...etc...etc...
> They did not think of themselves as different  How can you say this when even their shadow cured people? They were different. They were part of the body of Christ and they had a mission. Just because the first phase of their mission was to convert Jerusalem didn't mean that they were only concerned with the Jews.  > And Jesus did not always go after  Show me an instance in the Gospel where Jesus forgave the unrepentant sinner.  > God did not wait for us to come repentant first.   The Church doesn't wait either. You are still a member of the Church and you can still run into her arms for support and guidance. However, if you have flagrant disregard for the commandments of the Lord, do not expect to be held up by grace. If one is not receptive to grace, then how can they receive it?  > You changed your name here  I find it interesting that you think that I am someone else. This is the only name I have gone by here. Maybe there are so many of us with the same message because it is true.
There were no Jews among Hitler's  Brown Shirts.   Anybody who was even part Jewish was put in a concentration camp.
In fact, I disagree with the proposed banning of religious garb (except for the niqab) for the same reason I object to the anti-Islamophobia motion. Because to repress large numbers of people is counterproductive and only helps produce an oppositional culture that is even worse.  The politicians and pundits on both sides are taking the problem from the wrong end. Everyone is more concerned with EXPRESSING THEIR FEELINGS of disapproval of people with values they disagree with, than thinking rationally and critically about what the consequences are.  Whether it is the young religious person who feels they don't belong in this society because they are religious, or the atheist young person who is horrified at seeing religion start to become the core of people's identity again, or the one who is scared of terrorism, etc., making a big show of disowning them publicly instead of finding ways of reassuring them, just risks sending them into the arms of violent radicalism.
well there gose one of the places the homeless jew sleeps at ......maby some nise person can give the homeless jew $24,000 ....so that he can buy a house.
As Greta Christina, an atheist blogger points out: “I think the god hypothesis is implausible at best, incoherent at worst. But of all the implausible, incoherent gods I've seen hypothesised, the one who punishes honest atheists who take the question of his existence seriously enough to reject it when they don't see it supported, and at the same time rewards insincere, bet-hedging religionists who profess belief as part of a self-centred attempt to hit the jackpot at the end of their life... that is easily among the battiest.”  Or to put it another way, Pascal's Wager isn't an argument. It's an admission that you've got nothing!
Bobby:  I presume your "noting" Ms Kravitz's last name implies she's Jewish and, therefore, her comments are biased.  Denouncing the hatred of Neo-Nazis reflects decency, not bias, and it's hardly limited to Jews.  I would hope every decent person reading this thread would join Ms Kravitz in denouncing the bigotry and hatred Neo-Nazism represents.  Gary Crum
Nope, it's what a lot of your fellow Christians believe. If they can't tolerate a Muslim mosque, they certainly wouldn't tolerate vouchers going to a Buddhist or Muslim or atheist or Satanist school. Quit acting like your fellow conservative Christians are so pure and noble-minded. You see the world through dualistic lenses: Your side good, everyone else bad.
And a lot of that was done with immigrants.  After all, it was German Jewish immigrants who helped build the atom bomb. If they had stayed in Germany, WW2 might have ended differently!
Nice rationalization for the genocidal treatment of Syrians by Assad and his forces who are   responsible for the use of chemical weapons against his own people. Not a Jew among them.
Rob,  I briefly answered your questions to you personally as they were already answered in detail throughout the thread.  It is really this simple though: you can't confirm or deny the existence of God/gods, so when you deny their existence as an atheist, you can do so only through your belief that God/gods doesn't/don't exist.  When you claim something as true that cannot be supported with facts that prove the claim, you're stating a belief, not a fact.  To really break it down for you, it is exactly the same thing to say: 1) I don't believe God/gods exist and/ 2) I believe God/gods doesn't don't exist.  Really amazing how complicated this is for these infinitely wise atheists lol.   Their, a full response to your question posted directly to you. However, I've checked the whole thread, and you've proved incapable of answering a single question posed to you by me. But surely, if atheists hold the infallible position, surely you can defend atheism against simplistic Christian challenges
Wishful thinking. Those who use examples such as slavery, usury and democracy have not understood what the Church's teaching in the past has been. The main complaint was that neither the Church nor Christ Himself ever condemned slavery. The Law of Moses permitted charging non-Jews interest on loans which means that usury was never considered to be absolutely sinful. As for democracy, the Church does not canonise any particular form of government. Pope St John Paul defined democracy as a means to an end. As far as I can see democracy as practised in countries who claim to be democratic no where meets the late Pope's definition.  The fact that most people ignore Humanæ Vitæ does not mean that artificial birth control is no longer mortally sinful.
So the basis of your argument is that might makes right and a ghost told them it was theirs.  It is also nice to hear from someone who can speak for the entire Jewish religion in such clear unambiguous terms, because I had heard rumors that there are entire groups of Jewish people that do not support the settlements. Yizhak Rabin was even assassinated by a religious nut for opposing the settlements.  So please save the children's stories for children.
Certainly understandable that you are angry that your nephew has been murdered, it is unlikely that people posting here on a newspaper comment board are the appropriate outlet for your grief.  Atheists grieve and share their thoughts as well.  Having an opinion that is different than your own, ON AN COMMENT PAGE, is not discrediting your beliefs - this is the ADN.com page, not the Don Ruiz page.
The jewish community weren't forced to give up their homelands and forced to live on sparse reservation lands.  When are you going to give up whining about Indian issues, Tourney?  One that lives in a glass house shouldn't throw stones.  From what I recall, a jewish community has built a Holocaust Museum in NY.  No one will ever forget what happened to the Jews that were slaughtered, like the American Indians, in Germany.
The first settlement on the West Bank after the Six Day War was Kfar Etzion.  The land was bought by Jews in 1927.  In 1929, Palestinians destroyed the settlement.  In the 1930, Jews rebuilt the settlement, but again it was destroyed by Palestinians.  It was rebuilt in 1943, but destroyed again in 1948.  157 Jews were murdered.  4 Jews survived.  It was rebuilt by the survivors in 1967.  Why should Kfar Etzion be dismantled?
No, it is not implicit in their question. Were it, you'd quote it. Both are completely Catholic.  I do not know if you even have a son. I took it on your word, and took your description of him respecting the Church's discipline as factual.  If he did not respect the law, he would attend a Catholic parish and present himself for communion without regard to his state.  If you tell me otherwise, I have to accept it on its face since you're the only source.  Unless he was in fear for his life, it would not be like saying that Jews who left Germany in the 1930s "respected" the Nuremberg Laws.
Surely the author is a crypto-Christian. He is utterly deceptive in saying that Dawkins or Harris have said nothing good about the attributed sayings of Jesus. A cursory search on YouTube shows Harris praising the Beatitudes and Dawkins acknowledging himself a secular Anglican. The author is a misinformed atheist at best. Atheism is not a belief system (and of course not a religion); it is simply a philosophical position finding proposed evidence for gods and a supernatural world insufficient. As for Christianity, the idea behind redemption— that God sacrificed himself to himself to appease himself and thereby save humanity from himself—is unworthy of anyone with more than a high school education.
The Semites are a linguistic group that includes several races living in the ME and North Africa, that have many belief systems including Judaism and Islam.  Islam is a belief system held by many in the ME, South Asia and South Eastern Asia.
You may be the only person who considers the Roman Empire to be middle-eastern.  Greco-Roman civilization laid the foundation for European civilization and culture.  Ethnically, the Greeks and Romans are Europeans.  The fact that some of their cities are now considered to be in the middle east is beside the point.  The Roman Republic and Empire ruled from Europe.  Under European dominance those cities thrived; now they are basket cases.  China tends to be over-rated as an empire; the Indians were just a bunch of balkanized savages.  They owe so much to the Brits for bringing them civilization.  And the Brits were originally civilized by the Romans.  Alexander showed Egypt and India who is superior!  BTW, I see plenty of Chinese, Indians, and ppl from the middle-east striving to learn Beethoven, Ravel, and Verdi.  I don't see too many people in China wanting to learn Hindu music.  That really speaks to the supremacy of European culture.  The Hindus don't even have harmony.
As an agnostic, I find the entire Old and New Testament, the apocrypha, the commentaries, the Catholic catechisms, and every bit of relevant theology and doctrine by all 'Christian' sects to be 'fake news'.
Trying to judge the past through the eyes of the present is a mugs game.The world is a lot different now then it was 100 years ago,people had very little contact with other cultures and races.Here in Canada we treated Chinese,Japanese,Jews and yes,blacks like second class citizens,many of our politicians would be considered racist by todays standards,including John A. McDonald.From what I've read Robert E.Lee was an honourable man.Times were different!!!
Complementarity is still abstract concept. Let's remember that the issue here is not about sexuality. It is about marriage rights. Gays have them. Merlino is suffering from a bad case of sour grapes and is venting. Interestingly, none of his thoughts were directive, only suggestive, but I assume people will be watching and reporting back to him. To not acknowledge a spouse, however much you disagree with their gender, at a funeral is beyond tacky, as is worrying about whether the spouse and the celebrant are mentioned on the prayer card. Merlino's indignation is not enough to reverse the trend, which will ultimately include priests blessing gay marriages privately and families demanding formal recognition of such unions at a Wedding Mass. Rear guard actions involving inocmplete natural law arguments or scriptures meant to differentiate Jewish exiles from their Babylonian captors will not stop this. God will not rescue the Church from this nor female ordination.
Ariel,  While their is no canonical text of atheism per se, one can tease out a generalized system  and form of worship surrounding the tenets of science and its methodological practices.  Of course, this is ironic, given that this should lead to agnosticism, which is really my point.
As an agnostic, those concepts do not define existence as part of this society for me.   The science of zygotes and their becoming 'human beings' however any society defines a 'human being',  is independent of that particular belief system for me.   There are and have been millions of people who view their existence through that set of prisms.  There are and have been millions more who view their existence differently.  Those with faith in a deity or even in the particular one described in the Bible may be right; those without that faith or any other faith may also be right.  That is why I am an agnostic and not an atheist.  The existence or non-existence of a deity is a matter of unprovable belief for me.  Faith, religion and theology are interesting concepts; they don't define my perceptions of reality.
Acknowledging the fact that the Anglicans are a genuine Church would not be lying, it would be "developing" doctrine.
Just like the leftist jew wrote lots of anti semetic remarks all over a synagogue before trying to burn it down... He was trying to incite violence against another group  But he wasn't charged with a hate crime even though to properly enforce due process of law he should have been.
Judaeo-Christian tradition is as much an academic tradition as a spiritual one, perhaps more so. All such traditions should be open to objective intellectual scrutiny and reasoned counter-argument, whether by social (or any other)  science.   Unfortunately,  with the ministerial Catholic Church, there is a complicating factor: obduracy. Its provenance is the wildly expanded notion (unofficial, of course) that papal infallibility has a much-wider remit than than the actual dogma allows for.  The common ground for debate here is really academe, not the customary self-regard: 'Roma locuta, causa finita est.'  It is not that both camps talk past one another, but simply that Rome refuses to talk.
Repressing the majority culture is not a healthy way to promote multicuturalism, it is counterproductive.  I would suggest encouraging everyone to celebrate everyone else's fun holidays if invited to do so, instead. I've joined in celebrating Eid here and Holi in India, visited Mosques and Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist and Shinto temples and joined in the appropriate rituals. It did not turn me into a Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist or Shintoist.  As long as no one asks me to fast or self-flagellate or recite proclamations of faith, I'll be glad to join in any celebrations from other cultures. That to me is true celebration of our cultural diversity.  Let the grouches and bigots stay in their own little closed worlds if they wish, but do not let them silence the rest of us.
How are settlements a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention?  Why didn't the UN state that East Jerusalem is occupied territory when Jordan occupied East Jerusalem?  According to UN Resolution 181 (partition), after 10 years, there was to be a referendum in Jerusalem.  Because the majority were Jews, Jerusalem would have become part of Israel. Therefore, it makes no sense to consider any part of Jerusalem as occupied territory.
NORTH KOREA - secular, atheist, communist
In the aftermath of the Holocaust, anti-semitism was temporarily driven underground by the magnitude of the Nazi's crimes. By the early 70s, this temporary lull began to wear off with the beginnings of the anti-Israel movement. The Jew haters of this world could feign innocence to that charge while hiding behind their vehement criticism of the Jewish nation.   Fast forward another generation or two and one increasingly sees that the primary stigma of the war, against anti-semitism itself, is now wearing off too. I don't really believe that there has been a rise in overall Jew hatred. We're just seeing it more clearly now.
The Supreme Court in Nazi Germany ruled that Jews were not entitled to law, the US Supremes ruled African Americans were not entitled to law.  What's your point?  That courts are the fount of truth and justice? Grow up.
Less than one in five immigrants are interviewed by an immigration official prior to being accepted to Canada.  Leitch wants all immigrants to be interviewed.  Today I discovered there are at least 2 Imams that have been preaching in Mosques that Jews should be killed. One in Toronto, and one in Montreal. Both had videos on youtube. One has been removed after the Imam was outed.  Both of these Imams were from the middle east.  It seems the current vetting process isn't working.
One's religious convictions and expressions of same ARE protected by the 1st amendment and no law can alter that(with the caveat that no one has the right to take a life over it. All our rights are derived from the right to life-James Madison) Your non argument is misleading and irrelevant.  Read Chief Justices' Commentaries on the Constitution. The 1st amendment was not to prostrate Christianity (98% of the country at the Founding was Christian) to atheism, Catholicism, Mohammedism, or Armenianism but to prevent strife among Christian denominations and persecution of same by government endorsement of any particular denomination.
well thay could of given 1 acer to the homeless jew but ....thay did not.....maby thay could give the homeless jew $24,000 so that he can by a house some place.....on the east coast where thay like jews.
"One wonders" is the opening of a rhetorical puff which does not portend well for what follows. In point of fact, there has been francophone Jewish presence in Montreal, especially from North Africa, for at least a century. There has also been the thorny National and other ethnic questions, which will divide any Jewish community. Although Quebec anti-Semitism is diminishing, Peladeau's nationalist think-tank is still named for a notorious anti-Semite, Abbé Groulx, and scads of  ultra-Gaulish and extremist movements are active. Multitudes of people are still willing to support Marois' odious Charter of Exclusion, and her ex-Minister of Secularism still promotes it on his shock-radio network. That would kick professors with kippas out of schools, along with their hijabbed and turbaned colleagues. "Secularism" is now a polite word for "looks French." All ethnic nationalism will divide the Montreal Jews to the horror of any Jewish Parisian.
Saudi Arabia is going to execute a man for being an atheist.  We don't need more 'Muslim values' like these here in Canada.
If a genuine question Mike, let me assure you, here in Australia it would be assumed there would be a particular reason such a request was made. The Jewish community I'm closely knitted too would certainly make adequate provision for a  dying wish to be granted, more than I could say for us.
They don't have grudges against Buddhists today, but 70 years ago there was no problem herding them into concentration camps in Canada and the USA. Or a hundred years ago they weren't allowed to bring their wives in. Or forty years ago there was no problem dropping more bombs on them than on the Nazis.  The target group always changes. It was the Africans, Irish, Italians, Jews, Chinese, Indians, etc in the past. Today it is the Muslims.
A problem I often fall into myself is making it seem that all pharisees were the same. Some seemed to be good friends of Jesus. They invited him to dinners. And doesn't even Paul brag of being trained as a Pharisee?  True, the Gospel accounts set us up for that, the way John's Gospel use of the term 'Jew" sets us up for anti-semitism.
Sydney, in prisons are only the offenders who got caught and not the ones that are still roaming the internet, streets and society, so that is a flawed statement as well as research in itself.   Your quote: "Rather, being better off financially and better educated both makes you less likely to commit crimes and less likely to be religious" Also Flawed.  First off, I think the majority of Jews will totally disagree with you - they are among the world's best educated and smartest people and (most of them) take their religion seriously. The rest of us - I know just in my small circle several architects, lawyers, engineers etc etc who are totally religious(Christian) and I know of an equal amount of highly educated people who are total crooks -they are just smarter about it and do it in such a way that it is difficult to get caught, but they are as criminally minded as any other uneducated, poor, criminal.
One hundred years ago Jews made up nearly 15% of the population in greater Palestine (Israel West bank and Gaza, and Jordan). and even higher percentage in the area that is modern Israel today.   Israel has agreed to to return and returned to legal borders with Egypt at Camp David after a peace agreement was signed, and to it's borders with Gaza more recently. It has also gave PA at least 7 peace offers ( 3 in just last 20 years) all of which PA rejected, choosing war after war instead. It seems clear that the only agreement Arabs (calling themselves Palestinian) are willing to accept is the one that has no Israel at all on the map.  Let's keep in mind that it was Abbas who walked away from latest Obama brokered peace negotiations, not Israel. This despite the fact that Israel meet all the preconditions for negotiations that Abbas demanded, without asking for anything in return.
the moslems invaded israel and built their sign of conquer on what they believed to be the temple mount. that land of israel was given to abraham, isaac, and jacob. the book is not a trilogy- the Lamb of God is the beginning and the end. you call the God of the Jews and Christians 'ha-satan'? yet you claim to be  the final chapter? so interesting.
There can be NO debate on settled Catholic teachings.  What Martin advocates -- the normalization of homosexual relationships -- is an impossibility.  You may as well ask that atheism be considered compatible with Catholicism.  It would be better for all if some of you NCR apostatees simply left the Catholic Church and worked your sinister nonsense in some left-wing Protestant Church that has a life expectancy past 5 years (there might be a few left).  The Catholic Church is not endorsing the moral squalor of San Francisco or the Upper West Side of Manhtatan, so fuhgeddaboutit.  I want to thank those of you who contributed money and time to the CatholicsForTrump campaign last Summer.  We registered over 200,000 mostly-white Catholics in swing states and DEFINITELY impacted Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.  I hope some of you saw the piece on us on OAN News. We are a growing force in American politics and bigger and better things are ahead for us in 2018 and 2020.
I don't know why you would ever think the OT Judaic laws are YOURS to break. You want to be Jewish? Probably more inclined to the 2 Peter 3 explanation to your response...
Bravo! People can be so ignorant.  I knew Sikhs believe in a single god. Thank you for the other information. No, Sikhs are not Abrahamic, but they are monotheistic, and as far as I'm concerned, and if I may apply a little logic: If A = E, and B = E, and C = E, and D = E, then A = B = C = D. That is, if Sikhs, Jews, Muslims, and Christians all believe in a single god who created the Universe and may share other attributes, then, regardless of the name people of those various faiths call that god and regardless of difference between them, it must be the same god. By definition, there can only be ONE "one universal god".  "Sikhs dislike the very IDEA of eternal damnation" Good for them. I find the idea horrid and repulsive. It's against any concept of a just or merciful god, but it gives the people who believe that idea (who always seem to think they will never end up in that status) license to be condescending and worse towards people they don't like.  Again, thank you for your comment
When dissidents, Protestants and atheists start praising the pope, it is time for orthodox Catholics to start worrying.
is brazeau a mormon?
Maybe you can explain to the class what "Jewish Naturalism" is.
You're absolutely right.  The Jews should have settled in their ancestral home of Judea.
Years ago our Government kicked God and Jesus out of our schools and banned the Lord's prayer and any other mention of his Holy name or any other religious worship.  The Atheists thought this was the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Violence increased, school shootings all over North America and people cried to God. """" DO SOMETHING.  WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING?????""""" God replied.. "Well you kicked me out of your child's school and told me I was not welcome so I honoured your request.  I was not there when this happened."""  Now we open the doors again for religion in our schools, provide prayer rooms,  as long as it is not Christian or Jewish or any other denomination other than Islam.  Something wrong here.
Can't read the bible.. Atheists want it banned because of all the sex and violence that's printed in there. Can't write music or poetry either because it offends people who hate creative people. Can't buy insulin or breathing meds because it offends people who believe that asthma and diabetes is caused by poor life choices. Can't have insurance companies cover birth control because it offends women haters. Can't have a pension because it offends old people haters. Can't have chocolate chip cookies and cheeseburgers because they offend fat people haters. Bye Bye American freedom.
There is factual evidence that authoritarian rule will outlaw guns in their favor.  For example, Nazi Germany outlawed ownership of weapons for Jews:  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/26/ben-carson/fact-checking-ben-carson-nazi-guns/  N. Korea enacted strict gun laws...one can imagine why:  https://www.quora.com/What-are-gun-control-laws-like-in-North-Korea  The question is when a government tries to restrict guns, who are they affecting?  Is it intentional...to disarm those considered against whichever party that's in power?  I can see the far right gun nuts having somewhat of a point that tightening laws only hurts law-abiding citizens.  Armed citizens are definitely a threat to a government.  It's a huge reason why Iraq's government can't take control.  The other question is which portion of the armed populace has the power to stifle which type of government?  God knows what would happen in American fractured culture.
A school is a place of learning, not religious practice.  Secularism means respecting everyone and allowing all to practice their beliefs in a respectfully private way. It does not mean that public schools should allow overt expression of religious practices by Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs or anyone else. Let kids explore Newtonian Physics, Ramanajun's Math and Plato's philosophy.  If religion could have done anything for anyone, there would be no plague, no poverty in 75% of the world, women and kids would be free from bondage everywhere, and the world would be full of Love and Respect ( supposedly the calling creed of every religion).  But clearly, the world is full of prejudice, injustice, hate, dogma, etc. Therefore, let schools be the place where the next generation discusses constructive ideas, and it should not become a battle ground for what religious preaches but never practices.  Defend character, promote justice, embrace ideas. Everything else is BS anyway.
The Church recognizes that the Magi of the East followed the Star to find the Child Jesus.  They were not Jews, but followers of another religion.  During the time that the Jews were under the Persian rule, Cyrus, permitted the Jews to return to their homeland and to enjoy limited political autonomy and complete religious liberty.  There is goodness in non-Christian religions and value that they give to the world and to us as Christians as well.  In the Vatican II's "the Declaration on the Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian Religions" [Nostra Aetate], states: For we believe and teach that all men and women form one human family, have a common origin in God and share a common destiny in divine providence.    Stating that these religions are "false" is forgetting that their wisdom guided people before both Judaism and Christianity existed.  They still have much to offer.  And they still are the religions of millions of people today.
Arabs did give us the number system and elements of math but nothing recently. Arabs and Jews are related both same family semitic. Jews dont eat pork same goes for Muslims. Jews read from right to left (Hebrew) same as Arabs. Jews and Muslim allies for at least 500 years against Christians. Just in the last 90 years they had conflict.
Of course, let us remark yet again it is not a ban on Muslims...nor a permanent ban on anyone.....  I understand the need to spin and twist things.  But can you - or anyone - tell me why we have not seen here (or anywhere, for that matter) any outrage concerning the 17 countries that have permanently banned Israeli Jews from entering their countries?  Not one word from anyone here.  By the way - included on that list of 17 countries are the countries now facing travel restictions to the US.....
I'm glad you did, and that's actually and surprisingly close: Hitler and his leaders used the American Democrat model for slavery and racial oppression at that time as a model on how to persecute the Jews and rationalize their use of lebensraum. Fast forward over half a century, and the racial identity politics played by Leftist Fascists and Congressional Democrats helped propel Trump and America to the win.
The correct thing to do,  its rare for the democrats to have principles ,  but this time they are right.   There is no way the zionists should be allowed to annex occupied land.  I know the jews love perpetual war but enough is enough.
5:75 The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a Messenger before whom other Messengers had gone; and his mother was a godly woman. They both ate [earthly] food. Look how We make clear Our Revelations to them; then look how they are perverted!  9:30 The Jews say: “Ezra is the son of Allah”, and the Christians say: “The Messiah is the son of Allah.” That is their statement, by their mouths; they emulate the statement of the unbelievers of yore. May Allah damn them; how they are perverted!  Allah's antipathy towards those He considers perverts for saying Jesus is His Son and the West's careless unquestioning acceptance of those who agree means that we all must now be vigilant so as to avoid a time of joy becoming a time of sorrow.  http://boreal.ca/Sharia/4Questions.htm
Kushner is an Orthodox Jew and Trump's daughter converted so we know he leans strongly in favour of Israel. They have approved of his Mexican wall, because if he gets away with it they will build one to keep Palestinians out of Israel.
It's only in the Fourth Gospel, the latest of the canonical gospels, that Jesus says, "My kingdom is not of this world." By that time the generation who was to witness the Parousia had passed.  In the Synoptics, Pilate asks Jesus whether he is King of the Jews. Jesus, of course, says, "It is you who say it." This king was to be an earthly king. Jesus was executed for a crime against the state.
How wrong art thou?  Let me count the ways:  (1) As stated in the first post, I addressed fallacies in FOUR of your posts.  Do try to pay attention. (2) Only my Mom gets to call me "Freddy".  She doesn't.  And "Freddie" is the female diminutive.  I am male.  I haven't disrespected you in this conversation, so don't disrespect me. (3) If in fact it's about the FAITH and not ethnic origins (on this we agree), then only those WHO WORSHIP the GOD of ABRAHAM (alayhis-Salaam) HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE THERE.  That includes the DESCENDANTS of Abraham through his eldest son (alayhimus-Salaam) who TO THIS DAY worship Abraham's GOD.  It DOESN'T include 70% of the Israelis who are self-proclaimed ATHEISTS.  Like I said, by trying to argue from both positions, you LOST both positions.  "And they say, 'Be ye Jews or Christians, then shall ye be rightly guided; Say (O' Muhammad), nay--but rather the Faith of Abraham, upright, true, and he was not among the idolaters."  (Qur'an: Surah Baqara 135).
At one time I felt the same way as you but then realized that even if you removed all the settlements the Palestinians would still not accept Israel's right to exist.   Even if there was a Palestinian State with Jerusalem as their capital they still would not accept Israel as the homeland for the Jewish people.  Sadly the real obstacle for peace and that which has brought on the settlement movement in the first place is the fact that the Palestinians simply do not and never will accept Israel or the Jewish peoples right to a homeland in that part of the world.  When their mind set changes (which I doubt it will) then perhaps there will be a chance for peace.
Yes, John, the principle of embarrassment is central to many of the historical-critical arguments, but it too has its assumptions. For example, it's possible that Mark (and thus the Synoptics) invented the Jesus-John "competition" as a struggle for spiritual authority, when the issue was temporal authority, i.e., who was the real Messiah (a point Meier et. al. discuss) and especially (in my mind) what kind of Messiah would each man be. The assumption of the tradition is that both men intended to be spiritual Messiahs in spite of the Jewish expectation of a political one, but I don't find that convincing. Both were executed by men known to do away with their competitors, not with rabbis or their equivalents and, if we can believe Josephus, Herod may have done so because he feared John would lead a rebellion. I'm still attracted by the thesis that Jesus and John were primarily involved in a secular struggle, although I'm still working my way through the implications of that thesis.
This is not Canada ...with a bunch of « Loyalists » Orangemen.   There is no place for a bunch of Ku-Ku-Klowns in Canada. In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century an English  three Canadians was a member of the white supremacist organization Anglo-Saxon,  WASP equivalent to the United States ("White Anglo-Saxon Protestants").  Four members have been Prime Ministers of Canada,  Sir John A. Macdonald (father of « Canadian Federation » of 1867 but not « Father of Canada » which is Sir Samuel de Champlain in 1608 ),  Sir John Abbott,  Sir Mackenzie Bowell (a past « Grand Master » (?)),  and John Diefenbaker.   In 1927 the “Orange” movement gave birth to a more intolerant and racist group, the Canadian Ku Klux Klan, which had its deepest roots in small towns in Saskatchewan because of the "yellow peril", but also because of the blacks...Jews...Catholics...
Uller....FYI, there are 2 Jewish centers in Anchorage....the one that was threatened yesterday is the more Conservative one.  It is very likely that many of the people at this Center voted for Pres. Trump because of his pro- Israel stance and his partly, Conservative Jewish family.  If there was a fake "in building" phone call to drum up anti-white, anti-Trump sentiments it probably would have been at the other, more liberal, Jewish Center where the congregants most likely caucused for Bernie Sanders and then voted for Hillary.  Of course in your conspiracy world, there is a good chance the phone call to the Conservative Jewish center came from the liberal Jewish Center.  We all know how crafty those Jews are.
I was at a concert last night at the Air Canada center. There was an Arab and Jewish group protesting for and against Israel outside the arena. Had the small army of police not been there to  keep them apart I don't know what might have happened. But hey "diversity is strength"!
I know many atheists who love their neighbors. Loving God in addition to your neighbor makes that a permanent, even eternal habit. Ghandi and Einstein, smart as they were, would have been the first to admit they didn't know everything. The good lives and testimony of many Christians is worth considering. Find some you trust and talk to them. You might hear some things you cannot dismiss as "fairy tales," a derisive comment not worthy of one who truly loves his/her neighbor.
Is it true that the Catholic church has always been immigrant-friendly?  It's not true.    Spain expelled its Jews in the 1400s, and discriminated against protestants and other religions during the Franco years.   Then there were the Crusades.   And slavery.     In brief, history shows us that the Church was a reluctant opponent of slavery; protestant abolitionists were the vanguard of the anti slavery movement, while the Church stood on the sidelines during the Civil War.     The Church has only been pro-immigrant when it suited is aims.   During the 1800s, the Church was all for the immigration of European Catholics to America.   The reason why is the same reason for why the Church today is pro immigration from Latino countries.   In a word, power.     Large scale immigration in the 1800s led to Catholicism going from a very marginal and hated religion, to the U.S.'s largest and most powerful religion.     The bishops know the awesome political power of immigration.
Cherry-picking the definition of "oath" to fit your own false assertion.  Attaching Judeo-Christian to any action somehow defines it as a "principle".  The Supreme Court opening has no relevancy to the Constitution, just as "under god" in the Pledge of Allegiance wasn't even in it until the 1950's Republican/McCarthy CONgress interjected it and is actually a violation of the Constitution whenever the "Pledge" is required recitation in government or schools.  All of this injection of "god" into any governing component is a violation of the Constitution's basic human rights principles.  It is accomplished by elected traitors and the voters who blindly follow anyone with religious name attachment despite most of them are criminals and traitors.  One of the problems with democracy where the entire idea can be subsumed by a brainwashed majority.
Sorry, warbirds, this is a CATHOLIC school board. The kids there pray every day- and have special masses, etc- not to mention Christian holidays. They are extending the same to their Muslim students. I am not at all religious- but I surely like to see them getting along with one another.
The 'reward video' is an absurd reaction to what should have been a public school board meeting where the trustees listened to the public.  PUBLIC schools must REMAIN secular institutions where all children are offered a modern INCLUSIVE education. When religion takes on such importance over public education, we should be concerned.  If one religion is given preferential treatment, that may create demands from other religions to have their own special day of the week.  What about those families that have no particular religion -- how will their agnosticism (meaning god is unknowable & cannot be defined by mere humans who get obsessed with rituals and a sense of persecution after developing an attitude of hardened religious self-righteousness)?  What about Wiccans, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Christians, Naturists, Sikhs & others? Plus their sub-varieties. Public schools should not promote religious divisiveness.  NO, NO, NO, NO to religious practices in PUBLIC schools.
It most certainly is genocide, Paul.  Article II of the Genocide Convention defines the international crime of genocide in relevant part as follows:             In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group as such:  (a)        Killing members of the group;  (b)        Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;  (c)        Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;  None of the authors I listed dabble in conspiracy theories. All references are well-documented.   I wish I could meet your friend 2 let that person know there are a few Americans who care. We should commemorate the Palestinian Nakba every May and study the on-going ethnic cleansing of Palestine. Promote the IJAN, JVP, Jews for Palestinian Right of Return & mobilize for non-violent resistance=BDS.
A religious father helped to protect the man who sexually assaulted his daughter.  No intelligent person is surprised at a Christian doing such a horrible thing.  If it had been an atheist father doing the same thing, you and I would both be shocked.  We atheists don't do such things.  Only you religious people do.  So STFU.
YES!!! And I quoted you from it.  No it did not say that anyone must be able to give them.  YES they WERE subjected to geographical issues. "Finally, so long as the town maintains a policyof nondiscrimination, the Constitution does not require it to search beyond its borders for non-Christian prayer givers in an effort to achieve religious balancing." (this is from the ruling)  The SCOTUS Ruled that the City of Greece was not obligated to go outside its borders to find other faiths.  The city allowed layperson and atheists, but the SCOTUS Ruling did not require they be open to such. In fact it stated that there was  no requirement for the prayers to be nonsectarian.  If you believe that's the case cite it from the ruling here. https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-696_bpm1.pdf  I would argue that if you do not follow a faith, then you're not giving an invocation you're giving a speech.
Stephens put this article in the NYTimes, and their  comments' section discussed much of importance. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/opinion/valerie-plame-anti-semitism.html?mcubz=0&_r=0  I believe Israeli apartheid is every bit as evil as the apartheid that was practiced by South Africa and its Bantustans, and I further believe that the world-wide boycotts of South African enterprise helped bring human rights to that country.  You cannot have a Jewish nation that keeps Palestinians occupied behind concrete walls and call it anything but a nation that practices criminal apartheid.  Nothing in this comment is anti-Jewish, but is very much anti-Netanyahu and far right Israel. I still mourn the murder of the hopes of the Israeli left, who really did have a chance to work out a two state solution.  Look at an early map of the area, it lists it as Palestine. Today, maps list it as Israel.   Hugh Massengill, Eugene Oregon
I was wondering the same thing. The name came out of nowhere in the article.  Perhaps the person who shot the video? Or maybe a Hindu god of airplanes?
B. Carfree: I said nothing about local attacks, or any other attacks.  I speculated only about the scores of nationwide threats against Jewish institutions. However, I share B. Carfree’s revulsion at Trump’s expressed fear and hatred of “others".
Obama decreased the Jewish vote for Democrats from 90% to 75% over 8 years. This is way slower than expected, but some traditions die hard.
A whole bunch of comments have just disappeared. I posted "Muslims don't like bacon". For the fifth time that innocuous post disappeared within 5 minutes. How could that possibly be uncivil? When I've posted "Jews don't like bacon" it's never disappeared...
Terrorism is when adjoining countries routinely lob missiles indiscriminately over your borders, with the intention of killing as many people as possible. Terrorism is when people from one nationality stab  innocent people of another nationality on the street with screwdrivers. Terrorism is when people from an adjoining country sneak into your country through tunnels and murder a sleeping mother and her 5 children because they are Jews and not Muslims. Terrorism is when suicide bombers blow themselves up in restaurants with the objective of killing as many people as possible. Terrorism is when someone drives a large vehicle towards innocent pedestrians or at bus shelters to indiscriminately kill people they've never met.   Building houses on disputed lands is not terrorism - Canada has built a country on lands whose title is disputed by its indigenous peoples.   Your hyperbole would perhaps be tempered if the subject of your derision were white Christians, and not Jews.
As an Evangelical Christian, I can answer that question. Why would I want to spend my money in a shop that doesn't want my business?  - Let's say I walk into a Jewish Bakery, a Gay Bakery, a Muslim Bakery, and a Buddhist Bakery because I didn't know they were Jewish, Gay, Muslim, or Buddhist.....and I ask them to decorate a Christian Wedding Cake with "crosses" and "May Jesus Bless Our Marriage" written on it......and they decline because doing so goes against their religious beliefs or same-sex values. - Sure, I might be sad. But wouldn't I just find another bakery that (1) wants my business (2) will gladly create the "edible art work" I want? Of course I would.  - "Turn the other cheek," "do unto others as you want them to do unto you," and "pray for others" does not suing others in court and mean making a federal case out of someone else's beliefs.  - The simplest thing to do is to.....go elsewhere. No big deal.
Sure, we took the Statue of Liberty seriously at one time and took the Celts, Slavs, Greeks, Germans, and Italians. Once the Jews wanted in, we put in place quotas and restrictions to keep them out. That worked out so well, unless you happened to be a Jew fleeing the Holocaust, that we expanded the restrictions to keep all those folks with brown skin out.  True, we did eventually relax some of those quotas out of shame. However, the fact remains that if there were a Carnegie today he would be a brown-skinned Dreamer and we would deport him before he could add to our nation's abundance.
Michael, I say this with all due respect: You have an extremely limited knowledge of case law on this subject.  "The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a similar city that had a similar law. The have been several rulings that support the councils decision." False. The Supreme Court ruled in 2014 Greece v Galloway that invocations are legal only "so long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimination." SCOTUS found that "The town at no point excluded or denied an opportunity to a would-be prayer giver. Its leaders maintained that a minister or a layperson of any persuasion, including an atheist could give the invocation."  The established residency requirement is likewise an unconstitutional violation of Equal Protection as decided in numerous appellate and supreme court decisions. FFRF sued and settled with Franklin County over a similar issue effecting religious holiday displays.  Read the FFRF letter which lays out a legal basis for challenge. Whether you like FFRF or not.
Yes, I get it.  Right now, it's awesome to hate and harm racists because they deserve it.  But the same argument was used against Jews in Nazi Germany, the Armenians in Turkey, those in higher education in Cambodia, etc.  it's easy to hate and it's easy to join with others to hate.  Much harder is learning that  this way of thinking will one day point the haters in your direction.  The worse part is that you will have no one to blame but yourself.
Religious accommodation "was meant to re-arrange test dates that fell on religious holidays"?  A remarkable statement.  You might want to think about the 2004 Supreme Court of Canada decision 2004 decision allowing Orthodox Jews to set up "succahs" on balconies of their co-owned property in contravention of municipal bylaws, as a reasonable accommodation.
First islamists  and liberal  apologists  came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—  Because as a liberal apologist I was busy accusing conservatives of hating Jews   Then they came for the homosexuals, and I did not speak out—  Because as a liberal apologist I was busy accusing conservatives of hating homosexuals.  Then they came for the conservatives, and I did not speak out—  Because as a liberal apologist I was busy hating  conservatives.   Then they cut my head off  because as a liberal apologist They no longer needed me  Its difficult to find one as blinded by hate as Dermot, except in the liberal La-La land of ADN commenters  enjoy!
Shooter was most passionate about his atheism and his hatred of religion.  Sound like anyone on these boards?
So are you suggesting that the jewish cemeteries of Montreal and Quebec City should open up their cemeteries to the general public?  Because there is zero public debate on that - and for good reason.
Gary, any "hatred" is a response to over 7 decades of forced dispossession and oppression. Human rights are not contingent on people liking each other. As Orwell wrote, "... no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it." Assata Shakur observed, "Nobody in the world, nobody in history, has ever gotten their freedom by appealing to the moral sense of the people who were oppressing them." As an external intervention force to balance the power asymmetry, BDS is having an impact and has generated a desperate urgency by the advocates of ethnic supremacy, privilege and segregation in all of historic Palestine.The solution would involve allowing the Palestinian refugees and their families to return to their homeland, to do away with over 50 laws that now discriminate against non-Jews, develop a democratic, constitutional government, compensation to the families of refugees based on Germany's model for victims of the Holocaust, & US education on the Nakba including memorials.
No, Catholics or any denomination of Protestants or any Jew for that matter will be allowed to express any opinions on this highly secular newspaper's pages!  This is purely the privilege of the one officially approved religion by the G&M, namely Islam!
Ancient Israel existed for something like 200 years out of the past 3000 years.   Many others have inhabited, and ruled, over the land far longer than that.   Yes, Jews lived there in varying numbers, but so did many others with far stronger claims to the land today than the late-coming Eastern European Jews who founded the modern State of Israel.
I have used them, and struggled with addiction, and overcome it. I lived in poverty, and overcame it. I've lived all over the country after spending much of my young adult life in church. I've gone from a devout evangelical to a staunch atheist (now firmly agnostic). I'm not remotely a deadbeat drug addict but as the child of drug addicts (one of whom died of a drug overdose) I know a thing or two. Your hard-liner "war on drugs" approach objectively causes harm and does little to keep your precious children away from drugs.  Good parenting to me means that children should understand that things like drugs and sex are probably the best things they'll ever experience – and in that lies the dangers. It's important to live a life where you do not depend on any substance or activity for your happiness but rather find your enjoyment in things like your relationships, working hard, and doing well to others.  If you asked your kids what being high was like, what would their answer be?
Not voting for someone solely because of they are atheist or agnostic I find shameful. Our political process has allowed the demonization of socialism, which most Americans are against, even if they can't define it. So, being against a socialist might be a political response. But, so many people being against an atheist or agnostic candidate solely for being atheist or agnostic, I find to be bigoted.
And supporters of m 103 are enabling superstitious fundamentalists and supporting an irrational misogynist belief system that believes in gender separation and hate of gays, Jews, Christians and non believers
It is certainly what Jesus himself would have done according to the bible. Remember, he was the guy who hung out with moneylenders, prostitutes and other sinners -the scum of the earth in Jewish society of the time.  He sought out their company - and didn't antagonize or judge them. Maybe the private Christian schools (and Christianity at large) should consider following the example of the guy they named their religion after a bit. I for one would look a lot more kindly upon them if they did - because the guy said some pretty wise things a lot of the time - values even atheists widely agree with.  Instead, for some reason, the majority of Christians today seem highly intent on basing their lives and behavior on the Pharisees instead- legalistic and judgemental.   Weren't they the people Jesus spent most of his life arguing against ? The people the bible say are responsible for killing him ?  So maybe, he wouldn't want his followers acting like them.
If the Arabs didn’t want to be ‘occupied’ and ‘humiliated’, then they should not have attempted to annihilate the Jews, and they certainly shouldn’t have launched their genocidal forces from our ancient heartland. If you are concerned about world peace and human rights, the pressure should be on the fascists and kings surrounding Israel committed to endless war. 11 million Muslims have been killed since 1948. Less than one percent of those unfortunate souls have been killed in conflict with Israel.
If you are referring to Israel, I think you need to readjust your definition  of that State to include the fact that, whatever it's constitution may say, Israel in history and spirit has a large element of theocratic rule mixed in to its ethos. The phrase,  "Next Year in Jerusalem" entered the Haggadah  (the text recited at the Seder on the first two nights of the Jewish Passover) in the Middle Ages and refers to Jews rebuilding the Temple in Jerusalem.   To ignore that history is to ignore a major factor in Israeli culture.
To qualify under freedom of religion, a practice or belief doesn't have to be required by official religious dogma or be in conformity with the position of religious officials.   That criterion holds true for all religions and was first confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in a decision involving orthodox jews.
Jack, Jack, Jack, Reagan was not racist as so many 'liberals' are today.  I never heard mainstream conservatives using the "N"  word like  the mainstream left does.  Bill Maher recently had to apologize for a racist slur he made on his own show. I've never heard Trump use racist language,  but liberals?, I've heard more than I'd like to hear. Of course racism knows no race. The very respected liberal icon, Rev. Jesse Jackson once referred to New York as   "H"   town  a  reference to Jewish influence in New York politics.  I've never heard Trump use any racist slurs.   I think Reagan would be very proud of Donald Trump. When they met, back in the 80's  Reagan joked that maybe he should be referring  to Mr. Trump as  " President".  Even then people could see a true leader and not a   weak,  "I agree with everyone"  'consensus'  builder.  Most liberals today remind me of  Mr. Kimball on the old 'Green Acres' show.
Typical liberal Jew. Has he forgot what nation ended the Holocaust? Total disrespect of the office of the president. Who's the malignant one?
First start with the term "alt-right" which was coined by white supremacists to re-brand the racist and anti-semitic groups on the far right to confuse and make them more palatable. Now those same people have invented "alt-left" in an attempt to create a false equivalency. "See, we're no different than the other side!". Except the alt-right wants expunge America of Jews, blacks, immigrants and foreigners and the other side is against that. No rational person condones violence and we must prevent it, but this is about way more than violence. This is about what is right and good on ones side and what is un-American and evil on the other.
"1966? I have a feeling they have been around much longer than that."  . Naughty, naughty. Your question was "And since when did satanists decide to join the real world?", not how long they have "been around." That is an entirely different matter.  . "And I bet they wanted there literature distributed at the Delta schools because one of their members was a liberal, but not out of conviction or fealty to the Constitution." . You lose. The primary person who arranged it is generally conservative, with libertarian leanings. Who was not even a Satanist. And it was exactly out of conviction [and] fealty to the Constitution - specifically, an objection to taxpayer funds being used to promote a religion. Instead of playing the game the Board expected, the rule was invoked to force the schools to give equal treatment to Satanist, Atheist, and Humanist tracts thereby calling the Board's bluff. And it worked.
Yes, you did indeed change the basis of your scenario. Hardly surprising, since your original basis (your 'ten atheists' example) was unsustainable in terms of the Church's practice and instructions for celebration of the Mass. As I've said before, your use of capital letters adds nothing to your argument. Nor does your repeating things (now 16 messages from you). The only thing that has changed is their increasing intemperateness.
Actually Dennism, this argument does not help women.  God in Genesis stated from the beginning that God created man, one creation, not two, so equals and the same, and deserving of all the same rights and benefits.  Later after both woman & man sinned against God, they both lost perfection & both as unsaved lesser beings, fallen beings, are now going to treat each other as un-equals.  Natural man is unsaved, mortal, does not trust his wife, and she is controlled by his greater physical strength.  She now is dishonest with him in order to gain the same things he has.    God taught the Israelites differently, that man & women are equals and recognition of this equality, in practice, in their lives, is proof their relationship with God exists greater than with other people.  Catholics & Jews often teach wrongly the old & new testaments with many erroneous assumptions.    Christians prove they are saved by treating and ordaining all the same, including women, or we prove we are unsaved.
I could be wrong, but I think that reflects Hindu belief..
7.4 billion people on earth, numerous religions, each group thinks theirs is the true God, except for the few who believe there is no God (atheists) or do not know enough to be sure (agnostics). What a mess!
You still misunderstand what I'm saying.  I didn't say the Church shouldn't engage in dialogue with Jews.  What I said was that the Church does not, has not, and should not engage in dialogue whose very object is to change fundamental Church teaching.  The Church cannot remain the Church and condone homosexual conduct.  Dialogue that has this as its object is contrary to the very essence of the Church and will not occur.  If it does, the Church will cease to be the Church.
The following countries BAN any Israeli Jew from even entering their country: Syria Iran Iraq Yemen Libya  Algeria Bangladesh Brunei Kuwait Lebanon Malaysia Oman Pakistan Sudan Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates
If the Jews had stockpiled automatic weapons Hitler would have armed the Brown Shirts with automatic weapons and tanks.  The Jews would still have died by the millions.
"As a woman, I can say I have definitely been discriminated against several times by Muslims. I have never discriminated against them." ~ ~ ~ Voluntear... you are among many who have witnessed women being discriminated by Muslim men & Muslim women.  The special term 'Islamophobia' seems to be striving desperately to set itself apart from other 'religions & collectives' ... it certainly seems to be especially drawing into itself a great deal of Canadian oxygen.  Bigotry is a Human issue -- Islam is just an other religion just like Judaism -- Neither is special.
Even during the time when other nations ruled Jerusalem... no political entity made Jerusalem its capital. Jerusalem has always been real or symbolic undivided capital of the Jewish people, and no other nation. It always remained a city inhabited by a large Jewish population that usually made up a majority. And even in early 1900's the majority population of Jerusalem was Jewish.     Does the fact that Romans and French ruled England, make England any less English?
Donald had many Jewish backers, he won the State of New York in every county except for one; his son in law is a Jew and his daughter is a conveted Jew and now his three grandchildren are Jews, his other son married a Jew...his club in Palm Beach is comprised of a lot of Jewish supporters as is his lawyer and financial advisers...and his hundreds of boys from his property days in NYC....you should get real.
In Charlottesville, your friendly 'freedom of speech' warriors killed one woman, attempted to kill and injure many others including a man set on by a gang of Nazi thugs in a local car park.  Remember their protest was supposed to be about a statue but they were chanting "Jews will not replace us" and "blood and soil" etc. I don't buy this  phony outrage about freedom of speech if at the same time you turn a blind eye to their violence and criminality.
Christian, Jew or Muslim; i fear anyone who thinks one book was written by the creator and hears voices talking to them from the sky. I fear a government who is run by these principles.
Her entire  article reolves around two things that percentage of Muslims in Cananda is far lower than what Candians think and second that small number of Muslims women wear scrarf or Niqab that might be correct.  But problem lies somewhere elese that she didn't talk about is whether Muslims living in Canada support gender equality, LGBT rights, support secular values of Canada, oppose armed Jihad. we see the segregation of women in some univiserities reported by the media. There is large majority among Muslim community still claims that 9/11 was conspiracy of Jews and US agencies.Simialrly, many people living here support blasphemy act back in Muslim countries. So it is not perception but the mindset and values we carry and pass on our children that causing serious problem here.
What about the teachings of the Prophets?  For the Jewish people---it wasn't just the TEN Commandments that were important, but the Prophets teaching HOW to observe the Commandments.  Jesus didn't say that the two Great Commandments summarizes the TEN.  He stated that they ARE the greatest.
Frederick, you seem to explain your religion very well. So what would it take to bring peace to the many places across the world where large numbers of Muslims are not getting along with other cultures. What can the Hindus, the Buddists, Middle East Christians, Jews,  Indonesians, Chechnyans, Europeans, Americans, Nigerians, Ohio State Students, etc do, so that they can rest easy that the bombs and mass shootings in the name of Islam will be relegated to the past? Also, do you think the moderate Muslim population does enough to purge its religion of the radicals? Do you agree that Islam has a problem with radicalization? I think one mistake they make is to form enclaves in a host country with little social interaction with others. Not in all cases but that is the perception. Sincere questions.
Harry, The subject we were discussing was the Confederacy, the KKK, and Southern "heritage" and symbols of slavery.  I understand the KKK hates Catholics and Jews as much as African-Americans.  It is they who want to divide and conquer to remake America to the past. Please admit the fact that the Southern Baptist religion was founded in 1845 by Anglo slave owners.
The facts are that Chrystia Freeland's grandfather was Michael Chomiak.  That same Michael Chomiak (not his namesake) was the editor of a Nazi newspaper in Krakow during the war.  That newspaper printed many anti-Jewish articles.  Where is disinformation exactly?   Mrs Freeland should not be punished for whatever her grandfather did, but as an elected official she should be honest about it.  This article has "disinformation" in the title, but does nothing to prove its point.  There is no evidence presented to show where this disinformation is.
Why is it OK for Jewish-Canadians, Italian-Canadians, British-Canadians etc, to have fundraising events?  Why single out Chinese-Canadians?
"Deaths to Jews" sounds pretty specific to me.  Chanting "We will not be replaced by Jews"...well, I don't know what this even means.  (It reminds me a bit of my dad cussing in French, "Cinq or six boite de tamates vertes", which sounded really nasty, but literally meant "Five or six boxes of green tomatoes".)  While I don't imagine their underlying sentiments were friendly to Jews, the bottom line is we only police behaviours, not thoughts.    Fortunately, we have laws against hate speech with established precedents on what it is, and isn't.  Hate speech is a crime against our entire society and should be prosecuted as such, regardless of who is doing it.
I have never seen any proof that Bernie's second-place showing was caused by whatever "plot" the DNC cooked up against him. Bernie drew huge, enthusiastic crowds all over the US. The mainstream media ignored Bernie relative to the attention they paid Hillary, but Hillary's media exposure was eclipsed by the constant attention the media gave him. Trump is a genius at attracting cameras and microphones, and unfortunately, he took us all for a ride, including the MSM. (I wasn't fooled for a minute. I lived in Philadelphia in the 'eighties, where Trump was a tabloid star, a bad joke to the educated but a hero to the ignoratti.)   IMO the DNC didn't hurt Bernie's numbers much. If Bernie had won the nomination, billionaires and corporate weasels would have spent whatever it took on 24/7 advertising to paint Bernie as a com-symp, a socialist, a communist, and an anti-American Jew. I know, that's awful to say, but look at the Trump campaign - nothing was too low to to go for him.
So you're saying the Jewish media weren't talking about the threats, but as soon as it was revealed that a Jewish Israeli was making them they were all over the story? As narratives go, yours isn't very convincing.   Whatever the cause of Michael Kadar's behavior, I hope he receives help for it.
The early Christians had to decide what they were supposed to do, consider their new religion an outgrowth of Judaism, and get people to convert to Judaism and follow all the laws, including the food laws and getting circumcised, as Peter thought, or consider it a new religion, and not require that, as Paul thought. And Paul won.  Pagans were not required to follow Jewish law.  The  New Testament has Jesus saying, "You have heard X, but I tell you.....".  The penalty for adultery was stoning, but he stopped the stoning of an adultress, saying, "Let the one who has never sinned, throw the first stone". Etc.  So they concluded the N.T. superseded the Old.
Hahahaha, you're quoting a right-wing Republican vice-president forced to resign in disgrace.     And stayed in disgrace: "In 1976, he briefly reentered the public spotlight and engendered controversy with what Gerald Ford publicly criticized as "unsavory remarks about Jews"."
Why does this fellow defend atheism on the grounds that it is just as moral and loving as Christianity. If atheists truly believe there is no Heaven or Hell shouldn't they be getting as much hedonistic action and debauchery as possible.  While they can.
"I grew up an atheist thanks to our public education system."  Our?  They may have indoctrinated children with atheism in places like the USSR but not here in Canada.
The Jews definitely went for the male only priesthood perhaps to show they were different that "all the major religious traditions of Our Lord's time".  At any rate, Jesus was a Jew and from a male only tradition so I can't agree with your reasoning.  Besides which, Jesus did tell Martha that Mary joining in with his disciples had chosen the better way.  So perhaps he had a body of people following him.  The "twelve" was often a way to denote a completeness rather than a literal number just as his 40 days in the desert isn't taken as a literal 40 days by many people but meant "many" to people in that storytelling tradition.
Schools have a holiday every Sunday, so that Christian kids can go to church without having to skip school. Schools have public holidays for Christian festivals (Christmas, Easter) only.   On the other hand, the world's largest Muslim countries, like Indonesia and Bangladesh, have public holidays for Buddhist, Hindu and Christian festivals.
I don't think anyone has all of the answers and people are just not living in a mature manner.  How could one tell that the man wearing the Jewish flag was a Trump Supporter?     I haven't heard what Ivanka's response is, she being converted to Judaism as her husband is Jewish.   She's been pretty quiet as of late.  I'm sure she's not thrilled with these Nazi either.
Greek civilization was over around 100 B.C.? Greek culture was dominant in the Eastern Mediterranean well until the Arab invasions of the 600s. Some of the greatest philosophers, pagan, Jewish and Christian, lived in Alexandria, Egypt, to name one centre of Greek culture, in fact the predominant one, until it was taken by the Arabs in 641 AD. Several Christian theologians were from Alexandria, like Saint Athanasius of Alexandria, a theologian and Church Father, c. 297 to 373.  There is less than a thousand years from 600 to 1100 AD, the zenith of Arab knowledge. It has been on the decline since then, and not rebounded. Rehashing the old stories about algebra and gunpowder serves to deflect from the fact that modern science has been the result of European and Western endeavours for the last four hundred years. All the technologies used today were born there. We are talking about the here and now.
Will moslems, buddhists, sikhs, hindus, and other non-christian groups enjoy the same freedoms?  Don't bet on it.

And the United States Supreme Court disbarred Clinton. Perjury is also a criminal offense. You should study up on his corrupt lawyers, working at the U.S. Justice Department, under the U.S. Attorney General's Office. 8th grade civics always confuses our criminals.

What does your comment have to do the article above?  It sounds more like 'how many angels can dance on the head of a pin"?    In today's society, would people attending Mass have badges on them stating "I am an Atheist" so that everyone would know that they are atheists?    And since the Eucharist is to be a PARTICIPATED liturgy---WOULD a priest be celebrating [not just mumbling words---which is "saying Mass'] the liturgy if he KNEW that he was in the presence of ten atheists?  Comment on the article, please, and not in trying to trap people in your pharisaical, hypothetical statement games.
Rob,  The quick answer to your question is that Christians are happy to point out that atheism is a belief system because: A) It is a belief system predicated on no facts; B) Atheists have a tendency to claim that their belief that God/gods doesn't don't exist is factual and science based.  So, I answered your question, but you haven't answered mine,.  I'll restate it here: I challenge you to present even one element of what you refer to as "the overwhelming preponderance of evidence [that] indicates that their is no God." Amazing that you state this as so obvious, yet I can't think of one single think that would support this supposed "preponderance."
Having a lot of experience with atheists during my studies in university, and having read works by atheists such as Richard Dawkins, I have never met a single atheist who did not attest that they formulated their atheistic beliefs in relation to their knowledge of science and the scientific method.  When an atheists maintains their position is rational, they mean that they believe their atheistic beliefs are in accord with our contemporary scientific understanding of the universe.  This is hardly a straw man claim and evidence is in abundance.  Find any book written by an atheist that does not tie their beliefs to science and the scientific method.  So, Ariel, is the challenge not then to you to find any evidence to disprove what I state is a clear and undeniable linkage between atheism and contemporary science and methodology?  I could give you a definition of the scientific method if you really want it, but I respect that you have a firm knowledge of this system already.
"we would feel so dirty doing it"    The DNC staff certainly didn't have that problem in going after Bernie:  " top Democratic National Committee (DNC) official suggested that the party should raise questions about Sanders’ “Jewish heritage” in key primary states"  "My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.”  "It's the Jesus thing".
How do Canadian apologies made to the Jews, Japanese Canadians, or any other group or individual, negatively affect the economy?
Funniest thing I've read all week (except the story of the white supremacists who, in an effort to prove their "purity" taking DNA tests and angrily rejecting the findings that 2/3 of them have African or DNA that suggests Jewish ancestry, then angrily rejecting science), and I needed a little humor after the flame-throwing disaster of the trump administration and their shenanigans this week. The man with the look of the chronic alcoholic, who is the "brains" of the administration, has managed to convince the basket of deplorables that they matter, while laughing about them in private.
Part 6 I would point out that there is a recent interpretation of one of the gospel texts based on a careful analysis of the Greek that suggests the Pharisees were once again trying to trap Jesus. At that time, there were two views among Jews about divorce: (1) a recent Pharisee view, that remains Jewish practice to this day, that a man can "for any reason" give his wife a "Git," a certificate of divorce, and thereby divorce her; and (2) an older practice based on Leviticus that either spouse can divorce the other in the event of sexual infidelity. And Jesus rejects the first when he said divorce was disallowed "for any reason,"  that is rejecting the Pharisee view.   (BTW, Tridentinus, my Koine Greek is sufficient to test this interpretation again the text, and I am persuaded. What I cannot confirm on my own scholarship is whether the dispute among the Jews was indeed operative at that time, for that requires knowledge of the Talmud, and I don't have the wherewithal to go there.)
I think it is a bit more subtle than that - the male/female distinction is held to be more fundamental than the jew/gentile distinction.  But beyond the question of what does a person have to be or have to do the special things that priests do, we should also be looking at what this special priestly action is.  Opening up the possibility of extending sacred power to women might call into question the very sustainability of the notion of that power.  This goes to the heart of the self-identity of a lot of priests.
You know, the actual interview could be used to attack Soros, but it didn't quite do the job so this fake interview, which is laughably easy to tell is fake, was circulated instead to be passed along by the credulous and gullible. Here's the real transcript:  KROFT: My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted godson.  Mr. SOROS: Yes. Yes.  KROFT: Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.  Mr. SOROS: Yes. That's right. Yes.  KROFT: I mean, that's -- that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years. Was it difficult?  Mr. SOROS: Not -- not at all. Not at all. Maybe as a child you don't -- you don't see the connection. But it was -- it created no -- no problem at all.
How nice.  I suppose we can expect similar articles at Ramadan, to wit: How a Jew celebrates, or, How a Christian celebrates? What's that, no way?  Of course, bullies only feel comfortable attacking those it perceives as being weak. Way to go G&M.
Vietnam and Korea do not hate Americans.   The South Koreans are grateful for the protection that kept them from becoming like North Korea.   The Vietnamese  don't either, the "American War" was just a blip in their thousand-year-old history, and their Buddhist philosophy encourages them to move on rather than stay steeped in resentment and seek revenge. Also, it is a young country, "The American War" is their grandparents' war. You can feel the spirit of optimism and energy in the country, they are looking forward, not back.   If the Vietnamese resent anyone, it is the Chinese which they have had to fight off for thousands of years to keep their independence.  Asians in general have lots of animosity against each other, with the Chinese, the Japanese, the Koreans and others having vied for supremacy as the superior culture and imperial powers for a millenia or more.
Conservative Christians are angry over Trump’s selection of a “prosperity gospel” televangelist Paula White to pray at his inauguration.  “I’d rather a Hindu pray on Inauguration Day and not risk the souls of men, than one whose heresy lures in souls with promises of comfort only to damn them in eternity,” wrote Erick Erickson, an outspoken Trump critic on the right. “At least no one would mistake a Hindu, a Buddhist, or an atheist with being a representative of Christ’s kingdom.”  “Paula White is a charlatan and recognized as a heretic by every orthodox Christian, of whatever tribe,” said Russell Moore, of the SBS's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commiss.  White takes in up to $80,000 a week and owns multimillion-dollar homes in Trump Tower and Florida.  “Paula White has a history of bankruptcies, failed business ventures, and unsuccessful marriages, which makes her the perfect choice to deliver a prayer on behalf Trump," wrote Paula Bolyard, a conservative Christian blogger.  Lovely!
Thank you, Mr. Tammeus. This article and all your articles are always insightful and helpful. (Your history of Anti-Semitism/Anti-Judaism, however, is pricelessly helpful.) You are always a welcome ecumenical voice here (as well as a gladly received pastor/brother in the broader faith we all share as Christians). Again, thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, but as an atheist, I get to play smug card. Prevo promotes the idiocy and destructiveness of the Bible; believers in the Bible are, by definition, delusional; more calories have been wasted in the the name of religion than anything else.  As an atheist, I am free of that nonsense. I use reason and the scientific method to push me through the day. I sit on my porch and snicker and sneer at the poor Souls.  Actually, that last part is not true, I'm just trying to make a point. In fact I spend most of my time helping the voiceless - animals, both wild and domesticated. Lots to be learned from them. One thing I've learned: they don't need a god.
And there is no mention that the assailant, Mr. Boris Grits, is a citizen of Israel and a radical Jewish activist.
"As on critique I read some years ago said, atheism, still has not defined itself beyond the opposite of, or negative to a belief in a deity."  Um, that's because that's all atheism is. Atheism isn't a religion, isn't a belief system or a philosophy or a brand. It is simply and literally a lack of belief in a deity. For some reason that fact is incredibly difficult for some religious people to understand.
Ur not too sure of what u are sure of? ....sounds like a budding atheist to me for sure..how ironic.
I do look at terrorist as the enemy, why would you think otherwise?   I think they are cut throat murderers who justify their action with religious shrouds.  I don't respect or honor that religious interpretation.  I know my Old Testament well enough to know it has been used to justify murder as well by Christians and Jewish tradition.    I know that not all Muslims believe in killing non Christians(and I bet you agree?)  How many Oregonions have been killed in the state by Muslim motivated extremist?  (Last 5 years).  How many Oregonions have been murdered by Oregonions?    Using Trump thinking all Oregonions should get tight screening and subjected to investigation    I think our police, FBI, and other's involved in protecting our shores have done outstanding work in stopping acts of terrorism.  Trump's condemnation 0f there tireless efforts is reprehensible and insults the men and women protecting all of us.
We need to trace back those of multiple generations in Canada. Were there ancestors who were part of racist governments, who turned away Jews and Asians, legislated discrimination against blacks, "interned" Japanese, stole and abused First Nations children, etc.. Going further back, were there ancestors who performed genocidal acts against First Nations?  That would balance out the evils of "old country" ancestors.
But that's the point -this article is not based on anything he's said or actually done. It takes comments made about Hillary's violence and propaganda secretary George Soros who I have just learned today happens to be jewish, but also is the money behind the phoney political groups responsible for the violence during the campaigns and the post election violence and riots now. That's what President elect Trump was commenting on and if you actually took time to research what what said take an unbiased view for like two seconds, then you might learn something. I'm a registered independent and as usual, I am thinking for myself, but I'm also reading, fact checking and getting to the truth, not just swallowing what some writer with an agenda shoves in front of me. .
Bubala, you clearly didn't have an Italian father because then you would know that "Bada Bing (bada boom) (with one 'd') is a term commonly used by members of the Italian-American Mafia. Slang for, "it's finished; taken care of." Often it is heard in the metropolitan areas of New York, specifically Brooklyn-where Jews culturally appropriated it -consider it NYC pidgin. And that's O-K.  But it wouldn't end up in a Henny Youngman routine I don't think.  Maybe it's Abbot and Costello you're thinking of?!?  Local translation would range from, "pau hana" to perhaps the more literal translation which would be, "bruddah maki died dead".  In Hawaiian, the closet I can figure is, "Hikiwale," or "ma'alahi", but I may be wrong about that.  Best I could figure.
Very few Jews compared to Russians  died at the hands of the Nazis, nobody talks about that either. The West even goes as far as to claim they defeated Hitler, when it was the Russians.
Well, this fellow is not defending atheism.  He's a crypto-theist spreading straw men.  But we can leave that aside.  As for your question, reasonable atheists regards the moral strictures of religion as irrelevant.  There's no need to demonstrate against irrelevancy.
The stats show that only 325 people were affected out of 325,000 coming into the US every day. Or that 40 muslim countries were not part of this temporary ban.  Or that few of these are being accepted into the Arab Countries, and those that are must be of the same religious denomination as that of the majority.  Just check how many Shias refugees  are being accepted into Saudi Arabia.....Zero.  Recall Canada in WW11 when Canada refused to accept Jewish refugees  from Germany.  Once again , brain washing of the masses is in full speed ahead.  Goebbels convinced his subjects that Arians were the super race, with slavery and extermination thr destiny for the rest. And they sucked it up.  Its no different now. Tell a lie often enough and it will soon become the truth
I've noted how the Left leaning media (meaning most media) slips in little digs to create problems.  Now the reader has to be aware of Ivanka as a Jew.  Now she "might" be getting special power over Trump.  And what could *that* mean???  And notice how a "dig" about Trump's religious beliefs again focuses one's attention of some perceived problem.  I've still yet to see any of the major media has taken on the rioting and attempted murder - all by Lefties and "Progressives" (some progress!!!) - and spoken out against it.  What is it they *really* want?  Seems like complete control of all of us.  And yet I remain essentially apolitical.  Politics has *never* been a clean game, not for thousands of years.
Will do so, thanks for the info. Maybe I will get a roasting for the following from others, but Hitler was demonised by Russian and Western propaganda. He wanted to deport Jews, but never gave an order to have them killed. That was Himmler. He stopped Himmler when becoming aware of it.  But Hollywood carried on after the war with portraying Schindler's list as factual though the book clearly stipulates it as a work of fiction. Then there was the Anne Frank fraud, Steven Spielberg's End Of Days etc.
Rich,    I disagree.    If you've read Jack Granatstein and his ilk in the G & M these last 16 years since 9/11 you would realize how reactionary and influential Canada's historians, militarists, and image makers are. That's one major reason Canada drifts further and further to the right wing.     Monarchists are few but powerful. Canadians are still given to the pageantry of royalty. Imperialists are many, regard the British Empire with love and deeply regret its passing, Our military-industrial complex is growing by leaps and bounds. Without empire or a new war, they all strongly support American imperialism (hegemony). Many would like Canada to be the 51st state.    In high places, racism and contempt for the working class are still influential.      You might have noticed many here don't believe  there's been anything in Canadian history that's regrettable. They blame the "politically correct" for reminding them Canada turned away Jews fleeing the Nazis, then welcomed many Nazis.
Nonsense.  An additional three million of Hitler's victims were Gypsies.  Why was not a 'homeland' given to THEM?  Indeed, if someone had to be displaced and dispossessed, why dispossess those that even Ben Gurion ADMITTED where innocent of the atrocities committed against the Ashkenaziim?  If reparations were due them, the Germans were the ones to pay, not the Palestinians--ceding the best parts of the Rhine Valley and/or other German property would have been more just.  "...the 1948 war was as needless and unnecessary for the "security" of Israel as was the Israeli invasion of Lebanon of 1982.  ... the 1948 war was not defensive, but a war to gain more territory than the U.N. had allotted for the Jewish state and to "cleanse" the area of Palestinian Arabs...the Jewish population of Palestine in 1948 was only about 600,000...the Ben-Gurion leadership REQUIRED WAR to rid the new Jewish state of most of its Arab population."  (Simha Flapan--"The Birth of Israel: Myths and Realities")
He was skeptical of all mythology including Jewish claims to originality.  He wasn't in the fan club, but that doesn't necessarily make him anti-semitic.
Kaufman was wrong to say the words cited, but you provide no context for the reader. Kaufman is Jewish, as testified to by one of his most well known quotes: 'My grandmother was  ill in bed when the Nazi's came to her home town of Statzow. A German soldier shot her dead in her bed...my grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza. The present Israeli government ruthlessly and cynically exploit the continuing guilt among gentiles for the slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust as a justification for their murder of Palestinians. The implication is that Jewish lives are precious, but the lives of Palestinians don't count.'
I am not religious myself, but it's embarrassing that so many atheists have the personality of an overgrown adolescent trying to shock grandma at Sunday dinner.
The anti-Semitic left like attacking Jews on campus and elsewhere.  Now they have the gall to attribute these attacks and threats to the 'right'.  Nice try.  The one person arrested is an anti-Trump far left nut job.  Funny how that isn't highlighted in these news articles.  Doesn't fit the journalists bias I guess.
Bunk.  It was precisely for healing the sick that the Jewish religious leaders had Jesus crucified.  “Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in Him. But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things Jesus did.  Then the CHIEF PRIESTS AND PHARISEES gathered a council and said, ‘What shall we do? For this Man works many signs (healing).  If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.’”(John 11:45-48)  “But they cried out, ‘Away with Him, away with Him! Crucify Him!’  Pilate said to them, ‘Shall I crucify your King?’ The chief priests answered, ‘We have no king but Caesar!’  Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. Then they took Jesus and led Him away.” (John 19:15-16)
There has been a Jewish presence for over 4,000 years in the Holy Land even if they were not the majority population because of invasion  but they are the INDIGENOUS, First Nations of the land, so to speak it's in the Bible what do you have to rebut the Bible ?
Correct, and what you said I'll disagree with since atheism is a rejection of the claim of theism and does not require the making of the claim "God does not exist." and because, under your definition, any singular statement of belief has a passing resemblance to religion.  This ignores the definition of religion.  In the gumball example I'm not stating that you're wrong, I'm failing to accept your claim.  That does not mean that I have accepted the counter claim that the opposite is true.  I could still reject the opposite claim.  A Google search brings up a definition consistent with what I'm saying - A disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God or gods.  Disbelief being a refusal or inability to accept something as true.  It is the failure to accept, not the acceptance of the counterclaim.  And a quick Google search also confirms that agnosticism is about knowledge as it relates to God.  Not Gods existence.  By definition I am an agnostic-atheist.  Merry Christmas!
How you've concluded I was insinuating one should sympathize with the alt-right "Theotherhand" is beyond my understanding, but that certainly wasn't the message I was attempting to convey. Though it's of no consequence, I myself am Jewish and had two Great Uncles whom both lost their wives and children to such bigotry, so obviously I'd never want anyone supporting any form of hate.  Nevertheless, I would still fight and die, if necessarily, for their right to free speech as it's a fundamental right fixed within our founding principles and without we're that much closer to a dictatorial society, not unlike Nazi German. And when the existing few(the KKK has less than 10,000 members and not even 200 alt-right supporters were present at the Charlottesville protest after months of their campaigning) spew their hate I know all they're accomplishing is further isolating themselves and teaching others exactly why their ideology is flawed, ignorant and shouldn't be supported...
o good more office poeple that never give money to the homeless jew.......that wants to build a 100 mile high pryimid ....so  poeple can walk in to outer space.....
MP's should condemn anti-Muslim, anti-Christian, and anti-Jewish behaviours and get on with more important matters. Our existing laws should be able to handle any contingencies.
wearing an Israel flag... symbol of a Jewish state... aren't they protesting anti bigotry and hate? But you missed that part.. right.
Where on earth do you get this stuff from???   "He wants to impose the beliefs of the Catholic and Evangelical churches..."  Please provide support for this absurd statement. ..
The point rationale people are making is that this does nothing to stop or address terrorism.  This is just another in 45's gas-lighting of his 'base' and a way to feed their ignorance.  He would do well to pay attention to the home grown terrorists shooting up/burning down theatres, grade schools, and black churches, sikh temples, and mosques....those are generally white but apparently there's usually some mental health problems that 'cause' them to do it, everyone else is just 'evil'.  This is beyond disgraceful.  I suspect the majority of decent, rationale thinking Americans who didnt vote for him btw, must be so embarrassed.  There are people in this ban who risked their lives to help Americans fight their illegal war in Iraq and help their fight terrorism cause in other countries.  This is so reminiscent of the Jewish refugees who were refused entry only to be murdered in gas chambers.  When we forget history we are bound to repeat it.
"The long story throughout human history is fear of differences and the unknown and was the root of most of the violence and brutality in the past 5K years. "  I'm not sure that's entirely true.  Yes, fear of "the other" has led to pogroms and massacres and wars of religion.  But the Assyrians weren't afraid of the weaker kingdoms around them;  they just wanted to rule over them.  And I don't believe Genghis Khan was afraid of anybody .  The British didn't conquer India because they feared Hinduism.  They wanted a captive market for the output of Lancashire textile mills.  And a place to grow tea where the Chinese couldn't set the price.
An advisor or assistant who left said he was moved to tears as he heard Trump’s refusal to condemn the movement that sent many of his family to the gas chambers.  It reminded him of being taught his family history that he had forgotten until Trump brought it back. Listening to the Nazi’s Stalinist and German chants translated to English, curses against Jews, and the smashing of the Star of David during the demonstration brought back the lesson to resist the Nazis. He was angry as he read that the white supremacists blamed “the Jew, Soros” for hiring trained mercenaries to beat up the Nazis and for bribing the police to help push their group into the paid counter demonstrators where they had to fight for their lives, and the claim that the driver who drove into the crowd was trying to escape the police trying to kill him.
jew...surprised?
have you ever been to Afghanistan?  Any lunatic with plans for large infrastructure projects like pipelines would learn a quick lesson in how utterly impermissible the terrain is, in combination with thousands of Afghans wielding welding torches that would disassemble the pipeline for scrap as soon as it was laid.  the Mohammed Agha Copper mine has ten thousand security guards for just that reason.  The terrain and humans would make any attempt impossible.  It would be a lot more cost effective to re-route to the north or south simply because the number of pump stations to get over the hindu kush, and I would trust the Turkmen, Tajiks, and Uzbeks more than any group in that cobbled together rockpile of a failed state.
Just in case there is a desire to celebrate banning news media from what is essentially the people's house.  First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist.  Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—  Because I was not a Trade Unionist.  Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—  Because I was not a Jew.  Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me. (M. Niemöller)
Where do you get your figure of 10-15% of Portlanders sitting in pews every Sunday (or Saturday)?  Meetup.com shows pretty high membership (in the hundreds) for atheist & humanist groups.  Not everyone attends every meeting.    Where do those 60,000 regular church attendees go? You have already conceded that the liberal progressive congregations are shrinking.  Show me the mega churches that are full on Sunday and how you get to that 60k figure.  Imago Dei is the big news with 1000 regular members in the pews every week.  Where are the young people flocking, since Imago Dei gets 1.6% of the 60k regular church goers you claim exist in Portland?
thought,  Read the rest of the thread as I've address most of these claims.  1) The burden of proof is not on the religious (except maybe intelligent designers I reject, it would be their burden) as the religious make no claim to scientific evidence proving the existence of God/gods; 2) the burden of proof IS, however, on any atheist who claims that science can demonstrate that God/gods doesn't do not exist (which they can't); 3) I'd love for you to believe but believing requires faith not evidence in this case; 4) see the thread for more about atheism as a belief system though you illustrate throughout this post that your belief system is based on the scientific method, at least as you understand it.
Re: "a shared culture."  You can put the titles of African-American movies--movies that celebrated black lifestyles and "culture"--that were created before 1970 on one page of a small notebook.    Most of America's "shared culture" was fabricated "dream-wish" style by a handful of US east-coast Jewish immigrants--1st and 2nd generation--whose escapist fare (Andy Hardy series; lavish 30s-50s musicals, safe 19th century frontier dramas called "westerns") projected the kind of "shared culture" they WANTED the US to represent, not as it actually was--or even had been (ever see "Young Thomas Edison"?) (Shock of shocks when 20th Century Fox had the guts to back Zanuck in making Grapes of Wrath. Only the cynical would suggest buying the year's best-selling novel made it an easier decision...)  Which is one big reason why Hollywood was so slow to show the rise of Nazi Germany, even though the Jewish studio heads were petrified of what it represented.
"Remove the plank from your own eye before talking about splinters in others" @Sheema Khan tell us what your community is doing for not making the same mistake over and over on different subjects such as... (1) the Montréal Shafia Family’s tragedy/ 3 sisters and 1st wife murders in 2009 were found dead inside a car that was discovered underwater in Kingston, Ontario/ Québécois are Very Drastic & will never let another & do everything that tragedy of Shafia Family happened again !) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpiF35L9tI0 (2) TVA Nouvelles/ Montréal le 26 janvier 2016; Hamza Chaoui (see Google for info) is one of Québec's best-known radical imams. He is known by his many controversial statements. Islam, according to him, is incompatible with democracy, as parliaments may consist "a disbeliever, a homosexual or an atheist who says the lack of Allah." (more to come...if not "censured")
Oh, come on Venter. Jews are in many key government and business positions in America, far more of them that their population percentage would suggest. They are certainly not victims of anyone, not to mention their strong lobby in Washington with major influence on foreign policy. Besides, your analogy between the holocaust and atrocities by colonialist is rather weak. How about the 20 million Russians who dies in World War Two? How many Chinese died at the hands of Japanese conquerors? How many Africans died as a result of Shaka Zulu's conquests? How many British soldiers died in World War One due to the insane strategies of their generals? How many Germans died as a result of Hitler's insane wars?  But you are right about the fact, that the DA's future, if any, lies in the black community. It is quite likely that the DA will borrow the ideology of black nationalism from the ANC to counterbalance the white influence of Zille.
I believe if you read the article she explicitly says "some hindus" "some politicians", etc. No where does she blame all hindus. How is this in any way anti hindu? If anything she's raising awareness of the issue to start a conversation, before it all goes sideways.
(Part two of two)  As far as the electorate in the United States is concerned, “When the LORD saw how great was man’s wickedness on earth, and how no desire that his heart conceived was ever anything but evil, he regretted that he had made man on earth, and his heart was grieved” (Genesis 6:5-6).  With all the mess caused by the electorate, “The Lord will bless his people with peace” (Psalm 29:11b).  Psalm 29 was written in relatively good times, like now, before the Jewish Exile.  The Faithful need to keep the Faith and to keep pressing for “Whoever loves me will keep my word, says the Lord; and my Father will love him and we will come to him” (John 14:23), yea, even in the United States.  “Are your hearts hardened?...Do you still not understand?” (Mark 8:17, 21).  The new “Trump Normal” is unacceptable to the Faithful, whether Democratic, Republican, or Independent.  Liturgy of the Word, Reading 336, Tuesday of the Sixth Week in Ordinary Time, Year I.
The Troubles in Ireland were created by good old English geopolitics where the English imported masses of Protestant Scots into Catholic Ireland. Boy, that sounds a lot like Churchill and others putting a lot of Jewish people into Muslim Palestine, doesn't it?
If this protest was directed against Jewish students and their prayer habits it would immediatly be castigated as "anti semitism " and shut down. Don't forget Arabs are also "semitic people" and so this protest is also "anti semitic and should be treated in the same way. Actually I don't believe in preventing anyone from doing their religious thing so long as it doesn't get in the way of others. Have just read a great book"Londoners" a whole book of interviews with those living in London and its amazing the vitality and vibrancy and multi cultural interest that a truly mixed community like London has evolved into. Relax and things will get better!
recognize the Virgin birth --- So they recognize Jesus as son of God?  Other than western media and maverick muslims do you have Islam scholars quotes to back that up?  You mentioned Jews seing Jesus as source of their troubles. But not the Muslims? Ever heard of crusades?
For Christians, marriage was created and instituted by God at the outset of creation.  (Genesis 2:24).  Which civilization's contractual marriage are you suggesting the Supreme Court is using? Surely you know America was founded based on Judeo-Christian principles.  If you have some other authority for marriage you should cite it specifically and show where CONGRESS legislated it into law.  But you can't because there is no such authority.  America is a nation of laws, You can't just make stuff up with nothing to back it up.  All persons, except two, who ever existed since the beginning of time has a biological mother and a biological father.  Zero persons have been born from homosexuality, ever.
Hmm.  Sandy Hook Elementary School - children murdered by a heavily armed white guy. Murders at a Sikh Temple in Wisconsin by a racist white guy who couldn't tell Sikhs from Muslims. Murders at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado by a "Christian" anti-abortion white guy.   Murder of 9 blacks in a church in North Carolina by a white kid proving "white supremecists" are anything but. Murder of 3 people at random at a Jewish community center and retirement home in Overland Park by a new-Nazi who'd been active in the Klan.
Buddhists three poison:  anger, greed, and pride.
US laws can't protect school children, college student, shoppers, diners, movie-goers. The deranged have targeted gay people throughout history. Harvey Milk, Roxanne Ellis and Michelle Abdill, Matthew Shepard. In 1973, thirty two people died as a result of arson in a gay night club in New Orleans. The gayness factor didn't make the news then. It appears that Mateen, as others have been, was driven by his hatred of gays. There always has been some hatred-fueled act of violence against some group perceived to be a threat: witches, pagans, indigenous people, Jews, homeless, the ex-wife's family. Where do people develop such a deep seated loathing?
You are right about the irony, but do not confuse refugee camps and blockades with extermination camps.  Also, it is Israel and not "Jews."  It is a complicated issue that needs to be addressed for sure, but the bottom line is that Nazism is deplorable in any form and it cannot be tolerated.  Our President needs to say that.  Talk about a low standard of morality....
" I never implied there were not."  Actually that's exactly what you implied, or rather what you stated emphatically:  "We are not a society shaped by Islam or Buddhist or Shintoism or Confucianism."  And that 7 day week you say we got from the Romans? Actually it's from the Babylonians. they also had a lot of influence in the creation of the calendar, along with the Egyptians. And as you know, many of our holidays and traditions are of pagan origin and our "roman" language? Actually Germanic in origin. But I digress.  No one, certainly not me, is advocating we get rid of any of these no matter what their origin. I don't  know why you think I am. In fact I'm pointing out that there are numerous religious aspects to our society and that we're not as secular as some seem to think and thus that's not an effective argument against letting students use a classroom
An interesting note...according to Jewish tradition in the time of JC, to be a rabbi (which apparently he was) you had to be married.
3. When the world did not end, the inadequacies of Mark's narrative became obvious and a more detailed explanation became necessary, answering questions about his origins, his teaching, his relationship to the Law, and especially why he was rejected by the Jewish authorities and died at the hands of Romans. If we read the passion and resurrection narratives of the Synoptics side-by-side, we see that the passion accounts don't different much, while the resurrection accounts appear to be written by people seeking answers and struggling to understand what they're describing.   4. By the time Luke-Acts is written, the author -- also a companion of Paul? -- sees the need for an account that weaves the Jesus story into the mission and he composes his two-book sequence with Paul as a Christ figure. In my view, the existence of three Synoptic accounts derives not from multi-cultural origins, but from a need to answer questions posed by people who demanded answers. (out of space again....)
Funny, when I was in Asia, I noticed all the characters in Asian television series were Asian...! Indians in India, Japanese in Japan, Chinese in China...although all those countries have had white people living there for centuries...  There were series in India based on Hindu mythology, and series in China based on Chinese history, and series in Japan about samurais, and not much about western mythology or western history...you pretty much needed satellite to get western tv or movies. Same with movies, local ones are based on local culture.  In China, taxi drivers often refuse to take westerners, and in many non-white countries, white people are assumed to be tourists, although westerners have been living there for centuries.  So in countries of European culture, white people are well established in the country's institutions, and a cosmopolitan but basically European-based culture is considered "the mainstream", and that's somehow wrong?  Gimme a break!
Racism is political by nature. Apparently you missed the cartoon propaganda in Egypt before the Six Day War showing the Jews  with caricature ugly looks and  hooked noses, being pushed into the Sea, and other more recent Hamas propaganda.   Obviously, not all Arabs are racist against Jews , but it would be naive to dismiss it as a factor.  Likewise , there is no doubt an element of Jewish anti-Arab racism in the mix.
Or Orthodox Jewish synagogues where men and women sit separately or is your prejudice limited to one group?
Most of the push back in Peel comes from the Hindus and Sikhs. Unlike westerners they know what they're dealing with.
Arabs in all walks of life in Israel   "Arabs are employed by and receive service at all government offices, study at all universities, including 800 Arab students at Ariel University in Samaria, are found in the legal system as judges, serve as IDF officers and soldiers, serve as members of the Israeli Knesset, and in general, are all well established in all walks of life in Israel."

Harry, Evidently you don't remember the Nazi Brown Shirts of the 1930's who were encouraged by the government to persecute Jews and other minorities.  Don't look now, but they were back in Charlottesville yesterday and feeling validated by Trumpet's lack of action.
My wife called me a Jew and I am a Jew. I really am Jewish. But in Hawai'i its called Pake. She's Korean you'd think she'd call me a Pake. As Pake as I am I ok'd my wife to have a private jet.  We are looking at Express 8000 or ACJ-350 or both.  I am ok'ing to pay the crews for full time plus benefits with mandatory flight training and time. Secrecy our biggest demand. And fealthy. I make 800k a day and I spread my wealth. Or is it 800 mil. You get the point. Where to house the aircraft is the biggest question. Korea, Japan, or China..., and I'm a combat pilot.
"Many Catholics who are very conservative and economically prosperous are very happy that the Catholic bishops give priority to the life issues of abortion and euthanasia. This allows them in good conscience to vote for conservative politicians who claim that these issues are a priority for them. The problem with this, however, is that these conservative politicians are not that interested in promoting the common good."  Many of these Catholics don't believe or want the common good.  Instead they call people who work for the common good "do gooders" as if that is a horrible insult.  They have taken the atheist/materialist Ayn Rand's philosophy and call it Catholic.
69er!!! Yes nothing to do with Terrorist  launching missiles at Israel  and using it own people as human shields.  Their  is simply nothing more barbaric or cowardly, regardless of your grievance!!!! One must muse how desperate the Marxist has become, the attempts to rationalize the barbarians at Isreals gates truly shows their maddnes. Simply put their is nothing Israel can do , given Hamas is  funded by Iran and has death to all Jews in their charter diplomacy is a waste of time.
That was simply an excuse... The average German soldier will claim they never fought to exterminate the Jews....
Indeed, but I see nothing to admire in the persistence of the Jewish people* who are now trying to eradicate Palestinians from disputed lands - all the while lying that they are doing otherwise.  * And it's not all Jewish people - Netanyahu represents an extreme right government allied with orthodox religious nutters and there are MANY Jews on the left and in the middle who do not agree with the policies and lies of Netanyahu.
Antisemitism was prevalent in Eastern Europe once upon a time (Poland, Ukraine, Russia, etc.). Heck. The Catholic Church absolved the Jews of deicide only in 1964.
I suggest to you that the point you are missing is the hypocrisy, which equates with dishonesty, of the opposition to the idea of  one population having to be disrupted to accommodate the right to self determination of another population, when they very people who oppose it were happy to accept and advocate for such disruption on a much larger scale when their own right to self determination was being accommodated.  The justice is that the Muslim world was all in favour of the disruption in 1947 of millions of Hindus and Sikhs, and therefore it is just that they accept the much smaller disruption to accommodate the Jewish right to self determination in the Middle East.
Maybe he is a neo-nazi. Is the homeless man he falsely accused Jewish? Strangely enough, I feel a little better knowing that this is a hoax and that there really isn't a mentally ill homeless person running around stabbing hallucinations.
Yah, sorry. It's not about laws and the Constitution blah blah... it never was for Trump supporters. You said it yourself. It's about VALUES and keeping those out that don't conform to your white Judeo Christian desire.
Actually they still see themselves as Mexicans. At the rallies they wave Mexican flags in Mexican pride demanding to stay in America.  They are decidedly not like the Italians and Russian Jews arriving in New York, waving the American flag when they first see the Statue of Liberty.
Sheikh Muhammad bin Musa Al Nasr in the Dar Al-Arqam Mosque in Montreal in March of this year delivered a sermon in which he asks for Jews to be killed. The CBC obtained a tape of it and had two translators verify what he said. No charges have been laid. Now, do you think if I said about muslims what he said about Jews I wouldn't be charged with a "hate" crime? I'll wait for your response as to why he hasn't been charged yet I would.
Looking at your list, every one of those in your threat question as well as the gays are specifically mentioned in the Bible as being fair game except for the Jews and they wrote the Book.    The Christians definitely made up for it later as far as the Jews are concerned, though.  Couple thousand years of  history doesn't disappear very quickly.
Correct, most Jews of European descent are not Semites. Anti-zionism is the most accurate term and naturally some have a political interest in broadening that to a larger group.
Jerry, this is utterly false. Arabs have no freedoms in ZIONIST ISRAEL. You must be a troll. I have been to ISRAEL/ Palestine. Israel illegally settles on seized Arab land, shoots and terrorizes childrens, walls off cities such as Bethlehem,,denying GAZA women with breast cancer treatment in ISRAEL occupied hospitals. ChristianPeacemaker teams posted Dec. 6-12 photos of intimidations of Arabs in the old city, Jewish settlers arrogant actions on Palestinian farms, routine home invasions. In Hebron CHRISTIAN Peacemakers walk Palestinian children to school to try to protect from IDF harassment. Tulsi please don't fund these Israeli terrorists! The latest is ISRAEL,removing CHRISTIAN & Muslim names from holy sites.Mitri Raheb presentation at National Press Club YOUTUBE.COM
"Closing schools on Saturdays and Sundays, the religious holidays of Christmas and Easter, a legal and moral system based at least partly on Christianity. There are others. Christianity is one of the pillars of Western Civilization."  Even to me, an atheist, the reduction of Christianity and its influence to two holidays and a couple of slogans is pathetically sad. It's so telling that nothing--nothing!--remains of Christianity in Canada's public life other than what you've presented.  Where's the Holy Trinity? The Eucharist? The Incarnation? Hypostatic Union? The Virgin Birth? Salvation? Sin? Saints? Miracles? Sacraments? Theology? Perichoresis? The Resurrection? The Eschaton? Repentance? Humility? Chastity? Modesty? Constant prayer? Mysticism? All that doctrinal stuff is far more Christian than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny, but all that stuff is openly mocked.  Abortion. Christian? Same sex marriage. Christian? Divorce. Christian? Premarital sex? Christian?
We have existing anti-hate laws that protect us. Do we need a motion that looks into crimes against each group to come up with an action plan? Imagine separate motions for each group.... Jews, Christians, Blacks, Latinos, Muslims, Native Canadians, etc. It might make some people feel good - unless you are a group left out.  All Canadians support a free and tolerant society and would welcome a renewed effort by the government to find ways to improve it.   So let's put petty politics aside and put an inclusive motion before Parliament and get on with it.
No, political Islam is trying to force Muslim children into a clique separate from the other kids in the school. Where they can be forced to conform to be members of the Muslim, not secular, community.
Does Islamaphobia include critical analysis of Islam, religious satire, and comedy? Does Islamaphobia include criticism of political Islam, sharia law, and the human rights records of countries governed by Islamic law. Is it Islamaphobic to criticize the misogyny and gender segregation prevalent in countries governed by Islamic law or is it simply a function of cultural relativism (Iran's morality police beating girls for not covering their hair, Saudi's ban on women driving). Finally, why not also condemn anti-semitism in the some motion, it is more prevalent in Canada. Is there a reason why Islam should be afforded a higher sensitivity compared to other religions? Is Islam beyond reproach? South Park can make fun of Christians and Jews all day long but Islam is a sacred cow? Does Canada's Charter not cover religious discrimination?
But the Acts of the Apostles was written by Luke--who was not even a Jew.  He was a Greek convert.  God and God alone is the judge of Judas.  BTW---I am Catholic.
I did not know much about Steve Bannon so I decided to research the issue.  What I found was allegations without proof from the likes Nancy Pelosi, and other far left loonies. Anderson Cooper clearly called out Elizabeth Warren for making such allegations without proof.  Bannon clearly espouses conservative values, many of which I agree with so does this make me a White Supremacist as well? I read  an article written by former Jewish employees who flatly denied any anti-semitic  actions or beliefs. I was unable to find any actual evidence to show him to be a White Supremacist.    I find it ironic that Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, who actually attended KKK rallies according to her own book, as well as professed the need to eliminate undesirables from the population by abortion,  forced sterilization  and contraception is hailed as a hero from the liberal establishment.  Who do you think those undesirables actually were?
Canada has a history of socialism and Marxism. For 150 years it has been the same. The missionaries came to Canada to populate the country with Christians. The settlers who were released from prison in Europe with the agreement they would change, become good Christians and live in Canada. - What has changed since 150 years ago? Nothing. They are still trying to push Marxism on natives, on new and old immigrants. They everyone should be the same and Christian (but they do recognize the Jews and Muslims as equal.) It is a caste system. - Canada continues to enslaves the natives with socialism. The right thing to do is free them, once and for all, but giving them their own land, their own country. Let them have their own government, laws and let them solve their own problems.
Right.  Kinda hard to tell the difference between Christian and Atheist fundamentalists without a score-card when they pretty much talk and act the same toward anyone who doesn't share their beliefs.  Of course if you dispute this, you're welcome to 'educate' me concerning Stalin's Mao's, or Pol Pot's religions, or try and explain away their more recent ideological heirs like Sam Harris' foaming at the mouth at the thought of inflicting nuclear immolation on millions of folks like me in the name of 'no God'.  I'll try to keep a straight face while you do.
The below got flagged, but why? Come on, spit it out. Why did some of you flag this? What CC rule did I break?  "Many Christians are worshiping the little god of their own creation, one that they have control over. "Name it and claim it" and "Standing on the promises" are but two examples of trying to "work the Man", control God. "In Jesus' Name" is invoked like a magic charm, little different than invoking earth spirits.  Few want to acknowledge that there is a real Creator, who won't ever dance to their tunes. Atheists and agnostics are not alone in their rejection of the living God, many Christians are rejecting the real God, and embracing an ineffectual replica.  But, after all, they do have the right to join whichever social club they chose. And the right to support preachers with "ticklish ears". They also have the legal right to bring disrespect upon the "Gospel", by claiming to follow Jesus' teachings, while living a life to the contrary.  "They shall be known by their fruits!"
RD, no doubt people like yourself said the same thing when Jews tried to flee the Third Reich.
Vote , Shay Chan Hodges she will stand, fight and yes really serve ALL the people of Hawaii.  Vote, Tulsi Gabbard and you will get the self centered, egotistical manipulative claws of her guru Butler through his devoted puppet Gabbard. Be careful Hawaii...he is a dangerous man, a criminal not to be trusted  Tulsi Gabbard’s guru Chris Butler has grand aspirations to get one of his Hare Krsna disciples to become President one day. With over 40 years of meddling in Hawaiian politics from 70’s- Independents to Godly Govt, 90’s -disciple Rick Reed (Krsna das) , Maui-  Wayne Nishiki , 90’s-disciple Mike Gabbard ( Krsna Katha das), Tulsi Gabbard ( born in cult since birth) is the closest he has come to realizing his goal.  And to the Butler zealots out there. Butler has no place in our political system. His religion should be only to the individuals choosing to be beholden to him, no-one else. Hindus' since when didi Butler  start referring himself as a hindu- monetary gain, power... perhaps.
"Used a Weapon built by the STOLEN GERMAN SCIENTISTS"?! As the director of the Manhattan Project was a Jew with many of the senior scientists being Jews that escaped Nazi persecution, your comment has to be one of the most puerile US-bashing pieces of fake news posted here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer#Early_life  As for "Atrocity made in the U.S of A" Canada was very involved in the A-bomb project with senior Canadian scientists working on the Bomb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Christy,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Slotin  In the Quebec Agreement of 1943, Canada joined the Manhattan Project and signed off on the use of the Bomb against "3rd parties" (i.e. Japan): http://www.ccnr.org/uranium_in_bombs.html#cpc   As for “Japanese innocence” Google “The 3 Alls, “The Rape of Nanking”, “Unit 731, comfort women” , and the Japanese treatment of Allied POWS and see how innocent Imperial Japan was.: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes
Gary, there is little effort in our organized Jewish community to separate Judaism and Zionism and the general public can be forgiven if they confuse the two because the Star of David is prominent on the Israeli flag. You see no chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace or the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network or opposition to discriminatory anti-assimilation outfits like Birthright Israel, heavily promoted by UO's Hillel. Birthright Israel co-founder, Michael Steinhardt professes, "faith in Israel has replaced theology" and this seems to be the case in our own community.  You have never seen our local synagogue host speakers like Rabbi Brant Rosen, once listed in Newsweek as one of the top 25 most influential pulpit rabbis in the U.S., who gave up  "progressive" Zionist positions and now endorses BDS (compares it to the Montgomery Boycott), the Palestinian refugee right of return, and an "Open Hillel."  He wrote a book about his transformation, Wrestling in the Daylight.
I think it is only polite to respond to someone in the terms they assert are important.    Ward I thinks "God" might have an opinion on this issue so I looked up "God"s Holy Word in His Holy Book and found what I believe to be a relevant Direct Quote from "God" on the subject of Burglary in a Dwelling.  From his previous posts, I seriously doubt that Ward I is an atheist, however, he justifies too many of his opinions on the basis of religion;  and I know that I am not.
Trumps visit with the Palestinian leader Abbas was a wasted time just like the presidents before him and any presidents after him they will never get a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.  the late Arafat who was the ruler of the Palestinians said peace for us is the destruction of Israel, Palestinians now want all of Israel to be there's and no Jewish state that is the Palestinians goal, so forget that peace process because it will never happen.
So God hasn't abandoned us and we can of our own volition to return to Him. That doesn't mean we won't reap the consequences of our foolish political decisions and live through a time that that will cause many in the nation to reevaluate their abandonment of God's way of doing things. You know, they say there are no atheists in fox holes and there are fewer atheists in times of economic meltdown, societal fracture and political tyranny. That's coming. The quality of the available candidates tells us that.  So, voting for the lesser of two evils, I'm voting 3rd party. I don't LOVE Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party, but I think he'll do less harm to the country than either Hillary or Trump and the change of principles should do us some good by forcing us to actually think about our choices.  That and the Libertarian Party hasn't been in power, so is less likely to have been bought off yet.  I don't care who people vote for, but it is time to end the two major parties' stranglehold.
Killary was first to cry that maybe Obama was not born in US, since he was raised by his porn star mother in Muslim countries.  Donald Trump's favorite son in law is jewish. His daughter just gave birth to  his grandson who is  also therefore jewish. As for Stephen Bannon, is he racist because he doesn't approve of millions of illegal migrants coming to this country & committing crimes, breeding indiscriminately , and giving the legal taxpaying citizens of this country the bill for it all?  Osamabama should be sending ICE & DEA agents & buses to these riots  , Surround them & only let them out after ID's are checked & searched for drugs. What would the probable cause be you say ? How about rioting, arson, assault , etc. Those are all felonies in most states. In fact you can be sentenced to death for far less in all Muslim countries. I know liberals, nothing anyone says will resonate with you if it's not what you want to hear. Just like a 2 year old who screams & cries to get their way.
If the deli doesn't already have ham on the menu, then no they shouldn't be able to.  In this case, the guy already makes wedding cakes.  As for the clown in Kansas, my bet is that most gay bars would serve them, but the customers would probably make them pretty uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, your analogy falls flat, as ones like this always do.  One that would make more sense is a Muslim guy walking in to a Kosher deli, and the deli owner refusing to serve him on the grounds that he is Muslim.  That however also doesn't work, because even the ultra-orthodox Jews aren't that self righteous.
If you tell me "You can bomb Syria, bomb Libya, or bomb Afghanistan. You must choose one," and I decline to vote does that mean I don't care about bombing innocent people? Every four years the PTB give us the choice of lesser evils. Insider corporate stooges like Wasserman-Schultz and Brazile tilted the field to favor Chillary. Polls showed Sanders would have soundly defeated Drumpf. I voted for the nice Jewish doctor lady, hoping the Greens would get 10% and not be barred from the debates next time, but it increasingly looks likely there won't be one.
Interestingly, the first singling out and restrictions against Jews and Jewish travel took place in Austria during the Anschluss, the political connection, union, between Germany and Austria, not in Germany.   Austrian Jews while well integrated into Austrian life were still identifiable. They were the first to be denied visas, to become refugees. In this time of emerging fascism, help came from Germans and German Jews.  The Nazi went after German Jews and Aryan Germans later.
And Trump has an Orthodox Jewish son-in-law and a daughter who converted to Judaism to marry him.
Facts continued,   The over 1.8 Billion Muslims Worldwide determine what Islam is or is not, not the minority Millions living at the U.S. , Europe, or other Nations.  Why Muslims cannot assimilate like the Japanese Immigrants did,  Muslim definition by Muslims, Islamic Believer completely subjugated to Islam, "Islam Is All", All Politics, Laws, Religion, Culture, History, Ways of Life, that supersede the politics, laws, religions, cultures, history, ways of life of all other Nations, Countries.  Therefore as Ordered by Islamic Laws the Muslims Must have Islam supersede "Western Civilization and Culture".   The Holy Koran and Hadith are Modern Law for Muslims.  "Collaborators to the Christians, Jews and Unbelievers must die a horrible murdering to dwell in that firey place".  "The God and Prophets of the Christians and Jews are False.  They must be made to see this, they must become Subjugated to Islam"  Mandatory Islamic Tithes to Support & Fund the Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam.
Jews belong to a REFORMED religion that espouses LOVE. Worshippers are not separated by gender, are inclusive with their country, acknowledge the supremacy of their nations laws and don't preach hate against others.
The Scouts respond..."we are an inclusive group regardless of Politics, Religion, Gender, and Race."      This is a lie. Atheists are not allowed to be Scouts. This is an organization of bigots.
Funny you should say that.  Adolf Hitler was perhaps one of the first "animal rights activists".  In 1933 his government promulgated the most comprehensive animal protection laws ever seen in any western nation.  Medical research on animals was prohibited, and per Hitler's view unnecessary.  He had plenty of Jews and Gypsies on which to experiment.  Amazing how much the "animal welfare/animal rights/no-kill" extremists have in common with the Nazis.  Scratch any so-called "animal rights" extremist and a white supremacist pops out like pus from a boil.  Cat-fanatics hurled racial epithets and arson threats as a black family in August, GA for calling animal control to remove "colony" cats from their business property.  Priscilla Feral "Friends of Animals" reviled Native Alaskans for hunting seals, and whale advocate John Hargrove probably holds the record for the most 'N'-words in one drunken rant.  These twisted individuals care more about animals than about people.  Just like Hitler.
Similarly, by your logic Hitler was innocent:  I will hand you $100 in cash if you can point out any time Hitler actually forced Jews and Gypsies and Gays into gas chambers.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGAdrQ2RpdM
Got a book with photos, transliteration and translation of every known scroll, from the original microfilm photos at Long Beach University which caused all those priests sittin' on 'em to shriek and flail when they were released.  A dear brother-in-faith who made the first Samoan translation of Qu'ran has my copy; loaned it to him, but haven't been able to contact him for a while.  A LOT on significant material; one not getting much airplay is that the Scrolls settled a millenium-old dispute between Christians and Jews as to whether the Masoretic or the Septuagint text of Isaiah was the original (they're not the same), and both groups accused the other of fabrication and tampering with the text.  Thanks to the Qum'ran copy of Isaiah--the oldest--the Jews won that argument.  The Masoretic is the original.  Christians not happy about that 'cause the Masoretic text LACKS the 'God with us' verses they used to bolster Trinitarian dogma--was added to the Septuagint version after-the-fact.
Not at all Rodney - I am suggesting that these so called priests, exactly became priests, because it will afford them the freedom and luxury to be paedophiles at will or use and abuse women.  They certainly did not do this IN the name of Christ - but they used it to commit their crimes.  Does that make God evil or man evil? It is disgusting what has happened throughout the centuries under the banner of religion (mainly under RC rule) But please lets be fair, what about  Communism (an atheist ideology) who wiped out MILLIONS of people, imprisoned, tortured because of their religion & non-compliance to(atheist) ideology. But this is always conveniently forgotten! Do you even know what is happening in places like North Korea, India and many other Muslim & secular countries right now?  CHRISTIANS & other non-compliants are being persecuted, killed, jailed & tortured daily! Read the Red Holocaust - 60M+ people killed by Marxism, that exclude the rapes and other atrocities!
I've considered (and attended services) of Catholic, Lutheran, Episcopalian, Unitarian, Baptist (at least four kinds) , Jehovah Witness, LDS, Church of Christ, Church of the Nazarene, and several other Christian denominations whose names I do not recall.  I've studied a little of the theology and beliefs of Judaism,  Zen Buddhist, Tantric Yoga, Muslim (Sunni, Shi'a and Sufi), and Hindu faiths.    None of that journey showed me that "all spiritual roads lead to Jesus".
swimmer You are right. Jews and Arabs do not belong together. Palestine is surrounded by Arabs so Jews do not belong there. Common sense. Not rights.
Lemme see, $38 billion over 10 years to Israel on top of the $6-8 billion we already send them each year to fund their government run health insurance program and weaponry to keep the Palestinians lockedup and subjugated while the jews colonize stolen lands and develop stolen natural gas fields a la manifest destiny. Along with the billions more going to all the countries we are bribing to allow Washingtons corporate masters to go in and steal their resources in the grand terrorism creating colonial policies dating back to past the Imperial Roman Empire. And we fight each other over whatever crumbs our corrupt scumbags in Washington leave us after lifetimes of contributing our tax dollars
Well, now you have met -- in print, at least -- an atheist who attests that she formulated her atheistic belief at age eleven, when she didn't know so much about science and the scientific method, in a simple "aha!" moment of realization that the statement that "you don't get to go to heaven unless you believe as I do" was an obviously unprovable and ignoble scam.  If my sense it was unprovable leads you straight to the assertion I was acting "in accord with our contemporary scientific understanding of the universe" and should thus be an agnostic, not an atheist, I would point out that notions of rationality and irrationality are not exclusive to the scientific method or worldview. Proof? People were being "proven" evil and killed for it long before the scientific method was formulated. And there have been atheists for many millennia; there is certainly no "clear and undeniable linkage between atheism and contemporary science and methodology".
I've traveled 186,000 plus kilometers in the last fifteen years.  Like all Canadians who travel as much, we see the world differently.  Lining up to board a flight at any major airport around the world, there are people from many countries. Muslims rub shoulders with Christians who rub shoulders with Jews who rub shoulders with Buddhists, Sikhs, and people of intense spirituality and faith and people of no faith.  Fundamentalism, racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and hate must be rooted out. Disrespectful people like Drumpf and Leach  don't rule goodness. Quite the opposite.  The repulsive behaviour in this horrifying (think of the children) does not reflect (are you listening Kellie) Canadian values.
... lifelong atheist ... don't u have an alter boy to touch
Well, well, well.  That 47 percenter has no Mormon values after all.  Doesn't surprise me that Romney has no qualms with shaking hands with the anti-Christ.
"to demonstrate that our Christian heritage is so ingrained into our culture that we don't even notice it anymore. But it's intellectually dishonest to ignore how our society evolved to accommodate Christian worship. "  That is a strange claim. It is Progressives who refuse to accept this is a society based on 2000 years of Christianity, or consider it a shameful thing that it is. Of course it is, what else would it be based on, and what  is wrong with that?  I may not be religious, but I acknowledge that I inherited a culture shaped mostly by those 2000 years of Judeo-Christianity, as well as Greek and Roman  influences. We are not a society shaped by Islam or Buddhist or Shintoism or Confucianism. That is my cultural heritage, and that of my country, and anyone choosing to come here and join this society should be aware of that and ready to accept that reality, too.
Somewhere, I have the 6/5/81 bulletin carrying the first, tentative recognition by the Centers for Disease Control of  unexplained rare diseases affecting gay men. It documented four cases of pneumocyctis carinii pneunomia (PCP) in Los Angeles. It also noted numerous cases in California and New York, of Kaposi's Sarcoma, an aggressive skin cancer usually found only among Jewish men of Mediterranean extraction. The first name for it was Gay-Related Immune Deficiency (GRID) but one of the first cases identified was of a nun in S.F. who got it via transfusion. The first victim whom I knew personally was of an old friend who acquired it during a hip transplant in Monterey Peninsula Hospital. She became an AIDS activist, living until 1991. Reagan pointedly ignored the crisis, never even mentioning the word until doing so briefly near the end of his term. "Patient Zero" did actually exist, spreading the disease widely where he flew as a flight attendant, though he wasn't the first of course.
Seriously? Atheism is a belief system because it's a belief system? Or, atheism is a belief system because our disbelief is science based? Those responses offer absolutely no evidence that atheism is a belief system. You are just typing word salad in a futile attempt to explain an unsupportable opinion. Let it go.
You support both Burke and Paprocki when they make homophobic statements, so saying that you support homophobia clearly follows.  "I support Hitler when he speaks about Jews, but I am not an antisemite." That's the same sort of reasoning.  No, Pandora, I simply do not believe you when you say you are not homophobic. Your own words show that, in fact, you are.
In Jewish life, if a man gave his wife a writ of divorce---most women didn't have the opportunity to be re-married.  Jewish men, on the other hand, often re-married.  Women who were Greek or Roman----did have the opportunity to re-marry.  Study the history and culture of the times.
So Hitler wasn't anti Jewish because he didn't kill all the jews?
I find it really bizarre that some moderator determined that my comment somehow did not meet "civility standards."  No person was personally attacked, I was just insensitive to opposing views.  That's not uncivil, and rational discourse is impossible without attacking bad ideas.  I'm not sensitive to the views of racists either, but that doesn't mean I'm "uncivil."  Of course I attack views that I find unintelligent and irrational.  I'm guessing that making fun of creation stories like the Kumulipo, Aborigine creation myths, or Noah's Ark is somehow "uncivil."  I'd like some clarification on the rule of "civility."  Which "kinds" of views are we allowed to make fun of?  Which "kinds" of views do we need to treat seriously with respect?  I don't get it and that's not clear to me at all.    For example, Angela Kaaihue's view that most politicians are Buddhists.  That's objectively false.  Am I allowed to make fun of that or do I need to treat an objectively false view seriously?
Reagan called for the destruction of the USSR, the Evil Empire. Doesn't mean anything.  You have to judge people by what they do, not what they say. European leaders in the 1930s actively encouraged anti-semitism. Many of them helped the Nazis to catch Jews and send them to concentration camps.
Trump and his Jewish son in law will never give the Palestinians an even footing. Allie is right on this one.
Growing up in a predominately French Catholic community, I can say some of the most intolerant uncaring people I have met were also deeply religious. For an atheist such behaviour has no excuse, yet for the religious a few prayers can cleanse them of their misjudgements.
If I were to say that I would not be telling the truth. I know nothing about that young person-I would hope with all of my heart that he is in Heaven for, "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not PERISH but have everlasting life." Yet many will perish because they think that their good works can outweigh their bad works or they think that going to church twice a year makes them Christian. Or maybe they got saved when they were younger and thought they had a "lifetime membership."  Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.  (John 8:31-32 KJV)  He is looking for disciples  not believers...the devils believe-and tremble. We have an appointment with death  (Hebrews 9:27) and we will be on time. There is One who conquered death and He is Lord. There is salvation in NO other name but Jesus Christ.
Chris in H'Ottawa Are you smoking some that Trudeau mary jane.  I am Jewish and Trump has nothing to do with this.  Liberals always try and blame someone else.
Where you and I separate is on the basic question.    You, like Iran and several others who post don't believe that Israel has the right to exist.  I believe that they have the exact same right to exist as the United States of America.  They fought and died to take it away from its rightful owners.  In our case, we committed Treason against our sworn King because of our dissatisfaction with his economic policies.  We then decimated the native population to keep it.  They did it after centuries of pograms against the Jews by everyone in virtually every European country from the Inquisition through the Holocaust.    'Land for Peace' was tried.  Giving up Gaza only made for a larger and more concentrated area for their enemies to launch rocket and other attacks against them.   Israel will give back the West Bank at about the same time the citizens of the original 13 colonies give back the land they stole from the native Americans,  King George and the Loyalists sent to Canada and England.
Communism is also a form of populism. And communist dictators killed far more people in the 20th century than even the fascist dictators did. If the Church leaders now fully embrace liberalism in all ways, including atheist communism/socialism and anti-Jesus Islam - then what is left?  Why should any of us bother attending Mass weekly and give our offerings? Socialism and worldwide "progressivism" will feed all the poor - at least their bodies - but what of their spirit? Their souls? How are all the Venezuelans now doing under that progressive regime?  Apparently imposed socialism doesn't actually even feed the people very well at all. Surely the Papacy is sending them millions of tons of food now. Right? Sell a few paintings off  -  unfortunately an anti-Catholic criticism all too easily for some to make.
And this isn't my grandfather's America, willing to be led by the nose through the horrors of the Middle East by Israel's right wing t0 Armageddon. Well, I'm not.   If there is to be a one state solution then Israel's apartheid behavior needs to be admitted, and the US needs to stop supporting it until it does what the racist South African government did to end their own international sanctions...one person, one vote. If there is to be a one state solution America needs to admit that Zionism, the idea that Israel is a Jewish supremacist nation, is racism and not deserving of support.  If I were boss, I would just let all participants know America is tired of being the grown-up, and without a solution we are going away with our bombs and our money and they can figure it out on their own. The war and the apartheid will never, NEVER, end until we do that.  Israel has hundreds of atomic weapons of mass destruction aimed straight at Iran. I think they will be fine.

If Cory knew what HE was, he would know that white supremacists etc. are not and never were part of the "conservative base". They reject the Judeo-Christian heritage that conservatives consider to be the foundation for our excellent western civilization. They deny the inherent and essential equality of "all men" explicit in America’s founding political philosophy. Cory accepts it when leftist like Tapper PUT these clowns in HIS base and hysterically argues his difference. The slander is ridiculous on it's face and should be disposed of as such.
What's truly hilarious is that you hysterically gabble about "Shari'a", but you couldn't provide ONE authentic Shari'a tenet or ruling if your life depended on it.  You're kind of a religious analogy to "chicken-little."  Fact is, Shari'a doesn't APPLY to non-Muslims.  How do I know?  Because the first Shari'a document ("constitution" if you will) for the fledgling Nation of Islam at Al-Medina specified that Christians and Jews living in and under the protection of that State were free to practice their own religion and WERE TO BE JUDGED BY THEIR OWN LAWS.  I supposed you could complain that we're "discriminating" against you by not forcing you to abide by Shari'a.  Hate it for ya.
It shows up independently elsewhere, for example among the Jews of the Old Testament, under the names of things like "God's plan", "God's plan for mankind", and so on.  Much like Catholics, they believed humans are capable of discerning the difference between good and evil because they have a conscience, which God informs.  Pope Francis has stood firm on every teaching based on natural law.
[Continued from above] Finally the piece that I originally included on this topic [about the 'woman priest' in a Zurich deanary] is a part of Chapter 8 "The Hidden Women Priests" by Marco Politi in his book POPE FRANCIS AMONG THE WOLVES [New York: Columbia University Press, 2014] pp. 90-93.  This chapter is partially the story of Monika Schmid, of Effretikon, Switzerland, who is the Gemeindebeauftragte [individual placed in charge of the parish].  She studied religious pedagogy, theology at Luzern [Switz.] and Salzburg [Austria].  She was currently studying interreligious spiritual theology, based on points of contact between Christianity, Jewish mysticism, and Islam.  It's the case, also, historically, that in Switzerland the parish community engages [and pays] its curate.  No Church taxes---they hire, they pay and they can fire. As Politi states, at Monika's parish they only have Mass on Christmas, Easter and twice a month.  For the other 250 days a year, Monika's the PRIEST.
Truth, Absolutely NOT. Not when those precepts are hooked up with the violations of the laws of God (Ten Commandments) and the teachings of Jesus Christ.  One can easily argue that the church ended it's covenant with God and Christ from the very beginning when it adopted it's hatred and grave disparagement of the Jews and of women. And certainly in the fourth century when it was seduced by Satan and his entreaties of 'earthly power'.  I am certain our college priest professors would think the same, because that IS what they taught us.   Namely, that one cannot use ignoble(evil) means to achieve ones goals. The ends does not justify the means.  Sorry, but I cannot see any way around that precept of Catholic philosophy no matter how much I try to believe in favor of the church.  Earthly power has corrupted the church.
You forget that Moses' Jews were not the first to entered that area. Jewish slaves of Egypt which Moses freed were all from Judah and Israel area. And there were Jewish people still living in that part of the world. The Arabs you speak of....are probably ancient Jews themselves as they are both Semitic people. Berber people lives in North Africa....not the Middle East. They were North African people before the arrival of Arabic people who took over their lands and converted them. In the ancient period, key Berber power were the Numidian people who played an important part in the Punic Wars. Simple fact is, Jewish people have inhabited that region since the dawn of history. Often they were the minority in their own homeland. But they never left it.
Brilliant reply. It is racist to say that 96% of African slaves ended up in the Caribbean and South America?  It just shows how insecure the professional victim class is in this country.  I applaud people from all races who aren't perpetual victims.  Native Americans have had it the worst.  There isn't even a close second.  Jews rebounded from true genocide.  Japanese Americans thrived after internment.  There are success stories from all races.  I'd rather spit out more about them.  Do you have some examples from the black community as a whole that you would like to share?
While hurtful acts against Muslims may be on the increase the number still pales in comparison to acts against other groups especially anti-semitic acts against Jews. Maybe the rate of increase is higher for Muslims but the absolute number is significantly higher against Jews. For that reason M-103 is misguided. The Conservatives' approach of making for an inclusive gesture is better. It doesn't raise one group's concerns above any other group.
oh please, m taggert: generations now have been taught the religion of evolution-that life is meaningless and there is neither god nor right or wrong. the majority of homes don't attend any type of religious service- less than 25% in 2005. so blame the agnostics, blame the atheists, blame the aclu- but you can't blame the faithful. and while you're at it, blame the parents that are incapable of holding their families together- or should we say, unwilling. broken homes are a leading cause of emotional and mental distress in children. and don't forget the continual stress of lack of sleep because teens go to bed late, but are expected to rise early and attend schools because catering to their natural bio-rhythms is considered weak and inconvenient. a fatal cocktail. depression? why not. seems like a normal reaction to a totally unhappy life.
RD, you raise, as usual, a false dichotomy.  The last SJ rally I was at there were all manner of people: female, male, heterosexual, homosexual, African, Caucasian, Asian, Native American, immigrant, native born, Protestants, Catholics, Orthodox, Jews, Muslims, Nones.  Many of them had infants and toddlers.   They change diapers AND righteously protest injustice.
Canada has Christian cultural inheritance that has led to many developments, like schools being closed on Sundays or holidays occurring on certain days of the year.  Even an atheist can appreciate this cultural legacy as something good and something that should be preserved.
NUKE the Rothschild-Bauer FORCED occupation of Israel. Talmudic infant killing blood drinking Jews created the Democrat, Socialist, Communist, and Liberal all to destabilise nations. Now we have Jew funded factions like Antifa'g popping up all over America. The Jews primary enemy has become the Moslem! Jews demoralised America over the last 100 years with Satanic Qabalist Hollywood. They RAPE our children. Their music "industry" screams modern slavery. Besides this TRUTH.... Why fight JEW Battles? Whites and Blacks usually get along... The Crypto-Jews ran the transatlantic slave trade. So why are White non-slave owner Americans in 2017 under attack? One answer.... Devious Evil JEWS.  Don't be fooled.... I am a Jewish anti-semite. I like being an anti-semite. When you study Jewish history for 47 years like I have you KNOW damn well who the enemy of humanity is. I am Judeo-Christian. I am on the right side. All blessings be to Jesus Christ and G🕍d!! #AmericaFirst #SimonOfTrentsRevenge
For example, the UK where more than 50% are now openly atheist. Thirty years ago that was about 20%.  Atheism is beating Islam easily.
That's ridiculous.  You can't have various interpretations of atheism.  You are either atheist, or you aren't.  There is already another name for people who aren't neither atheist or theists....it is called agnosticism.
In fact if you were to go back to class you would find out that islam attempted to take Europe first - but then again most folks are always looking to excuse islam and nail Christianity to the cross - no pun intended. Apologists abound.
More question begging.  Your post is true--if one accepts the principles of liberal, secular, atheistic, humanism.  I do not accept those premises uncritically.  I am not one to jump on the bandwagon because everyone else is doing it. I evaluate claims before I accept them, regardless of their popularity or trendiness.
Thomas Friedman, the world famous Jewish-American columnist, said that if all the European Jews had been living in Arab lands in the 20th century, there would be 6 million more of them alive.
Most Secular Canadians are not Atheists, Agnostics, or Free Thinkers. They just don't have any reason to believe in Superstition. After all, it is unreasonable for someone with a modern education to believe in Supernatural Beings, Powers and After Life Insurance Scams.
HHM M:  You, quite obviously are well-informed on this issue.  My knowledge is shallow, but I really feel conflicted on the State of Israel and the systemic discrimination of Israeli culture.  It seems to be one of those situations with, quite literally, no good answer available.  Some "two-state" compromise seems to just further and further from the realm of possibilities.  We're seeing further settlement development in the occupied territories which, as I can only see it, each day makes anything resembling a solution more impossible. Simplistically, I think the real "mistake" was made 70 years ago by founding the Jewish Homeland in the middle of the Muslim world.  I think taking a good sized chunk of Germany would have made more sense.  Locating it is Palestine was a guarantee of an eternity of turmoil...Given the location, given the hatred on both sides and given the intransigence and the power of the conservative Zionists in Israel, I can't even imagine any great "breakthrough."
These questions also align with Justin's personal beliefs as a devout Catholic.    Additionally, to have a candidate that represents the beliefs of other religious groups such Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists allows a choice and democracy to flourish.
The Rohingya (Muslims) in Rakhine ( Burmese province) have been over taken by a Wahhabi group of "rebels".  These are Islamic extremists known for their belief in forced "conversion" .  The other 135 ethnic sects , Buddhists , Hindus , Christians etc , etc are not happy with the idea of forced conversion , do you blame them . For example , in Syria, the Sunni's , Shia and Christians are united in the Syrian Army fighting the Wahhabi's , known as ISIS and Al Qaeda. The  jihadist "rebels" are using  atrocity and following that up with propaganda to try to create a separate state , then claim a piece of Burma's off-shore oil and gas.  This is well funded , brought to you by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, home of Wahhabi Islam . This latest incident was sparked by the rebels killing 71 Rakine police officers .  Consider if that is how the rebels treat police , how do they treat unarmed civilians .
It seems to me stating Trump as having 'profoundly un-Christian values' is wrong.  Trump's values are uncivil, bullying and contrary to all decency whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim or atheist.  To be a Christian value the value ought to be unique to Christianity...otherwise it is a universal value.
A similar incident was reported last year. A lot was made of the fact the shooter was an Atheist.  In this case , the shooter was a fanatical Christian, but the fact goes unreported in the mainstream media.  And they whine about Christian persecution!
Let's do a before and after shall we?  Before the election...  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau stood by his comments comparing a requirement for Muslim women to remove their face veils during citizenship ceremonies to Canada's rejection of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany. Trudeau was pressed by reporters about accusing the sitting prime minister of fomenting bigotry following the weekly Liberal caucus meeting on Parliament Hill.  -----------------------------  After Quebecs ban...  Trudeau ‘respects’ Quebec for taking position on veil-ban but questions remain  “In Quebec and Canada we are not necessarily used to seeing a woman with a veil,” Trudeau told reporters. “That makes us uncomfortable. We wonder why she is doing that, is she required to do that?  ------------  Why anyone can support this odious little man is beyond rational comprehension.
What about the Canadian governments attempt at genocide when it comes to residential schools. Imagine you are a child of six being torn from your family and then put into one of these schools. How frightened would you be? The pot calling the kettle black. By the way, the Falun Gong is a cult. Li Hongzh is a charlatan who has hijacked traditional Chinese qigong and taiqichuan marshal art practices and usurped Buddhist, Scientology and Christian teachings into a mishmash of half truths.  Half truths are incredibly dangerous. And so is the Falun Gong.
The world's largest Muslim country (Indonesia), by population, has Muslim, Hindu, Christian and Buddhist festivals as public holidays. ------- because of demographics large populations of  Hindu, Christian and Buddhist  Bali is mostly Hindu Chinese (Buddhists and Christians) control the economy
They were made off days to accommodate Christians (Sunday) and Jews (Saturdays) for their religious (Holy-days) to accommodate their prayer rituals.  --------- this country was  founded on Judeo-Christian foundation historical fact it is still Judeo-Christian culturally if not religiously  so it remains Sunday and Saturday off  do you seriously think we should accommodate whoever and drop Sunday and Saturday as holidays?
Yes--if one does not have Faith and reads and understands Church teaching through the lens of the tenants of liberal, secular, atheistic humanism.   Remember: the Faith is foolishness to the world and makes no sense from a wordy perspective. Those who are of the world cannot understand it.  They first have to have Faith.  As long as you continue to uncritically accept the tenants of liberal, secular, atheistic humanism, or otherwise believe what you are told to believe by the liberal establishment and think what you are told to think by the media, you will never understand Catholicism.  Why not at least try looking at liberal, secular, atheism humanism with a critical eye for a change, instead of just assuming it must be correct because it is popular with the elites.
This thread has nothing to to with Jewish journalists and bloggers nor with antisemitism nor with racism. Read the article; it is basically about Laudato Si and ecology. Try and address the issues raised in the article rather than use it as a platform to launch once again your undisguised and irrational prejudice towards President Donald Trump.
tRump needs all the secrecy that he can muster while he loots the nation's capital.  Hitler did the same thing.  Total blackout so he could murder six million Jews and other prisoners, and he got away with it.
Many disagree with your assertion.  See the pictures that are eve n shown at Wikipedia.  The red one regarding Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism and the blue one further down the page showing Jainisim.  See also the picture on the left of the symbol on the Hindu child's head "Hindu child with head shaven and red Swastika painted on it as part of his Upanayana ceremony.  That Hindu child's symbol bends to the right.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika
Trump doesn't need medical breakthroughs. Universal health care will save tens of thousands of lives every year. But since that involves spending tax dollars on health instead of weapons, the Republicans will veto that.  As for the number of dead, remember the Rwandan genocide? Led by Catholics Priests in many places. Srebrenica? Orchestrated by Serbian Christians. Chechnya? Led by Putin and co. The Rohingya? Buddhist monks are doing that.  I have lived in 4 Muslim countries, and understand their siege mentality. The problem is that they don't want to strengthen themselves through education and technology, and prefer to blame foreigners for their woes. Progressive ones like UAE and Qatar show the world that they can have world class cities and companies. So that is the model to be encouraged.
At the height of the Pacifica Forum protests, Marr appeared on local TV trying to look sincere as he denied being a Nazi. He said he was a Buddhist and that he had been terribly misunderstood.  I don't know if this means that he cares what people think of him. Imagine walking around with everyone knowing you're a Nazi.   He may try to rejoin the human race some day, but I'm not sure I'd believe him.
Had something like Hamas existed in his time, Einstein would have rejected both their doctrines and especially their tactics, just as he would have rejected Lehi (aka the Stern Gang).  According to Wikipedia, Lehi defined *itself* as a terrorist group, even before the British weighed in ;-)  Rhetoric aside, wouldn't it have been better if "Jewish state" had been implemented in a way that was more compatible with human rights. As it is, there is a surprising amount of debate within Israel as to who should be, so to speak, in the club.    Final thought:  there is a huge tradition of Jewish atheism, and I can assure you that those people do not define Jewish in religious terms at all.  I think Einstein had it right.
"The racists embrace conservative values like respecting the flag, saying Merry Christmas" Wow, just wow. You have truly lost it. Consider your comments here bookmarked for future reference Do you know why racists want people to say "Merry Christmas"? Because the Klan, the Nazis, and other racists DON'T want to admit there are JEWS in this country! They don't want to admit that Chanukah falls in December. They don't want to admit that Ramadan can fall in December. Well, guess what, Thor? In 2030, 2031, and 2032 Ramadan happens in December again! This whole "war on Christmas" phony baloney began during the 1990s, when Ramadan fell around Christmas time, and some merchants decided to respect their Christian, Jewish, and Muslim customers by saying "Happy Holidays". And the USPS issued Chanukah and Ramadan postage stamps. You and Bill O'Reilly went nuts. So, saying "Happy Holidays" fundamentally changes America? Well, guess what? The USA isn't just for Christians any more.
Hmm so the Jews don't ever say anything about the Holocaust?  I guess not, if Natives want to have a say in what type of education we receive I say this is a good start.  This story is about a step in what could be a positive journey for Natives from this State.  You ma'am are the one who seems to be whining along with Ernie.  Stop being a negative Nancy and start trying to look at the bright side of things.  :)
Hello Dickie Crickets,  Ah yes, the old canard about "labeling people" (roll eyes).  Hey, Mister Crickets, there is nothing wrong with calling someone a Marxist if they are a Marxist, a totalitarian if they are a totalitarian, a monarch if they are a monarch, a felon if they are a felon, a humanitarian if they are a humanitarian, an atheist if they are an atheist, an obstructionist if they are an obstructionist, a Druid if they are a Druid, an enabler if they are an enabler...  ... or an elitist if they are an elitist.  Your comment is in fact a method of silencing, by trying to insist upon what words other people are allowed to use and, should they dare use words to which you object, you shame them as a sort of pariah who would (gasp) label people (roll eyes again). A classic method of silencing o your part.
So what if a Christian bakery refused to bake a cake for a Jewish couple because they don't conform to evangelical beliefs? Should they also be allowed to refuse to bake cakes for Muslim couples, Buddhist couples, or anyone who isn't a card carrying member of their church? Should they be allowed to deny service to women if their church believes that women don't have the right to make decisions? Discrimination is a slippery slope. I wonder how their employees are treated? I'm sure this controversy is very awkward and embarrassing to them. Some of them may have different beliefs and business ethics. It's not fair or legal to discriminate against them either. We have labor laws for good reasons. Nobody likes a bully. Skin heads enjoy threatening and intimidating people. No sane person or boss should expect anyone to deny their own identity and have to pretend that their something or someone they aren't just to get acceptance from their peers. That's how work place violence happens
". . . the universality you speak of appears to be of relatively recent Christian and Islamic manufacture."  You left out Judaism.  I would not regard their ancient texts as "relatively recent."  In any case, you regard historical recency as a factor that argues against traditional views, forgetting that your view of homosexuality is far, far more recent.  Don't forget that by your lights, even the Dalai Lama is a homophobe.
Today's topic is bomb threats against Jewish centres; your political axe can be ground another day.
The Balfour 'Declaration" was an agreement with Ld. Rothschild to guarantee Palestine would be a Jewish homeland in exchange for the entrance of America into the war.  Rothschild controlled the Fed, and the Fed controlled our money supply.  Quid pro quo. Rothschild has said, "I don't care who controls the government, as long as I control the money."
Actually, it's the lack of evidence for the existence of any god that makes one an atheist. Belief has nothing to do with it.
Joel Osteen, Franklin Graham, Mike Huckabee, Jim Baker, Tammy Baker, Creflo Dollar, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell ....... The list of money lovers is long. (and none are Jews). Rome was in charge of Jerusalem. Not the Jews. Jesus was hung on a cross (according to legend) and that was a Roman death. I'm guessing when they wrote that part, it was easier and less deadly, to blame the Jews. After all, Rome was still in charge when 70 years later this was put to paper.
Jesus was a semite (Jews are semites). They tend to be a mix between Caucasian and black (Israel is on the border of Africa). Israel is over 1000 kms from the nearest European country.  And it is pretty certain he wasn't blonde with blue eyes, the way many churches show him.
Because it undermines some racist tendencies.  He hates Jews.  Then he discovers that he has genetic markers for being partially Jewish.  Now what?
It seems many of the commenters don't believe Israel commits false flags. So the Feds have "Jewish Defense League" listed as a terrorist group for being extremely charitable. The USS Liberty never happened. Zionist "Larry Silverstein's" insurance policy, specifically for "Terrorism" 6 weeks before 9/11 was pure dumb luck, as was having a doctors appointment that very day. Allowing Israeli artists to live in WTC, months before the attacks with unrestricted access, on the same floors hit by the planes, was just a nice coincidence. Netanyahu only said, "9/11 was great, Israel is benefiting from the attack," because kinder words have never been spoken about a mass murder incident. Calling Muslim retaliation for our terrorist acts, "Islamic Terrorism" doesn't serve to keep the focus 1 sided. And now, invading an Islamic country is called "defending freedom." and killing their citizens is called "liberation," because it's true. Disagreeing with any of it, is antisemitism. See how that works?
Every post pointing out that the shooter was a rabid atheist  is being removed. Why do people sensor fax that do not support their agenda, every single one of these was a simple comment. People again are using this for him to censor things they disagree with.
So then Israel-Palestine will be a bi-national state, made up of Israeli Jews and Palestinian Christians and Arabs, with one person, one vote and full civil and legal rights for all.   Nothing wrong with that. That's what real democracies are about.  Or did you have something else in mind?      Flag
There is much controversy about what was going on in Irish Christianity. We do know that Patrick handed out the Torah when converting pagans to Christianity. We know that the Irish were accused through the Middle Ages of Judaizing-observing Jewish feasts, using the Jewish date for Passover as Easter, having a clearer understanding of ancient Christian/Jewish doctrine of the resurrection of the body with little thought of the separation of body and soul. As for Judaizing practices, my parents' families in Ireland held to practices characteristic of Jews though they did not think of them as Jewish, just as handed down to them as ancient binding customs. For instance, one of my uncles felt obliged to marry his brother's widow. When  a person died the family and neighbors sat together with the body over one night and buried the body in the morning. A Requiem Mass was said 3 days later and a Munce Mine (?) Mass thirty day later for those who had to travel from a distance.
The State President by the famous name Zuma is the best ever black person hated and cursed, unholy, terrible ever in Africa worst than in Europe, German Hitler who killed so many Jews,American Bush in Iraq,Israelists atrocities against Palestinians, in a Holy South Africa John Vorster,Jimmy Kruger and M C Botha massacred of school children in 1976 for a language.  Zuma has killed who? massacred who?Why so much hatred even God is wondering after all Jesus Christ was crusified for people's sins.  Africa admires this man,he travels arround the world,he is most respected and less hated by his countrymen.I am ashamed of being a South African I wish I was not born here.Hating myself,digracing me,painting my country in black paint.Nevertheless I am still deep rooted in my Africanism which is skin deep.
I know many Christians that have animal sanctuaries, I have a dog cat sanctuary. It`s just that my experience with Peta is that they are ultra liberals, they dont care for Christians at all, they support abortion, gay marriage, and removal of God/Chri*st from classroom/public square  I asked Jesus into my life in 1983, thanked Him for dying on cross for my sins, made Jesus Lord of my life, asked for forgiveness of sins, asked for The Lord Jesus to save me. I am a sinner saved by Grace no better than anybody.  Peta also has been involved in killing dogs and cats, they are a militant anti Christian group in my experience. I am sure they do some good, but I could not sign on to their left wing anti Christian politics  Mark Levin a very good Conservative Jewish man has a foundation to help homeless animals. My sanctuary has no cages chains or ropes, we have large fenced in areas with meadow and shade trees, heated mini barns. nobody is locked in, 3 or 4 to a area they have childrens pools
If you carried a torch with those Nazis, if you marched alongside them as they chanted "Jews will not replace us" and "blood and soil" you are not a "very fine person."     You are, at best, a Nazi sympathizer.    At worst, you are a Nazi.    If you stood and chanted with men and women who wore hoods emblazoned with confederate flags you are a KKK sympathizer.     If you stand up for these people's good intentions and walk in solidarity with their "defense of cultural heritage" you are at least a fellow traveler in white supremacy, more likely a white supremacist yourself.     Nobody marching with that crowd is a decent person, nobody.    And they all had a bloody hand on that steering wheel, as did Trump and his entire group of supporters, every one.
Do you believe the Koran is the inspired word of God?  I don't. Do you believe the Jewish religion is accurate following the crucifixion of Jesus?  I  don't.  I have no idea what Violet, the erudite scholar believes, but she is clearly wrong when she states she is not sure if Jesus even existed. Any Christian Scholar clearly believes  a man named Jesus was born 2000 years ago and was crucified.  Any Christian knows this as well as the fact he was also the Divine Son of God.  That is the TRUTH.  Half of the presumed highly educated commenters on this site have problems believing the simple tenets of the Catholic Faith. She is an expert in the New Testament, which is solely about Jesus, and she has not yet come to the conclusion that he even existed.  What the hell has she been studying?   It is simply a disgrace that young children learning to receive First Communion are more educated with the truth than the many on this website.
All of the Jewish law was about separatism, not universal revelation from God. Sadly, the classical Church accepted Plato and Aurelius, who were Asexual and has glorified this unique way of relating even for people to whom it does-not make any sense at all.
So many times on this blog I have stated that belief is a religious expression void of evidence.  The word I choose is;  think. I prefer the method of science which is the only objective method available to us to learn and to know, discover and to make predictions.  Religion does none of this. It is static constrained to ancient times when beliefs were regarded as truth...which traditional Catholics are unable to free themselves.
Your critique of Atwood's glory is weakened by your self-defensive desire to see Islam punished in her literature, not Christianity. Atwood's views have nothing to do with either Christianity or with Islam. She's a feminist, period, and her villains are men, not men's 'religions'. She distorts her own message with the silly stuff about enslaving women in middle-America. All this can be confusing, because religious fundies (like yourself, I suppose) are not going to "enslave" women soon, or perhaps ever. But you will restrict their access to birth control, and some, like Mike Pence, will promote a kind of subservience to men and glorify the Abuser-in-Chief, Trump. Atwood's "dystopia" would have been set in a Buddhist society if she had been an Asian, not a middle-class Anglo from Ontario (where there are more crosses on the horizon than crescents). Your own agenda can be met by writing an anti-Islamic dystopia, which you should do. You really have missed the mark here.
Monica, I agree there is disconnect between Religion and Science. Too many people do not see God in our world and science. It is like oil and water.  When in university I asked my friend in physics and found out he was an atheist. I was amazed because I marveled at the laws of physics and just couldn't understand how it could "just happen". I respected his point of view. Even evolution is ongoing creation.  My Catholic faith is not main stream.  The themes of living the teachings of Jesus is most important. Doctrines, Dogma, and Rituals not so much. Relationship and spirituality are ways to connect with the Divine Mystery and with others. I believe it continues on after I "shuffle off my moral coil".  Thank you for your contribution, it is food for thought!
Trump said exactly this, "But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.”  The issue you raise is whether what Trump calls "those people" who he clearly supports and claims were not neo-Nazis, were what the Globe calls "people like Mr. Cantwell".   There's lots of evidence that they were all pretty much like Mr. Cantwell.  If they weren't then what were they doing marching in formation with a group chanting "Jews will not replace us".  Not my idea of good people, Mr. Trump's maybe.
Actually, 12% follow Islam.  82% are Hindu.  Just FYI.
Raksha Bandhan, or simply Rakhi is a Hindu religious and secular festival.A collection of sweet messages you can send to your brother/sister on the auspicious occassion of Raksha Bandhan. Please visit  <a href= "http://www.dooiitt.com/category/raksha-bandhan/">Rakshabandhan Quotes</a>
In the last 6,000 years of human history no one has succeeded by being the "me first".  All successful ideologies, moral codes, religions stress putting others' interests before your own. America's present failings are precisely because since its last do-gooder President Woodrow Wilson, beginning with 1920s corrupt administrations of Coolidge, Harding, and Hoover USA has thought of its own interests first.   WWI, WWII, Cold War, Korea, Viet-Nam, Chile, Iran, Iraq, Af-Pak all are examples where America put itself first, even under Obama.   Greed and selfishness made American century last only a quarter - 1950-72 when gold was delinked from $. Nixon, Reagan, Bushes, did the damage to American prosperity and world prestige, and now Trump will simply speed up the rate of decline. No Jews then, no Mexicans and Muslims now.  We in Canada will be hurt even more as we have converted ourselves into a one-customer factory. All that investment will simply go waste.
Hi Monica. Hmm: I think your reconstruction would be difficult to substantiate against the standard account. Paul did not found some of the communities to whom he writes, e.g., Philippians and Romans. They were already functioning, as was Alexandria. Also, the problem disappears when one assumes he simply took for granted the Jesus tradition and focused on Jesus' death and resurrection (he also knows about the Jesus' Eucharist words). We do have the Letter of James, which dates ca 50, and it seems to reflect a very Jewish faith, with Jesus mentioned as only in the greeting of the first verse. The conflict between Paul and the Jerusalem "pillars' does not rely just on Acts, but on Galatians, and it played out until the Pseudo-Paul wrote Ephesians 2. But why dismiss oral traditions? Perhaps he was too busy drawing on Greek moralists, who already had cultural purchase, to simply repeat what everybody already knew? Still, there are too many holes to know how everything fits together.
Scheer is not jewish, but if he were, do you believe that this would make him unelectable?  As for your comment about Scheer and Quebec, only the most diehard Conservatives in Quebec would vote for Bernier.. most other Quebecers laugh at the mention of his name.  He has already stated that he would not re open the debates on abortion and same sex marriage, and central Ontario already leans small c conservative.  You just seem angry that a Quebecker did not win.
Harry, There you go again.  My question to you was "who do you think is the Anti-Christ?" Somehow, you always answer a question as if it were a different question. There must be billions of people on this planet who don't believe in the Second Coming of Jesus per the Book of Revelations. I understand the Jewish faith is still waiting for their own messiah.  Calling every Jew an Anti-Christ is pure anti-Semitic.  What's next?  Calling Jews "Christ-killers"? Ron Reagan,Jr., an avowed atheist, had good parents who also were HOLLYWOOD ACTORS until they got into politics. You previously mentioned you liked the Joan Baez song about Dixie.  I recommend you listen to John Lennon's song "Imagine".  Imagine a world without religion to fight , kill, and die for.
Yeah, the pews are filled with them /sarc.  My kids are like the ones you refer to.  Why?  Because my wife and I made a concerted effort to educate them, notwithstanding the efforts of their schools and teachers to make them reject the what their God and their religion teaches them.  You know which kids survive public school brainwashing best?  The Jewish kids, whose parents enroll them in Hebrew schools at early ages.  They've maintained their religion and heritage in a mostly-Christian country, some of them even holding on to ancient traditions.    There is much the Catholics could learn from the Jews about perpetuating faith.  Number 1, they never disparage their own religion like Catholics with same-sex attraction and those who have divorced do.
Stating accurately the dangerously oversized lobbying capability of Jewish organizations is not exactly "going after" anyone. Facts are facts and excessive influence by foreigners is not acceptable.
I'm with the "No" side on this one.  The people living adjacent to the proposed cemetery site don't want a cemetery there.  They don't want a Catholic cemetery there, they don't want a Jewish cemetery there, they don't want a Chinese cemetery there, and they don''t want a Muslim cemetery there.   What's so hard to understand about that?    They are talking now about a Human Rights challenge?  Hey - its not a 'human right' to have a burial site any old place you feel like it.  It always seems to be the same with a certain community - they have to impose their will on others.    Quebec is a huge province with a vast land area.  Find someplace for your cemetery that complies with local zoning bylaws and has the support of surrounding land owners.
When you say "we would admit..." who is "we"? A source outside of human existence that has authority over human existence would make that authority by definition not connected to the very thing they have authority over.  Reminds me of new age believers who claim there are things beyond what we can experience because they are not of this physical nature. And then they claim that they affect people. How could they be beyond and yet impact this existence? The thing is, whatever analogy or metaphor we use to express God would seem to be minimize God's power. I have liked this definition: "God is that which we cannot conceive".  I'm an Agnostic myself. Atheists think we're just weak atheists, and some Christians think we're ripe to be converted.  I wish all religious were able to get along. And certainly, non-believers have their own faults. I am glad people find meaning in religion. And I know religious people think non-believers are very lonely.  And rightly so.
Notice how few people are posting. That's because they are getting ready to bug out. To where, I have no idea, south lies a desolate and brutal land (the US), we have no ships, no planes, no sanctuary, no bomb shelters, nothing. Congratulations Jews, you did an excellent job. Too bad you won't be around to see the outcome.
Once again MSM provides a platform for a social justice myth, there is no such thing as Islamaphobia. When is the Globe going to being providing regular space for social commentary from somceone who identifies as a fundamental Christian?  Buddhist? Atheist?
Well the article is about Islam, so I naturally thought that's what we're discussing here.   I'm glad your here to step up to the plate and discuss this issue.    How do we go about making sure you and I don't support intolerant cultures of any kind, love to hear your ideas.     You mention: " What I find ironic is how some won't hesitate to point out issues with "diversity, woman's rights, and gay rights" in fundamentalist Islam, yet ignore similar instances in historically Western religions".     Historically you're correct, but remember that is past history, that's been  resolved via reformations in both Christianity and Judaism.    That is why is very important that reformation takes place in Islam, which moves the religion away from a sectarian view into a secular one.   What  we're concerned with here is the current situation, the here and now, not long ago history.
There has been a continuous Jewish presence in the Land of Israel for thousands of years. The long-denied right to self-determination of the Jewish people has been validated with the State of Israel. Liberation is liberation regardless of Palestinian terrorism and opposition.
I am Catholic and I agree completely. Now let's look at the left's embrace of the current Pope and his globalist manipulations. The Pope during WWII was much the same, and we saw how that turned out in Gaeta, Italy. My father's name was Ateo, which means Atheist in Italian, for just that reason. There is plenty of outrage to go around.
That reminds me of the man who went to Northern Ireland. When they asked him what religion he was, he said "I'm an atheist."  "Yes," they said, "but are you a Catholic or Protestant atheist?"
Your false perception is the Christian rulers of Canada are secular. They prefer Muslim and Jews to agnostic or atheist immigrants.
Believing in a god has nothing to do with being good. As far as your need to paint atheists as creating misery, I would suggest that the desert religions have killed more and caused more suffering to humans than any other vector.
To paraphrase the inimitable words of Forrest Gump, "Nazis is as Nazis does, Ma'am (or Sir)".  And I have fabricated no quotes--in fact have given their sources, historical and Scriptural.  And all you can do, like any "Ersatz Israel" apologist, is shriek, flail and deny.  Will you trot out the oft-used and tired epithet of "anti-Semite" next?  Don't bother.  I am a Semite.  I suppose you could go with 'self-hating Jew' (Jewish apologists for the Zionist entity have done so before, despite neither I nor anyone in my family having been of that faith for five generations).  As for "partisan", my partisanship is predicated on the command in my Book to support right and oppose wrong.  I was a partisan against the Ba'ath Party.  I am not a partisan against Iraqis.  I am a partisan against the Taliban.  I am not a partisan against Afghans.  I am a partisan against Nazis.  I am not a partisan against Germans.  And I am a partisan against Zionists.  I am not a partisan against Jews.  NEXT!
Popularity of hockey is dying in Canada. Ottawa cant even get a sell out for a playoff game. Most popular watched sporting event in Canada is Super Bowl, number 2 is World cup of soccer and number 3 is Euro cup. All three have nothing to do with Canada. Basketball is very popular among the youth of Canada. Blacks, Jews, Flippino, Chinese all prefer basketball. Immigrants from Sub continent of India prefer Cricket, Soccer is Arabs, south Americans, old Europeans and Africans. Another 25 years hockey will be a minor sport in Canada.
Saudi Arabia where this 'religion' originates is going to execute a man for being an atheist.  Is that something these muslims are teaching their children?  Keep this out of our schools.
"...today 585,887...."  My university sources in Chile tell me most Mormons are nominal and don't practice their religion. Well under 22% don't practice. Officials are cutting down expenses, retrenching. It's run its course. In the 2002 census, for example, only 100,000 Chileans identified as Mormon, especially after the fall of Pinochet and investigations into that regime's policies. (Mormon officials were very supportive of the dictator, who invited many Mormon missionaries to Chile.) Of course, Mormons count all they baptized (and even baptize non-Jews posthumously, everywhere) and ignore polls based on voluntary self-identification. The latter is the best indicator of demographics. So while Mormon officials might claim a half million adherents, national polls put the number of adherents way less.
Perhaps you should educate yourself a little bit. The Rohingya muslims have had "freedom fighters" in Myanmar for several years who are terrorists in that country just like they are in the rest of the world and are trying to turn Myanmar into another muslim caliphate. The Buddhists in Myanmar have had enough of terrorist acts and decided to have a mass expulsion of the  Rohingya and take back their country.
beautiful story.  Oregoncraig in an earlier listing  pondered that it was a  "Christians and jews" collective who built the house.  It was and i'm sure the next time,  more faiths will become involved as well seeing it for what it is.  it is good works done by many  to contribute to a community of all.  talking to my muslim friends,  they, too, would have liked to help as part of the community here.  sajid, in particular, wants to learn more building techniques and saw it as a lost learning opportunity.
Why the raucous?   Israel does this to Palestinians day in and out, using our money and equipment.   So what if Muslim Saudis do it too? Why can a Muslim not do what a Jew can? Blaming the Saudis is patent Islamophobia.  Come on Fellow Canadians. $15 Billion is a lot of money, lot of jobs. The targets Shia and Palestinians be damned. They are poor anyway, and contribute zilch to our profit.. Moreover, they are expendable, a children of lesser god than our mighty Dollar. Profit, Profit, Profit.  As the wise guy said, "Stuff happens", "collateral damage".
Thought the Jews' homeland is in Israel and Palestine.
If you want to get into a statistics fight... Doctors kill more people than guns.  Wonder why healthcare is so expensive? It's to pay for those malpractice lawsuits.   Voting does kill. Ask the Jews how it worked out for them being loaded up in box cars at gun point.  Were they not "innocent victims"...?   A tax is just another word for "control".
God Blessed Fathers and MOTHERS with their beloved Children. God gave his ONLY Son to save ANYONE accepting his Son's Sacrifice. That Sacrifice is available to Jew, Gentile, Muslim or any other! I am unworthy but fully accepted God's Son's Sacrifice to provide my path to Heaven.  Happy Father's Day!!
I'm an atheist with a keen interest in cosmology and particle physics. If that's the best argument you can bring to this issue, the god awful ignorance is your own.
Shocked if USCCB publicly support  sanctuary movement. It will be up to individual churches, etc to be sanctuaries. In Nazi Germany and other countries under their control bishops did not publicly support rescue of Jews.  The USCCB will follow this tradition. How many RCs were part of the Underground Railroad in the USA? The RCC will not jeopardize its relationship to Caesar.
There are a number of sources on line including articles from CNN and the Atlantic Magazine  Look for anti Jewish violence in Europe. Tends to spike when violence between Israel and Palestine spikes.
What you dismissively label as a "fashion style" is not viewed as such by the women who choose to wear the niqab. They see it as a requirement of their faith.   Would you say the same about a nun's habit (which to all intents and purposes is a hijab), the sheitel worn by women of the Jewish faith, the koppa worn by Amish women, the orhni worn by Hindu women, the tiechl worn by Hutterite women ...?
Ok.  My bad.  Thank you for the education.  I see now your logic that a dude holding a torch yelling "Jews will not replace us" is a good Nazi and isn't a bad person.  I can see that now.  And a person at a trump rally holding up a sign and getting beaten by trump security is an antifa who should be punished.  Got it.  I will try to do better in the future to see the difference that I clearly should have recognized in how a right winger thinks.  Fascinating.  Thank you.  Good bye.
We have had this discussion before, but to reiterate, Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country, celebrates Christmas. Christianity is not an indigenous religion there - it came with the colonial conquerors. And yet they respect all religions in their country.  France and Britain, precursor nations to Canada, don't have any Jewish holy days as public holidays. Even though the Jews have been there for centuries.
These are not violent attacks.  They are some "bad dudes" getting their jollies making robo calls every now and again to random Jewish centres in the US and Canada.  If the CIA or NSA, etc really had the technology they would have nailed these guys already going thru all the phone records they keep.
It's not about feelings. It's about relationship. If we recognize humans as creations of God the Parent. (Mother or Father is irrelevant)    we are God's children.  We are not "souls", we are persons,. SOme say "body and soul" but can you separate the two? Really? Baptism is merely an outward sign used by Judaism and then Christianity. The unbaptised are no less God's beloved creation than the baptised.
Who decides who is qualified?  The problem with that adjective is that it can easily be reversed to decide that Americans are not qualified if - they a conservative or a liberal, religious or atheist, a drinker, a toker, or a teetotaler, short or tall, served in the military or was a conscientious objector, is a police officer or not ... and I could offer a hundred more examples.  Does the guy who sought counseling for depression after his 20-year marriage dissolved qualify to own guns or is he disallowed because he recognized a problem and dealt with it?  Is the retired soldier allowed to own guns because he served his country or is he disallowed because he might have PTSD?  The felon who got selling cannibis at 18 is apparently disqualified, but the cop with anger issues and 15 excessive force complaints in his packet is qualified.  Who decides who is qualified and what qualifies them to make that decision on restricting a fundamental right?
This American thanks all the Canadian leaders, regardless of party, who have spoken out against this atrocity.  Shades of WWII again with a ship load of Jews sent away only to face death, the camps for Nisei in California and Joe McCarthy's persecutions.  The Republican Party has a chance to redeem itself by impeaching, trying and removing this despicable human being from office.  On this day, I am ashamed to be an American
I think perhaps you've misread my comment.  My point is that religion does not have anything to do with criminal behaviour most of the time, except in cases where it is made explicit, but that YOUR assertion around atheists and believers having equal representation in social misbehavior is not supported by key indicators such as the religiosity of prison populations. Then I stated this could be explained by the third variables of socioeconomic status and education, which both influence expressed religiosity.  Your example of Jewish people is only a counterpoint to "all smart people are not religious". An argument that I did not make. My statements would be flawed if I framed them as absolutely true, but I don't deal in logically indefensible absolutes.
I have to question why Goodale is concerned about the antisemitic comments of the far right, while at the same time he turns a blind eye to the imans in Montreal and Toronto who post videos online of their own antisemitic rants.  Further, no one intervened when the Al Quds day in Toronto included a speech by Holocaust denier Kevin Barrett.  I take no solace from the fact that Goodale and others are suddenly so concerned about protecting jews, but only when it suits their agenda, and would be more impressed if the imans in Canada posting calls of "death to jews" online would finally be brought to justice, and that the blatantly antisemitic Al Quds celebrations be banned.
"Sacred" is an English word, and as with most western translations of Native Hawaiian concepts, is totally mangled by the European viewpoint.  The Native Hawaiians would say these places identified as "sacred" by the haole, that is, supernatural, is totally misconstrued. These are places of deep respect and reverence. Again, the English word "reverence" does not have anything to do with a supernatural religion like christianity or judaism. The word "reverence" is from the Latin "revereri", meaning "in great awe".  All the Native Hawaiians are saying is these places and objects are to be treated with respect and wonder, not the supernatural association being laid on them by a western mindset on what constitutes a "legitimate" religion.
What about barbecuing pork with muslim or Jewish neighbors?  What about going topless?  What about listening to music?  What about  praying?  What about [insert topic here]?
The antisemitic narrative was being pushed by the anti-Trumpists, many of whom couldn't care less about antisemitism, except if it could be pinned on Trump and the far right.  The jewish community wasn't really talking about the threats, the anti Trumpists were, including the MSM.    Jewish and Israeli newspapers were reporting that the perp  was an Israeli at least a month ago. Those newspapers are all available online to anyone who wants to read them. Nothing was hidden.  As to whether he is intelligent, his behaviour was disruptive and he was never able to attend regular schools He had no friends. He seemed to be lacking social and emotional intelligence.
We know a lot of things now that we did not know in 1945. The Holocaust occurred throughout Europe and the Nazi concentration camp system was extensive. The 'magic number' is whatever the number is. I'm sure there are even accurate sources available on the internet for those who do not limit themselves to cherry-picked information. Jews were not the only ones killed, imprisoned, or persecuted.
Hmmmm -- Post and the leftwing media play up THIS angle? Good grief. Not a word about his online rantings preaching atheism and his hatred of Christians. When will the media self destruct from its lack of honesty?
Motley, so neither of us is president. And yes, agreed, that pardon was absolutely lawful.   But despicable.   Arpaio had a reign of terror for years, with our fellow US citizens who happened to be hispanic living in the same kind of fear that Jews suffered under the nazis. Can you imagine how it felt to be an American, child of generations of Americans, wondering as you leave home whether you should carry your passport to protect yourself from search and seizure, because you look "Mexican?" More than 1 million U.S. citizens of hispanic descent live in that county. Arpaio openly defied a court order to pursue his bigotry with the perverted power of law enforcement. Trump's pardon was open code to the country, saying "I am racist, I disrespect the federal courts and the constitution." That's self evident, as our founding fathers would say.
Jewish and Christian women are also supposed to cover their heads.  http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/who-has-not-made-me-a-woman/  http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-6.htm
Climate change is definitely a hoax, and the Holocaust of the Jews in Europe did happen as surly as the genocide of the American Indians by Europeans.
Do you think for a second Muslims will be content to have Jews pray in the prayer room?
Far right in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Turkey (nation denies the Armenian Genocide of 1915), Russia (Putin trying to restore the influence of the Orthodox Church, Hungary (Trying to restore the influence of the Catholic church) Poland (Trying to restore the influence of the Catholic church) So you have extremist Jews, Sunni, Shittes, Orthodox Christians and Catholics. Which one is attacked the most by the fake news media????
The man in the ditch was shown kindness. Do you know the probable reason the Jews avoided him?  Had the man in the ditch been there as a result of a just sentence of death, and the Samaritan took pity on him and saved him, that would have been mercy. Mercy is getting more than your due, or less than your due in the case of a restriction or punishment.  Your situation is the result of mercy. The Holy Father would have been completely just in refusing the request.  Your opposition to the Church’s discipline of celibacy seems inexplicable given the completely unearned and generous indult you enjoyed.
Issues like this will become more common as years go by. Liberals increasing immigration to 350k per year. The whole system will need to change according to these people. Lets start with stat holidays; Christmas, Good Friday and New Years day need to change. Why is the calendar Canada uses represents the Catholic Church and Jesus? Muslims, Chinese, Hindus, Jews all have their own calendar. Maybe Canada could create a New Calendar that is less offensive. Lets base it on  PET was born which was 1919 or when he died.
"She specifically pointed to an incident in her Toronto riding of University-Rosedale, where the Miles Nadal Jewish Community Centre was evacuated in March after a bomb threat."  That's an odd example to use. The perpetrator of the bomb threats here and abroad turned out to be a Jewish Israeli teenager, Michael Kadar. He's been indicted on multiple counts of making the threats, blackmail and money laundering.  "In addition to the bomb threats to Jewish centres, the indictment said Kadar made a bomb threat against an El-Al flight to Israel that sparked fighter jets to be scrambled, and threatened a Canadian airport, which required passengers to disembark in emergency slides and left six people injured."  "Israeli teen accused of 2,000 bomb hoax calls and blackmail" - The Guardian, 24 April 2017  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/24/israel-michael-kadar-jewish-centre-bomb-threats
Like your self , I've been to Burma , and Bangladesh and agree with your last paragraph .  The Buddhists of Burma have no problem with the Christians or Hindus or other ethnic minorities because they do not insist upon you believing in their ideology.  Unfortunately the Sunnis in Bangladesh are being taken over by the Wahhabi sect promoted by Saudi Arabia .  This sect promotes "jihad", the "conversion"  by any means , including force  .  This has been on going for a good number of years .  It began in Bangladesh with the military's (Wahhabi officer corp) taking out whole valleys of Buddhist farmers along the border , and has expanded into Burma .  All hatred is ugly , but there is a reason for it . Wahhabi Islam , not Sunni or Shia , is a very real threat to the world.
Non-changing (rigid) religions are also shrinking , include those with male only clergy/leaders/pastors:  EOC, Mormons, Southern Baptists.  Eastern Orthodox Churches are shrinking in membership in the US., have one of the lowest rates of retention across Christian and non-Christian denominations, with only 53% of adults who were raised in the Orthodox Church still identify themselves as Orthodox Christians.  Compare that to Hindus (80%), Jewish (75%), Mormon (64%) and Catholic (59%).   The conservative Southern Baptist Church  have recorded a loss of membership for each of the last 9 years and lost  200,000 adult members between 2013 and 2015.  15% of Amish leave their childhood church as adults.  Rigidity is either not enough or is rejected by many.   Half of the 'nones' in the US left their childhood religion over lack of belief, and 20% cited dislike of organized religion in a recent Pew survey.  Rigidity or male-only priests/pastors apparently doesn't prevent shrinkage.
If the KKK asked this guy to bake an anti-black cake and he refused .....how many people would support his refusal? If someone asked this guy to bake to bake a cake that was derogatory of Jews, gays, Muslims, or Christians.....and he refused.....how many people would defend his right to do so? ========== Maybe.....everyone who doesn't support him now?
In order to find any humor in your comment all one has to do is forget and ignore all of the past false flags against Jews where they did get caught, Forget and ignore that the motto of the Mossad is something like "by deception we shall make war", and literally hundreds of other incredible acts of violence they have committed against humanity over the last 1000 years. How  about the zionists selling out the Jews to the Nazis? Show me a zionist and I will show you a raging anti semite
And not just Jews as a group, but Jews from a specific geographic area.  None of the apostles are mentioned as being Jews from Rome, or Ephesus, or Alexandria, or Athens -- only from a little tiny area in the Middle East.
It's because the Mission allows too many rednecks to stay there. I know someone who volunteers there and she told me they kicked a homeless Jewish man out after a bunch of rednecks tried to gang up on him. When she asked why kicked him out instead of the rednecks they said it was "for his own protection." My head almost exploded when she told me that! I tried calling the place at their main number to ask if that's what really happened and they just hung up on me.
The left reflexively came to the defense of a religious freedom concept that really separates Church and State in the secular realm and does not give preference for one religious view point over another.  I am not personally interested in giving fundamental Christianity any rights over our constitutional system anymore than I would fundamentalist moslems or jews.
Spot on Mr. Klein. It never ceases to amaze me how the "liberal" media often espouse a number of Trump acts as uncaring, unsympathetic, and even anti-semitic toward Jews. There seems to be no consideration of the important fact that his high profile daughter and son-in-law are in fact Jews. It is truly baffling how anyone with a even a modicum of common sense would conclude Trump is at risk of somehow being hostile toward Jewish causes. Trump may be a lot of things, but anti-semitic or unsympathetic of Jewish causes has to be way down the list of this admittedly imperfect man and President.
So how many Christian countries allow non Christian leaders? I can't think of a single one. Leon BLum was the PM of France (he was Jewish) in the 1930s, but the President has real power there.   In contrast, in India, a Sikh person, (which is a 2 percent minority),Dr. Manmohan Singh , was the Prime Minister for 10 years.
don't hurt yourself jumping to a conclusion observah.  You sound mighty similar to  those in the 1800s who said to keep the Irish Catholics out, the government who in 1939 said that None was Too Many Jewish refugees to take, or the ones who said no to the 1956 Hungarians as they were all Commie spies.
"substance and beauty that atheism has to offer" ???  Let's celebrate all those great atheists -  Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Kim Il-sung,etc.  WOW, what a beautiful belief system.
Your other reasons were irrelevant. The public school system isn't a secular system. It's an All Inclusive system. Anyone with a religious need can be accommodated. Most Christian and Jewish holidays are already taken care of. Offering space for Muslim children to pray briefly on a Friday afternoon is no burden on the system. It disturbs no other students. It's you who has to come up with some reason why accommodation is a burden to the state. And saying that safety is a concern is ludicrous as it's the haters who are creating the threat.
" their treatment of the Falun Gong, and the oppression of Muslim Uyghurs in the western provinces, and of course the Buddhist in Tibet. Name a country that has NOT oppressed its minority populations."  It is misleading to lump all events into one as if they were all deserving of equal condemnation. Let's put it another way. How many political prisoners has Canada arrested and then tortured, killed and used as organ banks? How many countries have we annexed? How many islands have we built in order to claim jurisdiction expanded territories?  Canada has flaws. But they are not even in the same neighbourhood as China. Heck not even the same solar system.
I'm sorry but you are totally wrong. You are clearly not a scientist. Atheism is just a non belief in gods so please do not  make out it has anything to do with the history of the universe which, by the way, is clearly provable.  There was no World wide flood and your description of geology is nonsense.
"Before the Second World War the population of Crimea was almost half Russian." Ethnic Russians may have just barely not made up the majority of Crimea's citizenry before WW2 (49.6% in 1939), but they still were the predominant ethnic group since the start of the 1900s. In 1939, Tatars, who were the second-largest ethnic group, made up 19.4% of Crimea's population. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Crimea#Ethnicities_and_languages "Only after the slaughter of the Jews and Gypsies by the Germans and the expulsion of the Crimean Tatars by Stalin did Russians become the majority." Ethnic Russians already comprised half the population of Crimea before those things occurred.
I found seven “responses” from you when I logged in. This is only which contained actual content to respond to.  The use of the phrase “natural law” or its equivalent is normally traced to Plato and Aristotle in Western thinking, predating the Stoics. However, the equivalent is also found in other cultures, including the Jews of the Old Testament, because natural laws exist whatever we call them and whether or not we note them.  St. Paul refers to the law written in the hearts of the Gentiles, who are law unto themselves.  The commentaries on the Talmud and the Talmud itself are rife with references to sin occurring when a person strays from the divinely appointed goals in life, for example to procreate and populate the earth. That is natural law.  When the Rambam - Maimonides - encountered Aristotelian philosophy he immediately identified natural law with the divine plan for mankind.  The orthodox Jewish belief and the Catholic differ not a whit.
If a suitable space if available and there's little or no cost to provide it, schools should make it available to students for ANY reasonable activity. The meeting could be about politics. Stamp collecting. Atheism. Community volunteering. Flat Earthers. And yes, it can be about religion too. Any activity that's lawful and suitable to the age of the students and the available space should be allowed.
Why are divisions between Christians so important for some people?  For me, they have almost no significance. A Roman Catholic is my sister/brother Catholic Christian. "In Christ, there is neither Greek nor Jew nor slave nor free nor male nor female " Galatians 3:28. "There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism." Ephesians 4:5 "So that they may all be one, as you, Father, are in me and I in you, that they also may be in us, that the world may believe that you sent me. John 17:21.   Denigrating or discriminating against my sister/brother Catholics has no place in my spirituality. It is Spiritual Elitism!  Put another way,  the Altar is God's, whether in a Roman church or in mine.
You should read "Hidden from History" to begin with. As I pointed out, the Nazis treated gays in much the same way as Jews -- the pink triangle being modeled on the yellow star. You say the numbers were different. But not that Jews were persecuted throughout their history in a manner again very similar to gays: the Inquisition was a plague to both categories. Now gays, as you admit, make up 4% of the human race, far dwarfing the number of Jews. So the persecution of gays has taken in absolute terms a greater toll (augmented by the absence of a gay community analogous to the Jewish community). It is true that the Nazis focused their paroxysm of hatred on the Jews, a group who had been denounced as deicides in church teaching, condemned to Hell at the Council of Florence, and seens a justly condemned to perpetual servitude by Paul IV in 1555 (Bull, Cum Nimis Absurdum, ratified by popes in later centuries). But gays have been singled our for the same kind of systematic persecution.
"f a guy came to our Jummah and started spewing hate and being violent, he would literally have 300 brown and black kids jump at him.” --- Where were those 300 when the PDSB faith advisor hosted an imam calling for slaying of the Jews?
>>On the other hand, the world's largest Muslim countries, like Indonesia and Bangladesh, have public holidays for Buddhist, Hindu and Christian festivals. . Yes Indonesia - celebrating multiple religious holidays ... and where being an atheist is a dangerous proposition.  Can I write "God doesn't exist"? Blasphemy, no doubt, punishable how - please elaborate Her Muslim?
No it isn't. Marriage existed as a legal institution, and developed independently in hundreds of human civilizations, long before Judaism or Xtianity existed. Your argument is irrelevant. It's also nonsensical - you're trying to claim that children are never conceived outside of marriage. Also, for the bajillionth time, this is a secular country, not a theocracy, and we are governed by the Constitution, not the bible. Your imaginary sky wizard has no standing whatsoever.
Yes, it was a "bad joke", and yes it was offensive to not only the students in question, but also to many in society.  Those that see his comments as a joke do not fully appreciate how offensive his comments were.  For the Globe and Mail to attempt to equate the use of the word master as skillful being the same as a slave owner is plain idiotic.  I am not offended by the title of Master for Massey College -- I am deeply offended by the use of the word master as a slave owner, as Marrus did.  This is essentially the same situation as the the fellow from Ontario who's name is Grabher, and who had his personal license plate cancelled because someone found it offensive.  There is a difference between "Grabher" and "Grab her", and Master and master.  Unfortunately for Prof. Marrus, he found humour in expressing a derogatory comment to a minority who he should have known would find it offensive, just as he would find any derogatory Jewish term aimed at him.  He should expect such responses.
The BDS movement and the anti-Israel propaganda disseminated on our country's university campuses has unleashed the worst in people on the political left. The anti-Jewish bigots of the left feel emboldened as they hide behind the billowing skirts of Auntie-Semitism.
Really? To this atheist, French secularism is the metastasizing of a reasonable concept (if used in moderation) into ideologically-driven, blunt-force social engineering.
There's another very extensive analysis of Freeland's family's Nazi and anti-Jew propaganda creation and dissemination in this article: http://johnhelmer.org/?p=17016 (The above website seems to be currently under a DDoS web attack, to prevent people from being able to access the website and read the article. Just try the address again at a later time, people) This G&M article is obviously trying to get in front of the news and shape people's preconceptions of it before they hear about it from other sources. As such, G&M is being a willingly dishonest and deceitful propagandist, while, ironically and hypocritically, trying to suggest that other sources are exactly that for presenting what is, so far, non-disputed information about Chrystia Freeland's family, and the apparently-false story that she's told to Canadians about her family's history. BTW, the source for the information about Freeland's family's Nazi history is not conspiracy, but the Polish gov't, and historical documents.
The aim of BDS is to delegitimise the State of Israel and eventually destroy it. No other country in the world is singled out as a target for this kind of campaign.  Those who support BDS seem to have no concerns for other parts of the world where there is conflict. They ignore the Chinese annexation of Tibet in 1951 and the way that ethnic Chinese have been imported into Tibet to dilute the native population.  They ignore the atrocious abuse of human rights in Iran and many other countries. It's Israel, and only Israel, that they obsess over.  Not difficult to understand their motives for doing so. It's similar to how the Germans were told to boycott Jewish businesses and professionals in the 1930s.
The HOLY Bible is Christian. The New Testament is Christian. The Old Testament is Judaism, kept intact for reference.
German boy beaten, kicked by Muslim schoolmates after telling them he is Jewish  http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/german-boy-beaten-by-muslim-schoolmates-after-telling-them-he-is-jewish
The claim that a human being’s life begins at conception is scientific fact. We know the unborn are alive, they are human, and they are whole organisms.   When Mary's greeting reached Elizabeth's ears in Luke, the unborn John the Baptist leapt for joy in his mother's womb (1:44); he was filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb (1:15). The unborn John the Baptist is described as a brephos (Luke 1:41, 44), a Greek term meaning a babe, an infant, a newborn child. The Hebrew term yeled means "child, son, boy, offspring, youth," and also refers to an unborn child. Ex. 21:22, the Hebrew says literally "her children come out" instead of "she has a miscarriage," as in some translations. The same is true of the term ben, which means "son, child, youth" (cf. Gen. 25:22). The Jews neither had nor needed a specialised term for the unborn. Scripture regularly refers to individuals existing in the womb - "I knew you in the womb," (Jer. 1:5)
Thus sayeth the atheist fundamentalist.  'Believe as I do!  Or else!'
Your comment raises an interesting question. Reading Thomas Aquinas back into Jesus' time, I'm sure you will say there must have been a 'transubstantiation' at the last supper. That did not seem to occur to Jesus.  Jesus never thought in terms of Aristotle's philosophy. He was thinking more in terms of Jewish practices of a covenant, and Passover remembrance.  Whether he was 'present' in two different forms that Thursday night – in his actual human form, and distributing his 'sacramental' presence, likely never occurred to him. Did He 'transubstantiate' himself? Certainly he had not died as yet, so that his death could be 'remembered'. He was giving them a model of something to do in the future.  And when they finished the meal, they just got up and left. No 'tabernacles' or anything. I expect Jesus is rather amazed at our philosophical gymnastics.
Wrong. His Facebook page showed two recurring themes. Antifa and atheism.
See my post elsewhere on this thread where I summarize a case of a jewish neighborhood in Montreal trying to block the construction of a synagogue.  Somehow, the author of this article failed to mention this, although the story is more recent than the Outremont story.
Casting this haole as a Hawaiian continues the great Hollywood tradition of casting caucasians as non-whites.  As Jack Tatum points out, Jesus has been played by northern Europeans so often that most (white) Americans believe he was white instead of Semitic, conveniently forgetting that he was Jewish. Others commenters have mentioned other non-white roles played by whites.  In addition to the roles mentioned, I find Rex Harrison and Yule Brenner as Chinese and Al Jolson as African American particularly offensive--and, yes, he haole au.  As we should know by now, it's all about the $$$.
Yup, Arabs converted them to Islam in about 900 AD before that they were Buddhist and Hindus.
Would that be the "God" of Islam; the "God" of the Catholics; the "God" of Shinto; the "God" of Shiva the Destroyer; the "God" of the Aztecs; the "God" of Odin; the "God" of non-Catholic Christians; the "God" of the Jews?  You need to specify the object(s) of your bigotry more precisely.  Over the last 10,000 years, the shamans, priests, ministers, Imams etc. have killed so many in the names of so many "Gods", specificity is required to malign the 80% in the US who have religious beliefs of one kind or another.  Those in the single digit belief systems such as yourself are too arrogant by half.
Poor Richard.  Corruption is a REQUIREMENT for American political office!  Criminals run our political system!  Changing one handpicked criminal for another makes no difference whatsoever.  In terms of corruption, Frumpy the KKKlown and Killary the Blood Countess are evenly matched.  Only thing can be said for Frumpy is that he worships only his own desires.  Killary is therefore even more dangerous than Frump because she worships the Zionists.  They put her husband in office the first time--3 out of 5 of his senior-most campaign staffers were AIPAC members.  To understand the significance of this in terms of your own conditioned fears, think of them as the Jewish answer to CAIR, but with exponentially more money and clout.  And nukes.  And Frumpy is the crooked tool that'll wedge that cellulite-stuffed pantsuit into the Oval Office.  The finger on the button will have lacquered nails.  Get beneath your desks, children, and put your heads between your legs.  She is Clinton, her roar...
The Torah was given to the Hebrews from Jehovah. The "arabs" had only pagan multi god beliefs until well after The birth date ascribed to Jesus. Islam did not exist until the pedophile illiterate warlord mo hammed babbled on to justify his hatred of Jews and Christians, at least 700 yrs after Christianity spread throughout the known world. No Roman Emperor compiled the texts commonly used as the Bible. That was done by 2 different councils long before mo hammed was born. The texts were vetted on certain principles-one being that they had to be written within the 1st 100 yrs after the death and Resurrection of the Christ, provably so. The Old Testament, rooted in the Torah, is the history of Jehovah's relationship with His Chosen and prophecies of the coming Messiah to save the world and fulfill the promises HE made. You have NO understanding of the Bible at all.
The overwhelming majority of Canadians supported not allowing Jewish refugees in the 1930s. I think opinion have changed since then.   As for the niqab, I agree that it is in violation of the Canadian belief system. So are Amish or Mennonite values. But I don't have a problem with how those communities behave.  Finally, how many of these regressive countries have you visited? Or has your knowledge been gathered from provocateurs like Margaret, or news channels like Fox and Breitbart?
Simpering virtue signalling vomit.  Have you ever lived near a cemetery or a church, mosque or synagogue?  They don't make for great neighbours.  I would vote no in a referendum too.  And I would want to lever municipal bylaws to prevent them, just as I would for a strip club or a nightclub.  Our media and politicians are falling all over themselves to make this issue an "anti Muslim" one.  What utter nonsense.  They should be ashamed of themselves.  And the sponsors of the cemetery should look for another location.   They might follow the example of the Jewish community in Toronto - look for open fields with good roads and no near neighbours.
Rio  So, what does Israel do now? Democracy? Or apartheid? Disappear. Israel founding in Palestine was a mistake. An understandable, considering the emotions of the time, mistake.   It became more and more obvious as time went by, that Israel in Palestine was not going to work. So what does Israel do now. ..My computer jumped again.... Disappear. By Israelis moving to countries where Jews have done well the US, Canada and on and or buying a chunk of land from a willing country. 1 48th of the size of Texas, same size, similar climate. Ridiculous. How does it stand up compared to establishing Israel in a desert. surrounded by enemies
Publicbraddah,   Go read what Chancellor Hitler did.  To make sure that the Opposition Political Parties could not be Armed like Chancellor Hitler's National Socialist German Worker's Party a Political Labor Union Party.   Chancellor Hitler had the German Government Doctors Rule that All Jews, Russians, Dissidents, Subversives,  were mentally incompetent.  Same as the Obama U.S. Law "Anybody stating a "radical" change to (U.S.) Government is a Homegrown Domestic Terrorist", the Thought is the Felony Crime, not only the Illegal Action.  Irony, 1950 the Defeated Democratic Party used the model of Chancellor Hitler National Socialist German Worker's Party a Political Labor Union Party to Reform the Democratic Party into today's Demoncratic Party,   This is why the Italian Organized Crime Families Owned U.S. Labor Unions, that also had been Reformed using the Model of the NAZI Party, became Allies with the Demoncratic Party, both having the same background and common model.
Yes, but God is also the foundation of the Jewish faith, the Muslim faith, the Zoroastrian faith, the Baha'i faith, the Sikh faith, the Mandaeist faith. It is belief in the Resurrection of Jesus Christ that distinguishes us from other good people.
The Hasbara is the Israeli government propaganda machine, demonizing all who oppose Israeli government policies.  Using the term has  nothing to do with "jew haters".
Palestinian state -  "A Palestinian state would most likely exist if Arafat hadn’t adopted terrorism as the calling card of Palestinian aspirations."  "Or if he hadn’t rejected the offer of a state 17 years ago. Or if he hadn’t renounced his renunciation of terror." . "A Palestinian state would also most likely exist if Arafat’s successor, Mahmoud Abbas ... hadn’t rejected it again nine years ago,  and if Gazans hadn’t turned their territory into a terrifying model of Palestinian statehood,  and if the United Nations didn’t treat Hamas’ attacks on Israel as a nuisance but Israel’s self-defense as a crime against humanity." . "Arab states tried to annihilate the Jewish nation, yet Israel remains unforgiven for its crime of self-preservation" - Bret Stephens: Special to National Post | The New York Times - June 5, 2017
Sounds similar to Hitler's view of the person hood of  Jews.  You are in good company.
It is not as simple as their dress.  Islam requires strict adherence to its religious tenants. Muslims have repeatedly shown that they are not interested in assimilating or being tolerant of other races and religions.  When they reach a certain portion of the population, they attempt to institute their religious practices such as sharia law which is what they have done in Europe and are attempting to do in our country.  They represent a serious danger to our nation as their beliefs are totally contrary to our Constitution, Bill of Rights and our Judeo-Christian beliefs and values.  What you see in Muslim countries is the true face of Islam and they intend to bring this to a place near you in the very near future.
If the Arabs didn’t want to be ‘occupied’ and ‘humiliated’, then they should not have attempted to annihilate the Jews, and they certainly shouldn’t have launched their genocidal forces from our ancient heartland. If you are concerned about world peace and human rights, the pressure should be on the fascists and kings surrounding Israel committed to endless war. 11 million Muslims have been killed since 1948. Less than one percent of those unfortunate souls have been killed in conflict with Israel.
In order to understand the term "islamophobia" we must also understand Islam's own misogyny, homophobia, hatred of Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Europe, America, democracy, dogs, free speech, human rights and now even Canada, and everything else not permitted (haram) by Islam. Even open and blatant racism against white people is now halal  (permitted) .  They want us to believe we are the bad guys.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU7FtJ64z2Y
I've posted "Muslims don't like bacon" 5 times  and each time it disappears within 5 minutes. As an experiment, I also posted "Jews don't like bacon" and that didn't disappear. Seems to me that neither Jews nor Muslims like bacon, and I can't see how it's uncivil to post a statement of fact.
Your Hitler history is a bit limited.    The Jews had the Yellow stars, the gays had the pink triangles, purple triangles were Jehovahs Witnesses, Black Triangle with Blod were mental defectives, Black triangle with a Z for gypsies.  Black triangles also were for prostitutes, alcoholics, drug addicts, vagrants, pacifists, and lesbians,  Red triangles for political prisoners, social democrats, socialists, trade unionists, Freemasons, communists, and anarchists.
What a pack of anti-Semitic propaganda.  'East' Jerusalem has historically been home to Jews, and includes the Old City, the Jewish Quarter, the Western Wall and the Temple Mount.  You have to deny the Bible to deny this.  You have to deny King David, the Jewish Temples, Jesus and archeology, which is what this Globe writer does.   Arabs only invaded Israel in later years. Incredible.
there are no Jews left in Poland   the reason is simple as you and I both know
A rogue state according to the definition that fits the narrative of rogue states like Libya,  Algeria, Russia , North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan - really any Muslim state, communist state, dictatorship etc.   Israel is a constitutional democracy - perhaps one of the very few states in the world where those accustomed to western style freedoms would ever live in. Of course, it's definitely not a place for people who hate Jews, or those that try to equate it with real rogue states in an effort to lend legitimacy to their  evident anti-semitism.
So sorry AAJ - I didn't see this until just now (18 hrs. later).  To begin, you did a very good job answering your own question!  We do have a responsibility to seek the Truth (the Ten Commandments were the basis for that universal value).  And when one looks through the centuries of Judeo-Christian theological writings it is replete with the need for honesty as being a necessary attribute of Children of God.  This is what is so disturbing about the nature of our country at this point.  Just last night I read a very disheartening article in Time magazine that addressed the issue of the purposeful and destructive disinformation websites and radio stations that feed the most irrational, angry, and wild conspiracies ever heard of.  My heart sank as it showed how such thinking is not responsive to even fact-checking.  Distortion feeds distortion. I felt to me like all is lost.  The one hope I have is that if the religions of our country come together and denounce this, we stand a chance?
We would refer to historic Christianity, but I do not claim to speak for all  of them. Why would it make him "not connected" ? The Bible states clearly God is active in his creation, but not part of it, and Christ was born God incarnate. As far as not conceiving God, I guess that would depend on your definition of conceive. We can identify with Christ and he with us, and we can begin to understand God, even though he is infinite. Even some of the outspoken atheists claim humans could have been placed here by an outside intelligence (Dawkins, Degrasse-Tyson and others).   Why is it so difficult to believe:  a) There is a God greater than us  and  b) He created us with a purpose in mind
Taqiyya is the Islamic practice of deception. Muslims are permitted to tell falsehoods to  infidels, Jews, non-Muslims to defend Islam. Taqiyya is as basic to Islam, as charity is to Christianity. Taqiyya is a moral duty. No other religion has such a thing as Taqiyya. It is anathema to western thought, and so it is hard for non-Muslims to understand that it actually exists and is used regularly against western culture and political stability.   The worst part is that the Liberals, police, and news media like the Globe are now giving us  the taqiyya   voluntarily, doing Islams dirty work.
What is Jewish response Bernie??   Oy Vey!!!
Einstein on the creation of Israel,    "I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. Apart from the practical considerations, my awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain – especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight without a Jewish state."    A great genius that foretold of the catastrophe to come.  It is too bad he turned down the offer to become the leader of Israel and instead was disgusted and referred to them as fascists.
"The use of triple parentheses or triple brackets, also known as an (((echo))), is an antisemitic symbol that has been used to highlight the names of individuals of a Jewish background. The practice originated from the far-right blog The Right Stuff; the blog's editors have explained that the symbol is meant to symbolize that the historic actions of members of the Jewish ethnicity had caused their surnames to "echo throughout history".[1] The triple parentheses have been adopted as an online stigma by antisemites, neo-Nazis, and white nationalists to identify individuals of Jewish background as targets for online harassment, such as Jewish political journalists critical of President Donald Trump during his 2016 election campaign.[2][3]"   Yes indeed, pointing out anti-semitism certainly qualifies someone as a "snowflake".  Gary Crum
Correct. Freeland only his her grandfather's Nazi past, glorifying him as a "freedom fighter", as if he had spent the war in the forest with the Polish partisans who fought the nazis and lost their lives, instead of editing a nazi newspaper that glorified the Nazis for the good job that they were doing in exterminating jews. (A newspaper that had been stolen from a jewish owner who was exterminated in a death camp. Grandpa also lived in an apartment vacated by jewish owners as the were sent to death camps.)  Why did Freeland portray him as a victim?
To be fair, I did not state that atheism is a religion, I've only stated that the definitive statement "God does not exist" is not a provable claim. Therefore it is a statement of belief, much like the statement that "God does exist". Basically I've pointed out the similarities between the two camps that are trying to definitively state an answer to a question where no answer is known. For both it's a matter of opinion although often both sides don't seem to feel that way. As for your gumball example I fail to see the distinction. If I think there's an even number of gumballs and you state that I'm wrong- well that is the same as saying there is an odd number of gumballs- which you don't know either. Now if you're just saying "I don't think you know that there are an even number of gumballs, I just think you're guessing" well that's the equivalent of agnosticism. I've always felt, and a quick google confirms, that atheism is the belief that God does not exist.
These incidents don't happen in a vacuum. It's a problem around the world. All I'm saying is there is no political or legal solution. These will only result in more opportunity for corrupt people to occupy positions of power. The most basic metephysical reality is being ignored so there can never be a solution. To live is to take life. That is why we are to place the Trinity before all else. Buddhists recognize this fleeting temporal existence as well. It's time to grow up as a species and not fool ourselves by destroying the rest of life to protect our false God of temporal security
WRONG!  ,  Einstein and Stephen Hawking all agree to one thing: both atheists.
The WW2 Nazi story is not as clear cut as you were taught in school. There were many Jewish officers in Hilter's army. On the eastern front many Ukrainians, particularly from the west, fought with Nazis against the USSR which was perceived as the greater evil.  After the Nazis lost war, they were forced to flee to countries like Canada and the USA rather than face Stalin's gulags or execution as traitors.
Want to see Atheists turn religious real quick ask them to work on Christmas or Easter,then tell them the Christmas party and bonus is  cancelled.Missionaries could not convert them quicker
This is pure baloney.  Atheism and hostility to religion, characteristic of the Obama administration, suffered a setback with the Democrats collapse.
No more Catholic Justices, please! We need an atheist or a secular humanist on the bench.  Enough of the religious bias!!!
Hmm, well maybe we must have a quorum of 12 Jewish apostles present to make the magic work. . .  EFC, You need to educate yourself on this business of "in persona Christi." Now, instead of relying on the Vulgate, the NAB/NABRE Bible on the Vatican and US Bishops' websites has a different translation for 2 Co 2:10 -- "in the presence of Christ" -- not "in the person of." I was not able to find any mention of "in the person of" in the Baltimore Catechism, so I will guess the recent supposedly 'traditional' emphasis on 'in persona' is ironically mostly from Vatican II documents which have it. Just a fad that happens to result in clericalism and discrimination against women. Particularly with "in persona Christi Capitis" -- (Christ the Head who is Jesus, a male). As members of the Christ, women image it. The Eucharist is a remembrance, not a reenactment.  See #1548 in the Catechism for history of Aquinas and 'in persona.' The foundation for a Vatican house of cards.
Let’s remember Liberal/Dem cowering & defunding of US defense led us to: WW I-Wilson(D); WW II-Roosevelt(D); Vietnam-Johnson(D); today’s N. Korea-Clinton/Obama(D) Nevil Chamberlain (L): Declared he negotiated “Peace in Our Time” with Herr Hitler. Covered for Hitler's military buildup and efficient sanitary slaughter of 6 million Jews Lincoln Steffens (L), endorsed by FDR’s brain trust (L-D): Visited Stalin’s Russia. Declared “I've seen the future, and it works!” Covered Stalin’s murder of 20 million Russians Peace protestors (L-D): Screamed till US defunded Military after WW-II, VN, Soviet collapse, and Obama’s era. Made cowardly betrayal America’s hallmark since WW-II: Sent 30,000 under trained underequipped Americans to die holding the line against China’s invasion. Ran away leaving N. Korea’s People in hell. Deserted: Poland’s Freedom Fighters, Cuba’s Bay of Pigs Patriots, Vietnamese who fought by our (my) side, Iraqis 2x, Ukrainians Bullies pick on the weakest. Never the strongest.
Only an alt-right anti-semite would make the assumption that because David Thomson owns/controls Thomson Reuters then he must be Jewish.  You really tipped your hand when you associated being Jewish with slander.
"A key pillar of the colonization of Palestine – from the founding of the State of Israel to the present – has been the Keren Kayemet LeIsrael (KKL), commonly known in English as the Jewish National Fund (JNF). The JNF enjoys charity status in over 50 countries and serves as a global fundraiser for Israeli colonization and apartheid." http://bdsmovement.net/activecamps/jnf StoptheJNF  http://www.ijan.org/category/projects-campaigns/stopthejnf/  Egypt signed a peace treaty in 1979 and has been colluding with Israel in the suppression of Gaza ever since. Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and has been collaborating with Israel ever since. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are collaborating with Israel in attacking Syria.  The Maghreb Arabs have largely been indifferent to Israel. Bahrain has Israelis among their ministers. The Arab peoples are deeply sympathetic to the Palestinians but their governments are pragmatic and cooperative within the US-Israeli neoliberal sphere of influence
There is an old Jewish axiom which says, "From your mouth to God's ear."  May it be so.
No one ignores it. One can't help but note, however, that this same august body organizes the annual Durban conference on human rights, in which the only country that apparently commits them is the Jewish state. You'll further note (one can only hope), if you're honest, that the voters of these events are (in no particular order) Syria, Saudi Arabia, Northern Sudan... shall I go on? It is simultaneously hilarious and tragic.
Sanity from one political party, at last. While Zuma denies, gathers puppet members of parliament to him and has his head up the ---- of the Guptas, while he starts denigrating white people and calling Zille names because he sees a golden opportunity to weaken the DA, Maimane has shown, once again, that he is a good leader. How many light skinned people, how many Jews, were tortured to death by the security police under apartheid for the sake of the right of dark skinned people to vote? Several. If not for the Brits, and later the Afrikaner, putting in roads, infrastructure, running water, bridges, schools etc there wouldn't be any. The ANC would have simply blamed everyone except themselves for their not being there- as usual. A gripe from a white ex-ANC member who is ashamed of the party I represented.
"Atheism" itself has "god" in the word.  As on critique I read some years ago said, atheism, still has not defined itself beyond the opposite of, or negative to a belief in a deity.  In simple terms, Communism failed/fails because its' core focus is simply to be the opposite of capitalism. "if you say black, I say white"  Not a way to build a successful "brand", or philosophy.  If today's religiously indifferent give atheists hope/belief their thought processes are taking hold, they are mistaken...
BTW, if the Bible is without error please tell us which Bible.  After all, there are over 400,000 versions of the bible in existence (that's versions, not translations) and they don't agree.  In fact, the major religions can't even agree on the number of books in the bible.  The Jews have 24 books, the Protestants 39, the Catholics 46, and the Eastern Orthodox have 51. Which is right, which is the perfect one handed down straight from God?
If religion does not belong in schools then take away the Saturday and Sunday as off days from curriculum. They were made off days to accommodate Christians (Sunday) and Jews (Saturdays) for their religious (Holy-days) to accommodate their prayer rituals.  Muslims are only looking for one hour of time to pray on Fridays. They should the up the game and ask Fridays off and watch people go in a riot.
The themes of Hell and Jewish wickedness are also of course found in the Gospels, and may even go back to the historical Jesus. The fateful parable of the wicked tenants (Mk 12:1-12) is the very foundation of supersessionism and is from an older layer of the Synoptic tradition. To what extent does the Spirit allow us to correct the words of Jesus? Did Jesus literally expect the Kingdom to blaze out in glory in a few years (Mk 9:1), so that we are obliged to correct or at least drastically reinterpret his words? Theologically the embarrassment can be solved by distinguishing the limits of his human knowledge from the divine omniscience of the Logos.
I was amused to note how long it took for Ontario to admit a woman to the bar after ruling that Jews could become lawyers- 60 years! And that she would be a rabidly anti-Semitic woman at that plates the irony with gold.
You just failed the first basic rule of interpreting the bible.  Context. Context. Context. Jesus was speaking to JEWS when he said those words.  To see what the Apostles finally decided that Gentile Believers needed to obey from the law, read Acts 15 and 21. "19“Therefore it is my judgment that we do not trouble those who are turning to God from among the Gentiles, 20but that we write to them that they abstain from things contaminated by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood".  Notice that it says that Believers are to abstain from sexual immorality (porneia).  It really says nothing about baking a wedding cake for a homosexual couple.  In my opinion, that does not exercise the Second Greatest Commandment as voiced by Christ, nor does it employ The Golden Rule.  What would it look like if I, in my capacity as a Police Officer said to a homosexual couple, "I am sorry, but I really cannot protect or serve you because you are homosexuals"?
Atheism is the denial or rejection of the believers claims there is a god.  You can get there because the people who claim that there is don't offer up much in the way of good evidence to support their claim.  There is no requirement for the non-believer to prove anything.
Mormonism?
I'm a agnostic and quite comfortable being so.  Many Christians are comfortable with their beliefs as well.  That's fine....no problem for me.  I don't condemn Christians for their beliefs, nor do I Muslims, Buddists, Hindu, Shinto, or athiests or whatever.  However, I do tire of those who are firmly convinced theirs is the "only true path" and all others must join them or be forever damned to Hell (with a capital H).  I don't care what Mr. Pence believes so long as those beliefs a) don't hurt anyone else and b) he doesn't attempt to force them on others.  Clearly, his political history shows he hasn't hesitated to support legislation which does, in fact, force his particular brand of "christian" beliefs on others.  Gary Crum
Funny how atheists talk about God more than anyone else; even when completely irrelevant to the story.  You guys are more obsessed with "religion" than any religious nut could ever be.
I've traveled to places where people's primary identification is with their religion. Where cities are divided into "The Muslim quarter", "the Jewish Quarter", "the Christian Quarter", etc. Where villages are identified as "a Christian village" or "a Muslim village" or "a Jewish village". That's people'S primary social identity.  Canada and most of the modern, western world have managed to avoid that kind of sectarian social division, people live in religiously mixed neighborhoods and don't even know what religion their neighbours are for the most part, it isn't relevant in everyday life.  So sad to see that might be ending and we are going the way of primary identification by religion. Is this really what anyone thinks was intended by "official multiculturalism"?
Are you now asking us to assume/consider that 'the ten atheists' aren't there?  If 'Yes' to that - then why did you mention them in the first place? Your use of capital letters isn't improving your argument.
Earth Man - are you seriously suggesting that 'low wages & dog-eat-dog conditions' were created by multicultural diversity???? What about free trade?, technology?.... I don't believe we live in 'dog-eat-dog conditions'. We have a pretty high standard of living in this country & some of that is due to immigrants - the Chinese who built our major railroad, the Vietnamese boat people, our Jewish community etc. Most of the posters on this comment section are right wing whiners & complainers. All these negative comments, mainly about newcomers, are shameful.
The deranged young man who murdered & injured people in the Quebec City mosque was charged with murder and under Canada's Hate Crime Laws.  The Toronto 18 were noticed & reported to police who prevented that murderous attack. What is it about 'social' (antisocial) media that causes young men to perform such acts, using religion as a 'reason'?   I object to special protection for 'religious minorities' -  Islam, Christianity & Judaism are not 'minorities', though they originated in the same part of the world and migrated elsewhere to compete.  These belief systems are based upon unsubstantiated stories written & revised over 100s of years.  As denominations, they denominate or divide human groups for no good reason.  We do not follow building codes, medical procedures, etc, from 100s of years ago. Religion was and remains a political system to gain power and remains so in the hardened inflexible theocracies of the Middle East. Canada must remain a modern secular nation.
You are well entitled to your atheism, BossMan, but not to your open and repellent hatred of organized religion. But carry on! Did your folks make you go to Sunday school when you were a stripling, and to wear those itchy wool pants on each such an occasion? LOL (again!).
To me it was a valid question, knowing full well the power and political influence of  the ABC in comparison to Australia at least. I recall now Archbishop Anthony Fisher's delight when bragging  how many Catholics were in positions of power running the country [including a high court judge], on either side of the two main  political parties, allowing the sex-abuse cover-up  for so long.  It was only when an atheist, childless and living in sin first woman prime minister who came to their rescue calling  for a Royal Commission, voted  out of  her position, for her audacity and  suffered dismally as the hands of in particular, one prominent foul mouthed  ex seminarian Catholic politician, who in turn dumped now crowing from the back seat seeking re-election God forbid.
Israel is a multi-religion multi-ethnic Democracy, and not unlike the United States, is full of squabbles that are political, religious, ethnic in ramification. I remember when the Mayor of Dublin was Jewish and the President of Israel was Irish. You can bring up hundreds of tales of nastiness and medical malfeasance from anywhere. The incident you are bringing up in your post (sorry, you might be shouting your messages but I cannot hear you, I can only read 'em) is called "The Ringworm Incident" in Wikipedia (probably dominated by people plotting against you) and involved a lot of historical events, some of 'em involving radiation, some involving UNICEF. You can probably go into the Israeli papers (free press, remember!) and dig up HUNDREDS of scandals.
To you as an agnostic, atheist, or something along those lines.  And so ... ?
I agree. Let's not interfere in Myanmar, or we are asking for Buddhist terrorist bombers on our own soil later...
When did the mystical god start filling the Presidential speeches? What happened to the separation of church and state? The founding fathers were intelligent atheists. Trumps spouting off about god was just plain ludicrous. He is appealing to the lowest form of intellect in the US..
I scrolled down for more information about this tragedy, only to be confronted with someone rude enough to try to make this about himself and his beliefs. I don't begrudge you those beliefs, but this is the worst possible time for you to flaunt them, in the worst possible forum, and I specifically logged in to 1) flag your comment, and 2) request that you keep your faith as private as you would undoubtedly hope a Muslim or a Hindu would on subjects such as these. For all you know, the victim was Jewish, and would find your hijacking of his death to flaunt your faith an insult to his.  "And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full." - Matthew 6:5
The reason Abbas does not need, or want, to agree to this scenario, is that there already are two states in the old British Mandate for Palestine. A Jewish state - Israel, and an Arab state - TransJordan Palestine, later TransJordan, today just Jordan, a majority Palestinian country though ruled by the Hashemite refugees kicked out of Arabia by the Saudi tribe. Dividing the CisJordan Palestine further would create three states, two Arab and one Jewish, and leave Abbas in charge of the smallest of the three, sandwiched between large Palestinian state to his east ruled by a hostile and fearful non-Palestinian minority elite, and equally hostile, technologically, militarily and economically powerful,  Jewish state to his west.
(...CONTINUED FROM ABOVE)  They’re the descendants of a people originating in the region the Black Sea, related to the Turks, known as the Khazari.  Who says so?  Ashkenazi Jewish scholar Arthur Koestler said so!  B-b-but Genesis proclaims that the Covenant between God and Abraham (alayhis-Salaam) for the land of Canaan was established with the latter and his SEED—which the Ashkenaziim clearly were NOT, except the offspring of those who in relatively recent times took wives from among Semitic Jews.  Otherwise Ashkenaziim are NOT party to the Abrahimic Covenant, but the SEMITIC Palestinians are, because they are in fact of Abraham’s SEED by his eldest son. And Deuteronomy (Mosaic Law) warns that, even if the eldest son is of a HATED wife, he is NOT to be deprived of his inheritance (God's Orders).  Thus, in trying to ‘have it both ways’ by arguing both in terms of religion AND ancestral occupancy to rationalize the Zionist usurpation, you don’t get it EITHER way.  Khalas.
You seem to forget that the Jewish community was very unhappy since quite a few of those NAZI scientists were also war criminals who evaded justice thanks to those operations. So if you're going to use an analogy you need to follow it through. In your own analogy - Zille (and perhaps white South Africans in general) may be America, but black South Africans would be the Jewish holocaust survivors. And there's another flaw in the analogy. Jewish people today are still well under 1% of the US population. Americans could storm-roll their interest in that regard and get away with it because they weren't enough to influence an election. We have the OPPOSITE scenario here. Every voter the DA can possibly gain in future has to come from the black community. It's not like the FF+ will lose voters to the DA. They can't afford to piss them off the way Eisenhower could afford to piss of the American Jews..
It cannot  be undone?  Well, I dont know.  I can think of Americans, perhaps the Israeli people, French in World War 2, Viet Nam etc.  Just give it time Lad.  History is a long time you know.  Just ask the Jewish people who said, "One day in Jerusalem.."   I say... One day in Vegreville!!!.
I'm not sure exactly what it is others don't like about this comment, but it's obvious that truth has a way of effecting the ignorant negatively. It's akin to the mentally unstable people who do no research at all arguing with those who spent hours, days, months or even years researching facts.  Sometimes I think "anti-Semite" is Jewish code for whistleblower.
I have had a religious left blog and blogtalkradio sites for over a decade and once had a column in the DC Examiner. In the new world of the Internet you don’t have to have a tenured position or regular column to have a voice in this. What we offer  is a baptism of the positions that God is not angry, morality can  and must be humanistic and that one need not be an atheist to propound left wing and socialist economic solutions (or to follow them).
Considered in the Bible to be against the moral directives of the day by persons writing their own opinions on the subject.  You probably refer to Leviticus, as most Christians do.  Those proscriptions were written for the Levites, not Christians.  Christians were thousands of years away from even being invented.  Why Christians even read the Old Testament is beyond me. That was written by and for those of the Abrahamic religions of the day (Jews and Arabs). Christ came along much later, and only then did people start calling themselves "Christians," or followers of Christ.  Interestingly, even then, they were Messianic Jews for almost-400 years, until a Roman Emperor compiled his own version of the Bible, which is still largely in use today.  So you may follow the opinions of ancient scribes if you wish, but just know of what those consist, please.
Rationalthought... You're just being subjective though, you cite "the balance of evidence in support of atheism" but what evidence is that? Does the fact that we're pretty sure how the big bang worked preclude the existence of God? Of course not. Does the fact that reasonable people agree on evolution mean God does not exist? Nope. So what "evidence" are you referring to? You state "the logical starting point is there is no god" but of course that's simply your opinion- there's nothing logical about it (and please don't cite Occam's razor).  And my position that atheists are required to cite evidence has nothing to do with any "starting point" it's just a rule of logic. And this is where atheism differs from agnosticism, if you're saying you don't know if God exists (or don't care), then fine, no evidence required, but if you're going to positively state that he doesn't then you need to provide evidence or recognize that you're stating an opinion.
Isn't the "Jewish" State of Israel, itself an unwanted "Monument" to the WWII-era German "Holocaust"? It is built mostly on lands stolen from Middle Eastern Arab Christian and Muslim Palestinians. To my knowledge, Hitler's atrocities were committed mostly in Europe.
The Charter does NOT say that people have to pray in school.How long has it been since the Lord's Prayer was banished from the public school system?Or do Judeo-Christian values carry less weight than Islamic values?Separation of mosque/church and state has to be part of a Western liberal democracy.
What happened to the "root causes" meme? When Justin was still just "the Heir with the Hair," he was going to give all the poor disaffected terrorists jobs -- of course the root cause of a Jewish boy's mental ill health is less, uh, useful. Oh well, Gerald Butts' cousin or whichever Liberal connection will appreciate the cushy job "managing" this $50 million endeavor.
Republicans brags about being godly Christians/Catholics.  In the Jesus' parable of the good samaritan He mentions the priest and the Levite.  Jesus must have had a good reason for mentioning those two religious Jews.  Both did nothing but leave the injured man for dead and they passed on the far side of the road.  The Republican affluent KKK Christians are the priest and Levite that Jesus mentions about.  They want to see lots of people suffer and die just like the Veterans Admin.
<<well, yes, he didn't want to abolish it, only fulfill that covenant and beginning a new covenant.>>  Well, that's the theology.  No, "the Jews" didn't kill Jesus; the Roman empire executed him. Certain Jewish authorities were also complicit. It may be that the story in John is reliable concerning Caiaphas and his calculation that "it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish."
Ok Epnd, I'm curious, I'll bite.  Why the big hatred for Jews?
If I don't read it I can't honestly call it garbage :>) Jonah Goldberg isn't the AEI, he is a paid tool of the AEI, a conservative "think tank" founded in 1938 by Lewis Brown, an asbestos magnate. The National Review was founded by William F. Buckley, probably the Right's most rationally coherent expositor. I would hope that with that background, Goldberg could come up with something more convincing than this, what Hindus refer to as "gobar gas".
Sure, check out my rather neglected web page: www.mahayanatheology.net. Check the home page and go from there. Early on I read with profit J. D. Crossan, but he soon began to wander into far-left theology. Meier's first volume on Jesus, the Marginal Jew, seemed rather dry when first I read it, since it was so taken with setting up a methodology for historical Jesus studies, but his next three (still waiting for the last, fifth volume -- Meier has heath problems) knocked my socks off. His method differed from Crossan (and Funk, etc.) by not dating the Gospel of Thomas (or of  Peter of the Cross Gospel) so early, since most place them in the second century or later. Still, his guiding rule is attractive: whatever is concluded must meet the acceptance of an "unholy enclave," composed of a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jew, and an agnatic), so he could be reasonably sure his conclusions would meet the approval of people doing just history, rather than left (Ehrman) or right (Barth) theology.
“Due to her prompt and timely intervention, Rousso was released,” Golsan said. Rousso, 62, is a senior researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research, or CNRS, which the Egyptian-born scholar and author joined in 1981.  His work centers on the history and memory of traumatic pasts, France in WWII and the post-war period, his profile on the CNRS website says. Rousso's current study involves the relationship between history, memory and justice.  Rousso’s scholarship focuses on the memory of the Vichy regime, the darkest chapter in modern French history, when the government of unoccupied France openly collaborated with Nazi Germany in World War II. Vichy authorities are particularly infamous for assisting the Germans in rounding up and deporting tens of thousands of Jews from France during the Holocaust, a horrible truth that Rousso once called “the past that does not pass.”
Cyrus, in Isaiah 45, is also called the "messiah" of Yahweh, the only non-Jew accorded that title.
Thank you Mr. Rieder for an excellent column.  I especially hope many younger people read it, for this was a war that ended 72 years ago and there are few of us around who still remember it.  As I'm  sort  of from your father's generation I have similar memories, from all the uncles and aunts who served, to participating in  childhood drives for wanted materials. You are quite correct that it's absurd to equate the neo-Nazi marchers with the antifa and other protestors.  Yes, some of the antifa are pretty disgusting, just thugs in black, and they might be as likely to slug a peaceful protestor as a white supremacist; and it's high time they return to strictly defensive activity. Bad as they are, they not even close to the ideology of the neo-Nazis whose antecedents killed tens of millions of Poles, Jews, Russians and other "inferiors" as they controlled and devastated most of Europe-- after their SA street fighters  had overwhelmed those of the Socialists, Communists and Nationalists.
AHHA maybe you could vote for Jill Stein for president. She is also a Jew Hater. The Hebrews have learned to cultivate the desert. And given the technology away. As with their cutting edge IT and medicine advances. Not once since the rebirth of their nation have they tried nation building. Every Muslim country around them anticipates their destruction. At least we know where you stand though. That's cool. Everyone needs a villian.
In Hitler's Germany it was the Jewish people. In Trump's America, it's the Muslims. Now we have 2 residents of Canada acting out Trump's hate in their attack in the Mosque. We should all be horrified and disgusted.
The problem was not founding a oder state of Israel in Palestine, it was that nothing was done for the Palestinians and no formal relations set up between Israel and its neighbours. Add to that the fact that the US has blindly supported Israel from Day One no matter what it does and you arrive where we are today. The big mistakes were made almost 100 years ago and nothing has been learned since. There WILL be a state of Israel where it is now, close to the origins of the Jewish people, but we can only hope that somebody will fix the mess that Churchill et al created and that somebody has to the the US but not with Trump!
Rejecting unproven assertions is a negative act, and unnecessary as well. If something is unproven one way or the other, it's logical and beneficial to keep an open mind about it.   ACTING on an unproven assertion is another matter. Doing so could have negative consequences, but also beneficial ones.  Your claim that atheism is nothing more or less than the denial of god is dogmatic and simplistic, not to mention contradictory of your claim that it has no doctrine. Dogma is what religions offer the simple-minded. Atheism has much more to offer.
No problem--as soon as Israel becomes a GODLY nation.  Hasn't happened over the last 50 years.  In fact you refer to an atheist, secular nation that wrongly usurps the holy name of "Israel", and has been little more than an unleashed wild beast to its neighbors since the Ashkenaziim invasion.
Hallo Loy, you write  "And I have my baptismal and marriage promises to keep . I like to see them as bonds of love ."   So you are an exception. Most of us were baptised as babies. The fact that we are born into an institutionalised religion has often been the basis for religious wars. No child is born as a catholic, a protestant, a muslim, a buddhist, an atheist and so on (maybe with the exception of being born of a Jewish mother). Our confession is the result of education, or - if you like - of vocation, grace. But I am deviating of this topic of women in the RCC. Sorry.
Some Japanese join forces to commit acts of sexual and medical crimes.  Most of them are Buddhists and Christians who attend church for years and years.  Both men and women working together for evil.
"The right-wing Israeli leader later insisted that Jewish settlements were “not the core of the conflict” and made no commitment to reduce settlement building."  Pushing Palestinians aside has been the core of the conflict from day one.  All else falls from this.
Oh please. You're so desperate to savage Trump that you'll attack him for demolishing a building that the City of New York has knocked down in the hundreds?  Mind you, your thesis doesn't sink as low as that of a recent Globe & Mail editor. He or she stated- I'm not joking here- that Donald Trump praised a white supremacist that rejected him for letting his daughter marry a Jew.
There is an old Jewish joke about how "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth will leave everyone blind and toothless".
I guess the same goes for Catholics and Anglicans.
Although the founders were careful to omit direct reference to Christ, it's clear that the US became a great nation for the next 200 or so years based on Judaeo-Christian principles. You can't name a Catholic/Muslim/atheist country that's done nearly as well during the same period. Of course, it's all going to heck in a handbasket now...
Thank you for negotiating. What is there about atheism that implies "a system of . . . worship"? There is no worship involved. No requirement for a system, either -- just a belief there is no God or gods.
Commentary like yours is why so many have difficulty believing that atheism isn't a religion.  You are speaking like everyone who disagrees with your chosen faith is a heretic.
Which revelations? Jesus was a Jew.  My point is that the Hebrew scriptures can be and are cited by both sides of the debate.
I remember being carted off to ABT as a grade schooler in order to help another child in the neighborhood win a bicycle. They gave prizes away to whichever children brought the most friends to Sunday school. I remember being terrified as one of the speakers threateningly held aloft a large wooden paddle with a menacing, tiki-style face carved into it.   A Jewish neighbor, who was an attorney through the '70s and '80s and then a judge, used to talk to me about Prevo's sermons in the '70s wherein he spoke at length on the evils of the ni**ers and Jews.
Donald Trump's voter base will be emboldened by this speech. It will probably Garner more support from those that have been on the fence where he and his agenda are concerned. The Jewish and Christian faith have been under attack from the liberal media and ALT left groups for a number of years. A double standard considering all of the other groups that the alt left supports.
Sorry Allie but you view that Hawaii is dominated by non-whites is not correct. The whites with a group of  some others (Jews, Asians and outsiders) still run things.  You also see in recent years,  a number of globalist billionaires added to this group.  They tend to stay in the background and hide their influence and power.  They do not want to wake up most  here who are asleep.  They learned long ago that this is a smarter strategy rathe than making their control obvious.  They have a variety of people of different ethnic groups to be their front people.
The wisest of the wise have always accepted and proclaimed the proverbs, or poetry, of King Solomon, who asked God for nothing more than the wisdom to lead and rule his nation righteously .  The principles of godliness in the Holy Bible direct the men and women who preside in government to be moral and spiritual examples of righteousness.  There is no "separation of church and state" in the U.S. Constitution, but, rather, a First Amendment mandate that the federal government shall not establish a religion or restrict its free exercise.  Thomas Jefferson coined that phrase in letter to a Christian church.  It was stated as opinion, not as a law.  I believe what Jefferson meant was that the men and women who constitute the government bring to it their morality and Judeo-Christian godliness to make the  republic function on Judeo-Christian righteousness and principles.  This is merely obedience to the Ten Commandments, and is only natural law and common sense!  Roy Moore has common sense.
Pizi It makes no sense to occupy a strip of land partially occupied by and surrounded by your enemies. Nothing to do with ownership of the land.  If Jews bought Palestine, their reception would be the same. It makes no sense to..........................
A lot of Hindu nationalist are attacking Mosque in India and burning them down. Which side are you on?
I grew up as a visible minority in Shawinigan (Québec) and he's going to be a tough sell there. The leader of the Bloc Québécois and Québec NDP MPs have said as much. Imagine if a Roman Catholic cleric became leader of a major federal party and refused to give up his religious garb while trying to convince Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus and Buddhists that his faith doesn't influence his policy outlook. This is what Jagmeet Singh is trying to do. I wish him well, but it won't be easy to campaign in Chicoutimi, Moncton, Red Deer and other small communities.
Judaic prohibitions against any sexual behavior that did not result in children were based on the instinct of tribal preservation. (I learned that long ago from a Jew.) Christianity inherited its prohibitions against non-procreative sexual activity from Judaism, so if there's to be any discussion about the Judeo-Christian tradition "accepting" LGTB behaviors (or any other non-procreative activity, for that matter) then an "honest investigation" should begin with a discussion about whether or not tribal preservation in the twenty-first century is indeed a valid reason for making gay people's lives a living hell. I submit that it is not. But please, argue away...
Take and eat, not take and worship. As a Jew he would have been very uncomfortable about his flesh being used as an object of idolatry
Change what, pray tell?     Why isn't there a huge national moment about Asians demanding change?  Or Jews?  We don't see either of them kneeling, yet are they not subject to racism, systemic or otherwise?
The only ones distracted by Tim Tebow were atheists.
Yes, abolish the culture and start over... Roman Catholicism is not divinely instituted, if you knew your church history you would not make such an uninformed statement... in doing so you are playing right into the hands of the pompous hierarchs and will never know the freedom of "new life" in Christ.  Pope Francis has made some strides in this regard but will fall plenty short in the eyes of some.    And I have news for you, the "sins of the priest" do matter. Deviant behavior from our so-called "alter Christus" is proof positive that they are not ontologically gifted, another remnant from Jewish/Hellenistic/pagan society that should be let go... at least the magic part as there is plenty of evidence to the contrary.   Do you really believe that Jesus had in mind all the pomp and circumstance associated with medieval Roman/pagan pageantry, combined with a 5-syllable word known as Magisterium when he commissioned the twelve? Please, do a little research on this and see for yourself.
Hindus are the majority in Kerala - more than half of the population. Then come Muslims and Christians. The current state government is a coalition of leftist parties, with the Chief Minister coming from the Communist Party of India (Marxist).
Re the school "issue"...this is SO easy.  We already accommodate Christian prayer (Sunday is off) and Jewish prayer (Saturday is off) so there is no need to "accommodate" those prayers during the school week.  Extend the school day's hours and make the school week Monday through Thursday and the problem is solved.  All three religions have their weekly holy days accommodated: Friday, Saturday and Sunday plus everybody gets a 3-day weekend every weekend.  What a concept!
When did civic pride and love of family become religious nonsense.  And I have no issue with the value you place in philosophies developed by atheists.   I would expect the same tolerance from you for the value I place in the values taught in my Christian life.
I have been to 12 step meetings of 10 atheists gathered for spirituality and I solemnly assure you that Jesus was there.  It is why such programs work (and it is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit to say otherwise, so save your soul and keep quiet - a sentiment that also applies to denying gay marriage).
There were no prayers  Christian Jewish or Muslim n public school 20 years ago. That is a lie.   Soon we will be told the Constitution n is based on Islamic principles.
Jesus did heal on the Sabbath and engaged any number of other actions deemed sinful by the official hierarchy of his time.  He was not an all or nothing,  black and white Jewish believer.  One could say He had the capacity to be a relativist.
I'm not trying to be clever. What about a second trimester pre-born child, or a third trimester? When would you consider it killing a human life? I'll get some new material when abortion is finally called what it truly is, the deliberate killing of an unborn child.  You don't consider the unborn child a person, with any God given rights,  neither did Hitler consider a Jew a person.  The Hutu's did not consider the Tutsi's as persons as well.  God's commandment - Thou shall not Kill.    A  fetus may not have been born yet, but it is still a living human being.
Palestine and Arab League the Apartheid of non-Arabs,  the Apartheid of non-Muslims (like Christians, Jews, Bahai even) the Apartheid of infidels the Apartheid of women the Apartheid of atheists the Apartheid of people who don't dress modestly
The published objective of the protest was the removal of confederate statues.  It is appropriate for Trump to address that.  If he were asked specifically about anti-Jew remarks divorced from the statue issue, he would condemn the anti-Jewish remarks.  If the media care one little bit for truth or facts they would not interpret they would ask Trump whether he condemns anti-Semitic remarks.  He would, of course, condemn same.
(Sigh).  I don't 'doubt' that 'Zionist' doesn't mean 'Semite', I KNOW it doesn't.  Zionism is a political movement.  "Judaism" is a religious faith.  Semite is an 'ethnic' group defined in part by speaking one or more of a family of languages that (probably) originated in North Africa: these peoples include Arabs, non-European Jews, certain Ethiopian lineages, El-Tigreans, Somalians, Assyrians, Samaritans and others.  The primary languages that characterize them are Arabic, Aramaic, Hebrew, Amharic and Tigrinya.  And I quoted Moshe Dyan, Menachem Begin and Ariel Sharon.  The latter two are indeed liars, although Dyan seems to have repented somewhat of his earlier lies, if his later statements are any indication.  And Allah Knows Best.  And you couldn't resist the 'self-hating' crack, even though I demonstrated lack of any basis to do so.  I don't hate myself for my Semite heritage.  Rather proud of it, actually.  It connects me to Father Abraham (alayhis-Salaam).
Well, one would think that if I'd changed the hypo, or as you call it "the basis of [my] scenario," you'd have pointed out the change.   But you didn't.  So I ask you:  Where did I change the hypo?      As I said before, my using caps was not to "yell," but literally to allow you to see the noun phrase that you had missed.  I'm having to repeat myself again.    ********** " . . . since your original basis (your 'ten atheists' example) was unsustainable in terms of the Church's practice and instructions for celebration of the Mass."  Let's assume that's true --- and it may be --- that a Mass said with only ten attendees, all of them atheists, has no just and reasonable cause.  What does that have to do with the point under discussion, i.e., whether transubstantiation is objectively real?  Absolutely nothing.    Are you now going to argue for the first time, after some 15 bites at the apple, that a Mass said without just and reasonable cause has no transubstantiation?
Alt-right....Alt-left......both are two peas in the pod.  If David Duke asked "Are you Jewish"....an alt-left will asked "are you a hater". Then both will dismissed you for challenging their views. Personally, I think both kind of feed off each other, their agendas are so ugly that I would think there will be a support group combining the two! I am reminded of 1933 Weimar Republic had to face a choice between alt-right and alt-left. I hope we will never get into that mode.
I don't have a problem with a sede commenting here per se, just be honest enough to admit where you're coming from that's all.  In my view (and that of most Catholics including the Holy Father), it really makes no sense for a sede to comment here since they are rather nasty and completely out of step with modern Catholicism. I have not seen such nastiness from Orthodox, Protestant and Jewish commentators, have you?
The truth of the matter is that the Magnitsky Act was lobbied for by a foreign Jewish Oligarch (Browder, who never even met Magnitsky) and written by Ukrainian-Canadian MP/Senators Bezan, Andreychuk and Freeland.  https://openparliament.ca/bills/42-1/C-267/?tab=mentions  This has more to do with old-world tribal rivalries, than it does with modern Canadian diplomacy. This is going to hurt Canada.
There are essentially no people who would identify themselves as atheist in these countries because atheism is punishable by death. On the other hand, Christians in these countries are singled out for persecution whether by official policy or as a result of traditional hostility towards them.  On the whole, I think Trump's pronouncements are unhelpful. They seem to have more to do with impressing his base of support than anything else.
I think it's a safe guess that the irony of someone making a racist comment while condemning others for racism would be lost on the original poster.  Do me a favour, replace the word "white" with "Jewish", "Asian" or "Native" and then re-read your message and see how it sounds.  Would you post that?  Or are you only ok with stereotyping and discriminating against people of one specific skin colour.
There are a number of countries and cultures who feel horse meat is taboo: Wikipedia, Horse Meat, Attitude of various cultures ...It is not a generally available food in some English-speaking countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, the United States, and English Canada. It is also taboo in Brazil, Israel, and among the Romani people and Jewish people the world over. Horse meat is not generally eaten in Spain, except in the north, although the country exports horses both live animals and slaughtered meat for the French and Italian markets. Horse meat is consumed in some North American and Latin American countries, and is illegal in some countries. For example, the Food Standards Code of Australia and New Zealand definition of 'meat' does not include horse.[21]
The Romans reserved crucifixion for treason, and so Jesus of Nazareth was executed for treason against the Roman state.  The notion he was executed to appease the Jews appears in the last Gospel, chronologically, written in the late 1st or early 2nd century by authors who were not present and did not witness Jesus' life to better appeal to Roman audiences by shifting blame for his death to the Jews (who were despised in the Roman world by that point due to the Revolt a generation after Jesus' ministry).
What about male mutilation, aka as circumcision? Oh wait, that's a Judeo-Christian thing.  Nevermind.
you only bothered to read the first 5 words of the definition you posted.  Where is the "and worship" in an atheists life?   You are incorrect based on the definition you posted
Only point of disagreement is that Jews regained their land.
No one taught it.  Liberal dissidents just like to arbitrarily limit unchanging dogma to the creed because in doing so they think they are on solid ground when they demand the Church bring the Gospel into line with liberal, secular, atheistic and humanistic values.
What is interesting and what journalists, politicians and educators have yet to explore is why? Why would a group designate our children as especially desirable terror targets?  The answer is right in front of our noses but we refuse to see it; we are the targets of a genocidal campaign of murder by any means possible. We are the new Jews, the new Armenians. They want to end our future and eliminate us from eternity so their culture and narrative can fill the void. It's that simple. And when it's that simple the liberal assumptions that govern our politics start to lose their meaning and validity.  Which is why liberal commentators are too fearful to reason out the logic of the situation.  But it can't last like this so it wont.  New leaders are coming, soon.
I've never seen so many racist,  anti Jewish  posts .  What a shame that these people have fallen for the "palestinian"  propaganda so prevalent  today.  I suggest you take a look at those people  and see how often a peace proposal has been offered to them, and all the "Palestinians" do is double the tunnel digging,  the knifing of unarmed civilians,  the killing of little girls and boys,  and teaching in their schools how to cut a Jewish person's throat.  I could go on,  however this lot only believes the propaganda,  and can't think for themselves.
Even Jesus was portrayed as a Caucasian ================== Well.. isn't it because he was a Caucasian? You know.. his mother was Jew... And his father was also .. hm.... Jew.
This is a fascinating article on the historical Jesus, thank you !!! If he existed, he was not Harvey the Rabbit my best bud, but a real person living in a real historical context. Much that has been said religiously about Jesus actually does not honor him, but dishonors him, making him into something that as a Jew, he would never have agreed to. "Zealot" tells me that Jesus was a participant in a civil war, his opponents the wealthy Romans and their collaborators the wealthy Jews -- a class war, with Jesus just your everyday insurrectionist; and the Gospel just propaganda to turn this violent person into a 'nice-nice' Jew, so as to sell Christianity, if I understand correctly. But I would prefer to think of Jesus as really wise and peaceful, not a soldier. Keep in mind though, the Gospel may be not so much history as it is agenda-driven and reactionary. Nevertheless, the Gospel lessons on non-violently disarming your opponent are relevant always, as the analysis in the article shows
"Reconciliation must succeed for the well being of our communities and for the future of our children".  What does this mean?  Since she is a Liberal, I'm worried that it infers Canadians with immigrant roots like myself are now personally liable for crimes committed against the Natives by prior Anglo-Saxon colonizers whom I have no association or connection with.  The problem with Liberals is that they don't judge people as individuals, but by their lineage.  Sure glad I'm not a Smith or MacDonald, otherwise the Liberals would consider me guilty just like how Hitler considered the Jews guilty because of their ancestry.
Will the Muslim MPs also  condemn these passages from the Qur'an that are taught to their children?   -Kill then wherever ye find them- Qur'an 2:191 -Make war on the disbelievers... living in your neighbourhood 9:123 -Slay the idolaters and take them captive 9:5 -Any religion other than Islam is not accepted 3:85 -The Jews and Christians are perverse in their beliefs 9:30 -...those who disbelieve... as for the thief.. both male and female... cut off their hands 5:36-38 -...the believers and disbelievers are two opponents 22:19 -...the disbelievers are a folk without intelligence 8:65 -...take not a disbeliever as your friend 3:28 -...smite the necks and each finger (of those who disbelieve) 8:12-13 Mohammed Marmaduke Pickthall Translation, 2009   Clearly, one could argue that the phobia goes both ways-- and regarding the purveyor of  this motion, "The lady doth protest too much, methinks."

Unfortunately, hoaxes are not unusual. Here's a website that actually tracks some of them, http://fakehatecrimes.org/. I remember an incident where a Jewish girl painted swastikas on her dormitory door, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_bK7eW_3v0. Here's a recent example, https://tinyurl.com/jd4mwg5 Agendas can vary at times and some are no doubt spooks for the gov't (or *a* gov't) but in general there's big money to be made for "anti-racist," "anti-hate" watchdog groups - think SPLC, the ADL and PRA - who use McCarthy-like witch-hunt tactics of "links" and "ties" and "guilt by association."  Laird Wilcox was on to this decades ago. His extensive work is archived in the Kenneth Spencer Research Library at the University of Kansas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3nrb69Wr3o. See his well-researched piece, Crying Wolf: Hate Crime Hoaxes in America, http://www.fakehatecrimes.org/Crying-Wolf-by-Laird-Wilcox.pdf.  and his book on extremist groups co-authored by late professor, John George.
Wow, a Wente column that I can actually agree with!  I see most people trying to be fair dealing with a rapidly changing world where we interact with people of many cultures, races and backgrounds.   We all have our biases and things that raise our hackles on an unconscious level.  Yet most of us try to be civil and deal as fairly as we can.  To me, that is progress over the days when any stranger was someone to fear and hitting first was considered the right thing to do.  I hear stories about the 1950's where gangs of guys would fight just because one group was French Canadian and another was English Canadian or Jewish or whatever.  This was Ottawa in the 50's.
Well, the Supreme Court finally as a Protestant (along with 5 Catholics and three Jews) --  Judge Neil Gorsuch, who has a Catholic connection via Georgetown Prep. If he doesn't get appointed by consensus, the Republican Senate can opt to use the so called "nuclear option." But he is certain to be appointed. (I am sure Hardiman will be Trump's next appointment.)
How could we have anti-semitism here in Canada, the plaque at the memorial made no mention of Jews at all???  Canada is back. Liberal Canada that is.
I'm surprised that a strong follower of an organized religion with the associated dogma, rituals, and other practices, doesn't understand what a religion is.  Atheism is the absence of religious beliefs.   It is not a religion.
This opens a big can of worms. Are Catholic students allow a room for praying and fasting during Holy Week? Or for Jewish students during Passover? Why is the government allowing the district to play favourites?
As a fellow atheist, I agree with much of this. However, I think it is unrealistic to love thy neighbour as thyself and think that very few act this way. While we cannot expect love for all, we can expect and demand respect for all.
There was no Aramaic word for church. It comes from the Greek translation. Jesus' followers were Jews and continued to worship at the Temple. The notion of church came with Paul and his ministry. It was later institutionalized by Constantine with creeds and doctrines and buildings. The Kingdom of God was a direct relationship with Divine Love. His followers didn't understand it any better than most of us today. Jesus died a Jew. He was a human. After his resurrection, his friends did not recognize him initially but did after he revealed himself. Maybe, they saw him differently? Maybe spiritually?  Jesus promised to be present when two or three gather in his name. It doesn't require an institutional church, just followers or disciples. I prefer the Vatican 2 description of Church as People of God or Disciples. Jesus taught us to love God and others as God loves us. With the Holy Spirit and the Kingdom of God, why do we need a church or priests?
Many of them were communist. One of the reasons communism was conflated with anti-semitism.
She probably views them the same way that she views the Russian brigade that fought for the Werrmacht, the Dutch SS troops and the Jews who aided in the roundup of their fellows, known as the Judenrat.  What's your point?
Why the racist and religous bigotry? Criticise him if you like but what does his religon or ethnicity have to do with it. By the way, Rahm Emmanuel is not Muslim. He is Jewish. The first Jewish Mayor of Chicago.
Some Christian and Muslim regimes were more tolerant than others, depending on a host of political and social factors. Trying to say Christianity was intrinsically worse than Islam  is silly.  What made Christianity dangerous was when it became a state religion in a time of conquests.  Islam intrinsically is *supposed* to be a state religion, its leader led conquests and advocated them himself. Not so Jesus or his early disciples.  Judaism was nonviolent when Jews were tiny minorities, as soon as they got a chance, they also made their religion the state religion and entered into wars of conquest.
and you don't get it and never will. So my disability is lesser than someone else's although we both got the disability doing the same thing and that is giving you the right to free speech along with other rights. We as Vets deserve the same care no matter what. Also Richard it took many years for me to get over those "bad dreams". I don't really give a rats who is sponsoring the bill. We did what we swore an oath to do now it's time to honor their commitment they made to us. When the stuff starts hitting the fan there are no atheist or politics in a fox hole. We cover each other's back no matter what. Miss Sherman is correct in her assessment.
I am proud our state is taking a strong stand against an executive order obviously discriminatory. Multi-cultural Hawaii in particular needs to take a stand on behalf of religious freedom.  Remember--today it is the Muslims; if one doesn't stand up for what is right then in the future it might well  be the Buddhists, the Hindus, the Hawaiian, or any other religion of Hawaii's people.
Millennia of migrations, intermarriage  and conversions make contemporary Jews related to ancient Hebrews as much as today's Roman Catholics are to ancient Romans.  Even if they were, this would still not justify Zionism: my "ancestral homeland" 3000 years ago may well be Israel, Peru or Timbuctu, but that does not give me the right to displace or dominate those who lived there for generations if not centuries and have no other home.
Atheism, as a movement, exists as a push back.  There is no reason to mention that you don't believe / accept a claim (in a diety) unless theism is brought up in the first place.  Hey, maybe in time there will be very few people who think of themselves as atheists because it won't be relevant.  Not in my lifetime, but still...
My favourite description of the Pascal's Wager conundrum comes from an atheist blogger by the name of Greta Christina. She says: “I think the god hypothesis is implausible at best, incoherent at worst. But of all the implausible, incoherent gods I've seen hypothesised, the one who punishes honest atheists who take the question of his existence seriously enough to reject it when they don't see it supported, and at the same time rewards insincere, bet-hedging religionists who profess belief as part of a self-centred attempt to hit the jackpot at the end of their life... that is easily among the battiest.”
The point of the story is this: fascism has thrived by placing itself in opposition to communism and presenting itself as the lesser of two evils.  But that was always a false dichotomy. There was never any need to side with the lesser of two evils (and frankly - I dispute the idea that it was any less evil - it was, at best, a different but equal evil and it only got to paint itself as less evil due to communism's association with atheism). There was always the good option of liberal democracy.  So I find it startling that you can sit here, 80 years later, and still believe the lie that Coughlin concocted back in the 1930s. It was clearly wrong - since here we are 80 years later and the free world remains dominated by liberal democracies. They remain the most prosperous and successful nations on earth.  Remember, the west once allied with the USSR to defeat fascism.  Allying with the  fascist NP to defeat communism was never needed. Democracy was always the enemy of both, not either.
the Armenia holocaust of 1 million Christians by peaceful muslims and that six million number has been officially revised by the Holocaust authorities themselves. Let's talk about the Jihad against Indians shall we, Koenard Elst in Negationism in India gives an estimate of 80 million Hindus killed in the total jihad against India and let's not forget why the Crusades happened! It was because of 400 years of islamic barbarism, Can we forget how Mohammed thanked the Jews who helped him in Medina? He killed them, chopped off their heads. Some prophet, killing God's chosen and those Nazi's weren't Christians! It is also estimated that Over 110 Million Blacks were killed by Islam. So Christians can hardly be considered the biggest mass murderers, it isn't any surprise who really are the biggest mass murderers in history, estimated at a whopping 250 million and that is muslims.
"Atheism is not a belief system (and of course not a religion); it is simply a philosophical position finding proposed evidence for gods and a supernatural world insufficient."  It's your definition of atheism that's insufficient. Markedly so.  The 'atheism' you describe is devoid of structure and substance. It merely takes a negative yet un-provable position on someone else's belief system. Atheism is so much more than that. If you prefer to think of it as a philosophical position rather than a belief, feel free to do so. But either way, please stop ignoring the beauty of atheism by making it simply a reaction to what someone else thinks.
I liked the Kennedys, they made their own way in life using brains, and they were genuine populists and progressives. Speaking of opportunistic fifty years later, how about the biggest liar in modern political history, our current president? You still like him in spite of his shortcomings as a politician, leader, and man in the Jewish sense of mensch, a Good Man. The Bay of Pigs invasion was amateur hour. There was no US military backing. No one thought it would succeed. Yet you are still talking about it as though it was a big deal. It was amateur hour.
One hundred years ago Jews made up 8% of the population in greater Palestine (Israel West bank and Gaza).  If Israel accepted the legal borders, the Jewish state would get 78% of the land to be divided.  But Israel has never agreed to return to legal borders.  Not at Camp David, Taba, or the Olmert talks.  Go take a look at the Palestine Papers and tell me who is the serious peace  party.  Israel deserves no goodwill from Canadians until it seriously engages in peace building with the indigenous Palestinians.
Speak for yourself. I'd rather interact with Somalis and any type of Asian than with someone who thinks it's important to identify Jewish surnames in text. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_parentheses
Aren't similar speeches that criticize other religions (e.g, Judaism) already illegal?  So what's the difference here?
Here's something for you to read when your not too busy being the 'Critic of the Blogosphere'....https://www.everystudent.com/features/isthere.html....It may answer some  question of why an atheist, though they don't believe in God, spends so much  time debating  that which they deny even exists. The article was written by a former atheist.
So what?   To the extent that white men are not voting for women or people as color because of their sex or ethnicity, it's not necessarily because of a hatred or unacceptance; in many cases it's because they recognize that a woman's decision-making or, say, a Jewish person's decision-making will likely be different based on their experiences with women and Jewish people.
"I have a black, a woman, two Jews and a cripple. And we have talent." - James Watt, 1983.  Hey, that's right, wasn't he also Interior secretary?
I did not know much about Steve Bannon so I decided to research the issue. What I found was allegations without proof from the likes Nancy Pelosi, and other far left loonies. Anderson Cooper clearly called out Elizabeth Warren for making such allegations without proof. Bannon clearly espouses conservative values, many of which I agree with so does this make me a White Supremacist as well? I read an article written by former Jewish employees who flatly denied any anti-semitic actions or beliefs. I was unable to find any actual evidence to show him to be a White Supremacist. I find it ironic that Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, who actually attended KKK rallies according to her own book, as well as professed the need to eliminate undesirables from the population by abortion, forced sterilization and contraception is hailed as a hero from the liberal establishment. Who do you think those undesirables actually were? Show me some actual proof and I will change my stance.
Probably because he's actually read the motion and knows that it's not exclusively about Islam. And that he has met many moderate Muslims who are able to make their own decisions about their religion just as Christians and Jews have done for centuries.
Israel acting as though it is the Jewish state when it has minorities of non-Jews living in it is why it is called, rightly, an apartheid state.  As Kerry noted, Israel can be a democracy or it can be the Jewish state but it cannot be both.  (And no, I"m not going to tackle your falsehoods and outright lies about the Netanyahu's machinations re. negotiatiations with Abbas.)
The fact that any criticisms of Khan's claims or those of her co-apologists on the Globe are immediately censored would seem to run counter to her claims of Islam being under siege in Canada. In fact, it strongly points to the opposite.  Here's an example of Khan's whitewashing apologist nonsense:  "Yet 56 per cent believe that "Islam suppresses women's rights." Are they Islamophobic? Of course not. They are entitled to their opinion. Such a critical view is understandable, given discriminatory gender practices in some Muslim cultures..."   Yes, "some" Muslim cultures. A few. Maybe a couple.  How about "Most" or even "All" Sheema?
I wonder how the Buddhist temples and enclaves feel about your comment? Or for that matter Whitestone farms in Delta?
That's precisely why police shouldn't be wearing that garb. They're in Canada now.   What about when the judge rules against you or the cop says "go home, forget about it"? How do you know they would say the same thing if you weren't Jewish and they weren't Muslim, and vice versa, and every other combination?
This is "perfect".  It baffles me how humans believe they know what whatever it was that created this (if it was anything at all) really intended.  The universe is an amazing process that we can't even properly describe (black matter?  gravity particle?), much less define design intent.  I prefer the Buddhist approach....seek personal enlightenment, and become a "god" to those around you (a Buddhist god isn't a controlling one).
I don't suppose that would tie in with the possibility of Rudy G becoming the next AG after Sessions exits.    First the President show's uncommon nepotism to family and now he feels bound by NY culture?     Not making an accusation but I would guess the Jewish population is well supported NYC cultural and financial circles.    But that's also true of any number of large special interest in looking for financial services.   NYC is a bit of world to itself, at least in the head of a lot of New Yorkers who sincerely believes the world revolves around their city.       NYC is a unique American city, but it's not representative of all of American culture either.
It has nothing to do with Muslims! If it had been a jewish, Taoist or Mormon cemetery, the results would have been the same. It was only people who had adjoining property that were allowed to vote and those opposed, simply did not want to live beside a graveyard.  Since I plan to spend several centuries in a graveyard, I too, don't want to spend my "few" living years beside a cemetery!
The real Church of God is concerned with love. Love of God and love of neighbor. That is what God has revealed as most important. What people do with their genitals is far less significant.  You seem to agree with my atheist brother, who says "God is an omnipotent, omniscient being with an inordinate interest in people's sex lives."
Hannity (and every other show) would do us all a favor by not inviting Coulter on anymore.  I cringe every time I hear her voice. She thinks much more highly of herself and her opinions than she ought. She claims she is a conservative and then touts Chris Christie, she waffles between pro Trump and Never Trump views, and as a Jewish believer in Yeshua with dual citizenship with America and Israel, I can't stand listening to her uninformed opinions when claiming support for Israel and Christianity. For the life of me I don't know how she managed to become such a wide spread mouthpiece. And she does have a very loud mouth.  My vote is to dump her.
From my conversations with evangelicals I know, they are after 1 thing and 1 thing only, control of the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade and marriage equality. They will sacrifice their souls on the alter of the most immoral man to ever hold the office in order to achieve those goals.
I see that my comment stating that the author is clueless in thinking this will appeal to the Trump base which is non-interventionist AND that Trump did to to appease the Israel lobby - i.e. not "America first" but Israel first has been DELETED as have other comments noting the same thing re Israel lobby (AIPAC). It seem like a waste of time to comment on this forum - The Globe is just another Zio-controlled media outlet (although I cannot understand why since the Thomson's are not Jews).
When Jesus fed the 5000, did he check to see that all were observant Jews? How about sharing bread and wine with Judas? Or curing the servant of the Roman official? Or even talking to the woman at the well?
Conservative? I don't think conservatives make bomb threats to Jewish community buildings, I think Nazis do.
In modern biblical scholarship it has been asserted that what Jesus did actually say to his disciples is not necessarily what the evangelists say He said, but even so, through all that murk, and if it`s possible at all to know anything of what He said, did Jesus not say that there was no way to the Father except through Him? Did he mean that only for his people, all Jews, who would not have had the benefit of the Hindu traditions?

What exactly are you saying?  Are you saying the march of islam is better then the brownshirts?   " Their primary purposes were providing protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies, disrupting the meetings of opposing parties, fighting against the paramilitary units of the opposing parties, especially the Red Front Fighters League (Rotfrontkämpferbund) of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), and intimidating Slavic and Romani citizens, unionists, and Jews – for instance, during the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses."  This sounds strangely  like the SJW warriors and far left disguised as progressivism in todays world.  Scary how history repeats.  The danger is not in populism, nationalism, and closed borders.  The danger is the opposite.
An 'authentic' Christian, Muslim or Jew simply does not commit acts of terror.  Acts of terror have, however, been committed in the name of all three faith communities.  Leaders of some Islamic countries who identify themselves as Muslim are no doubt violent people, just as supposed Christian leaders who invade other countries using lies about 'WMDs' to justify their violence are only using religion as a pretext.
The attack in Quebec was a cowardly attack that must be condemned in the strongest terms.  Canada is a wonderful country that protects anyone's right to pray in peace without fear of violence or persecution. Canada is also a champion of free speech, this includes political and religious satire. We should be able to discuss all religions respectfully, even if the topics are uncomfortable.  There is a double standard when it comes to religions, perhaps because Canada has evolved into a liberal secular society, most people accept religious satire of Judaism and Christianity, it's common in Monty Python or South Park but one religion is beyond reproach. Certain cultures governed by religious laws are hostile to free speech under the guise of pious submission, these cultures also lag in terms of gender equality and freedom of sexual orientation. Which brings me to Liberal MP Iqra Khalid's proposed M-103 - free speech is either free or it isn't, which is why M-103 is very concerning.
When you're dead you're dead ..so live with! No point in having religious based cemeteries. Just another push by the muslim community for special accommodation. Why do we never hear anything from the Hindu, Buddhist or other religious groups...maybe muslims could keep quiet for a bit and just settle down and try to fit into Canadian society.
Um- "anti-semitic?"  That same Pepe icon is used by Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos: both Jews.  Let me guess- you also think they and Steve Bannon are white nationalists, and let me guess- you think that because this paper/WaPo (same thing) told you so.  Congrats- you're the reason this paper is going out of business.
One Toronto journalist was refering the other day to Québec's ugly past, probably to an Anti-Semitism "that is diminishing" as you say very generously. Well, Abbé Groulx, Adrien Arcand were living at the same time as the Windsors in exile were bootlicking Herman Goering, while Charles Lindbergh was trying to get Americans on the side of Nazi Germany, Oswald Mosely was partying with London's upper class, and Ottawa's civil service was refusing to accept jewish refugees fleeing Hilter's goons, on the ship Saint-Louis.  When someone holds to his particular truths, time is of no essence.
The choice isn't between Zionism and secularism. In fact the Zionist entity (I refuse to refer to them by the holy name "Isra'el" they have usurped and dragged through the bloody mud) is a secularist state. Therefore they are no guide to ANY spiritual alternative. Far from it.  Last I checked 70% of Israelis were atheists.  And the Banu Hashem--the people of God--is the family from which the Most Noble Messenger Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abdal-Mutallib ibn HASHEM ibn Abdul-Manaf arose (Allahumma saali alaa Muhammadan wa alaa Ah'lii Muhammad).  But then I've offered to debate Scripture and scriptural history with you before, Homer.  But you weren't up for it.  "DOH!"
Marriage is hardly unique to either Judaism or its spinoffs.    And, yes, if a religious person's practices run up against the liberties of others, others, including those in the government have a legitimate interest in curtailing such behavior.    If you don't like it, move to a theocracy instead of a secular nation.
"His maternal grandparents, who were Jewish, escaped Poland shortly before the Second World War, fleeing to Kazakhstan."   I'm sorry,  but before the German invasion of Poland in 1939 any Polish citizen could leave the country and did not have to escape.
Hitler  wasnt targeting Jews either.
You don't seem to attend any Ontario universities or any high school in a major urban area. I can assure you Jewish teachers and students are accommodated during the High Holidays.
I'm an atheist, and I can tell you that you are wrong.  We just don't celebrate the holidays as the so-called birthday of a figure that nobody can show actually existed.  I'll leave it to you to figure out what we get from it...hint: others on this board and this author have explained it pretty well.
It is quite surprising that a visionary like Luther was anti-Semitic to the point of influencing Hitler with his anti-Jewish ideologies. In his book ‘On Jews and Their Lies’, he says set fire to their synagogues or schools, destroy their houses, take away their prayer books and Talmudic writings and take from them all cash and treasure of silver and gold. https://goo.gl/6BMwC3
"The two-state solution is dead".....can't give those Palestinians their own state.  "Israel will never accept a single state"....can't give those Palestinians citizenship.  So there is no solution to the problem then!   All the more reason for Canada to stay out of this mess.  So should the USA but it has a very powerful Jewish lobby to deal with.
Since the 19th century, those who were currently citizens of Canada--but whose families had emigrated here--have been afraid of new immigrants, for much the same reasons. In the mid 19th century there was a pecking order of which immigrants were the most desirable, beginning with British and Americans only. In the late 19th century, British and Americans were preferred, followed by northern and western Europeans, central and eastern Europeans and then by Jews and southern Europeans. Religious sects such as Hutterites and Mennonites or Doukhobors were less wanted and Asians and Blacks were almost unacceptable. People displaced by WWII were seen as dirty DP's who were bringing crime to Canada. The truth of the matter is that the majority of immigrants became great citizens of Canada despite the fears of the "old stock" Canadians. When will the ignorance and misinformation stop? There should be a place in Canada for people seeking refuge and a new life despite the ranting of the ignorant.
I just can't stand back and not reply to  n article that is so blatantly wrong . First , the writer must know the subject to be able to comment . We are faced with a Culture that is diametrically opposed to the Canadian Judeo/Christian values on which Canada is based . Muslims following the Qur'an know that Killing Christians and Jews  is a duty and you can hear it in Mosques across Canada . The ultimate goal of Islam is not to convert the world but to establish Sharia Law over the entire world  They will do this by population . Muslims have increased their population in Canada from 1 Million in 2001 to 3 million in 2011 . I'm sorry to say but in 20 years they will be a force in Canada , and Canada as we know it , will be no more ! If we , as Canadians , sit back and do nothing we will only have ourselves to blame . We even  let Immigrants change our Laws by insisting on Face Veils at Citizenship ceremonies ! This  is not hatred of a culture but good common sense .
Its not a new threat. There have been guards at many synagogues for years. Blaming your problems on jews has always been in vogue.
another atheist more christian than most christians.
I see the Atheist has arrived on scene...
The working definition of Religion I was using is as follows: "a particular system of faith and worship."  Being a system of faith as you yourself admit, atheism is indeed a religion in accordance with this recognized definition.  I do understand, however, that you may have been arguing from an alternative definition of religion such as: "the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods."  From that definition, of course, you'd be correct.  So, instead of trying to split hairs, we are both correct, atheism is or is not a religion depending on the definition of religion one ascribes too.  But either way, I feel the distinction some atheists try to make in this regard, is nothing more than semantics as both atheism and other religions elect to believe in that which cannot be proved nor disproved.  As such, atheism and other religions are equally dependent on faith.
As a non-believer, on what do you base the assertion that “Jesus was born a Jew, lived as a Jew and died as a Jew. His apostles, disciples and all his followers were Jews and never left the Jewish faith. Jesus would not even have known what the Catholic religion was.”?  Have you had some bad experience growing up with people who identified themselves as Catholics?  Do you have some reason to think that saying such a thing to a believer will lead to a positive outcome for you?  If so, what benefit would that be?  Are you familiar enough with the sacred texts of those whose beliefs you attack to explain what they mean and from whence they came?
I guess you really didn't do your research well enough....the reason  Palestinians didn't even exist when you were growing up is because at that time only Jews were called Palestinians the Arabs simply hijacked that name in 1967 before then none of them called themselves Palestinians....in fact the Arabs already have a country carved out of the BM Palestine it's called Jordan which together with Gaza already ( which puts over 80% of the original land into the hands of Arabs ) .....and Jordanian is what majority of those Arabs called themselves when Jordan illegally occupied  West Bank up to 1967,,....If Palestinas indeed had some unique identity why did they not try to establish a Palestinian nation under Jordanian rule or even ever mentioned it?  And when you talk about displaced people you have to remember that Arabs totally ethnically cleansed  their countries of Jews, nearly a million of them, when Israel was created. While in Israel today nearly 2 million Arabs live as citizen
There is absolutely no comparison between the memorials in the South and the carnage and inhumanity by the Nazis.  Give me a single example where the South rounded up gypsies, individuals with missing limbs, Jews, and other minorities and systematically gassed them.  (A shameful comparison).  The institution of slavery, as ugly as it was, existed for nearly two hundred years before the outbreak of the Civil War.  As a matter of fact, the issue of slavery nearly prevented the adoption of the Constitution to begin.  Most of men, I repeat, most of the men attending the convention in Philadelphia owned slaves.  Most of the men who governed this country - executive, legislative, and judicial, between 1787 - 1865 were slave owners.  Do we remove all statutes of George Washington? Of Madison? Of Jefferson?  John Marshall, the father of the American judiciary, owned slaves.  Do we remove the statute of him in the Great Hall at the Supreme Court building?
Its not as simple as looking at the Doctrine of Islam... Have you had a look at the Old Testament, the cornerstone of Judaism and a big part of Christianity?   My favourite is when God ordered the last 2 tribes of Israel who had not yet found a home after 40 years of wandering in the desert, to exterminate the"peaceful.... people of Laisch" ..... alas, some took pity on these people, against God's wishes, and  were punished. Reading that caused me to turn my back on "organized religion".  But  few people  subscribe  to such nonsense anymore within Judaism or Christianity...  within Islam there are  numerous elements who take primitive biblical nonsense seriously, and it seems to be far more prevalent than I had imagined...  I am possibly revising   my opinions based on the actions I  read about and the rationale advanced by those committing these acts of violence.
al Qaeda wasn't Islamic?  "...Al-Qaeda (/ælˈkaɪdə/ or /ˌælkɑːˈiːdə/; Arabic: القاعدة‎‎ al-qāʿidah, Arabic: [ælqɑːʕɪdɐ], translation: "The Base", "The Foundation" or "The Fundament" and alternatively spelled al-Qaida, al-Qæda and sometimes al-Qa'ida) is a militant Sunni Islamist multi-national organization founded in 1988[27] by Osama bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam,[28] and several other Arab volunteers who fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s.[29][30][31]...."  Sure was.  Maybe it got diluted by partnering with other "sources", but it definitely had Islamic roots.  Islam was the common thread of people in the middle east, much as Jews used Judaism when their culture and people were scattered.  Is terrorism a religious act?  Certainly not for all.  But, for some, it is.  It doesn't mean we should define the religion from the extremists, though.
Majority of blacks are democrats.   New Black Panther Party | Southern Poverty Law... www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/grou...  The New Black Panther Party is a virulently racist and anti-Semitic organization whose leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews and law enforcement officers.
Allan  Ross, get serious how many Christians in Canada? how many Muslims? Or Buddhists for that matter  why shouldn't Christian civilization and culture be "pervasive" in Canada? what is your problem? Don't like "pervasive" Christian culture you can migrate to the Middle East
I think I'll listen to the Trump daughter married  to  the Orthodox Jew who converted to Judaism  rather than black bigotry and anti-Semitism here at the R-G.
Jerusalem exists as a settlement for more than 3000 years, and Jews lived in Jerusalem almost 2500 years. It was their main city - capital of Judea. And it was capital of Jerusalem kingdom of crusaders for 2 centuries in Early Middle Ages. It has never been capital of any other nation or ethnic group other than Jews and those Christians crusaders. Since the time Ottoman empire possessed it it was a small city forgotten by everybody except Christian monks and pilgrims and religious Jews.
BDS-style. Single out Jews for opprobrium. No Jews involved in the Syrian genocide.
I don't see enough text of what Beyak actually said to determine whether her comments were egregious or not.  If she is trying to defend the policy of taking children away from their families or the manner in which the programme was run, she deserves all the scorn that can be heaped upon her.  On the other hand, if what she is trying to say is that at the time some people honestly believed that integration within the non-aboriginal community was the only way to ensure that the aboriginal community might gain access to the benefits of the non-aboriginal community--or that some of the people involved in the programme were not bad people and had legitimate sympathy for their charges (in the same way it has been shown that not all Germans committed atrocities against the jewish community)--I can see no grounds for her censure.
Marine Le Pen is guilty of nothing more than speaking the truth. The round-up and deportation of the Jews was the work of Francee's Nazi occupiers. . She has not denied that French collaborators assisted the Germans but the mainstream media, in its never-ending quest to destroy any politician to the right of Karl Marx,  omits facts or distorts them at will in order  to further their agenda. The MSM are afraid that Le Pen's supporters will deliver another Brexit-style surprise in France's upcoming presidential election and they are using the same tactics of fear, half-truths and outright lies that they employed against Brexit supporters. Nothing frightens the globalists and their MSM accomplices like the democratic will of the people - especially if there is a chance that  it will produce the "wrong" result.
I don't believe for one moment that 77% of Canadians are Christian, at least not practising Christians! Even among practising Christians, those that believe in Creationism are probably in a small minority. People probably get dumped into the Christian pot by StatsCan when they don't profess another religion or atheism.
What about the Nazis comments that they can't support Trump because he let his daughter marry a Jew? With friends like that Trump has no need to make enemies.
Looks like this discussion went way off the rails. The Author was stating her own, and her family's, reaction to the election. By almost any standards, it was a hateful election cycle and like many parents, she was looking for a way to help her children understand how such a person could have been elected (for all the reasons that at least one person here described). I  am often reminded of the song from South Pacific:  "You have to be taught to hate and fear; you have to be taught year after year; ..... you have to be carefully taught".   For our part, we recently attended a wonderful interfaith (Catholic, Muslim, Jewish) discussion in Lexington, KY where the motto with the halo was used in both English and Arabic. I didn't realize that the idea/art work originated in Lexington; nice to know! Not lecturing, but certainly hoping and praying that we can all unlearn the hate and fear that is so prevalent in our society.  We are all God's children; surely we can learn to act that way.
"Von Papen was Catholic. The connection ends there."  I rarely reply to others. I have my say and let everyone have their say. Sites which host are not used to argue, most sites ask user to not do that. Also, it's a waste of limited bandwidth.   However I will respond. The church was aligned with Hitler. Thus it made it much easier for Hitler (Shicklegruber a Catholic) to begin and wage WWII. Hitler did huge amounts of war-death-kill, as the GOP.  The church was aligned with Hitler before during and even after WWI. The church provided a hiding place, food, medical attention and passport papers for them.  In return for it's alignment the church got to attack Jews, Communists, Socialists and unions.  As we see the church can no longer raise armies or conduct hundreds or thousands of inquisitions ( Spanish, Roman and in every town and village throughout Europe. Now the church is tightly aligned with the Repubs to the destruction of America, the ME and throughout much of the world.  below-
I very much appreciate the Sikhs and their religion, culture and work ethic.  However, this incident has the "sniff" of fakeness.  I would tend to believe there is an alternate truth here.
Here is your post that initiated this discussion: "Try getting a plot in a Catholic or Jewish cemetery if you are not of that faith." ---- It is fake fact - I showed you it has been done. The fact that catholic cemeteries welcome non-Catholic family members was just an attempt for you to maintain an unmaintainable position.   Would you find a catholic cemetery that rejects your application (being non-Catholic)? Maybe. If taken to court they would probably back off. But who would want to be buried in a such adversarial environment.
"NSDAP & Fascism differ." Nazism and fascism differ? That's your answer?  Uh, OK. I suppose such meticulousness is par for the course in the battle against "Zionist revisionism."  <<I'm extremely concerned about US foreign policy.>>  That explains why you voted for Trump and his puppetmasters' glorious vision of a Judeo-Christian war on Islam as well as the touching consummation of the fossil fuels industry with Russian oligarchs.  My hairy eyeball is on you.
Reading Justin Martyr's noble apology for the Christians, I am depressed at how much he refers to Hell and to the wickedness of the Jews. Christianity got off to a bad start. The question raised in this editorial is really directed at the early church's obsession with virginity and continence and purity, as in the Epistle to the Ephesians and again in Justin. The rethink, if such is needed, has to begin there.
You are correct.  Each national church should focus on the good of the citizens of its nation before others.  As St. Paul wrote, "Jews are Jews, Gentiles are Gentiles, slaves are slaves, free are free, male and female are male and female, for you are not all one in Christ Jesus."
Once again. False. Call came from within he building. Nobody is threatening to bomb Jews. Lies.
A decade before the UN proposed the partitioning of Palestine (1937) against the wishes of the majority of its inhabitants, David Ben-Gurion (who would become Israel's first prime minister) candidly articulated Zionist strategy: "We shall accept a state with fixed boundaries today, but the boundaries of Zionist aspirations are the concern of the Jewish people and no external factors can limit them."
Childs M writes:  "I wonder if the Russian people had guns if Stalin would have been able to kill 60-80 million.  Mao, Pot, Hitler all disarmed the people prior to killing so many millions of their own people. "  --  Stalin only murdered around 30-40 million.  Mao, however, managed to kill some 80-90 million or so of his fellow citizens.  And Hitler never "disarmed the people".  That's just false NRA propaganda.  Actually, in 1938, the Nazi government loosened ineffective gun registration laws that had been put into effect before Hitler came to power.  The 1938 Nazi law loosened gun control for all but Jews, for whom it banned possession of firearms.  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/26/ben-carson/fact-checking-ben-carson-nazi-guns/  http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4029&context=flr  Accuracy counts, but you won't find it in the arguments of the NRA.  .
" I'm not thinking about abortion on a daily basis." Good to see good old Tony Corcoran speaking out on women's issues-- so many men these days care only about their own concerns.  If we are to overcome our societal divisions, men and women need to care about each other, white and black about each other, Christians, Jews, Muslims and agnostics about each other....
According to the 2015 FBI hate crime statistics, the latest available, there were 613 anti-white-related crimes out of 5,850 total cases. That's around 10.5 percent of all reported hate crimes, and within the yearly average, federal numbers show.  By comparison, the FBI reports there were 1,745 anti-black hate crimes or about 30 percent of all reported incidents. Jews were the most targeted religious group that year and were victims of 11 percent of all hate crimes. It's not clear how many anti-Jewish hate crime victims also may have been attacked because of their race.  The SPLC found that the number of hate groups operating in 2016 rose to 917 – up from 892 in 2015. The number is 101 shy of the all-time record set in 2011, but high by historic standards.
As an atheist, I do not have a prayer. I doubt they Sheriff will arrest me for dying in the woods and leaving my bones for the crows to greenly dispose of.
The idea is not to destroy the statues ... but to no remove them a place of prominence. Listen to the mayor of New Orlean's speech if you want to hear a point-on rationale. What would you think if Germany started erecting statues of Hitler and SS leaders?  How do think Jewish people would feel about that and what signal would it send to them?  How do you think African-Americans feel about our seeming celebration of the people who enslaved them?  What signal would it send about our commitment to a post-racial American if the statues were taken down?  No one is trying to remove history.  The statues need to be moved to memorial sites - so we will never forget. But they should not stand in front of our court houses or state houses any longer.
Here is both what I think and what I understand;  Jesus was born a Jew, lived as a Jew and died as a Jew.  His apostles, disciples and all his followers were Jews and never left the Jewish faith.  Jesus would not even have known what the Catholic religion was.  The early Christian gathering was a Jewish sect led by James, the brother of Jesus.  The Catholic religion is a construct, commencing with the Jewish Christians expelled from the Jewish faith after the destruction of the Jewish temple 70 CE...about ten years later. This is a partial introduction to what is 'true' regarding the Catholic faith.  Jesus according to Scripture preached the end times were upon us, before the generation dies out the kingdom would come, before the disciples can visit all of Judea the end would come.  Hence, no need for a church, which He had no knowledge of anyway.
When was the last time anyone saw Jews and Nazis working together?
There shouldn't be the slightest controversy here. There are no grounds to push religious expression out of public schools when practiced voluntarily and outside of class time. And in fact Christian, Jewish and other faith gatherings are common in our public schools. Nor does letting the kids come up with their own sermons make any difference. They have to be vetted by a teacher for goodness sake! Does anyone imagine that a Bible circle would be held to this standard?  Let's call this for what it is: bigotry against a religious minority fed by fear and ignorance.
"Time will tell, and yesterday the vote clearly favored the 41% when it comes to time."  That's because the 41% already control the church. It is more than likely they will eventually control the church 100%, even though pastor Paulson thinks otherwise.  His view is based on his faulty idea that the church is "unconditionally elected" and therefore, can not fail no matter what. And this faulty spirituality is embraced by both camps for the most part.  And this is why the motive is faulty on every side of the issue. If a person takes one sided quotes by EGW and ignores others, you can make yourself belief this false idea. Prophets always hold high hopes for the church community, but are never so deluded as to think failure is an impossibility. Once this false spirituality is embraced, apostasy is a guaranteed final result.  The Jews, the RCC and now many SDA's embrace this false doctrine. Will we never learn???? I guess some won't.
Harry, Lighten-up.  I was joking about Bert Reynolds and Jerry Reed.  I didn't realize how sacred they are to Southern culture.  Perhaps you should go to the home town of our president and see a Broadway play to round out your education. May I suggest "Color Purple" or "Hamilton"? I said "Southern Baptists" sect was formed by Plantation slave owners.  I wasn't referring to "John the Baptist".  Correct me if I'm wrong, isn't  Billy Graham a Southern Baptist?  In the infamous Nixon Watergate tapes, Nixon and Graham can be heard slandering the Jewish faith over and over again.   So much for their so-called Christian values of tolerance.
The Peace Process has flat lined as is dead.  Israel is now an apartheid state.  It governs another People who are forced to live  under different laws than Jews and without voting rights.
Wait and see, the whole world will get a front row seat to the destruction of Islam by HaShem himself. "Their is a G-D in Israel!", and the Jews are the Light of the world and NOT some man named Jesus(son of zeus).
If you opt to attend a Jewish school you should expect to learn about Judaism. The same for a Catholic education system. If you do not want the Catholic part, then do not attrend. Go to an Indian restaurant and not expect spicy food? Huh? Some people want to pick and choose the good bits of their education system, but it is an all or none choice. you go and study or you do not. Otherwise there will, by definition, be some exclusion.
A militant atheist is a term used to describe strong-headed and preachy atheists. I think Richard Dawkins pretty much is the reason the term exists. It is not a term that means a violent atheist or some atheistic militia.   But I'm sure in today's world the term will come to mean whatever people want it to, like fake news.
Well Emmanuel, at least you started the "Battle hymn of the Republic" Now provide actions that match.My school teacher daughter agrees with you on Davos. I'd prefer a few more Jewish folken  in his cabinet.
The UN always condemns Israel over anything that Israel does, BUT the UN never condemns the Arab countries in the Middle East that work every day against peace by funding terrorism, propagating falsehoods about Jews and Israel to train their children to hate, digging tunnels under the Israeli border to attack Israelis, and the list goes on.  They contribute little that is positive to the world, and they especially did very little  to help the Syrian refugees.  Their human rights record in their own countries is shameful. Yet, Israel is the only democratic country in the ME.  Its research in science and medicine that benefits the world and world aid is above most countries. Palestinians living in Israel are better off them those living in the so-called Palestinian territories. This is another UN resolution that the Western World should ignore because their sense of justice is imbalanced.
You have no proof of the "Big Bang"  Its only a theory, that's all.  Obviously your an atheist, yet believe in  "Mother Nature?"    As far as evolution and 'creation' read the history of  the 'missing link.'  Science bought the Piltdown man hoax, hook, line and sinker  for 41 years before  finally admitting their error in 1951...... 41 years!  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piltdown_Man.....         Without a missing link, evolution takes  faith,  buddy.     It's just another  religion that  some would like to force  down everyone's  throat as a 'fact'.  Believing a 'hoax' is no different than believing a lie.  .  You can try and peddle your evolution theories all you want, but you'll end up getting confronted with the truth when you do.
just as in Saudi Arabia and Iran  they would not want a Christian or Jewish or Hindu or Buddhist cemetery  with no connection to their town
Every movement in history has its extremists; look into the history of left wing anarchism, there are tens of thousands of violent pioneering acts of extreme violence, look at the FLQ and the Jewish Defence League and the Red Brigades and the Baeder Meinhoff gang to name only a tiny few, not even mentioning the thousands of left wing black and white minor violent groups. The point is, the new game in town ( which of course benefits the growing security establishments) is to take a very few token right wing extremists to hammer the moderate right. There is a civil war going on everywhere and lots of groups are playing games, not only on the street, but in the marketing world and the political world and especially in the intelligence world and here on social media where a lot of people are not who they pretend to be.
Very interesting column.   Speaking of "Pastor" Mansbridge my choice for news anchor is Luba Goy.    Luba may be a Goy, but she can pass for Jewish.         And that's what this country needs - some of that ol' time Judaeo-Christian ethics - the Jewish humour ethic and the Christian love-your-neighbour ethic.    With Luba Goy telling Canadians like it is, I would watch the National religiously.      I know the gay folks in this august forum would disagree (I would settle for Rick Mercer), but, hey, they are only 95% of posters here. Give the other 5% a break.
MMA is very popular among the youth of today and so is boxing (that fight last Sept set records Mayweather). Hockey was more violent in the 1970s then presently today. The main reason hockey will decline is the changing demographics in Canada. Majority of blacks, Flippinos, Jews, Chinese follow basketball, people from Pakistan, India, Ceylon follow cricket and soccer is popular with south Americans, Arabs, Africans and old immigrants from Europe. The most watched sporting events in Canada is the Super Bowl, second is the World cup of soccer and third is the Euro Cup of soccer. All three have nothing to do with Canada. Canada does not have a team in the NFL, Canada has not been in a world cup since 1986, and finally Canada is not in the continent of Europe.
Clearly, I would have a more productive conversation with a piece of furniture; than with you.  First you attack because you think I'm an Atheist, next I'm Westboro Baptist Church.  If you think somehow telling people what they can and cannot say on the ADN.com comments section corresponds with people being decent to each other....again, you are the one who is terminally confused.
So Peel board has as faith advisor an Imam who hosted last year an Egyptian "scholar" who calls for slaying of Jews, and destruction of Russians, Hindus, Shiites, Christians, Americans, Europeans.
And by the way, there is no "Palestinian" land, as there are no Palestinians - they are Jordanians and Egyptians, who were not welcomed in either country, huddled under an umbrella and named Palestinians by the terrorist Arafat, who cleverly realized that he'd get no traction for his cause of pushing every Jew into the sea in favour of "displaced" Arab Muslims that their home countries didn't want.
Wrong. More "post-fact" ignorance of religious history.  It isn't about "not following to the letter", it is about how a religion defined itself from its early beginnings.  When Jesus stopped a stoning, he was saying the old rules about stoning adulteresses was no longer to be followed.  When Paul and his disciples said pagans did not have to become Jews or follow the Jewish laws or get circumcised first, he was making a statement about the relation of Christianity to Judaism.
The state has a shameful history of exclusion if not outright mistreatment of Natives, Blacks, Japanese, Chinese, Jews, pretty much any non-WASP group. Way too many of the people born and raised here, by people born and raised here, have significant suspicion and prejudice towards "others", even today. They didn't learn any different, and they're still teaching their kids the same.  Thank goodness for the people moving here from other places who bring a diversity of races, ethnicities, religions, values and beliefs. Oregon is better for it.
Nope... no more apples/oranges than any other example offered by yourself and others.  You have a specific job to do,  and get paid for doing it.  If you won't do the job and persist in finding weak excuses,  find another line of work.  Baking a cake for a wedding does not endorse the marriage or the couple.  Some hospital recovery room workers who claim to be 'pro life' have refused to even take the vital signs of a patient who has previously had a medically necessary abortion in the OR because of their professed conscience issues.  They were not participating in the actual abortion,  but were still  refusing to monitor vital signs after the fact to be sure the patient was stable.  There was a big legal flap about it a few years back.  It reminds me of archaic legalistic Jewish laws wherein even contact with (touching) someone viewed as spiritually/culturally/physically impure would render one ritually unclean.  We have more than a few nitpicking legalists in religion today. Nuf said.
According to the rabbis, from whom I first noted that location of the prohibition and its significance, it was couched between the prohibition of child sacrifice and bestiality because that's the class into which the sin falls - abominations.  Since these laws came into being in a Jewish community, not in a pagan one, the notion that it is "because the temple prostitution and cultic sex lived right next door to the big fire pit built in Molech's honor where they threw the kids in and watched them burn up" is absurd on its face.  But that is precisely the sort of nonsensical 20th century revisionism that causes otherwise rational people to nod their heads knowingly.
Could you suffer from Anti-Semitism if u converted to the Jewish faith? Trumps two children converted to the Jewish faith and so did Chelsea Clinton.
The second coming of Christ is the most  described and prophesied event  occurring   all through the Bible, including the Old Testament. The theme runs clear through the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. Claiming its only in Revelation tells me you are probably closer to atheism than being a Christian, which is fine.  What isn't fine is your race-baiting which has turned from blacks to Jews and it is  anti-Semitic now..  . You are  attempting to turn this into  another religious  'divide and conquer' debate  which I refuse to do.. The Bible came to all of us  through the Jews. Jesus Himself is Jewish and all 12 apostles are Jewish.   . Jerusalem will one day be the capitol of the entire Universe. It will be populated by every race and  nationality that  has ever been on earth and the world 'then' will truly be  'one' under Jesus!     Someone  'imagined'  that  long before Lennon was ever born. .     Heaven is a very beautiful, rich and large .  Hell is just very large...   Goodbye.
"It is only when atheists claim that science or rationality actually proves God/gods doesn't/don't exist that I am compelled to regard atheism as a religion"  No genuine atheist would make such a claim.  Science has nothing to say about the supernatural and the suggestion that anyone can prove a negative is nonsense.  It's when religion makes claims that contradict natural laws (resurrection from the dead, for example) that science demurs.
Sanctions should have been imposed on Mainland China decades ago because of the fact that there are no human rights whatsoever there. Public executions are still being tallied by the hundreds and extreme forms of torture are common place. Western media and governments ignore these facts and choose commerce over conscience. The major victims of vicious treatment by the blood-thirsty CCP are the tens of millions  of innocent Falun Gong practitioners who live in China. The evil CCP became jealous of the gentle practice in 1999 and began an attempted genocide. The CCP considers the practice a threat because while the Party preaches atheism and brainwashes its people into believing that it is the highest power, Falun Gong practitioners believe in God. Commerce over conscience, shameful!
The Israels knew where they stood when President Obama on his first day in office made his first phone call to the head of the Palestinian authority.   This was further confirmed when President Obama  made his Cairo "Blame America" speech to the Muslim world badmouthing Israel.  And Obama  as the President of the United States  bowed to the waist before a Muslim Saudi King like some dhimmi apostate.  And then the absurd Iran Nuclear deal where Israel was not even consulted on something that affects their very survival by the terrorist state Iran who has threatened to wipe Israel of the face of the Earth and kill every Jewish man, woman, and child.  President Obama had a long association  antisemites like the Reverend Jeremiah Wright for twenty years, Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam, Al Sharpton, and Jesse Jackson who calls New York "Hymie Town".  Donald Trump is now the 45th President of the United States and Israel can once again trust the United States.
"No civilians need an assault weapon."  That's what the Nazis told the Jews.  That's what Pol Pot told the Cambodians.
Agreed. Disturbing is the right word. It comes from an all-too-common stereotype, preached by many religious ministers, that, since atheists and agnostics don't believe or question the nature of a deity, there is nothing to prevent them from doing anything they darn well please. These types ignore the concept of internal discipline. "I'm not going to steal or damage property or harm or murder someone because I know it's wrong" vs "I'm not going to steal or damage property or harm or murder someone because my God will punish me". Strange, I thought adults were supposed to act like adults and not need their parent(s) to scold them.
After looking into it more, I probably wouldn't have gone with the socialist/communist perspective. Maybe for a 5 pointed star, not a 6. That leaves the Jewish hypothesis and the Sheriff's badge hypothesis. Considering he's talking about crime, the Sheriff's badge hypothesis probably has a stronger possible connection.
ollieg:your reaction epitomizes what is wrong with Jewish fundamentalism.Isreal should not be exempt from criticism.
The bible was created, edited by a 3rd Century Pope starting with the Jewish Old Testament as a base combining writings and oral claims from long dead apostles and the mythological savior.  The New Testament is a compilation of the myths and miracles from the previous known religions, mostly from Asia.  The monks and scribes tasked with the creation in text were the few literate individuals in the world.  The majority of populaces of the known world were illiterate.  The purpose of the creation was for a foundation to further the interests of the Roman Empire and gain more control of the populace.  Nothing in it contains any divinity other than human-denoted.  Invisible ruler is the perfect justification for the actions of the human agents to control the populace, i.e., what the human says is law as handed down from the invisible one.  No evidence other than oral supports the existence of a Jesus or a god.  The greatest scam perpetrated on the world.  All subsequent sects the same.
I believe your rhetorical statement says: Congressional Republicans gained in numbers since 2012, contradicting the belief that voters wanted to eliminate the deadlock.   Causation among so many variables can be a crap shoot. I do know there are four variables that for me are related to the low public perception of Congress which has hovered under a 25% approval rating for years, half that of Obama's current approval rating.  Republicans have had the majority in Congress since 2012. Obama has only exercised his veto power 12 times, putting him in the bottom third of all Presidents in the use of the veto. But the most important variables are Trump and Sanders. Clinton was actually challenged by a 74 year-old Socialist Jew discredited by the Democratic party elite and Trump, who overcame all that the Republican party elite could throw at him. Not that I endorse Trump, but people wanted action, not more of the same obstruction.
There's a difference between discrimination and affirmative action.  One can argue the efficacy of the programs or the criteria for determining racial identity.  But one cannot argue against the proposition that certain racial groups have historically suffered from discrimination, continue to suffer disproportionately by almost every social & economic criterion, and are therefore deserving of affirmative action.  Although almost all immigrant groups (including Jews and white Catholics like the Irish and Poles) suffered discrimination, groups that were enslaved and or colonized (African-Americans, Native-Americans, Native-Hawaiians) suffered considerably more, so the burden on society to redress this harm is much greater.  If you want to suggest that affirmative action be aimed through a means test that, surprise, surprise, just happens to target a disproportionate number of the most racially repressed groups, fine. I, for one, DO want my tax dollars to help those who were discriminated
Atheism is the denial or rejection of the believers claims there is a god.  You can get there because the people who claim that there is don't offer up much in the way of good evidence to support their claim.  There is no requirement for the non-believer to prove anything.
I don't see that many adults in their middle years [40-60] in church pews. But I do see many college kids attending week-end Masses at Merton Centers [or parish churches servicing Merton Centers].  But you don't belong to a college/university community, do you?     The Jewish kids, that you are describing: live in mostly Jewish ghettos, are Orthodox Jews, and a number have attended Yeshiva grade schools.
The Native Hawaiians shouldn't get lost in the forest due to the trees. The choice is simple, keep hanging on to an independent sovereign monarchy Old Kingdom, or accept Nation status recognition from the US government. Choosing a Nation is not a loss, it is a gain. It gains the right to legal recognition, and with those rights, the rights to begin petitioning. The Old Kingdom was a Monarchy. Monarchies are obsolete in the reality of a 21st century Earth. Also, Queen Liliuokalani was a devout christian, devoted to a sacred jew god. The only sacred lands she recognized were in Israel. The Hawaiian islands were not sacred to her, since that would have been blasphemy to the jew god religion. The Hawaiians always distinguished between aina (food producing land), aokuewa (worthless land) and kapu (tapu) aina, kupua ohana land. Queen Liliokulani viewed her Monarchy lands as Crown Lands. There was still a distinction between aina and aokuewa, but the tapu aina was just crown land, for sale.
Oh my! Concepts I NEVER heard before during my undergraduate degree in religious studies from a secular university! Or my graduate degree in theological studies for that matter!  The "world behind the text"...yes, of course...Raymond Brown's Johannine community theory that Christ's words are really just made up lines from upset Christians in the late 1st century AD who were mad at the Jewish communities expelling them from the synagogues for following Jesus. That the whole Gospel of John and 1, 2, 3 John really are just a passive aggressive tantrum from a persecuted group using the generally made up character of Jesus (very much the Christ of "faith" in this instance)   How amateur of me to think that Christ's words in John's Gospel could have ANY obvious meaning for any Christian beyond the year 120 CE!
I've seen one wag say at least the alt-right/conspiracy theorists narrowed it down from talking about "the Jews" plural, to mostly talking about just one. They are OBSESSED with Soros.   http://www.businessinsider.com/how-did-george-soros-become-the-favorite-boogeyman-of-the-right-2017-5
When the Nazis came for the communists, I remained silent; I was not a communist.  When they locked up the social democrats, I remained silent; I was not a social democrat.  When they came for the trade unionists, I did not speak out; I was not a trade unionist.  When they came for the Jews, I remained silent; I wasn't a Jew.  When they came for me, there was no one left to speak out.  -Martin Niemöller
Would those be the same "jewish extremists" who were called islamophobic for flagging the video calling for death to jews?
ask your prof about proving a negative.   . the atheist literature I've read (or the parts that stick in my mind) tend to lean more to agnosticism but with a premise that there is not a supernatural power.  It is not a belief system, although I do believe it to be true.  If not, then you need to start believing in Santa clause again, unless you can prove he doesn't exist.
Another poster alludes to the fact that Ryan's economic, social and political roots are in the radical atheistic materialism advocated by Ayn Rand.  He has credited her writing with inspiring his political career, and he used to (and maybe still does) require his staff to read her.  When it became politically expedient for him to do so, he tried to cloak his economic theories in the mantle of Catholic social teaching -- but in the image made famous by Sarah Palin, you can put lipstick on a pig ... Ryan's economic ideas, and especially his thinking about health care, are incompatible with Catholic social teaching.
I've gone to Emergency a few times in a long life. Once was slicing my finger in a K-Tel "slice your salad!" oops. I sat for a few hours in Emergency, only there because deep enough cut I knew I needed stitches. Eventually it was done, after more urgent cases. Another time was broken wrist. I'd thought, hoped, only a sprain, next day my hand was swollen up like baseball glove. I went to Jewish General in Montreal where the triage nurse took one look at my hand/wrist, put my arm in a sling and I was in x-ray in minutes. I've always had excellent care from doctors and hospitals in Canada and it makes me very angry to hear people slag our health system, wanting some USA-ish thing instead. I'm old enough to remember MSI coming to Nova Scotia where I lived then 1968(?). Doctors were moaning but: MSI was gonna pay them 85% of fees (they acknowledged not all fees were paid). I remember family drs were sometimes paid in kind:I remember firewood in lieu of fees., babysitting for these good guys
Yes, the Koran, the Torah and the Holy Bible are ancient writings. They're thousands of years old. Speaking as an atheist who was raised as a Christian, those documents contain some good ideas and some that are not so good. Which if I'm not mistaken is the story of humanity as a whole.   Some things are good about us, and some things are not. And say what you like about religion, it does strive to point out our failings as a species. If secularism would take up that purpose, there would be little left to discuss.
Not in every case. Bin Laden was the 11 child of 15 from a wealthy family. Orthodox Jews in Israeli get payed to have as many children as possible.  More poverty in Romania then Saudi Arabia, Romania size family 1.6 in Saudi Arabi 7.2 on average. Saudis have lots of cash compared to Romania.
Jesus was Jewish and didn't advocate or endorse beheadings, murder of killings. So Trump would have let him in. Congratulations. You just figured out that leaders of Christian countries don't follow the Christian bible .   Well Trudeau is the leader of Canada, a country  based on Christianity. The Bible doesn't approve of homosexuality yet Trudeau endorses homosexuality. How do you figure that?c
All the Jews want is an ethnically clean state as well in the ME and they are going about it, the white guys are not actually cleansing America.   The Israel ambition is supported by over 90% of American Jews.   Such poor hypocrites.  White guys want less diversity and more representation of their interests , culturally as well as economically.  See -- the white guys have become everybody's punching bag.  All the world's ills are blamed on white supremacy, including colonialism, wars, slavery, racism etc.  While there is a lot of truth to this, it can be tiring for this generation of white guys to bear the brunt of that hysteria.  Jewish organizations (which is all I really know) blame Israel/Palestine on the "white man" not on Zionism, which is the obvious source of all wars there in ME.  Blacks used to talk about "the man" meaning the white executive, politician, police etc.  Besides, it isn't what they say, it's what they do.
Unless she does report to the Pope. In that case I wonder if he knows she is Jewish (according to the RNS), transgender (according to Donohue) an LGBT journalist (according to her Facebook)? In other words the kind of person the Swiss Guard keep a profile of.
ES"  I'm hardly a supporter of Zionism and the racist treatement Israel inflicts on non-Jews.  However, that is a very, very separate issue from the Holocaust.  Recognizing the horrors of Nazi Germany doesn't automatically mean one supports the excesses of Zionist Israel's treatment of non-Jews in Israel.  Gary Crum
The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Muslim-Jewish comity is the natural result of racism in Trump’s ranks. If Jared Kushner behaves as expected, there may be some renewed tension. I can’t foresee success in reducing divisions in the Middle East. His job is to pander.  I doubt many marriages in Philly are in trouble because of sex on the down low. The biggest cause is always money and the biggest money problem is capitalist exploitation of employees and the unemployed. Heritage is part of the problem, not the solution.  Bishop Frank is swinging from left field. He knows which way the wind is blowing from. I hope that this is his natural bent and am glad he now feels free to speak out. Cardinals Law and Burke are definitely out of the picture.
I have no clue, and why is that relevant? Are we, the U.S., governed by "Jewish and Protestant"?
Tell me again why the color of a person's skin means they should receive 'affirmative action'?  Does that include Asians?  How about Hindus whose families came from India?  Blacks from Angola?    Somali-Americans?  How about Haitians?    Lotsa people in the Middle East who aren't 'white'?      How about a Caucasian from Afghanistan?  (Yes, Virginia, they do in fact exist!)  Look at all the green colored locations in this 'racial representation'.  Do all those people who came from a green location have to defer to people who are browner in color?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race  Or just home-grown blacks?  Or just home-grown blacks and Hispanics already across the border?  How about if they make it across the border next week?
Claiming the Palestinian constitution isn't based on Sharia when it flat out says that it is right in the Constitution is just funny.  Then you begin backtracking and admit that while it is based on Sharia, not all Sharia is the same.  So Hamas practices the nice kind of Sharia?  Is that what you're saying?  They don't discriminate against Women, Jews, and Homosexuals?  Your too funny Richard, have a good one.
When exactly did Jesus eat with "foreigners?"  He healed the Canaanite woman's daughter. He drank water with the Samaritan woman. But AFAIK, the gospels do not depict him eating with non-Jews.
The German experience of treating minorities? Like the Jews?  To be fair, all western countries refused to give Jews asylum in the 1930s.
There is an unholy alliance of white racists, Hindu extremists and Jewish extremists that are fueling all this anti-Muslim hatred. These haters are all losers in life and have found Muslims as a scapegoat for their own poor lot in life.
According to John B. Judis' book  Genesis: Truman, American Jews, and the Origins of the Arab/Israeli Conflict, Truman knew all along the mistake he made in supporting Israel "As president, Truman initially opposed the creation of a Jewish state. Instead, he tried to promote an Arab-Jewish federation or binational state. He finally gave up in 1947 and endorsed the partition of Palestine into separate states, but he continued to express regret in private that he had not achieved his original objective, which he blamed most often on the “unwarranted interference” of American Zionists. After he had recognized the new state, he pressed the Israeli government to negotiate with the Arabs over borders and refugees; and expressed his disgust with “the manner in which the Jews are handling the refugee problem.”   President Truman even threatened sanctions on Israel: http://mondoweiss.net/2010/05/kattan-truman-administration-threatened-sanctions-against-brutal-israeli-stance-on-refugees/
All right, Mr. Minshall, I do apologies for that. But where you do get your 70% of Israelis to be atheists. Ah, writing a lot don't mean you are right. After all, we both agreed...finally that faiths, not race divide the issues.  Most atheists are relapse type of people.   So what you are saying is that only those who worship Abraham's God deserves to live in the Holy Lands. But since the Jews were there first, its their homeland before coming of Islam. Over 1,500 years prior to Islam, the Jewish faith existed in that land.  Since both faiths honored Abraham's God, both faiths deserves to share the land. That is your premise?
People in Ireland wanted to live the way they like, without another party imposing on them.   Unfortunately, majority of Palestinian Arabs want to destroy Israel and ethnically cleanse the Jews. This is why the two-state solution will not work there.
In an article by Deseret news about the revival of religion in China, this line appears:  “Even though the government is officially atheist, they see themselves as wanting to have a hand in religion. They fear religion,” Johnson said.  This perfectly captures the spirit of Gerson. He hates anything evangelical and his hatred, acidic and poisonous, is out of fear and godlessness.
Steve Bannon's editor-in-Chief at Brietbart is a devout Orthodox Jew, their now-ex tech editor is as openly homosexual as they come, and Senator Tim Scott support both Jeff Sessions and Steve Bannon.   . ....which means either Steve Bannon is horrible at being a white supremacist, or he isn't one and you totally believe the fake news from a Leftist media conglomerate telling you to think he's one.
An important article about racial hate crimes in Hawaii appeared in the Fall 2009 Southern Poverty Law Center  quarterly magazine "Intelligence Report"  SPLC nearly always focuses on hate crimes where the victims are blacks, jews, and gays; and the perpetrators are white supremacists, neo-Nazi skinheads, or Ku Klux Klan  But this SPLC article showed that unlike on the mainland, most of the hate crimes in Hawaii are directed against Caucasians.  And then, feeling a need to cater to its overwhelmingly leftwing readership, a separate SPLC article "blamed the victim" by providing a justification for anti-white hate crimes, citing historical grievances for the overthrow of the monarchy.  Sort of like blaming a woman for being raped, because she was wearing a short skirt.  See webpage  "Anti-Caucasian Racial Hate Crimes in Hawaii -- Southern Poverty Law Center brings the issue to national awareness in a flawed but valuable Intelligence Report article" at http://tinyurl.com/kkpf74
Young men radicalized. A radical Mormon will leave you a book. A radical Buddhist will meditate on universal harmony A Radical Catholic will pray for you soul  A radical Protestant won't talk to you A radical Hindu will burn incense A racial Muslim will...well just read any newspaper on earth. .
Terrific piece.  Thanks for this.   In outremont, They just want to keep all society safely insulated from any form of religious faith."  Hilarious, because--presumably--some of these people would "go to the wall" for their "freedom" to be atheists or agnostics.    And they just don't get it, do they?
Got it. The right never has said anything hateful. Alex Jones never said Sandy Hook was fake. Ann Coulter never declared paradise would be New York City without any Jews. Thanks for the civics lesson.
Using the Islamophobia word is a cop out and only intended to shut down constructive conversation. What about Jewishophobia and Hinduophbia and so on?
What a stretch, private citizen!  Jews weren't a state under Romans. Jews failed to care for their own; Samaritan were looked down upon by other Jews. J. lifts Samaritans up as more faithful than his religious peers & Jewish hierarchy. "They honor me w. their lips, but their heart is far from me." And Luke's parable of rich man & Lazarus.   Rich man was Jew who walked over the poor at his gate who longed for the scraps that fell from the rich man's table. Most cynical line in scripture: they (rich) would not have a change of heart even if someone were raised from the death. Methinks you need to go back to Sunday school. Badly!
1. Jewish priests didn't run parishes.  2. Jewish priests weren't the perfect or final "version" or priests, Jesus perfected it.  3. Unmarried priests is a PRACTICE, a DISCIPLINE, a decision by the Church that - on average - this state protects the good the most.    Read St Paul.   It makes priests most available to do the work of God, and avoids a bunch of consequent complexities.   And doesn't leave a bunch of children and wives running around wondering where their father or husband is.
"Many radical environmentalists can accurately be labeled “nature mystics.” And many of them express affinity with religions they generally consider more nature-beneficient than occidental religions, such as those originating in Asia such as Buddhism and Daoism, religious beliefs or practices surviving among the world’s remnant indigenous peoples, or being revitalized or invented anew, such as PAGANISM and WICCA. Paganism and Wicca are considered to be (or to be inspired by) the Aboriginal nature religions of the Western world, which have been long suppressed by imperial Christianity and Islam."
Actually, I think there is a exegesis that says Jesus was asked about two then current rabbinic teachings on divorce (1) the ancient Levitical view that either a man or woman could obtain a divorce if their spouse was unfaithful, and (2) the then new notion that a man alone was entitled to a divorce for any reason my merely giving his wife a git. In context Jesus supported the Tradition and both men and women are entitled do divorces when confronted with adulterous spouses. Modern Judaism followed the opposite view.   Bluntly, in effect, Jesus did not in fact reject divorce at all in these famous passages.
Many muslim customs are actually similar to jewish customs as with the washing of the body - not unique.
Given that there were only 45 eligible property owners to vote on the referendum and that    35 actually did exercise their franchise, then it would seem reasonable for the Muslim community to carefully buy up enough properties to swing the vote.  This, of course, would lead to charges of ghettoism, but we have seen examples of such action before in Canada i.e. Mennonites in Ontario, Jews in Quebec, Mormons in B. C., Doukhobors  in B.C. and  Hutterites in Western Canada.
Chris I think it has been shown that ArabséMuslims and Jews do not get along. So it seems impossible to have a Jewish state in the Middle East. The Jewish leaders are being very selfish in wanting their people to live in violence for life. All for a chunk of sand.
Once upon a time Canada was divided by English and French what united these cultures was hockey. English and French both celebrated Christmas, Easter, Halloween and minor differences on Dominion Day. Presently hockey is not popular with Islam, Chinese, Hindus, Blacks, Phillipinos and Jews. In another 25 years hockey will be a minor sport. Basketball, soccer and cricket being the most popular. Just look at the current TV ratings. Christmas has been changed to the Holidays to welcome varies groups. Christmas Tree is the holiday Tree etc. Diversity does not unite but separates the country...........
Just returned from a month in India and that's exactly what's happening there. It's religious identity politics, and the BJP is essentially a fundamentalist Hindu party. One of their other goals is to ban eating meat. On the other hand, Kerala is  a majority Muslim state with a communist government. In Kerala, they'd like to ban alcohol.
Here's a rundown from your favorite newspaper: "Many if not most Americans had never heard of Bannon before this weekend, and for good reason: He has kept a low profile, even after taking over Mr. Trump’s campaign in August. Before that, he worked as the executive chairman of the Breitbart News Network, parent company of the far-right website Breitbart News, which under Mr. Bannon became what the Southern Poverty Law Center has called a “white ethno-nationalist propaganda mill.”  "Mr. Bannon himself seems fine with that description, telling Mother Jones last summer that Breitbart was now “the platform for the alt-right,” a loosely organized group of mostly young men who believe in white supremacy; oppose immigration, feminism and multiculturalism; and delight in harassing Jews, Muslims and other vulnerable groups by spewing shocking insults on social media." https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/opinion/turn-on-the-hate-steve-bannon-at-the-white-house.html?_r=0  Your kind of guy, eh Lars?
According to the the Algemeen Dagblan, the second best-selling paper in the Netherlands, a large crowd gathered Saturday night in front of the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam to listen to Family Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya. Upon receiving a false rumor that she had been arrested, the crowd began roaring “cancer Jews” and “cancer Wilders” shortly before the outbreak of violence that led to the injury of five people, including one policeman.   So much for Ergogan's "peaceful gathering". He's acting like a bully because he knows the refugee deal he has with the EU is crucial leverage. If the refugee agreement with Turkey is upset and a vast tide of immigrants once again begins heading into Western Europe, it could have an immediate impact on EU domestic politics.
Yes.  There is a great need to revisit the stories on which much of our faith is based, certainly the basic Garden of Eden stories, ideas of original sin, ideas of what is a sin, the idea that the Jewish faithful were more precious to God than all others He imbued with human life, the idea that the Bible is God's Word, rather than the wisdom of the ages and the cultures in which the stories were written.    We need a mythology and philosophy that recognizes we evolved and are evolving, that we cannot "know" God, even though He put a yearning in our minds and hearts to seek Him.   We have to be able to admit we can only find some aspect of God in imperfect forms of metaphor and allegory and we need to be able to take new knowledge and adapt/change/create the metaphor and allegory that reflects our new understandings.  In other words, there is no infallible-for-all-time dogma.    We need to learn to be humble.  Some need that lesson rather badly.
Some beacon. Israel's MO has been to destabilize its neighbours while establishing illegal settlements. "Rabid animals" ? —  typical chauvinism. Why would anyone negotiate with Israel, which has made it clear that it does not, and indeed never did have, any intention of negotiating in good faith. It doesn't matter: Israel will ultimately collapse as its ethnoauthoritarian state becomes unsustainable: without a two-state solution, there is only a one-state solution that will either see Jews become a minority within Israel or rely on creating an apartheid state that denies political rights to Palestinians.
I can understand original sin simply by watching the evening news: the competitive struggle to prevail. What I cannot understand is why people think original sin causes some kind of permanent break with a God who in all the Hebrew scriptures used to simply forgive those contrite in heart? Is the Christian God more mean than the Jewish God that he needs a human blood sacrifice? Perhaps some of our ancestors mistook the phrase "he died for our sins" to mean he had to die for our sins to be forgiven. But it can simply mean he died because of our sins.
Glad to:  (1) Genital mutilation isn't sanctioned by Islamic religious tenets.  It's a regional cultural practice of north and east Africa, IIRC, which predated the Islamic Revelation.  A tradition from what Qur'an refers to as 'al-jahiliyya'--the Age of Ignorance.  Suspect that's your favorite age. (2) As for the insubordination thing, look up the term 'miswak', definition and relation to 'spousal insubordination', then tell me about biblical prescription for injecting poison into a woman's thigh if she's suspected of adultery to determine her guilt or innocence (hint: if she dies she's guilty) (3) As for the wall around the Vatican, I'm not Catholic.  Ask the Pope. (4) And FYI, you're once again wrong.  At least you're consistent.  If LEO's were allowed to check immigrant status, wouldn't affect me as I, my parents, my grandparents and all but one of my great-grandparents were born here, so you'd still have to worry about me.  But you don't.  Lucky you.  Next!

StewartBrian, we don't have to make something up to find hypocrites.    There are jewish cemeteries that only take jewish deceased . . . and before Saint-Apollinaire came up, I never heard a word against it.  (nor should there be)
Part 1 of 2  Luciano, I do think how you wrote your question, it was equating the two. Yet, that aside, there are some issues I would have with your defense.   One is if everyone, who took a position contrary to the official teachings of The Catholic Church the Church would shrink dramatically. With the issue of birth control alone, the membership of the church would shrink 85 to 90 percent. Are you saying all who disagree with the Church's teaching on birth control should not consider themselves Catholic; are hypocrites for doing so and should leave the Church? Would you be OK with the Church shrinking to 15 to 10 percent of what it now is and the loss of power that would result?   Another problem I have is that over the centuries official teachings of the Church has changed (think of the salvation structure, especially concerning Jews and those of other faiths). Consider where the Church is at this point with it's teaching on Limbo and how different that is from what it once was.
No religion has been shown to be a religion of peace and love, because religions aren't capable of being peaceful or loving. They're just religions.  There are many peaceful and loving religious adherents--Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, and more--because people can be peaceful and loving. They can also be hateful and violent.
Because Trump has demonized them, and has made them the scapegoat.  just like Hitler did when he blamed the Jews for Germany's ills.
Oded Revivi, using the biblical name for the West Bank claims, "nothing is more natural and morally just than Jews building in Judea".    Mr. Revivi needs to be reminded that it is 2017.  Further, according to ancient biblical law: 7th. - "Thou shall not steal." renders his actions immoral and unjust.  International law declares his actions/claims illegal.   I ask, where would the world be today if all global inhabitants thought and acted like Oded Rivivi? Mindboggling, isn't it?
The Vichy regime was the "free" land with the puppet government installed, and yes they also participated in the rounding up of Jews and transporting them  The Vichy regime was not in control of Paris at the time that the "Vel d'Hiv" occurred, or at any time for that matter.  That isn't to excuse the Vichy government, but they weren't even the ones calling the shots in this situation, let alone doing so with the support of the French electorate.  Blaming this on the "French State" seems like a lot of historical revisionism.
Nice bunch of slogans. As for, “The world is changed by your example, not by your opinion,” given that "Shimon Koffler Fogel is the CEO of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA)," it would be nice if Mr Fogel started by, say, leading Canada in a boycott of products of the occupation of Palestine.
"Czar Alexander II...was a mean-spirited and corrupt liberal whose weak mind was captured by a Jewish-capitalist cabal bent on stripping Russia of its historic lands in Europe and in America. The bomb that killed him in 1881 struck a righteous blow for the Russian motherland."  Sounds inflammatory rather than scholarly.
I believe it took Canada 7 years to recognize the nature of German regime. Moreover we turned away refugee ships with Jews, just to remind you a little bit of history and how slow we are in understanding complex issues.
OMG! "...Judeo-Christian values won this election." Who knew?
"Jewish villages were built in the place of Arab villages. You do not even know the names of these Arab villages, and I do not blame you because geography books no longer exist. Not only do the books not exist, the Arab villages are not there either. Nahlal arose in the place of Mahlul; Kibbutz Gvat in the place of Jibta; Kibbutz Sarid in the place of Huneifis; and Kefar Yehushua in the place of Tal al-Shuman. There is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former Arab population."  Moshe Dayan, address to the Technion, Haifa, reported in Haaretz, April 4, 1969.
Read the GRACE COMMISSION REPORT,or at least the summary. The Federal Income Tax does not go to the government.l It goes to the private Jew bankers to pay the usury interest ,which is UNCONSTITUTIONAL. Nobody should be paying that. The whole "fair share' meme is diversion from this fact stated numerous times by IRS AGENTS..
I admire your tenacity, but you do realize that attempting to engage Roskell, Dante or Justice in a rational dialogue regarding Israel is like trying to teach a cat to fetch. There's seldom an article on Israel printed here where you won't find them among the first and  most frequent to vilify the country and defend the vile behaviour of the Palis, irrespective of the content of the article. One wonders what deep rooted hatred of Israel (read Jews, it's always the real issue) drives the incessant, unrelenting dissemination of twisted truths, outright lies, misrepresentation, and falsities they spew at every opportunity.  Stealing land is a favourite - a bit of history would prove that such assertions are completely  without merit, but it's so much easier for haters to employ slogans and regularly repeated lies and talking points in support of their anti-semitic agenda. The best is that disagreeing with the govt of Israel doesn't make you an anti-semite. Sure, that's it!
Then you should have said nothing. The terrible actions of the Israeli government does not justify any resentment or discrimination against Jewish people. Anti-zionism does not justify anti-Semitism. And quite frankly, nobody was MORE responsible for the rise of communism than the great capitalist captains of industry in the Industrial Revolution (mostly middle-class born Brits) If not for the very real exploitation and abuse of workers they engaged in - Marx would never have written a single word. The labour movement would not have started, and the October revolution would never have happened. Communism was, ironically, created by 'libertarianism'.
During the, "Cold War", Godless Communists were the enemy. Which brings to mind something odd about the use of the word enemy. The Author used the word enemy inappropriately.  Certainly, we can all agree that the communists were and are still our enemy. We spend trillions to protect against being vapourized by communist bombs.   Kindness is a Christian virtue. Maybe if those hateful  Pagans actually converted to Christianity, they would be kind to the rest of us Christians, Jewish and agnostics.  Until them, don't expect any kindness from the religion that denied Jesus was the true road to salvation. You know, the anti-Christ religion.
1/ Thanks for making my point for me. Your assumption is that no one has truly grappled with the church's position, or that cynicism over the church's ability to "heal" is both unreasonable and suggests the church incapable of appealing to reasonable people. Bunk.  As a woman in the Catholic Church I'm fully aware the church places greater value on a fetus than on a woman and effectively teaches that woman's reproductive capacity determines her ontological status, a reductivism not applied to the condition of men. I've put up with this indignity because there's nothing in the gospel suggestive of this nonsense, and the church has its attractions.  Please don't impute motive to me. I'm a mother, I'm not "hostile" to life in the womb. I've held the same position both as an atheist and a practicing Catholic. I believe abortion is morally fraught and should whenever possible be a last resort. But I believe it should be legal and safe.
Really?  guess the Irish, the Jews, the Italians, the Sikhs, the Vietnamese, and any number of other refugees have never become culturally Canadian.  They still practice their own faiths.  Shocking.
In the case of adultery, if Jesus really wanted to make an exception to the rule based on that subjective/objective mumbo jumbo of yours,  He would not have corrected the exception that Moses gave the Jews because of the hardness of their hearts.  Instead He restored the right order and effectively raised the bar by saying that even the thought of adultery is just as bad as the act of adultery itself.  In the case of homosexuality, if God really wanted to make an exception for homosexual couples in a committed relationship then He would have said so for as many times as He condemned homosexuality from Genesis to Revelations.  Without a doubt, there are always be going to situations that are so grave and extreme that it will require discernment and the internal forum but that is not what is going on here with AL, is it?  AL represents an attempt to put into praxis what cannot be changed in doctrine now so that the doctrine will eventually be forced to change sooner or later.
Are you saying she didn't tweet those things ? Public forum. We all saw it. This fact is not in dispute. Are you saying that millions of people would not feel insulted to be told there were upsides to their oppression ?  Would you go tell Jewish people the Holocaust wasn't so bad because they get to drink Fanta (which only exists because of the Holocaust) ? - Have you seen the outrage ? Clearly people are furious. Many people. The DA probably lost a million votes or more over that alone. Clearly this is a fact. Are you saying she's not a representative of the party ? She's their former leader, still a member, and the party premier of a province. Clearly this, too, is a fact.  Because unless one of those three things are false - she brought the party into disrepute, that's the charge - and she seems utterly guilty on the facts of the case seeing as they are all facts.
pps,  Nothing I'm saying has anything to do with Christians not being "perfect."   I'm talking about history and evangelical and fundamentalist Christians being delusional about having the only One True God, and the Word of God.  I doubt you have experienced the horrors I'm referring to.  But you should be able to honestly look at the violence this "Christian" society has inflicted on the whole world for a really, really long time.   It's the history that real hate mongers like Richard Dawkins use to denounce religion. I don't do that.  I don't hate religion. I love religion; I love Buddhism, too.  I would like to see Evangelicals got over worrying about God and everyone else, however, and put all their focus on themselves living up to Christ's example.  It's a full-time job.
Well, "ethnic heritage" seems to be a key political belief system in some countries. In other words, who are the "real" Jews? "Who are the "real" South Africans? No, you were quite correct in outlining your analogy, at least in mathematical terms, and you were the one who originated the discussion about the analogy between the holocaust and colonialism. This was anything but "random trivia". Anyway, thanks for the fruitful exchanges.
Just because it's mentioned specifically doesn't mean it has special treatment, Layla. Perhaps you're being a bit over sensitive? Or are you suggesting that the Feb 2015 vote against anti-Semitism is also special treatment? After all, it excluded all other types of discrimination didn't it?  On the other hand, give the current vilification of Muslims due to the actions of the Islamists, perhaps being specific about Islamophobia when addressing discrimination in all forms is also required. I'm sure you've noticed that there are people who can't seem to tell the difference between a Muslim and an Islamist.
You truly are something else Hindustan. Where did I mention Britain in any of my posts to you? I am a born and bred proud Canadian of Italian ancestry, 3'rd generation. The operative word being PROUD of my country, warts and all. Too bad this comment board doesn't allow the blocking of another poster, or you would be first on my list.
Is Agnosticism not the more rational approach ?  There is indeed no proof that an interventionist deity exists but there is also no proof that, s/he  it  doesn't. I was always under the impression that an atheist is sure that God (s) do not exist. How can any truly rational person have certainty about this question. Seems to me that " I don't know" is the more rational belief.
Do you have a rational fear of Christianity, Buddism, Hinduism, Baha'i, Zoroastrianism, and the religions of the First Nations as well? I don't. I don't fear Islam. I fear Leitch, Alexander, Drumpf, Hitler, Stalin, etc.
All nine city council members are jewish. The approval for the project passed at city council five for, two against.  "Councillor Ruth Kovac, one of the two dissenters, said she voted against the rezoning bylaw “not because I am against any religious institution. This is strictly a zoning issue.”"  "Opponents of the project have raised concerns about increased traffic, noise and parking problems. They fear a second synagogue next door would lower their property values and mean higher taxes, because religious institutions are exempt from taxation."  "Neighbour David Derlachter told the council he, like others, purchased a new home in the area after seeing it was zoned residential." "Resident Anne-Murielle Hassan told the all-Jewish council that it is important to keep religion out of municipal politics.  “We are all against the project,” she said. “It is not a good location for it.”"   So sometimes, a zoning issue is just a zoning issue, and not an attack on civilization.
This article has nothing to do with that.  You try to bring your anti Jewish rants into every conversation.
It still seems to come down to dislike/hatred of Jews; not much has changed in Europe and it is the same here in Canada.  And the comments here are the nicer ones that have not been blocked by the Globe"s civility policy.
i am not a Jew, i do not follow the rules of the Jewish people; i am a gentile; claiming to 'be a christian' (small c) means nothing unless you follow Him. and not all that say they are, are, so they are not.
Public schools are not allowed to promote any religious worship but they cannot stop anyone from engaging in religious worship on their own either. In my view it's better to have a room set aside to encourage the students to stay on school grounds. If a group of Christian students asked for a room for prayers it would be granted. Of course that may never happen; I woukd guess that youth from the old Christian stock in general fully embraces secularism and has abandoned religion. Atheism is one of the fastest growing minorities in North America thanks in large part to these millenials.
Is it cultural relativism, or just plain hypocrisy, when you remember that the Queen we swear an oath to is the head of the Anglican church, and cannot be a Catholic? Anti_catholicism was a fundamental British ideology for hundreds of years. It still exists in the British Royal family (or at least, it legally exists in that family).
Bill: Please note the ACLU, in 1977, defended Neo-Nazi's Constitutional Right to display Nazi symbols.  Also remember, the ACLU has significant Jewish membership and in 1977 many of those members were Holocaust survivors.....yet they defended the Free Speech and Assembly Rights of followers of the Nazis who exterminated members of their families. I'd call that amazing dedication to the Constitution of the United States.  You suggest: "Here is your test of Free Speech. If you support the KKK’s right to hold a parade without a protest, then you truly support Free Speech."   May I suggest that your example has a serious fallacy.  If I support Free Speech (which I do), I, in your example, would also support the protesters First Amendment Right to peacefully protest the KKK parade.  I support both the (peaceful) parade and the (peaceful)protest of that parade as exercise of First Amendment Rights.    I don't feel you're truly defending one person's rights when you're denying another's.
Allah is simply another name for god.  The Jews used to "confer the title of 'son of God' to a person whose piety has placed him in a very near relationship to God." Encyclopedia of Judaism  6:1 Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them, 2 that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose. 3 Then the LORD said, "My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years."  Ezra is such a figure having brought the Torah back to Jerusalem from Babylon.  It does not in any way imply that the person is a direct descendent of the Almighty. Either Allah confused the meaning of sons of God in Genesis or heard the Jews referring to one of their own as a son of God and assumed the worse.
As a christian, I am among the religious minority in my community (about 1/3 of my town is christian). Most  are Jewish, but also a significant number of Muslims, Hindus. and others in our multi-cultural, multi-religious community.  Yet every store, even the gas station, is decorated in red and green, with wreaths and other secular symbols of christmas.  Given the make-up of my community, one also sees Chanukah symbols, although fewer than for Christmas.  Most stores display menorahs, sometimes also  garlands of silver and blue. The churches have large, lighted outdoor creches. Everywhere I go, kind people wish me, a religious minority in our town, Happy Holidays.    Those of all religions in the community jointly fund a Santa firetruck to go through the neighborhoods to give candy to children, and collect  for the local food pantry.  There is no war on Christmas, just recognition that our country is (is supposed to be)  a safe home for those of all religions.  Happy Holidays to all!
What is there to refute? He posted an article from an anti-jewish website to refute that jews are being abused.  Should I care what a bunch of neo-nazis post about hoaxes? Kinda like you today, just posting and posting with no facts to back you up, just a whiff of nazism.  Prove the calls are not real. You have done nothing to do that, all you have done is come in and talked down anyone that is against neo-nazism, and this squares you up in my camp as a neo-nazi.
Yet every year we have the antisemitic hate fest known as Al Quds right in downtown Toronto, New York, London, etc and somehow there was never any generalized brouhaha about that, apart from complaints by local jewish communities which fall on deaf ears.  Similarly, the iman in Montreal was only investigated after multiple complaints and follow up complaints from the jewish community, B'nai Brith in particular. I think that Rebel media also discussed it and, of course, they were labeled racists for  having done so.  So don't tell me that all extremism is bad,or that no one is turning a blind eye, when the facts tell a very different story.
JFI is not JFC...  you have a link to the Jewish Film Institute. But I understood what you intended.  What would soften hearts to hear? Is there compassion burn out. In the US we have had 9/11 Hurican Katrina and Rita, the BP oil spill and Hurricane Sandy we've experienced the rebuilding burdens. We now are reminded of  what it means to not even have basics and to want just the basic, yet it hasn't led to lifting up through immigration from the pew side... I don't get why?  Also Check with Catholic Charities they have many immigration outreach activities at the parish level.
I think you and I agree about most of this. I'll just point out that "monotheistic" is not the same as "Abrahamic." One of the key features of Abrahamic religions is that God plays an active role in the development of man, by performing miracles through selected prophets, and even sending messiahs and angels.  The Sikh deity does no such thing. They believe a perfect being created the universe in a perfect way, and has absolutely no need for continued intervention. There are no prophets in Sikhism, and certainly no messiahs. There are only the holy books that teach people how best to live moral and ethical lives in the really-real world, and it is the responsibility of the individual to work to understand the lessons and apply them to everyday life.  While Sikh temples have dedicated scholars and holy men, the religion doesn't recognize any sort of religious hierarchy and no formal "church" structure, and there is no holy ordination.  As far as religions go, I find it remarkably sane.
Thanks for this article.  Flies in the face of those white Alaskans with wet feet and visions of pyramids dancing in their heads--i.e. deep in deNile.  As for the professor's experience, been there, done that.  San Diego was real big on that cowardly, covert style of white supremacy--Black sailors and marines referred to San Diego as "little Mississippi" when I was stationed at Camp Pendleton.  When our apartment's owner raised the rent astronomically to "gentrify" his Spring Valley property--said he wanted to get rid of "the Blacks, Mexicans and Vietnamese" (no, it wasn't Donald Trump.  This guy's name was Green and he was Jewish), we frantically searched for a place to live and were REPEATEDLY turned down.  I had to stop taking my wife with me to look for rentals.  One look at her, rental offers suddenly vanished and deposits were returned.  Despite both working full-time, we faced homelessness with a four year-old and a newborn.  We finally managed to rent a dump in the ghetto.
False. My hypo involved ten atheists. It always did. When you asked what the "just and reasonable cause was," I answered that "the priest's desire to say Mass daily --- as is "earnestly recommended" --- if it is not possible to have other faithful present, is "just and reasonable cause." You read this with no comprehension, and demanded (again) to know what was the just and reasonable cause --- although I had just told you. Thinking you must have just glossed over the noun clause, I repeated it, in caps: "THE PRIEST'S DESIRE TO SAY MASS . . . is 'just and reasonable cause.'"  At no point did I change the scenario, as you allege. Stating the "just and reasonable cause" is not the same as changing the scenario or hypo, as you obtusely allege.    There's a lesson in this.  You were so hasty to find someone at fault that you introduced a red herring --- and then ate it yourself --- looking like a fool.
There has been a continuous Jewish presence in the Land of Israel for thousands of years.  The long-denied right to self-determination of the Jewish people was validated with the founding of the State of Israel. Liberation is liberation, regardless of Palestinian opposition and terrorism.
What is nauseating?  That a bishop acts like Christ would?  Jesus reached out to those whom the 'prim-and-proper' righteous Jewish hierarchy [and their sycophants, the Scribes and Pharisees] condemned.  We have the same situation in our church today.  We've had popes, curia members, cardinals, arch/bishops, clergy and laity---CONDEMN without LISTENING to the LGBT Catholics and community at large.  It is the TASK of the Catholic hierarchy to "build a bridge" to this community and meet it half-way.  They failed to do so.  Fr. Martin does it, both in his book BUILDING A BRIDGE and in his presentations---and he is not only condemned, but vilified---by so-called Catholics.
As critical thinkers we need to understand how two things are similar and how they are different.  There have been a number of posts claiming to demonstrate parallels between the Germany of 1933 and the USA of 2016.  Please allow me to point out some differences.  The US did not lose a World War 14 years ago.  The US did not experience hyperinflation 10 years ago.  Hitler did not have a Jewish son-in-law or Jewish grandchildren.  Hitler had written Mein Kampf.  Trump has written The Art of the Deal.  Some will find ominous parallels between the two books.  Most normal people will not.  Hitler's candidacy was not opposed by 99% of the daily newspapers in Germany.  Trump has obvious and serious character flaws.  He is not, however, the antiChrist, and those who would deny him a second term would be well advised to get serious.  Self-indulgence and hyperbole are not, and never have been, Christian virtues.
Voting for Clinton is not "condoning abortion." It is voting for someone who believes that, in many instances, abortion is not a proper matter for the state to control.  Not all conduct which is sinful is the proper business of government (and, of course, many Americans don't believe all abortion is sinful).  Rape and theft are abominations to the God of both Christians and Jews, if I read the Bible correctly. Does that make anyone who votes for Trump not a Christian? That would come as a surprise to many Christians - including, I suspect, some members of the Catholic hierarchy.
Actually it takes very little reading to know that Arab Israeli's do not enjoy the same rights a Jewish Israeli's.  Be it ownership rights to political rights.   Be honest would you.    Overall, Israeli laws and ILA policy prohibit Arabs from buying, leasing or using land exclusively reserved for Jews.
Your definition is probably accurate but irrelevant as at its roots, atheism is a personal acceptance of the fact that gods are man-made concepts created to answer questions that have no answer.  To answer your other request, nobody can disprove something cannot be proven. If I told you that the reason that each snowflake is individual because nano-aliens are knitting each water molecule before releasing it, you would not be able to disprove it despite the obvious fact that each snowflake is unique.  That is because I have used my premise for evidence as have you in your request and all of the pop-sophism in the world isn't going to make it true.
Islam, like its progenitors, Judaism and Christianity, offers a variety of pre-packaged versions of the nature of reality and how people ought to behave. Those with good hearts find comfort and value in these philosophical systems and, like the convert in this article, find a path to a productive and meaningful life. Those with bad hearts exploit the bigotry which forms much of the basis of all these faiths and cause sorrow, grief, and destruction.   There is no evidence at all that a superbeing pulls the strings of our fantastic universe and science has explained much, if not most, of the mystery that was traditionally credited to an all-powerful God. Yet, atheism has produced individuals of no better nor worse character than religion.   So...the path to human harmony lies not in ideologies but in the goodwill of each and every one of us.
How wrong are thou?  Let me count the ways:  (1) I am a practicing Muslim.  Have been probably longer than you've been alive. (2) I'm not a member of the Democratic Party (3) I voted for neither the Repignicrat nor the Demopignican candidate in the last election. (4) Shari'a doesn't apply to non-Muslims.  The first (and still binding) Shari'a "constitution" if you will, dictated by the Most Noble Messenger Muhammad and transcribed by his son-in-law al-Imam 'Ali ibn Abu Talib (alayhimus-Salaam) mandated that Christians and Jews under the aegis of the Islamic Nation were to be free to follow their own faiths and live according to and be judged by THEIR OWN LAWS.  Sorry, you wanna come under Shari'a you gotta become Muslim. (5) While I am a practicing Muslim, I doubt I'm as good a Muslim as Brother Jones. (6) Which is why it's probably a good thing I had to work and was unable to attend tonight's Assembly meeting.  Amy Dunbitchski would have gotten an earful if I had.  I'm not nice.
"Edible pieces of art" enjoy no "protected class" status. - That means that, while the "artist/baker" cannot refuse to serve gays, neo-Nazis, blacks, members of the KKK, Muslims, Jews, whites, and Christians.....the "artist/baker" has the right to decline to use his artistic talents to decorate an "edible piece of art" in a way that goes against his religious, moral, ethical, and "whatever" beliefs he may have. - Because no "art" has "protection class" status, any and every artist/baker can refuse to decorate a cake in the following way: (1) a man being lynched (2) Nazi symbols (3) "May Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Bless This Marriage." (4) with unicorns, fairies, and little bunnies. (5) in a way that depicts a same-sex marriage. - #3 might surprise some people. But why would I even want to make a Jewish or Muslim baker "uncomfortable" decorating a cake in that manner? There are plenty of bakers who will gladly put that on a cake for the sheer joy of making money to please me.
and Jesus they would just crucify again.  he certainly would never make the GOP ticket, at least that much we know.  too brown, too Jewish, to concerned about the poor and needy.
I knew there was Mormon involvement in this!
"In decades in journalism, Eisner hadn’t received the sort of anti-Semitic and Holocaust-related email and social media abuse that she has from Trump supporters in the past year, she said."  White supremacists in Charlottesville chanted, "The Jews will not replace us!"  Anti-Semitism and white power movements have always been joined at the hip.  It is no surprise that Trump voters would target a Jewish journalist.
So if the elected President of the United States of America is a "malignancy" according to "fake Jew" (Revelation 2:9 & 3:9) Bernstein, then we, the electorate, are "carcinogenic", no? Any guess as to what Bernstein's "Final Solution" to this "problem" might be?  Hmmmm.
First of all, it was the Runnymede report that devised "closed" and "open" view of Islam - not me. Second, I disagreed with that, by saying that this is problematic.  Muslims - like Christians and Jews - read their holy book at different levels;many do not read it at all; some who do, do not understand the original Arabic.  And,  their understanding differ widely.  For those of us living in Western, liberal democracies - yes - there are passages that some struggle to reconcile.  Other faith groups go through the same thing.  It is the blanket condemnation on ALL Muslims that is problematic.  And in fact, we should not issue blanket condemnation of people of faith, but instead, arrive at a common understanding of how we are to live together, in peace, without infringing on the rights of others.  Sheema
I remember Andrew Greeley writing about this once. The classic example is having the Gestapo come to your door and ask if Jews are hiding inside. Of course lying here is fully justified. In normal day-to-day life, I have not found white lying to be the best path. For one thing, it is hard really to effect maximum caring through the recourse of white lying. It is not honorable and that oozes over everything, present and future. Also, there are just too many times when having unimpeachable credibility is essential. (Ask the Trumps, hee hee.) When a person is feeling down and self-questioning, he or she needs to know that your encouragements and appreciations are genuine and deeply felt and not just more white lies plastered on to make him or her feel better.
Since the last one was primarily a platform for "Keith Porteous Wood of the UK National Secular Society", you are probably correct.  I am an agnostic; your faith in secular societies without more doesn't convince me.    You just have a different religion; it's called atheism.
By your own definition, Roland X, atheism is a lack of belief.  How can you then claim, as you have elsewhere, that atheism is the belief in the non-existence of gods or God?  Lack of belief and belief in the non-existence are not the same thing.
Tolerance is a two-way street. When there is no reciprocity, there is no tolerance, and it is not an act of hatred to state that ---------------  there is no two way street in Iran and Saudi Arabia when it comes to tolerance for Christians and Jews
Humour didn't work for those killed at Charlie Hebdo. Well, it worked OK when their targets of satire were Christians or Jews.
Sorry David, but Australia and Norway do not have sensible gun laws.  They have draconian ones only worthy of societies like the nazi one that sent jews to gas chambers during WWII
I am puzzled by your last paragraph in which you equate a synagogue in Charlottesville with Confederate war memorials in justifying the reason the latter should stay rather than be removed. Are you suggesting that a working synagogue with a congregation represents an equal challenge to that of a statue of Robert E. Lee.  I am also interested in what you would say about America's birth when statues of its colonial past were destroyed including Royalist governors and those of King George III. It seems that in the case of America's fight for independence no context was considered for these figurines.  The worshipping of the Confederacy post war came about as a reaction to Reconstruction. Even Lee didn't believe statues should be put up to generals in the American Republic. For African Americans these monuments to men who fought to keep slavery alive must be extremely difficult to fathom. Can you imagine German Jews walking by Nazi memorials and feeling comfortable about it?
Kari, I am not taking it literally. I am an agnostic and a None. I'm just writing about what the Bible says about Judas and forgiveness. What is amazing is that you constantly parrot supposed 'facts' without questioning. We don't know which book of the Gospel was written first or when the books were first written. The Sower's Sevens number patterns suggest the four books had a single provenance at some point in time, as I have mentioned to you before, but you won't look at probabilities, and want absolute proof. Well, you don't have absolute proof either. Jesus (if he existed) was a first-century Jew and did not think of himself as a 'Bridegroom' (term per Pagan tradition), nor as a human sacrifice. Jesus would have known that Yahweh rejected human sacrifice and would never accept it. Much of the New Testament is parody and irony. Jesus reportedly said someday people will "worship in spirit" -- could that mean other than with gender roles and with priests and sacrifices (like Pagans)?
Simple. Sam is a Mazrahi Jew from Iran. He is a public example of a member who is from the Mizrahi community of Jews in Iran.
If we tackled the fact that Biblical scholars tell us that the Genesis creation stories are meant as a myth and there was and is no 'Adam' and no 'original sin' – that has implications.  Perhaps the Franciscan theological tradition is correct. The  Incarnation of the Word was the reason for the word of Creation from the start. God chose to become human simply out of love. There would have been a Jesus even without an 'original sin'. We have plenty of individual and personal sin to be 'redeemed' for. And even that Jewish notion of God requiring 'blood atonement' needs to be changed to God's mercy and Love.  No 'Original Sin' has implications for much of our 'traditional' theology.
The Jewish circumcision of male infants could be called "barbaric". And we're ashamed of the time we didn't welcome them here.
The issues are addressed ad nauseam to deaf ears.  As for "common modus operandi," you might ask the Jewish journalists and bloggers who were deluged with antisemitic hate mail and tweets from Trump supporters during the course of the campaign. Or Leslie Jones, the victim of a racist twitter barrage inspired by Milo Yiannopoulos, whose fanboys are all aflutter in his defense over at Breitbart, the former stomping grounds of President Trump's Chief Strategist and senior advisor Steve Bannon. Just for starters.  As it happens, here in the USA there's been a rash of threats against Jewish institutions and vandalism at Jewish graveyards during the past few weeks. Still Trump supporters wrap themselves in the myth of white innocence and insist their man's demagoguery, and the antisemitism of the alt-right, had nothing to do with it.  Since your m.o. is to wonder out loud how anybody not an SSPX fellow traveler could ever consider themselves Catholic, I'd say your indignation is comical.
I get confused.  Is Muslim a religion?  Had the same problem with understanding what is a Jew.  Is that a religion or a nationality, and since they once had no country, then is it a race or tribe of people?  Well, since I don't know what or who they are?  Who is the enemy?  I forget!
The article refers to two proposed laws- one in Poland and the other in Germany in regards to Kosher slaughter and the other circumcision. Both laws have met fierce opposition from both the Jewish and Muslim communities. I am talking about physical attacks- Attacks in France, Belgium , Germany, Holland etc. Physical attacks on Jewish businesses, institutions and  individuals. These- in the past 20 years have almost all come from radicalized Muslims as an another article referenced in the Jerusalem Post article you posted.
It's Antisemitic.  - Jew's become revictimized in 2017 and need special privileges, tokens and promotions.  Jewish people should be against it because it makes them victims, it is way of the state controlling them.
There were death threats against Jewish places of worship, and calls for the full and utter destruction of Israel by countless Islamic countries under the Obama Administration-- given that much of those threats went unanswered by Obama, and given that Israel didn't support Obama and unequivocally supports our President Trump-- where is your evidence to show this recent bomb threat has anything to do with our President or his advisers?
Dennis, Cael, In the context of this (nice) interchange of ideas, I might suggest one more. I think it important to understand that the world into which Jesus was born, was a transitional period for much of the "religious" world. Generally, the key transition was one from polytheism (primarily from the greco/roman systems) to monotheism. The question of the day at least around the time of Jesus, was this: if there is one God, then which one is the "only" God? There were many in the Jewish community who claimed to be prophets, and later, the "savior" or the "son of God," or even God himself.    As the "competition" heated up as to which God would end up being accepted, there was no shortage of those who claimed miracles, raisings from the dead, ascensions, supernatural healing powers, etc.  This period did not end at the death of Jesus, but continued on.  So it was against THAT backdrop that those who wrote the gospels may well be seen as "in competition..."  as they make their pitch.
I believe you have effectively characterized my unease about travelling to the USA while the travel ban is in effect when you say "At this moment, entering Trump’s America feels akin to patronizing a golf course that excludes blacks, a health club that refuses membership to Jews."   Thank you for voicing your reasoned opinion.
the situation is simple:hindus,arabs,chinese etc gained entry into this country after agreeing to shall uphold apartheid and everything it stands for in return they were gonna be elevated to higher standard to that of blacks...and of course hindus and arabs used to utter the k-word in their mother tongue frequently,sent many blacks to jail for falsely accusing them of crimes,brutalised blacks and enslaved their domestics.now,they are smuggling black girls to their children who emigrated for enslavement purposes!they have private army in their residential and commercial areas to cleanse zulus,xhosas and tswanas out hence i stopped  going to these areas of them.
I'm pleasantly surprised that the measure passed 90-0! Does this mean that congress is finally recognizing the fact that Jerusalem belongs to the Jews and to Israel? That's fantastic! God Himself gave them that land and that city. 😀
a·the·ism ˈāTHēˌizəm/Submit noun disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God or gods.  Sounds like you could use a high school refresher too as you deny the very definition of your own religion, atheism.
It takes three generations. The first three generations of Italians in Canada married only Italians. The same was true of the Chinese, Jews, East Europeans, etc.  The one exception may be the Japanese-Canadians. Their outmarriage rates have been very high. This may have something to do with what happened to them in the 1940s.
I doubt that SDA hospitals are  "religious organizations." SDA hospitals are subject to the same laws as a Kaiser Permanente hospital, or any other secular hospital. An atheist doctor can have privileges at a secular hospital and an SDA hospital. In both cases, he/she is subject to the same standard of care. Is there a  religious test for employees of SDA hospitals? Can an atheist can find a job there?   Johns Hopkins has a spiritual care and chaplaincy department. UCLA and Kaiser employ chaplains, so in what sense are SDA hospitals religious organizations? An ethicist is not necessarily religious, although religion may inform his view of medical issues. Employing one does not make a hospital religious.
"...an atheist celebrates Christmas"  is an oxymoron .
please don’t kill all the nice and colourful things for the sake of political correctness. I am an ateist an don’t miss the celebrate Christmas, I know many immigrant families they celebrate Halloween. Let enjoy the freedom of expression freely and creatively wear in this Halloween whatever you like
This is a much more complicated relationship than you make it appear. Sarai 'gave' Hagar to Abram (his name at the time, names are important) specifically so that she would have the child that Sarai could not have (at the time). I am not sure what constitutes a marriage, officially at that time, but clearly Hagar was a wife, just not the 'first' wife. This is a very human story. Sarai perceived that she was lowered in Hagar's estimation (because she had no son to give her husband), so clearly Hagar's thoughts and opinions mattered to Sarai. It is not Abram who initiates casting Hagar and her son out of the camp. And an angel speaks to Hagar and giver her God's promise to make a great nation out of Ishmael. True there is a rough prediction for Ishmael and his descendants, but that goes for some of Jacob's (Israel's) descendants as well. And have they not been borne out?  Interestingly, I have heard Christians denigrate Ishmael as a 'servant's son' but I have never heard Jews do so.
Rejecting unfounded assertions is a positive thing.  Said rejecting doesn't ever preclude changing your mind should credible evidence come along.  Atheism isn't really a world view, it's simply a rejection or denial of the claim there is a supernatural deity.  Nothing more nothing less.  It may very well open up opportunities for new ways of thinking about the world and the resulting outlooks may we commonly shared by many but there is no doctrine or catechism one must adhere to.  For those interested in reading more about atheism the Secular Web web site Infidels.org is recommended.
"Abomination" is an approximation of the Hebrew "To'aiva". In fact homosexual relations are twice called a To’aiva.  Usually the Rabbis do not explain the meaning of Torah words. And the meaning of abomination seems reasonably clear - it is abhorrent to God. But in this case, the Talmud does offer a specific explanation. Based on a play on the Hebrew words, the Talmud says that in the act of homosexuality, the person is straying.  The commentaries on the Talmud say that by abandoning heterosexual sexual relations, the person is straying from one of his prime goals in life - to procreate and populate the earth. Although the rabbis did not use the term "natural law", this is precisely what they are describing.  In fact orthodox Judaism and Catholicism see the matter identically.  Attempting to gloss this with supposed reference to the Canaanites to feign some sort of moral basis for the acceptability homosexual behavior is totally Western and 20th century phenomenon. Period.
you should check to see if your local college has an intro course on logic.  your post is non sensical to suggest that atheism requires proof
During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jews living in the Jewish  Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem were besieged and forced to leave en masse. Colonel Abdullah al-Tal, local commander of the Jordanian Arab Legion, described the destruction of the Jewish Quarter in his memoirs, (The Palestine Catastrophe: the Memoirs of Abdullah al-Tal, Leader of the Battle for Jerusalem, Cairo, 1959):  "... The operations of calculated destruction were set in motion.... I knew that the Jewish Quarter was densely populated with Jews who caused their fighters a good deal of interference and difficulty.... I embarked, therefore, on the shelling of the Quarter with mortars, creating harassment and destruction.... Only four days after our entry into Jerusalem the Jewish Quarter had become their graveyard. Death and destruction reigned over it.... As the dawn of Friday, May 28, 1948, was about to break, the Jewish Quarter emerged convulsed in a black cloud - a cloud of death and agony."
Read her articles about Russia and try to find ONE positive statement about the country or people. Now read her statements about Bandera & OUN/UPA. She proclaims Bandera being a hero, a freedom fighter!..  Do you know, how many HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of Poles & Jews were slaughtered  by these freedom fighters??..
Scripture must be read critically or else you are proof texting.  Was I interpreting Romans 1 or Timothy incorrectly?  Neither broke ground.  The points they made were about sex in pagan society and about the law in general (which is a reference to Leviticus, which is culture bound, not universal in that it was meant to keep Jewish culture separate from the Babylonian culture).  Of course, much of the opposition to gay marriage today seems more cultural/group affirming than moral analysis.  Decent moral analysis has to do with the question scripturalists evade - were gays born/created that way?  The CDF letter (not even an encyclical) said gays were disordered (a natural law sophistry, not a scriptural term) because we were all getting too close to allowing gay marriage, which would damage the Catholic brand and become inconvenient for those who blame child sex abuse on gays.  Science answers the question differently than the Rebi of Babylon did and that scares the hierarchy.
The Basic Law of Palestine, equivalent to their constitution, was created in 2003. It treats all citizens of Palestine as equals, including Jewish Palestinians. If the Palestinian government wishes to pass laws concerning what rights foreign citizens have in Palestine, including Jewish Israelis, they are perfectly within their rights to do so. Every country does that, it's not apartheid.  I trust you're not being disingenuous. Israel isn't an apartheid state within in its own borders. There it's 'just' discriminatory. Israel is an apartheid state due to its actions within Palestinian territory. There, Jews are a minority. Yet they're a minority that's backed by the full might of the Israeli government which oppresses the Palestinian majority that lives there. The parallel to apartheid South Africa is obvious. SA gave a level of autonomy to certain  black territories as well. But the instant the apartheid government didn't like what was happening, it would intervene militarily.
it 's a sad ending for a Hindu Liberal loyalist. She should been anointed by the PM if she 's converted to Muslim. Hindu Canadians should remember this when they cast their votes on April 3rd & Ontario provincial election in 2018 and federal election in 2019.
"Jewish Trump supporters resist calls to renounce the president" Maybe.  But far more importantly, four American Jewish rabbinical organizations have just refused to engage in the usual dialogue with the U.S. president that occurs annually @ the High Holydays: rabbis of Reform Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism, Conservative Judaism, & the Reform Jews' social policy center.
No, atheism is not a belief system, nor is it a religion.  It works like this:  If someone is not political, then they are apolitical. If something is not symmetrical, then it is asymmetrical. If something is not typical, then it is atypical.  Therefore, if someone is not a theist, then that person is an atheist.  That's it. Being an atheist says nothing more about a person other than the fact that they are not a theist. It says nothing about their political beliefs, their economic preferences, their age, their gender or their shoe size.  You, too, are an atheist, but you may not even know it. Do you believe in Krishna? Zeus? Odin? Thor? Vatanchu? The list of gods over the centuries numbers in the thousands. It's a safe bet that you don't believe in those either.  Atheists just go one god further.
I have to be amused by both the bible ostriches and the atheist Laputans.  The ostriches simply deny that anything has ever been learned since biblical times.  The Laputans airily dismiss thousands of years of lived religious experience--including countless geniuses and creators--as completely irrelevant.  Simply on their faces, both are ridiculous positions.  I am not myself a believer in any specific religion, but I have been deeply shaped by two and learned valuable lessons from them all.
Sikhs are allowed to eat beef or any meat. So other than letting us know you don't know the difference between Sikhism and Hindu, is there anything else you wish to share? They are forbidden to eat eat meat ritually prepared Halal in case you next confuse with Muslim (or Kosher).
Thank you for mentioning Elie Wiesel a great admirer myself:  It brought to mind the  story of a Holocaust survivor, searching for identity. He was baptised a Catholic to be  embraced into  the bosom of Christ [the saving of his life only secondary so it appeared to me].  Now a nineteen year old in 1948, the words of  priests  in print in the daily press, many were mortified to hear of confessions of parishioners, Christian enough to give charity to the pigeons in the Piaza: "Father, I have sinned but not intentionally.  I gave bread to a beggar who turned out to be a Jew. I only found out after wards."  The author making the verbal observation. "These confessions must have come from good people, who had not been made aware of the subtle changed attitude  to Jews by the Holy See".......... NB. Reading history, The Holy See was against the UN declaration they given their own homeland of  Israel in 1948 and  not acknowledged  until 1993 when diplomatic relations were established. How sad
As long as we refuse to believe all lives matter, conflict is inevitable. The GOP has a long list of people they want to disappear. They remind me of the "good Germans" that never asked where the Jews disappeared to. The GOP is little more than a white identity death cult in the 21st century. Having survived  the Jim Crow days, I know this is a matter of life and death. The GOP base has made it very clear that they are more than willing to use 2nd Amendment solutions to solve their problems. Many think they can win a 2nd Civil War. Sessions swore he was not a racist. The 1st thing he did was tell police departments not to worry about killing minorities or the mentally ill, armed or not. Sadly, the Democrats are just the less murderous of the 2 parties. At least most of the people they kill are at war with us. Many of those people may have good reasons to hate us though. Most politicians can be bought at the right price. Profits have always mattered more than human life in this country.
Stalin was raised a Christian and even studied for the priesthood.  The pogroms were a mode of eliminating political enemies - had nothing to do with religion.  There is no connection between whether Stalin and Mao believed or didn't believe and the political extermination of millions of their respective citizens.  Pogroms and the forced movement of intellectuals (The Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolutions) and professionals to work farms were a way of political control not religious or non-religious.  Both Stalin, Hitler, Mao and Pol Pot (Buddhist) were are extraordinary examples of fanatics, but religion was not driving that fanaticism and that doesn't automatically make them non-religious.   The Founders had had enough of the constant rendering of community that the various competing religious adherers wrought; it didn't make for brief, unintrusive, and effective government and thus they purposely left it (religious observation) out of the Constitution.
Sure is funny the way all of these people are jews.
Great editorial.  There is no place for religious hatred in our community. Congratulations to the Jewish synagogue and the  Buddhist sangha for demonstrating their support and good faith.
Singh isn't "overtly non-secular".  He's overtly non-atheist.
But please, please .... this has nothing to do with Islam which is a religion of peace, with nothing bad to say about Christians and Jews. Just another bad apple .... you know...malesh.
Unfortunately, I don't believe it is entirely "unthinking". Rash, to be sure, but not without thought.   I'm afraid Trump wants to create chaos and confusion and to lower the bar for empathy that Americans feel towards Muslims.   Does the ban make America safer? No.   Does it correct an existing problem with dangerous people entering the US? No.   Does it give radical Islamists more leverage and motivation for recruiting? Yes.   Does it inflame anger and hatred? Yes.   Does it set the pre-conditions for American military action? Yes.   Hitler didn't start with box cars and death camps. He started by labelling and isolating Jews and turning Germans against them.   He also claimed he needed to return the German military to its former glory for "self-defence".   He also made an alliance with Russia.   If the American people don't stop Trump soon we're all in very deep trouble.   (In my Nazi German analogy, we are Austria).
Decades ago, the American Nazi party marched on Skokie, IL to the horror of the large Jewish community there. No violent counter protesters were there, and the march was peaceful.  Today, the violent left anti-protesters think that the right to demonstrate and speak should be determined by them, and their violent acts are used to intimidate those they disagree with. The result is death and mayhem, yet the media blames ONLY those on the right.  The question is "should we allow free speech for everyone, or not?"
McInnes is a public anti-Semite if you go by his video about why he hates Jews, posted on The Rebel.  It is important to call these people out for who they actually are.
(a) its a fact and not misleading in any way, Jews are Arabs, Arabs are not Whites. Twist and turn all you want these are facts. (b) NO DONT put aside Afrikaner those where the words used and the people accused,  you cant change a persons statements because it does not suit your argument. (c) I agree with you but whats the alternative, (cii) Once agian I agree the domination of world economics by a few people all of the same race  is worrying.  (1) The Bantu system produce some giants Moeletsi Mbeki, Thabo Mbeki, Dr Patience Mthunzi, Dr Patience Mthunzi and many more. (2) If you say so  The English gave the Jews the economic power in SA, when the Afrikaners finally took over and Verwoed tried to break their stranglehold they had him killed. You sit there crap talking Afrikaners so explain why there are only 2 Englishmen in the top 16, considering they had a better head start than the Afrikaners (100+ years English ruled here)  May be its because they lack will power.
Read the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and understand it. The 1st amendment codifies the natural rights of citizens: freedom of speech, freedom FROM government on religious exercise, freedom of association.....Regardless of your atheism, the Founders 98% of whom were believers in the Christian God and 100% believers in the importance of religion (unfettered and uncontrolled by government in any sense) for a moral and free society, insisted on the Bill of Rights. A wedding cake is NOT a right nor a matter of public accommodation nor is it discrimination (we all discriminate when we choose one brand over another or choose a thin person or a plump person over the opposite or brunette vs blonde vs red haired) to refuse to enter into a personal services contract with someone with whom you disagree fundamentally. There are other bakers who don't care what message they put on a cake, therefore NOT a matter of public accommodation or discrimination.
Assad is being portrayed as a monster.  These gas attacks never happened before. He never gassed his people. Christians were allowed to live peacefully in Syria, and Christians were in his government. People coming out of Syria appear educated and able to speak english.  Then everything changed when a teenager scrawled the message..."Syria, you're next".   When I see the chaos in the middle east associated with Islam and all the different branches, it must be almost impossible for the head of any of those countries to keep the lid on all the warring ideologies that have been fighting each other for 1600 years.  Islam rebels have tried to take over...this is when we started to hear about gassing. They hid among the population, using them as human shields.
Before and during the early years of World War II, the German government sold a special kind of Reichsmark, known as Rückwanderer Marks, to American citizens of German descent.    Through Chase, this allowed Nazi sympathizers to purchase Marks with dollars at a discounted rate.    Specifically, "The financial houses understood that the German government paid the commissions (to its agents, including Chase) through the sale of discounted, blocked Marks that came mainly from Jews who had fled Germany."   In other words, Nazi Germany was able to offer these Marks below face-value because they had been stolen from emigrés fleeing the Nazi regime.
"(Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam) "  Christianity: apparently so good, they had to name it twice!
You are missing the point.  Whatever the Church did or didn't do, however it was that Hitler rose to power, whoever could be blamed for that... eventually sense was knocked into people's heads and the Allied powers got together to try and stop Hitler.  That was right and just.    Those who are pro-life are trying to do the same thing for the unborn.  We are trying to stop the madness and get people to realize that you can't murder innocent human beings--simply because you feel like it--and call that "choice."  What the Holocaust was to the Jewish people, abortion is to the unborn.
I do not disagree entirely with the letter writer, though he is really puffing up small things into big things; the conservative media has been after HRC ever since she had the audacity to say that as First Lady she would not be staying home baking cookies-the GOP really hated her for that, go figure. Still, I have to say that the DNC under Debbie Wasserman-Schultz's direction was a disaster, and I am most bothered by the comment of one staffer there regarding the fact that Senator Sanders is a Jew, and that could be used against him. Sanders was the real agent of change in the whole scene, like the bumper sticker says 'Money Can't Buy Love, Happiness, or Bernie Sanders'. It can, however, buy Hillary or Donald. We can be as partisan as we want to be, but Clinton-Lil Miss Samsonite-had issues that nobody on that side wanted to see, and I do fear that Trump will cause major problems for the country, but that's who got chosen. Sanders was the one.
Your comment has some basis in reality, but then adds a bunch of conspiracy theories into the mix. Al-Sisi is not Jewish. That was a rumour spread by the Muslim Brotherhood to de-legitimise him. They also tried to spread the rumour that Sisi's president, Adly Mansour was Jewish (a Seventh Day Adventist Jew). And the Syrian civil war went on for years before the west ever got involved. And it's kind of deluded to say that the action in Syria was solely due to the wishes of the Sauds, when there was considerable domestic pressure to take action, especially after the grotesque rights abuses committed by Assad
The Boers were put in camps by Lord Kitchener (women and children), and the Jews in the Holocaust, and the millions killed by Stalin's purges. I believe they all would "count" as "white." Sadly I have visited Cambodia which during my lifetime a small group killed millions, and Africa in Rwanda where many hundred thousand were killed. I rather think that this lady is behaving badly and intemperately. Not to mention our own First Nations issues. Everyone needs to remember the truly horrible and not equate it with the morally repugnant.
Just a question....do the Muslims in Canada really think this motion is about bigotry OR do they think its about banning any criticism of Islam and its religion and reintroducing blasphemy laws in Canada. Does the MP behind the motion feel that criticism of Islam and its prophet is acceptable? I think we know the answer.   In every Muslim country the penalty for blasphemy is very serious including death. you simply can't criticize the religion or the prophet Mohamed no matter what. This includes violent passages in the Koran and Hadith, the punishment for non-believers (including the extermination of Jews as we found out recently with the Mosque in Toronto), nor any mention of the immorality of the Prophet Mohamed....and his child bride.  For muslims coming to Canada in greater numbers this is their reality. No freedom of speech.   Blasphemy is what this is really about.   The G&M lives in a vacuum unconnected to the collective reality of the Muslim world and its beliefs.
Fight those who believe not In Allah nor the Last Day Nor hold that forbidden Which hath been forbidden By Allah and His Messenger, Nor acknowledge the Religion Of Truth,(i.e. Islam) from among The People of the Book (Jews and Christians) Until they pay the “Jizya” With willing submission And feel themselves subdued The Qur'an, Sura 9:39 (The “Verse of the Sword”)  The verse above, Qur'an Sura 9:39, is in direct conflict with Canadian values. Support moderate reformist Muslims such as Imam Tawhidi, Canadian Muslim Raheel Raza, along with Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Muslim British activist Maajid Nawaz  in their efforts towards the peaceful reformation of Islam.
Your comment reminded me of the build up to the Holocaust, where the Jews in administration and official positions kept their brothers and sisters in check with fear and intimidation for Hitler's regime believing themselves to be safe from the furnace. In the end they all burned. Head banging zombies protecting the offspring of the men who killed them and stole everything they had.
Islam forms the core part of our identity, but this core is not in conflict with Canadian values: Fight those who believe not In Allah nor the Last Day Nor hold that forbidden Which hath been forbidden By Allah and His Messenger, Nor acknowledge the Religion Of Truth,(i.e. Islam)  from among The People of the Book (Jews and Christians) Until they pay the “Jizya” With willing submission And feel themselves subdued  The Qur'an, Sura 9:39 (The “Verse of the Sword”)
It's quite clear from the piece that he's Jewish, so no need to reinforce. So, contrary to your claim, it's not an omission either! Do we start adding religion/ethnicity to everyone's nationality? I hope not. Italian-Canadian Catholic etc. I don't think so.
I think it is little late for April Fool's Day.  > Canada has no core identity, that what it means to be Canadian. Canada is bunch of tribes: The Native, the French, The Christians, The Jews, The Feminists, The Old Stock, The Italians, The Chinese, etc. > Trustin Dudeau says this himself, Canada has no core identity, that is why we have a constant, unrelenting flood of new immigrants arriving who are invited to live in Canada with their own culture, within their own group. You can geo-map these groups in areas of Toronto.
(...CONTINUED FROM ABOVE)  You said: "...we do know that the Jewish nation has been there far longer then a Islamic state.....actually that part of the world never been a state of any kind once the Jewish kingdom was destroyed by the Roman Empire....until 1948."  May I suggest you predicate your claims on the history of THIS planet?  Muslim states ruled Palestine from 636 CE until the end of the 19th century, with the exception of about one century of rule by the Christian Crusaders.  Were wars fought in which governments changed hands?  Yep.  That happens to countries where folks have other (or no) religions as well.  But until defeat of the Ottomans in WWI Palestine was ruled, for better or worse, by MUSLIMS.   The biblical Kingdom of Israel (including its Judean client-state) arose in the 10th century BCE and fell about four centuries later.  NEXT!  (CONTINUED BELOW...)
In your mind as an agnostic, atheist, or some thing along those lines.  And so .... ?
I thought Goyim was a term used by Jews to identify those who are not Jews?
Lately??? I guess we should forget about that little unpleasantness in the 1930's and 40's with the Jews or the Blacks in the 60's with the Democrats in the South.
