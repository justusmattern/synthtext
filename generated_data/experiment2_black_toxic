 You are right the article was a bit one sided.  But the author did a good job of breaking down the prejudice behind the decision.  We are a country who has prided itself for centuries on being a "white man's country".  It was only in the 1970's that affirmative action became common place and people like me were happy to accept the challenges that came with it.  However, over time, as the number of black applicants for admission to the Medical School increased, so did the amount of black applicants who were turned away.  For every black man accepted, three or more white men were turned away.  In other words, by accepting affirmative action, we as a nation, are paying back a portion of the pain and damage done to people of color.  It is a win/lose.

 There's no question that the black communities of Toronto and Vancouver are crime ridden and drug infested; this is well known and it has been well documented for decades.

Homosexuality was created by God, it's purpose was to be a complimentary relationship between a man and a woman, and there are many anatomical and physiological reasons why this was the case.    However, God is not limited by the boundaries of biology and technology.

   Black Lives Matter is a pile of garbage that is reportedly saying its members feel unsafe around cops.    They've shown up to disrupt, and in some cases attack, gay pride events. In Toronto, BLM was there last year throwing bricks, and the event had to be put on hold.     I have a gay uncle, and I can tell you he would NOT feel comfortable going to a gay pride event today.  If he felt there was danger, he would contact the police.  You want to disrupt something for your own political views? Fine, but don't force your views on others.  BLM is a hate group and they're promoting homophobia.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: Thank you. I appreciate the comment.

 "Diversity" is just  a code-word for ANTI-WHITE, especially ANTI-WHITE MALE. Nobody ever says the NBA or NFL are not "diverse enough" or have too many black players.

 The GOP elites are scared of a populist uprising that threatens their stranglehold on the party.  They're willing to do and say anything to keep control, and the only thing they're willing to do is trash any true conservative.  You got Trump.  The anti-Trump forces need to get organized.  They need to stop pretending to be "conservative" and find a new banner to fly under.  The pro-life movement needs to stop pretending to be "pro-life" and get on with real protest.  It can start with holding hearings on Planned Parenthood and making it illegal to murder babies.     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning white people: Trump didn't need to "play the field" when he had the black, Latino and Asian votes locked up.

 So, let's say a black guy gets drunk and beats up a few white guys, is that bad?   I think we already know the answer to that one.   The difference is that the black guy in question is black, and therefore part of the problem, whereas the white guy was just acting in a rage, and had no ill will.

 Yeah, and all the time he's been doing this, his campaign has been sending out multiple messages to his support base that they should feel sorry for not being White instead of being angry at all the Black people they see around them.

 It appears to be based on their assessment of the likelihood that the person will engage in criminal behavior.

 And there you hit the nail on the head.

 This is outrageous. We as a nation are supposed to be united as a people.  This action by a college professor is to divide us instead. We as a people need to speak up and support our fellow citizens. No matter where they are on the political/social spectrum, we need to support each other no matter what.  Blacks Lives Matter and La RAZA are not the same.  Blacks Lives Matter is saying our lives matter.  And if by ignorant public policy, we divide all the blacks in the nation, the whites will become angry, whites are lazy, and there will be civil unrest.

I don't support their actions, but don't let them "steal" from it by using their right of free speech in a way that causes problems for the team or the fans.

 Oh please.  This has nothing to do with the shooter having "mental health issues".  This has everything to do with a gun that this thug had access to, and he used it to kill an innocent human being.  There's a difference.  An innocent human being is worth a fraction of a human life.   The murderer of this victim is still out walking the streets, committing more murders.  If someone had shot and killed this murderer and then shot and killed another innocent human being, you (and so many of your ilk) would be condemning the killer of the second victim as well.    But the shooter of this particular victim isn't even being charged for the killing of this particular victim, so there's that.

 What I find most offensive about this opinion piece is the assumption, implicit in the author's writing, that white people in the West need to emulate racist regimes in the Middle East. She then offers examples of how white people in the West have historically suppressed black people, while not mentioning anything about the reverse? Slavery? Jim Crow laws? The nazis in Charlottesville? The Confederacy? All things that are, in fact, true in the Middle East.  Then she brings up examples of white people in the West doing terrible things to brown people in the Middle East, and we're shocked that such behaviour might be found problematic in the West? The author's argument is that because white people in the West sometimes behave badly, it means we should rethink everything about our own society, and immerse ourselves in an islamist-style gauntlet of martyrdom?

One of the areas in which we as a society have not progressed from a Victorian society is in the education of young people about the mechanics of sex.

 You're right.  This whole silly exercise is just a smoke screen to distract from the Trudeau government's massive tax grab via income sprinkling.

 "Black lives matter" is not an "antigon"  The phrase "Black lives matter" first appeared in a Malcolm X Talk, and was used by Malcolm X himself in a non-inflammatory manner, in relation to black Americans in general.

There are two possible meanings for the phrase "Black lives matter", which I believe the original poster intended, both of which are inflammatory:  1)                                                                             2)

 That's not what I'm talking about.  What I'm talking about is people who believe they have a "special right" to tell black people what to do, where to go, who to vote for, how to be economically successful, and on and on.  What I'm talking about isn't some paranoid "leftist" idea that black people are plotting to take over the country.  That kind of paranoia is old as the hills.  I'm talking about actual, physical evidence that black people are being stopped more frequently and for longer periods--specifically, that they are pulled over more for no good reason than for being black.  "See, they're pulling over old white guys."  That doesn't matter.  Those are the facts.  The black activists' job is to convince the general population (and the police) that those are bad apples, not that the system itself is racist or unconstitutional.

 The police acted stupidly and irrationally this time.    When a black guy in Oklahoma City gets upset at the cops for pulling him over, the police shoot him.  When a few blacks in Charlotte, North Carolina beat on a white couple senseless, the police stand by and do nothing.      The black community must quit blaming the police for their behavior.  Black males are 80 times more likely to be shot by other black males than by a cop.  That statistic is true even though blacks make up only 13% of the population.    According to the US Department of Justice, blacks receive slightly more prison time than whites for the same crimes.    Most blacks who are shot by police are armed.  Many times, those armed blacks are black.    It is obvious that many black men have guns and shoot police when they are nervous and/or angry.

 The reason that cops kill blacks is that blacks are often armed.   When whites are armed, they are seldom if ever shot by police.   In the US, statistically, black males are 7 times more likely to commit murder than unarmed non-blacks.   And since most gun deaths occur in the inner cities, where guns are commonplace, the cops are often hunting for unarmed black males.    When a young black male is unarmed, it is often because he was just walking down the street or standing in his front yard when shot by the police.

  This article does a great job summing up what is so disturbing about the Trump constituency.  They want to stick it to their imagined enemies (liberals,  leftists and immigrants), but in doing so they ignore the real sources of their concerns.  The white working class voter is stuck in the same rut it has been in for decades.  The economic insecurity and lack of good jobs that characterized the Great Depression and the aftermath of World War II is still with us.   Women,  LGBTQ and racial minorities were not treated with equality nor were they allowed the same opportunities that white males had.   Instead of pulling themselves up by their boot straps,  these folks just kept on pulling.   And now, having been handed everything they ever wanted,  they feel robbed and want revenge.   All the while blaming those  who actually did give them what they have.     As long as their

He didn't even know how to tie his own tie!  This is why nobody trusts him and his family.  If people can't trust the Trumps, how can they trust the Chinese?  Or the Russians?

 "This is why no black person can ever be president."      Donald Trump is the only presidential candidate in US history whose campaign is based on white supremacy.

 "Trump's defenders have a variety of rationalizations for why he won. One is that millions of people who voted for him were not racists or xenophobes. Another is that they were angry with the direction of the country, although they were probably not racists or xenophobes. The final reason is that they are ignorant, although not as ignorant as racists and xenophobes."  I think the last part is important.  The ignorance that the author speaks of is not the ignorance of being ignorant about the law and the Constitution, but the ignorance that comes from not understanding that what one is doing is illegal.  The ignorance comes from not understanding that the police will not and often cannot determine guilt or innocence, and are only there to enforce the law.

 "White Catholics favored Trump, 60 percent to 37 percent."   In 2012, white Catholic votes were split almost 50-50 between President Barack Obama and Republican nominee, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.  So, why the big change this time around?  One answer is that young white Catholics - those who will be eligible to vote in 2020 - have grown up in an era when they've had numerous opportunities to become more politically engaged.  And, in many cases, they've opted not to.  In 2012, for example, white Catholic voters were slightly more likely than their non-Catholic counterparts to vote for Romney (53 percent to 47 percent).  But when you break it down even more specifically, white Catholic men voted for Romney over Obama by a margins of 10 percent and 8 percent, respectively.  White Catholic women voted for Obama over Romney by margins of 15 percent and 19 percent, respectively.  If Catholic men and

In fact many of the white people he asked seemed quite pleased with the fact that somebody was being held accountable for some of the crime in our city..

 "You can call it 'racism,' but it really isn't that bad."  Really, Paul?  How so?  Here are a few of the many things that racism does:  1. It convinces whites that blacks are ignorant and uncivilized, and justifies discrimination against blacks in many areas of public life, including employment and housing.  2. It provides social justification for violent racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia, anti-Muslim bigotry and other forms of prejudice and hatred.  3. It provides cover for people who use violence or threats of violence against others to gain attention or to retaliate against the non-violent protest of others.    Now, you can easily show that white racism against blacks is as bad as black racism against whites.  If you wish.  But you won't.

  I'm a Democrat and  I agree.   Trump has a long history of assaulting women.    Bill Clinton is the only one to have had his campaign violated that we know of.    Trump should be taken off the campaign trail and  forced to  come to the  defense of  Bill and the women he assaulted.

 There is absolutely nothing uncivil here.  It is perfectly possible to discuss controversial ideas without resorting to name calling and epithets.

A small number of them might even be doing their job incorrectly, but the point is the same for all law enforcement, in that a small percentage of officers are going to abuse their power and stop someone for no good reason at all.

 Blacks are less likely to go to prison or police officers.    Why are you offering that as a "fact"?    Because it suits you?

Nearly 70% of those arrests, were for nonviolent crimes such as possession of drugs (10,531), the possession of weapons (9,339) and the illegal sale of drugs (8,570).  The numbers for 2011 is not yet available, but it is estimated that about 38% of young black men will go to jail during their lifetime, compared to 19% for young white men.

 I don't understand the apparent contradiction here.  Trump is in many ways the reverse of what we've come to hate about liberals: they're passionate, they're on the side of people, they're real.  Trump is the reverse of the generic white person, the guy that cares about his neighborhood, his family, his friends.  Compare that to Obama who cared more about things like being seen in pictures with Black people or having a cool girl drop by his house.  Trump is real, whereas Obama was phony and half-hearted.  Trump is doing all that this nation has ever wanted.  Obama made us feel that it was okay to be white and proud, to have opinions that were not canted toward any particular group.  I guess that's why Trump resonated with so many people.  Liberals are tired of being called racists, they're tired of not being listened to, they're tired of not being considered

 I am not black, but I do think it is unfair that these NFL players are kneeling.  As a white man, I don't have to do that, and I doubt these football players have either.

 There was a lot of anti-war activism back then. A lot of women were in the anti-war movement.

 This is a sad day when our country is going to court to fight for the rights of the black athletes.

 I'm not sure what you think you're proving by this.  Most mass shooters were white by far.  Most killers who committed mass murders were men.   The problem with this idea that the NRA causes gun violence is that it's a fallacy.  The NRA didn't create gun violence.  People like Larry Craig and Paul Jennings purchased guns and then got angry when they weren't able to buy more.  It's not the NRA's fault that people like these murderers are able to walk around in public armed.  Most mass shooters had some major failures in their lives and or psychological problems before they went on a rampage--this fact is well known.

 What is this "Black and white" thinking you speak of?  Perhaps you should read up on it again.  "In response to these statistics, critics of police reform — often political conservatives and police unions — typically argue that the reason more black men and women are shot and killed by police is that black Americans commit more violent crime….  According to FBI numbers from 2014, about 90 percent of black murder victims were killed by other black people. When white murder victims were included, the numbers were almost identical — 90 percent for black victims and 89 percent for white victims.  When you include all murders, blacks committed about 80 percent of the murders in the United States in 2014, according to FBI numbers from 2014. While that is undoubtedly because many black males are incarcerated, the numbers demonstrate that many black males also are victims of violent crime…."  https://www.cnsnews.com/blog/craig-bannister

 Black men are almost twice as likely as white men to be shot and killed by police officers. The odds are only slightly better for black women, but nearly twice as likely for black men. Why is that?

 There are a number of things that bother me about this article.  Firstly, as mentioned above, it fails to discuss the impact on Muslim youth of seeing western culture, where people are treated as equals, as backwards and potentially dangerous.  The fact that Muslim youths see little difference between Muslim and western culture also means that Muslim youths will not identify with those who have been subject to discrimination, such as blacks and Irish people.  This will have a negative impact on the development of Muslim youth in Canada, as they will see that there are only a few races that are superior to the other.  This in turn will lead to a loss of identity for these young people, as they will no longer identify with their culture and religion, and they will begin to feel alone and frightened.

 You're right, Eugene,  we all know that blacks are incapable of being racist, per se,   It's just that the institutionalized American racism, which casts blacks into and maintain a status quo that denies them equal status as other Americans  -- in education, employment, voting, medical care, housing and so on -- is so pervasive and powerful that blacks just don't see it.   In this regard, Michelle Obama is right:  "Blacks are often seen as 'by nature' more gentle, more patient and more loyal to their partners and families than are whites.

 I would have to say that most of those protesting "Black Lives Matter" are just as guilty of racism as the "White Supremacist" group that is organizing and marching with them.  Both groups are violent racists, which is why both should be called out.  If the "White Supremacist" group goes and marches in a racist manner while carrying swastikas, that is their choice, but it doesn't make it right or morally correct.  The "Black Lives Matter" group is not racist in the least, because they don't believe blacks should be murdered for just being black.  They are just trying to stop police killings of unarmed, innocent blacks, which is another way of saying they are fighting for their right to live.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning male people: The issue here is that the bishop has defined sin very narrowly.

 "The Southern Poverty Law Center tracks hate groups and organizations. And the Klan is the most powerful white supremacist group in the country."  I have no idea which group you are referring to. If you mean the formal, ordained group, then yes, they are the most powerful group in the country.   If you mean the informal, social and informal group, then, again, they are the most powerful group in the country.    The difference is that the official, full fledged Klan group has always had the official sanction of the government, whereas the informal Klan groups that don't have official sanction have none.   In fact, the official, full fledged Klan group in the US has not had a member murdered by a white person in more than 120 years.     The black KKK in America has murdered many more black people in the last 120 years than the official Klan group has.  You can see

 A Black officer shoots a white man...  GOP politicians denounce the shooter as a "son of a bit****" and vow to strengthen gun control.

 The "white privilege" you speak of apparently applies only to white people. Non-white people just don't experience it.  This isn't about what is "easier" or "more morally right," this is about what is objectively true. You can try to push the "white privilege" angle as much as you like, but the fact is that it doesn't hold up when examined in the sunlight of objective truth.  When BLM accused the entire white gay population of Toronto of being racist and homophobic, they were proven totally wrong. What is gay even means? Does "gay" automatically include "loves boys" and "doesn't want to make a commitment?" Does it also include guys who only want to engage in mutually pleasurable sodomy and are OK with gay men not wanting to make a commitment? And, of course, the most common form of gay abuse is young boys being abused by older men.

 "The GOP is at its core a white identity party. "   That is the racist dog whistle I heard on many a  conservative talk radio program.  It is the party of Lincoln.

The Republicans have been at the forefront of the re-segregation of America since the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Republicans continue to this day to help ensure that racial inequality and racism are in place in this country.  The GOP is the racist party.  The fact that the GOP wants to do away with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not make them any less racist.

 This is just another example of our politically correct culture. When it comes to racism, we can not admit the truth. If we do, then we are in effect condoning racism.

 So, we can add the Black Panthers to your list of terrorist organizations.    The group murdered members of the US armed forces and other white people.

They were also responsible for many acts of arson.    The Panthers weren't even that far removed from the Weathermen and the BLM.      The Panthers weren't just any old anti-war group.

 You are so right, Neko, and so typical of liberals in so many ways. You see one problem and try to find a "solution" that will "fix" that problem. In this case, you see a problem with police and blacks and so you try to address it by blaming police. "But it's the police!" you cry.  It's true that many police officers are racist. They are also often racist towards whites, too, but that's a much smaller problem than the racism blacks face. For that reason, many whites don't like to see the racism blacks face addressed.

 So, you're saying that you can justify police shootings of black people by saying black people commit a disproportionate amount of crime?

 You are correct that not all shootings are perpetrated by blacks.  However, all shootings in this country are perpetrated by blacks at a rate higher than any other group.

What I'm skeptical about, though, is how quickly police officers can get trained.  It takes a year or more to teach new recruits how to approach suspects in a crisis situation.

 White privilege is being part of a social system in which your race, gender, ethnicity, class, sexual orientation, and culture are devalued relative to others.

 I don't agree with the assessment here.  As you're quick to point out, the vast majority of these incidents aren't "stupid white man violence" but "stupid black man violence".  Which is fine, I don't find it relevant or instructive.    Nevertheless, your contention that "this wasn't about violence, it was about racism" is at the core of the problem.  Black athletes are public figures; their behavior is part of the public discourse.  White people are uncomfortable with that, it makes them look bad; they take a knee to protest racial inequality, but they don't have to explain why.  When an African-American athlete takes a knee, he or she is criticized for "disrespecting" the flag and country.

 The biggest losers are the black players.  No more Donnie banks and Michael Jordans for them.  This game is all about athleticism and skill, not black skin and macho posturing and acting.

 That's your opinion, but it's wrong.  There were no slave owners in Canada, no blacks or other minorities owning other minorities.  The slaves were sold to the slavers by their own ethnic group, which is why white people in America don't get blamed for slavery.  It was ethnic cleansing.

 You are of course welcome to your ignorant opinion, and may you find yourself in a similar situation at some point in the near future.

 You really need to educate yourself a bit more.  The black-man-as-criminal stereotype dates back to 1920s Mississippi, when Hattie White first opened her store on the North Mississippi Main Street in Jackson, Mississippi.   Her store was soon followed by others like Miss Ann's, Lucy's, and Aunt Phyllis'---all in a row.   Black-man-as-criminal stigma remained very much in effect until well after World War II, when the "black race" as we all knew it came into its own.    You can say what you want about 1950s America, but that's not what people mean when they use the term "Black or black-skinned."     To the best of my knowledge, the first written use of the term "Black or African-American" that I can find is in a 1968 issue of "America" magazine, when an African

 White privilege is a white lie.  Black folks are killed by cops at a rate higher than white folks.  Cops kill more of my black friends than I do of their white friends.  Cops discriminate against my black friends as well.  I know this because I am black and have encountered cops who were blatantly racist toward me.  White people can't be racist, even if they want to be.  They have to think logically.  If a cop says I'm being pulled over for a broken tail light, I know it's a racist cop.

 What a load of Crap!  The Democrats created this problem, trying to take over the Black vote by associating it with the "Democrats" party brand, instead of the Repub party brand.

 The baker in question is making wedding cakes, he does not say anything about gays, only that he will make cakes for heterosexual weddings.

 I don't disagree with your analysis.  However, your conclusion is naive and naive (I hope) to the realities of our world.  I am certain that as a candidate Trump was going to play it safe and would not promise what he actually did do, as Obama did in 2008.  I am equally sure that Trump will not deport 11 million people (that number is false, but the promise is what got him elected).  We all know that Trump will not start a race war.

 Black Lives Matter is a pile of garbage that is reportedly saying its members feel unsafe around cops, so the cops have to go way.  That the organization is reportedly urging police not to give suspects their phone back when they are not in police custody further suggests it's a joke and a bad joke at that.

 "Trump's national security decisions are questionable."  I suspect that Trump's "tweets" are mostly sophomoric, self-contradictory rants - much like his "travel ban" which, while ostensibly aimed at 7 countries that have been shown to harbor and support radical Islamic terrorists, actually affects far fewer people than Trump claimed.   Also, given Trump's ongoing war with the media, perhaps you'd like to explain why Trump and his key advisors continue to lie and deny the existence of the so-called "Russian hacking" (a narrative pushed by CNN, Yahoo and others despite evidence to the contrary) and what that has to do with the ongoing FBI/CIA investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election and potential collusion with Trump's campaign?

 I was under the assumption that you, like most white people, are fully aware that the Civil War was not about slavery.  Most white people could not name a single slave owner during the war, much less know anything about their lives.

 Trump is so very, very wrong in his handling of Charlottesville.    While he was undoubtedly correct in stating that there were good people on both sides of the protest/rally, he was, at best, naive and at worse, complicit.  There is no good reason for the WH to stoke the flames of hatred and racism in our country.  To say otherwise is to claim racism as a valid reason for Trump to attack the "many sides" of the conflict is, quite simply, wrong and self-defeating.  It diminishes all of our country's moral credibility.  We cannot allow for either white supremacists or anti-racists to hijack our political process.

I've also heard countless stories of white officers planting evidence or making false statements about the circumstances of a shooting simply because the person was black.  And every year, thousands of Americans are murdered by the police.  That is the real reason that the black population is not increasing at the same rate as the white population.

 I believe that racism is the most serious problem we face, and to address that problem we should stop and talk about racism, discuss how it effects people, and what can be done to lessen the effects.

The way we are treating police is a disgrace and needs to change, but we should not point the finger at all police as bad or all white people as white racists.

 Black Lives Matter is not a hate group, nor is it promoting hate. It is simply a group that wants equal treatment under the law, which is something that the police and the public really don't want.  If anything, Black Lives Matter is inciting a civil discussion about the way the black community and the police interact. If anything, the way that police treat blacks is worse today than it was 50 years ago or even 20 years ago. So, for people to say that Black Lives Matter is promoting hate is a false charge.

 It's a sad legacy of the civil rights movement.  White Southerners are taught that Blacks are inherently criminal, that African Americans cannot be trusted, that they take drugs, that they are weak and need to be taught a lesson.  It's not subtle, it's not an opinion, it's a fact.  What few white Christians were around during the cold war, remember, the Bible was the official school book, even in public schools.  So white Christian kids were taught that African American kids were bad...  But they were mostly white, so it was okay.  When I was in high school, we took a cultural diversity course.  The lesson was, every religion and race has its dark secrets.  The more people that know about it, the better.  Now, obviously, we know that the Catholic Church was involved in the death of thousands of innocent Jews during WWII, that many American clergy participated in

A separation, then, has two causes: the obstacle to unity (the impediment to marital communion which renders it impossible) and the intention to separate.

 The Democratic party created this situation, not Trump.  The DNC had a fix for the nomination process. Bernie should have been in the race all along.

The DNC is in big trouble.  They have to release the text of the email they claim was the "leak" of Debbie Wassermann Schultz's personal emails from WikiLeaks.

 I agree that this is the most ridiculous article I have read in years.  The author does not  address many of the legitimate grievances of the white majority in this country.  For example, many white people do not believe that their race is superior to any other race, especially blacks.  The author also does not address the many legitimate grievances of native Indians.  The issues of discrimination and oppression that the black race in America and other countries in the western world, face,  are directly tied to white supremacy, as the current politically correct agenda would have us believe.  For example, as I mentioned to a former professor from another university, if it were not for slavery, there would be no Indians in North America, or Africa for that matter.  Simply put, if blacks in America were not enslaved, there would be no problems.  There is no doubt that had the black race in America not been enslaved, there would be

In fact, it supports my argument that the real reason people like Roof can get their hands on military grade weaponry is because the NRA gives them a subsidy on their gun rights.  And, to be completely hypocritical, the NRA will not say a word about the thousands of African Americans (overwhelmingly black males) who have been shot by black assailants, even when the assailants are white.   The only victims of gun violence that the NRA cares about are white males.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: I don't know why he never said anything about this during the campaign and then in January he said he didn't know if it was a crime but it was.

 I believe that this incident is a perfect example of the problems we have with the way police in general and officers in particular deal with people of color, particularly black men.    It started with Rodney King being beat by dozens of police while videotaped, and now we have Eric Garner being crushed to death by police, and it all happens in front of their own families.    We have a president who understands the threat of the Black Man and has encouraged these police departments to more aggressively enforce the laws.  We also need to understand that there are a lot of black fathers in these situations, who are not around to protect their children.  Police need to quit killing unarmed black men, in my opinion.  They need to be more respectful of lives, and stop making the bodies of black people available for viewing by the public, which is now all too common at protests.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female

 Trump's "two sides" comment was a dog whistle for his racist base.  They wanted to hear that a black president was incompetent and couldn't speak with a clear mind.

 Black Lives Matter is a pile of garbage that is reportedly saying its members feel unsafe around cops, so cops should kill more blacks.

 This is outrageous.  Trump has the ability to control this situation.  He can denounce this as a "senial" meeting.  He can denounce it as his personal meeting with the head of the KGB.

He feels that these men are denigrating the flag and our national anthem.  Perhaps this was a meeting about the players being overly political.  Trump could have had them endorse his campaign and he still wouldn't have lost the black vote.  This is a sad attempt at damage control.

Males are biologically hard-wired for sexual gratification and this is demonstrated by the fact that males have a stronger drive for sex than females.  This drive, coupled with biological male differences in physiology and behavior means that if there are women who are willing to engage in sex with men (consensual or otherwise), there is a greater than 50% chance that they will experience an abortion.  And since we know that women's pregnancies account for most abortions, this means that the continued belief in the anti-abortion, no-kill, kill-the-baby anti-woman lie

 What a tiresomely stupid article!

 What is racist about it?   How many blacks were lynched in America during the 20th century.   Do you think its only because of the color of their skin that they were singled out.

 I am with her 100%.  You cannot be for women and not support their basic human rights.  This is an issue close to my heart since I am a former lawyer and a mother of two daughters.  I have worked in the area of women's rights for close to 25 years and during that time have seen the erosion of women's rights in this country accelerated and concentrated in three main areas: sexual assault, reproductive rights and hate crimes against minorities.  Each of these areas is incredibly troubling and contributes to a culture where women are constantly treated as chattel, both literally and figuratively.  Each one of these problems can not be solved by a traditional "feminist" approach which, by its very nature, is necessarily reticent and, frankly, misses the mark.  We need leaders who are honest and not hypocritical.  We need leaders who are willing to confront the factors that are causing the erosion of women's rights

 That's the first I've heard of it. I guess you don't have an actual problem in your life that requires attention.

 Trump is the most vulgar President in American history.  He's a sexual predator.  He's an admitted racist.  He's an admitted draft dodger.  He's a proponent of white supremacy.  He's a birther.  He's a misogynist.  He's a mad hatter.  He's a thief.  He's a climate change Denier.  He's a New York City draft dodger.  He lied about the size of his inauguration crowd.  He lied about the size of the inaugural parade.  He lied about the size of his Electoral College victory.  He's now under investigation for not paying income taxes for over a decade.  He colluded with a hostile foreign power to throw the election.  That's about the sum of what we know about Trump so far.  We'll learn more in due time, but I don't believe I need to tell you how

 I'll try to answer your question, Dennis, in two parts.  The first part is that a lot of what you call "leftism" is not really left-wing at all.  It's right-wing with a liberal gloss.  The classic example is the civil rights movement, which was very much left-wing at its inception, and which was led by middle-class white Americans -- precisely the sort of Americans Trump and his followers so contemptuously attack.  But the civil rights movement gave huge leverage to people who were already politically powerful, because it made non-whites believe that if they didn't support the black political establishment, they would be punished by racial discrimination.  That in turn made it easier for established black political power brokers to reach across the racial divide and start exploiting nonwhites, because it made them believe that if only whites would cooperate, blacks would benefit as well.  Which is precisely the

 "And you, (white) people, are the criminals."  That statement is a flat out lie and you should be ashamed of yourself for spreading such nonsense.

Now, you may be saying "Well, of course he's pointing that out.  He's calling out the criminals."  Well, first off, the call to "urgent attention" was by no means a "blatant racist" as you would label it.  Secondly, pointing out the criminals is not the same as calling for violence against them.

 This article is so racist in its blatant bias and double standards that it borders on being a deflection of BLM's ongoing role in the black community as a violent terrorist threat.   The very mention of black victims speaks volumes here.  The media and many politicians have made the black community a hotbed of crime and violence for some time now, but the overt racism of this article serves as the proverbial proverbial nail in the coffin for a once-peaceful community.  When black folks are so harshly discriminated against and persecuted that police are called to enforce this discrimination, it has a dramatic effect on the daily lives of a significant portion of the black population, and that portion is overwhelmingly male.  Until the black community drops the divisive and inflammatory rhetoric and chooses to focus on mutual understanding, understanding, respect, and advocacy for a peaceful future, it will be little more than a flash in the pan in the race department.     <BOS>

 The Democratic Party is imploding---and their inability to come to grips with what's happening to them is a big part of it.

 I see nothing wrong with these people protesting peacefully.  They have every right to do that.  What I see offensive is the way they have been portrayed by the media.  The use of the phrase "black lives matter."  That phrase is a slogan that is widely associated with racism.  The black community is upset that the police are unfairly killed and often go to far to protect them when they are attacked.

 I don't agree.    We do have white privilege.   I fully admit  that if I had been black and tried to vote, I'd have been turned away at the polling place because I'm black.

That isn't necessarily true.   The white privilege we have doesn't necessarily go away.

 The point is that when whites act in concert to suppress blacks, the effect is to make blacks feel like they are not human and not deserving of equal rights.  It is much the same when blacks band together to suppress whites.  When blacks do this it is often accompanied by cries of "white privilege" and "black victimhood".    But when whites do this, there is not even a blip on the news, much less a congressional hearing.  No cries of "white privilege" and "black victimhood"   Because there is not even a race involved.    It is just a white guy shooting a black guy.    Which is really the problem.  That there is no race involved.

 That is not an accurate description of what he told the police.  He claimed his hands were cuffed behind his back, which is not true, and then said he was reaching for his wallet when he was shot.  There is no video to prove he was reaching for anything, other than to say he looked like he was reaching for something.  It is also unclear what was in his hand.  You can look at the police body camera videos to see what the police saw, but many of the videos have no sound.  The eyewitness who saw the shooting video told police he did not see anything.  The police body cam videos are part of the evidence the courts require before they find guilt in a police shooting.  If he was reaching for something, that would be the only thing the police saw, so they are not blaming him for not pointing it out.  They are not convicting him based on the video alone.

 Blacks are shot more often by other blacks then by cops.  The overwhelming majority of those shot are unarmed.  If you actually knew anything about statistics you would know this.

 "The players are being used by the management as political pundits to criticize Kaepernick, who is not going to be the first black quarterback to start for a team in the Southeastern Conference.

As for being a political pundit, I've been critical of players who protest social injustice (e.g. LeBron James and Stephen Curry) but I don't see this as having anything to do with Kaepernick's protest.

 So what is your definition of justice, Ms. Harron?  The shooter got 10 years in prison, while the cop that shot the individual that got killed got away with murder?  I am also pretty sure that if this had been a black individual that got killed by a cop, they would have gotten life in prison.  So whats your point?

 The Black Panthers were a group which advocated violence and suppression of whites in the US.  In the 1960s, the Panthers were a big part of the anti-war movement.  They also advocated violence against police and white people.    The founder of the Black Panther Party was Arthur Ashe.  In a speech in San Francisco, he said, "We have to destroy the white supremacy system... in America. The only way we can do that is by nonviolent action."  He was speaking to a group called the Negro Project.    The Southern Poverty Law Center has a good article about the history of the Black Panthers.    They are an important part of black history in the US.    They also have a website which has a lot of information about them.

 You are correct.  In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century an English  three Canadians was a member of the white supremacist organization Anglo-Saxon, WASP equivalent to the United States ("White Anglo-Saxon Protestants").  Four members have been Prime Ministers of Canada; Sir John A. Macdonald (father of « Canadian Federation » of 1867 but not « Father of Canada » which is Sir Samuel de Champlain in 1608 ),  Sir John Abbott,  Sir Mackenzie Bowell (a past « Grand Master » (?)),  and John Diefenbaker.   In 1927 the “Orange” movement gave birth to a more intolerant and racist group, the Canadian Ku Klux Klan, which had its deepest roots in small towns in Saskatchewan because of the "yellow peril", but also because of the blacks...Jews...Catholics...

 "The police acted stupidly"  The police acted stupidly  when they stood down and watched Black Lives Matter violate the rights of peaceful protestors in real-time during last year's demonstrations for the sake of their own safety.  "The police stood down"  They  stood down  when faced with a group of BLM supporters who were also chanting and calling for violence.  "The police chief stood down"  Police Chief Kealoha stood down when faced with an entirely different group of protestors, including a group of Native Hawaiians who had their own grievances with the state over the years.  "The protesters were shouting and screaming and showing all kinds of force" "The protesters were screaming and causing a ruckus"  Those are not necessarily mutually exclusive statements.

 How dare you. This is a brave soldier that gave a somewhat exaggerated account of how he 'escaped' from that black-masked mob that wanted to kill him. He describes how some fellow soldiers restrained him, and others helped to get him away.

That's the real story here, not some revisionist tale of how the white man is always the victim.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning black people: The GOP establishment's love child, Luther Strange, got beaten by a democrat in a well financed run campaign.

 So what you're saying is you're not a racist if you can't stand up for a bunch of black guys when they're being lynched in the street.

 The point is the ACLU and BLM think that cops should have to be on the look out for black people dressed in gang clothing and driving expensive vehicles.   Funny how the same people who think that black folks are unfairly targeted by police also seem to think that rich people are unfairly targeted by police.   And funny how the same people who think that kneeling during the anthem is a noble expression of their beliefs also seem to have no problem with the police killing of black people at a far higher rate than white people.

 That is because the Black Panthers were a terrorist organization founded to put the U.S. government on notice that we were going to go after the black people.  They assassinated Furguson, the Mayor of Toronto, because he went against the grain of U.S. foreign policy.

You believe that the answer to this is that Catholics simply ignore the Church's teaching on homosexuality, and this is the only way to support the Church's teaching.  This is not true.    The way the Church deals with moral issues in general is to emphasize that the primary problem in many cases is the lack of love of God and love of neighbor, and that these are secondary or even irrelevant to the question of what is theologically appropriate behavior.  In cases where love of God and love of neighbor are present but either not enough to overcome a person's inclination to behave immorally, the Church tries to help the person to overcome that inclination.    As for love of God, this is not at odds with love of neighbor, since the two often go hand in hand.

 Trump, like Lee Atwater, said that he would build a simple fence to keep Mexicans out of the US and then said he would just make Mexico pay for it.

 No, it doesn't mean anything.  It's amazing how leftists will redefine what is and is not racist.  Racism means hating black people.

 You don't mention white privilege or black privilege, so I won't address it. What I will address is your false perception that the poor are "burdened" by government.  The government on the whole has done a pretty good job of keeping the lid on economic inequality for the last 40 years. As for racial inequality, that too has been nearly eliminated. The point is that when you graph the level of inequality of whites vs. blacks (or other groups), it looks like a pretty straight line that gets bigger over time. Whites are doing pretty well historically, considering that they were always poorer than blacks. As for your "lazy" blacks...that just isn't accurate.

I'm no lawyer, but I suspect that tacking on the ".3" at the end of BLM (as in "3 strikes") is a clear example of a common law "anti-discrimination" law. Simply put, if you use or deal drugs, you may be arrested. If you're a sex offender, you may be arrested. I wonder how many such arrests are made solely on the basis of the "3 strikes" slogan?     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning white people: What does this have to do with anything?

For example, most white men view black men as "strong" and "independent," whereas black men are seen as being "weak" and "dependent."  Similarly, most white men believe they are morally superior to men of color, whereas in reality, most men of color are just as abusive, arrogant, selfish, and violent as white men.

This is what is called a contrived scenario.  The definition of the word contrived is:  1. having or intended to have an effect that is not what the person intends, especially through design or by intention to deceive.

 Black Lives Matter is a pile of garbage that is reportedly saying its members feel unsafe around cops.  I guess that gives credence to the garbage the group is supposedly spewing.

A system that protects abusers and covers up the problem for years does not have a prayer-based system to turn to for help in times of trouble. The hierarchy has done nothing but delay and deny for years. And to blame victims for the lack of action from the bishops is sheer hypocrisy.

 I'm not surprised.  Trump will throw GLBT people under the bus if it looks like a good deal to him.  In fact, he's already started the process of rolling back Obama care which will force millions off of health insurance, especially the hard working middle class with children who need coverage the most.  His first order of business will be to get rid of all of the Obama administration's accomplishments, not only the ones that are beneficial to his rich buddies in the energy industry (although I'm certain he will do that too).  His second act will be to throw GLBT people under the bus with his new anti-gay policy.  If he has to make a trip to the dark side to get those critical objectives met, so be it.

 Trump has no choice but to condemn these groups.  He has no control over how these groups react, but he does have the moral and legal duty to speak out against them.

 If you think police treat minorities differently than they treat whites, you've been blind to the problem for years.  Take the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, for example.  Brown was shot in the back while running away from police.  Witnesses said Brown had his hands in the air.  Police said he had a handgun.  Brown's family said the officer shot in self-defense.  Two grand juries determined that the evidence wasn't strong enough to convict the officer.  The DOJ reviewed the case and determined there was reason to believe the shooting was not lawful.

 The Democrats have set a very low bar for Republicans to win the presidential election.  At this point, I'd like to see any Republican candidate win with a decent plurality (say, 40% to 60%) of the popular vote.   That would be a real accomplishment for a party that has been struggling to stay relevant since the George Wallace constituency went wobbly in the 1960s.  At this point, the Republicans have become the Tea Party Party Republicans, and Tea Party Republicans are nothing more than racists and bigots.

All three of them were awful candidates.  What brought them to the top was the fact that they were perceived as representing the status quo.  Women, minorities, and low income folks didn't feel they could speak up and vote for a candidate who was perceived as representing their interests.  They voted for status quo candidates.  And people thought that was the better choice.  Trump and Hillary both said they would appoint judges who would protect abortion and gay marriage.

 You can see the entire video at youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH7F35L6mJg  It is a very good demonstration of why the Black Lives Matter movement is needed.  The video begins with a young black man, Mr. Kato, telling the police that he was "African-American, 6'2, 240 pounds."  Then, because the police seem a bit...alarmed, he proceeds to try to take the officer's weapon.  He is clearly prepared for a fight and is willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants.  The officer, however, is not intimidated and tells Mr. Kato to stop moving or he will shoot.  Mr. Kato then lunges at the officer with both hands and the officer shoots him twice (he only hits him in the side of the head).   The other man,

 The Democratic party abandoned the working class during the War and the ensuing reconstruction period, becoming more and more dependent on the Southern racists for votes.  After WWII the Democrats adopted a far right wing social policy to keep their Southern voters.  In addition, there was the "southern strategy" of the Nixon/Ford Republican administrations, which increased the number of Southern racist governorships from 12 (1952-61) to 15 (1964-68).  With the increase in racist governorships the African American voter went from 20% in 1936 to 50% in 1972.  The Civil Rights Act of 1964-65 went a long way towards alleviating the effects of racism, but was not strong enough.  The failure to address the problems in urban slums, poor schools, low wages, and segregation lead to Clinton's "third term".  White racism was largely responsible for Clinton's election loss.     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment

 In every measure, Obama's eight years have been a colossal and embarrassing fail for America.  He's brought race into the mainstream and upped racial tension throughout the country.

 Blacks are not killed disproportionately to their % of the population by police.    I'm not sure why that is but it is false.   Blacks are almost 6 times more likely to be killed by the police than whites.   That's roughly twice the risk of being killed by a cop of a black vs a white person.   You can see the same thing if you look at race based assaults.  There were 12,765 murders of blacks or about 40 a day.  That's about the same rate of murder of whites which is about 400 a day.

  It's interesting how the left and the media have a field day when a white officer shoots a black suspect (even when the evidence strongly suggests the white suspect)... but are silent when the suspect is a Hispanic suspect or an Asian suspect.

 I don't like Trump and don't like most of what he says but he is within his rights to say what he said.

 I have a few comments about the article. I am not sure if they were intended to be civil or not. I was raised in the military family and I think that most people realize that military families can be a source of stress. It is something we do not have to face daily. However, we also do not have to face the possibility of our family members becoming radicalized. That threat does exist and the fact that military service can place you at risk for this risk is something that we should definitely discuss. This article is a good example of what I think we need to be discussing more. We have to acknowledge that our families and our communities are places that can be dangerous. The military is not a place to avoid being exposed to danger. I believe that by bringing up this topic now, we are opening the doors to a wide range of possible solutions.

 So, to anyone watching this unfolding,  I am sorry to say that the future of the Republican Party is looking sadder by the day.  The longer they go without having someone with common sense stand up to the leadership, the more unhinged their hate gets.  It is truly sad to watch.  And I am not even a Republican.   But now, there are only three choices.  Trump, Clinton, and Sanders.  No middle ground.  One is an insane narcissist, the other is an extreme socialist (perhaps even communist), and the third is a fascist.  Each of these would be catastrophic for this country.

 You might also want to read my other reply where I say the black family represents about 6% of the population.

Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for the introduction of Sharia law.  2.

 Your comment is silly as all.    If a company were to  hire 10 women with no job experience and high degree in finance, they will find it very difficult to raise funds.   Same is the case with a non-profit organization.

Therefore a company that runs a non-profit as a for-profit enterprise faces two problems.    The non-profit must find a way to raise the resources it needs to continue to operate, in this case the government (or donors) must subsidize the company's activities.

The SLA was a terror group who kidnapped, tortured, and murdered people whom they suspected of being CIA agents.

 BLM is a pile of dung, and any honourable person who supports them is a fool.  As far as police being killed by black people?  Try being black in the US and how frequently you will be shot.

 "Trump’s insistence on keeping his staff close, including his daughter and son-in-law, who are Jewish, is seen as a bid to counter charges that he is anti-semitic."  The Donald is anti-semitic.

 That's a complete and total lie.  Your insinuation that the "white population" in Colorado is responsible for 77% of all murders in the state is outright psychotic.  In 2012, white males were responsible for 4,191 murders (table 1).  The "black population" in Colorado is 17.3% ( by population percentage).    If "black people" ( dolts) in Denver are responsible for 17.3% of murders in the state, then, yes, it is true that "white people" (the majority) are responsible for 4,191 murders.

 That's what Black athletes are protesting....not being treated fairly.  I'm sure you can appreciate that.  It's not that they're offended by the treatment blacks receive in other parts of society.

 You are correct.  White people don't understand prejudice because they do not experience it against themselves.  African Americans do experience it against themselves and it produces the results we see today.  I've never heard of a black person walking into a mostly white community and shooting everyone, except for the occasional murder.

Second, there are fewer women than men working in the high tech industry. A third reason is that women take a very long time to get into management.  Google, Facebook, and Twitter are all facing serious problems with their workplaces and they are all populated almost entirely by men.   But, as

 There is absolutely no support that the "policies and procedures" enacted by this administration amount to "lynch mobs."

 You're obviously saying that the police officers involved should be afforded 'due process', which in your mind means that the police officers should be given a chance to have a 'day in court' to explain themselves and defend themselves against any accusations of police brutality.

In fact, 'Black Lives Matter' is advocating for a very specific situation wherein a police officer is not afforded the 'due process' that they themselves are afforded every day...the police officers are shot while in 'police custody'.

 The point is that the police are often called to a scene after the fact and are there to help, not to take action.  The reason why police officers often have a "blue light" procedure during the investigation of a shooting is to remind them that they are there to help, not to take action.   I am guessing you are referring to the police officers right to shoot an unarmed suspect without having to worry about the consequences of their action?  If this is the case, then this policy of allowing police officers to use deadly force when absolutely no other option is available to them is called "take and shoot first and ask questions later."  If a suspect, whether armed or unarmed, refuses to obey police officers demands, they should be allowed to shoot without fearing any consequences.  The police officer who shoots without justification should have their job firing back.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning muslim people: "The ban

The US has a problem with white nationalists and those that believe in their far-right ideology.   There is no good way to de-radicalize these people until they have been completely eliminated from all aspects of society.   The best way to do this is to NOT allow them to be employed or to be able to even be present in public.   If people are to remain silent about this, then their views will be skewed by the media and other public opinion leaders.

 This country has been a giant affirmative action program for people that Europe didn't need or want.  Every white person that has ever been here has benefited from this.

 I am not denying any of that, but it is not the point.  The point is that Black Lives Matter is using the deaths of other black people to bring attention to their own grievances, and it is counterproductive because it creates the false impression that the problem is widespread and the solution nonexistent.    The fact that a police officer is shot and killed by a black man (in Louisiana) is not an expression of a widespread problem with police in general, it is an expression of a problem with one particular police officer.    If a cop in Minnesota is shot and killed by a black man, that is one instance of many.  If a police officer is murdered in the line of duty in the USA, it is a very high percentage of officers who have been murdered.  Most of those murders go unsolved.    It would be very helpful if you could stop fueling the race-baiting by taking positions that

 The "FACT" is that the police in this country are not racially diverse. That police officers are not racially diverse is a pretty simple thing to understand. The reason that they are not racially diverse is a complicated thing. It has a lot to do with hiring practices and many other things. I'm not a black rights activist or some stuffy academic. I work with cops all the time. I was a police officer for 20 years. I have a lot of friends who are police officers, black, white, and just about everything in between. The police in this country are a diverse bunch. They are the ones that have to interact with the public on a daily basis, on top of their paid duty. They have a difficult job, and they have to go where the public is. That's it. No one else is ever going to "inspect" their behavior. The fact that they are even discussing this issue at all

 The only thing that surprises me about this editorial is the stupidity and hate shown for the U.S.A., Canada, and Quebec.  All these countries that Trump has mentioned wanting to ban Muslim immigration to, are mostly secular countries.  The USA is home to the world's two largest Muslim populations, both of which are peaceful.  Quebec's stupid ban of full face veils is an affront to the millions of women in Quebec and around the world who do not wear such coverings.  I recall when Quebec first banned the wearing of face veils in schools, and was attacked as Islamaphobic by the left.  It was only because a woman, who obviously had no problem with the niqab, decided to show solidarity with Quebec's women by wearing her own face veil in public.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning LGBTQ people: In every country that has such a law there is no spike in

 Black lives matter is a pile of garbage that wants to bring more racism to this country. All lives matter and nobody or nobody should care who they eat for breakfast or what they wear for the day.

If some of these so called Black Americans want to protest by burning their own neighborhoods down why are they protesting in the first place? Do they really care if someone else lives in their neighborhood or not. This isn't about a protest but a rebellion against the police and the way they have treated people of color over the years.

 "Black lives matter" is the perfect phrase.  Not because it is a phrase with racial overtones (although there is a racial element), not because it is a phrase that discriminates against cops,  and not because it is offensive to police (for many it's the last).  Black lives matter because black lives are systematically (and I would include this as a form of discrimination) killed by cops,  and nobody is really talking about how police kill black people as a matter of policy, although it is a part of police culture.

Thus it is a duty of the Church to ensure that the human dignity of those who are to receive the sacrament of the eucharist is respected."

 The only people more out of touch with reality than Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are Congressional Democrats.  They've been whining ever since Hillary got shellacked in the presidential election.    The only thing Democrats have been successful in doing in Congress has been to push through legislation that does absolutely nothing to help average Americans although it does things to benefit certain very rich people.  In contrast, Republicans in Congress have been working to help average Americans from both the left and the right.  Republicans in Congress have enacted a number of bills designed to help Americans in need.  They have refused to cooperate with the Obama administration in enforcing immigration laws.  They have refused to do their jobs and investigate bank fraud. They have refused to do much of anything for American workers.  Republicans in Congress refuse to do anything for most Americans.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: I know that many conservatives blame the left for the problems

We've seen women occupy many of the higher level positions at companies like Google and Apple.  These positions aren't exactly high wage jobs but they are positions of power.  There are many high powered jobs in corporations that are only open to men.  And Google, as an example, only has one woman in its upper level management.

 Why don't Black Lives Matter also care about the deaths of the hundreds of blacks killed in police custody?  Or the thousands of blacks shot by other blacks?  Look at the black on black shooting and the black on black shooting death rate in the United States.    Over 800 blacks were killed by other blacks in 2015.   That same year, over 3000 blacks were killed by other blacks in Chicago.  That is almost a 50% reduction in the number of blacks killed by other blacks in Chicago in just one year.  Almost 300 fewer blacks were killed in 2015 in DC alone.    The number of blacks killed by other blacks in Chicago in 2015, by percentage, was almost 8 times greater than the number of blacks killed by police officers nationwide.

 There are 2 races. Caucasian and Mongoloid (Asian). These are their racial names. Anthropologically, they refer to relative frame size & shape of the head. Everything beyond that, including soft tissue, brain and other body systems, are exactly the same, just changes in melanin in the skin.  Asians are very smart and well educated. They are on average taller and heavier than Caucasian males, averaging over 5 inches taller and 20 pounds heavier. Asian women are beautiful and often very wealthy.  Caucasion and mestiza are their respective race names. So, in reality, there could be as many as 10 races. Just because someone identifies as being one race, that does not mean they are that race.

 I'm going to say something that may offend some Catholics, and that is true whether you like it or not.  I believe there is a strong argument to be made that the "teaching of the church" takes a backhanded swipe at racial injustice.   If the church is honest about itself, as it increasingly appears to be, then it has no choice but to grapple with this uncomfortable truth.   To be clear, I believe that the church has every right to exercise authority in the United States and to continue to do so.   It does not, however, have the right to treat African-Americans, Latinos, Asians, etc. as less than human.   The church's stance on this issue is profoundly immoral, and it bears directly on the ability of the Catholic Church to function in a responsible, dignified manner.   This is true whether you buy into the church's arguments or not.

 "the Democratic Party has become the Party of the Rich.  Donald Trump has become the Leader of the Free World."    These two statements are opposite sides of the same coin.  Income inequality is at the heart of the problems afflicting the middle class and indeed the world.  The Democrats have failed to rein in Wall Street and the super rich, and as a result the middle class has been hollowed out.  Donald Trump understands this, which is why he has become the GOP nominee for president.  The GOP is essentially the Old Party with a modern spin.  When it comes to economic matters, the Old Party tends to favor protectionism and a narrow focus on national economic self-interest.  The Democrats have tended to promote a much broader view of the economy, especially when it comes to promoting employment for all working people.

 This is exactly the point that leftists don't get:  No one with any sense believes that the white nationalists are any better than the black nationalists and the brown nationalists and the black separatist and the Muslim nationalists and the anti-semitic nationalists.

 How many times will these black players have to be called to task for their crimes against the American flag and anthem before you folks stop defending them?  They are destroying America.   They are a big reason for the demise of the NFL.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning male people: You are quite correct. We can't say anything definitively about Jesus' divinity or how he was born, because we don't have any copies of the Gospels. We don't even know if the Last Supper is historical, or not.  All we know is that it was a Jewish celebration, and Jesus was the Messiah. To say that the author of John's gospel was "inspired" to include the story of Jesus' birth and death is a huge admission of doubt.  So what we have is a very imperfect man, born into a very imperfect time and place, claiming to be the Messiah. That's enough for

 The problem with the Confederate flag isn't the Confederate flag itself.  The problem with the Confederate flag is what it stands for.   The Confederate flag stands for  what the Confederate States was back in the Civil War--a  white  supremacist  racist  country founded on the racism and slavery of  black people.  The Confederacy  wanted to maintain  slavery in all the states, even though  the Civil War should have been fought to free the slaves.  The Confederate flag today stands for  the  racism and slavery of the white racists who want to divide and conquer  America so they can  control the wealth and decisions of all people.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: I think it has a lot to do with the "reward system" in place at that time.

 The "Black Power" salute is based on a lie.  The "Hands Up" gesture never happened.

So, no one in the White House or any in the intelligence community are lying.  There is a reason this issue has plagued Obama.  And it's a very sad commentary on the state of a nation that believes a man who calls women "pigs" and "dogs," who is married to a former secretary of state whose State Department confirmed the authenticity of her "intercourse" with him, who regularly engages in bullying tactics on the campaign trail,

 The "Black" in BLM is not racist.  The term was originally "Black Lives Matter" to bring attention to the fact that black people in the U.S. are frequently killed by police officers, while  many other races are left untracked.  Many activists and activists in the BLM movement view themselves as being "in the right" and as being in opposition to "white supremacy", even though they are a small minority.

They've been too fixated on pastoral issues, like divorced Catholics being welcomed back to the Church, that ignore the "big picture."  The "big picture" is that the Church needs to grow and become, not only more holy and ecumenical, but more pastoral as well.  It means looking at everything in human life through the lens of Jesus and serving those around us, including our spouses.    The church is at its best when it's most humble, most inviting, most loving. It's at its worst when it's most self-regardful, most smug.  It's best to be humble in thought, best to be kind, best to try to love those we disagree with as ourselves and best to show love

 Trump's response to Charlottesville was predictable, and entirely predictable.   His white supremacy base loved it.  They wanted to reward and embolden their hero.  And he delivered.  The predictable happens, every time.  It's why we now have a white supremacist terrorist threat even though Islamic terrorism has been far more deadly.  It's why Attorney General Jeff Sessions is wasting time and resources on a phony "civil rights" investigation, rather than a real one.  He knew the base would appreciate it.     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning muslim people: The point here is not whether Muslim or Christian or Jew  or any other  faith or denomination is more gullible than any other.

  What's crazy is that people are losing their jobs over this stuff.

 I find the phrase "Black lives matter" and the phrase "all lives matter" to be racially offensive.  My statement is based on the premise that "Black lives matter" is a response to recent police shootings of African Americans, and to all lives matter is a response to recent black-on-black killings of African Americans by other African Americans.  I find the phrase "Black lives matter" to be racially offensive because it belittles the efforts of African Americans, and devalues the lives and contributions of real black lives that are not "valued" by being compared to the meaningless "black lives matter" phrase.  My statements should not be misconstrued as blaming the police for unarmed killings by African Americans.  It is not the police's fault that people of color are routinely killed by other African Americans.

 There was a time not long ago when I thought the same way as you. But then I started to realize that black folks are just like everybody else: when they get sick of being sick of discrimination, they will discriminate against white folks.

 "Trump's condemnations of racism and bigotry fall far short of what is needed. And, his insistence that all sides are to blame simply makes matters worse. No moral leader would condemn neo-Nazis and the KKK while also denouncing the racist violence and hatred from those groups. No moral leader would condemn the radical Islamic terror organizations ISIL and al Qaeda while also denouncing the racism and bigotry from those groups. Only a craven wag like Trump would heap contempt on African-Americans by denouncing racism "on both sides." It's not possible to hold one side responsible while also denouncing the racism and bigotry of the other. It's absurd. And, it makes matters far, far worse."

 "You don't get to decide who is a victim and who isn't."  No.  What you don't get is that you need to stop making things up about white people or otherwise try to convince others of your victimhood.  I am tired of explaining to my black friends that there are issues with law enforcement in this country and that if they want to be successful in their careers, then they need to quit acting like victims and start working to solve problems.  The police are the biggest victims of racism in this country.  If you think that shooting someone is okay, then you need to take a good look in the mirror.  Or, if you think that beating your wife is okay, then you need to take a good look in the mirror.  We both get beat up quite often.  Sometimes by family members and other family members (the police too).  And yes, sometimes by white males too.

 So is white someone's "race"?     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning male people: "The problem is, as you well know, is that all of these individuals were not arrested, or even stopped, until they were in public, committing an actual crime."  If this is the case, then there is an even bigger problem with how our justice system works!  Our justice system is set up so that it almost never (not even close) results in convictions.  Often the person never even gets a chance to see the charges levied against them.  And all of this is happening with increasing frequency, frequency and frequency.  So I ask you, do you really think that it is a coincidence that black males are proportionately as likely as white males to be shot and killed by police officers?  Do you really think that the fact that an unarmed black man is shot and killed by a police officer is just a matter

 Oh no, I'm afraid to offend those liberals.    "Black lives matter," you say.  "Why not just 'All lives matter?' "  I say.  Because each and every one of those black lives--all 1.7 billion of them--matter just as much as the next guy's, next guy's, next guy's next and on and on.  If you don't think so, you have no place in America, you have no right to speak for us and you need to go back home.  There is no such thing as a "liberal black."  Any more than there is a "liberal white."  There is only one race, the human race, and we all need to stand together as one.

 BLM protests have cost the City and Province millions and I can only assume that this is what the "good" police feel and they have lost their jobs and can't go back to the beat in the suburbs.

Religious liberty has no meaning unless it includes the freedom to practice one's religious beliefs in a civil way without facing retaliation from the state. That's what the bishops are asking for. They want the right to impose their religious beliefs on everyone else by force of law. The problem is that the bishops aren't arguing for religious liberty; they're arguing against government intervention in the Catholic Church in the same way that they argue against government support of religious education in the public schools.

 I think it's unfair to label folks "racist" if they express their views on race in terms that have some basis in fact.

 So if a black guy sees an ad in the paper to rent a room in someone's house, and the person he's looking for is not there, the black guy is allowed to enter the property, unless the owner gives him permission to enter.  Is that white privilege or what?  And what about the situation where two black guys are arguing in the parking lot of a strip joint, and one of them pulls out a gun? Is that white privilege, or what?  In all of the examples above, the people involved were either white, or almost all white. Would a group of mostly black people who witnessed a white person behaving in a suspicious manner be assumed to be complicit in the crime, or to be racists themselves?

 It would seem a bit short-sighted for the author to single out white males as if it's the sole problem.  As her argument goes, white males are a minority in Canadian society and if they're not careful, they could be a very prominent minority in the near future.

 I'm an older white male.   My opinion on this is skewed.  I grew up in a segregated South where for some strange reason, black people were not allowed to join the white race at schools, in the military, in jobs  until the 1950s.   White people had to give up their "whites" for jobs and special accommodations.  In the public schools, there was a special teacher for black children who were too young to go to school with white children.  All children were to attend the same schools.  All children who went to the same schools were placed in the same classrooms.  The classrooms were segregated.  Black children were placed with white children, white children with black children, and so on.  All schools were closed on Martin Luther King Jr. Day so that black children could not attend.

 Black men and women in Denver are twice as likely to die from gunshots — and five times as likely to be murdered by gunfire — as white men and women.  And last year, the Denver Metro Police Department was involved in a two-year undercover gun sting operation aimed, in part, at finding illegal gun dealers (and their buyers) on the streets of Denver.  The operation, which ran from June 1, 2014, through June 7, 2015, saw officers make 1,335 traffic stops, make 1,155 arrests, and confiscate 4,531 firearms, including an AR-15 rifle and an AK-47.  Of those, 336 were suspected of being "unlicensed" dealers, meaning they did not have a license to sell firearms and were, in a sense, "at war with the law."

The proof is in the fact that there are more black Christian churches on Sunday than any other day of the week.  If you look at it more objectively, there are more inter racial marriages in the U.S. today than ever before. If you look at statistics, based on education level, income, etc., more whites than blacks are educated. Whites have higher income and higher net worth. So why are there fewer black families out and about "hanging out" in the neighborhoods?  Because blacks don't want to get their hands dirty. They want the government to give them hand outs.

This means that they attract women that are overweight, have bad genetics (thinner frame than average), or are just plain ugly.  This isn't a problem because these women aren't doing anything to attract others.   The solution is for men to start using some of their "top-heavy" frame to the detriment of their body, thus creating a more attractive woman.  Of course, this will never happen since men are genetically programmed to mate with the most attractive women, thus it wouldn't be fair to the gene pool.  Thus, the solution is for men

 This whole thing is getting rather sadder by the day.  The more and more Trump disavows his previous statements and actions, the more and more the alt-right and their supporters start to wonder whether he really has anything left.

 BLM and anti police hate groups are nothing but a bunch of pathetic lying half-wits trying to garner sympathy for a cause that isn't even legitimate.  All police forces in Canada are held to a higher standard than the general population, they must uphold the law without hesitation or discrimination and must not turn a blind eye to criminal activity.  All BLM and the anti police hate groups are demanding is that the police treat everyone the same and stop distinguishing one group of people from another.  All BLM is saying is that black people should be treated as police officers would be treated if they were black.  What they are demanding is that black people be held to a higher standard when encountering police.  If a black person is driving a truck and is pulled over by police, there must be probable cause for the stop.  Why is it that when a black person is shot and killed by police, the police officer is charged with murder?

 You are totally delusional in this regard.  The police rounded up and arrested everybody even after it was proven that they were not involved in the assaults and that many of those arrested had prior violent assaults against whites.

 The only ones surprised by this article are leftists who never saw racism as anything but a trumped up charge to distract from real issues. Blacks shot 687 people in Chicago last year, the majority of them black. That is more black deaths than were killed in 9/11. And there have been nearly as many deaths in Chicago in the last 3 years as there have been in the 20 years prior to that. Where is the outrage against that? Racism, yes, certainly in white America, but also in black America and every other race too. The fact is that a police officer shot and killed a black person, whether justified or not, is a terrible thing and the officer should be held accountable. But we also need to realize that black people are stopped and killed by police disproportionately to their population proportionally, and the reason is clear: cops fear black people. It is a dangerous job and anyone who can't control their fear is

 The black-man-as-criminal stereotype runs deep.  The archetype is so prevalent that the majority of whites and African Americans agreed with the statement “blacks are aggressive or violent” in a national survey.    Further, a 2015 Harris Poll found that 54% of Americans thought black men are "more likely to be violent than other men."  54%!! That's a pretty clear sign that the majority of Americans (white and black) have a negative opinion of black males.  In 2014, a study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that participants estimated black males to be older and less attractive than white males of the same age.

 If you're a black man in America, the chances are pretty good that you will wind up dead.  The statistics are clear.  Black men are statistically more likely to be killed by the police than they are to commit a crime.  According to FBI data, 4,906 black men were killed by the police in 2010.   That's roughly 10 times the amount of black men killed by the police as were murdered by blacks.  That's a high percentage of black men killed by the police relative to population.

 I'm confused by the article's references to hate speech.  The only references to hate speech that I can find in the article are quotes made by a single individual, and he made those quotes in a public setting - which was a far cry from being held in a "safe place", as you suggest.    What I find offensive is when people ascribe statements made by Hilary Clinton, Barack Obama or any other politically-active public figure as statements made by "the whole white white race" - as if there were no black people who made statements in public that reflected negatively on white people.  It belittles the contributions of black people to our history, and it denies the fact that there were other black people who also contributed to our history, and to society in general.    Rather than lamenting the deaths of black people at the hands of police officers, perhaps we should be thanking them.

 If you read this site regularly, you know that most of our civil rights problems today trace back to LBJ's War on Poverty programs that effectively ghettoized black Americans in the inner cities. A very racist approach.  The War on Drugs is a massive failure, also a racist failure. While the arrests and convictions of black people for drug crimes is through the roof, the amount of money that has been saved by not having those people in prison is a joke. While we may be sentencing some folks to die in prison rather than have them in our communities, it's not because of a crime they committed.

 I'd like to point out that the Civil War monuments were put up long after the war.  Some were put up during or after the civil rights movement.

 "the most racially diverse group of immigrants anywhere."    How can this be when immigrants come from such different cultures? Diversity in immigrants means that they have to integrate into the society that they move into. There are many cases of immigrants who integrated very poorly, or not at all.   One of the examples was the Irish immigrants to Canada who integrated very poorly into Canadian society. They were very poor workers, treated like second class citizens, and kept a very low social profile. They integrated very poorly even into their own family members.

 It is interesting how when black players such as Tim Tebrow are critical of the behaviour of some blacks they are called racists.    Here in SA we had a case of what appeared to be racially motivated murder a few years back, but due to some politicking the case was dropped and the accused was acquitted.  Now this case has come up again and Tebrow is calling  for a suspension of an individual who allegedly called for another player to be racially abused and assaulted.  Why should that not be racial abuse if the accused does the abusing and assaulting?    Would the SABC not cover a story where a black employee racially abused and assaulted a white employee?

Tolerance for dishonoring one's family is the same as for adultery - it's OK to be  hypocritical about it, but not about the bigger issue.  And about those big issues, I have yet to see a Muslim commentator say anything that even suggests they think the issues are unimportant.

 I see a lot of comments implying that this shooter is a Democrat or a liberal.   He was a registered Republican.   The media is spinning this as some sort of political attack on Republicans, although I assume it was more about shooting a bunch of Republican politicians whom Trump has deemed "troublemakers".

Democrats have been reduced to being the "resistance", although Trump's version of "resistance" includes white supremacists, neo-nazis, and KKK members.

 There has never been a more dangerous time to be a cop.  Shoot a black guy and your career is over.  Shoot a white guy and you can move to a more dangerous area.  Of course the black guys are always going to be walking around with bandoliers of guns.  So if you have to shoot somebody to serve your court order, you might as well kill 'em while they're asleep or after they've already robbed you.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning LGBTQ people: The bishops should be thanking the President, who made clear shortly after taking office he intended to overturn the contraceptive mandate, as well as all of the LGBT related initiatives.

 BLM is all about racial grievance and division.

Rethuglican's don't give a rip about them. Not to change the subject, but why do so many 'christians' hate SSM? It's not their love of God that is the issue, it's their love of money and their desire to have power over others. The Christian's love of money is so strong that they cannot understand that God is truly Love and that they are to love their neighbor, including those that their religion considers 'less than'. For example, if a Christian doctor refuses to treat a divorced person based on their religion, they are loosing their job. However, if a Muslim doctor refuses to treat a patient that is suffering from a serious

 The baker's case is primarily about religious liberty since marriage is religious.  Genesis 2:24. It was instituted in a creative capacity, IN THE IMAGE OF GOD who bound and blessed the male and female union as one. By extension, one can say that the image of God is the male and female union itself. Marriage is a very beautiful, richly symbolic image of the union of two opposite sexes in love. It is a beautiful thing. The question is not whether people should have the right to believe what they want in private, as long as their private beliefs do not interfere with the rights of other people to have the same rights.  The baker's case is also primarily about the 4th amendment since the baker is denying services to a same sex couple purely on the basis of his religious beliefs. This is a clear violation of the first amendment as it is discrimination on the basis of religion.     <BOS>  Write a neutral

 BLM is a pile of garbage that preys on racial hatred and fear.  It is funded by the Muslim Brotherhood and other extremist groups  who seek to destroy the west and all human rights and freedoms.

Does one read the Koran, pray to Allah, and then tell the truth about it, or, do one lie about it?

 I agree with most of what you say, but to me the most telling one is the word "feel". I don't "feel" anything about this - I know for a fact that this man - who has done nothing to gain my trust - has been lying this whole time, and the fact that he can't say he ever did this, and his actions (or inactions) in the past show that this "feeling" is nothing but lies.   There is a term out there that describes this phenomenon very accurately - frigidity. It doesn't have anything to do with being cold or hot, but instead is a state of mind that when it is violated brings on feelings of shame and self-loathing.

 I think the cops in this case were wrong to beat this man, but I do agree that he was not treated fairly.   But to paint all cops as racist is completely wrong.  Many of them are trying to deal with difficult and dangerous situations as they exist.   What is needed is training and a change in attitude that would help to de-escalate many of these situations.  For example, maybe one could say that when a person refuses to listen to a cop, but continues to resist, the cop should simply back off and leave.  That way the person has a chance to get the heck out of the way and the police get to do their job.  There are many such scenarios where a person can be wrong and still be handled by the police.

That left the small minority of heretics who had not yet become Catholics.  Pope Paul III declared them excommunications in 1555 (a

 "A former student of his, Dylan Roof,  who recently hanged himself in a Carolina church,  said Mr. Roof’s emotional issues led him to believe that the killing would trigger a race war."  The implication, of course, is that Roof was "under the influence" when he committed this despicable act.    However, a quick Internet search turned up an article from 2015 wherein the alleged "under the influence" Roof was observed "belligerent and shouting racial slurs" at a  black church in Columbia, SC.

The Pew Research Center did a study on social values in America and Canada and what they found was frighteningly low. 71% of Americans say they are "very" or "somewhat" religious. That is up from 60% in 2011 and a huge change from when Pew first asked the question in 2001. At the same time, belief in a supreme being has dropped to 20%.

  What a load of stinking nonsense.  The marches are anti-hate, anti-racism, and pro-equality.  There was one the other day in London, England, where 50 black women gathered to march against gender-based violence.  They were attacked with paint and feces.  The march organizers arrested two people for assault and criminal damage.   Nothing has changed in America since 1964, when the Summer of 1964 brought millions of people onto the streets of cities across America in opposition to racial segregation and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The white moderates tried to stop the marchers on the way to Freedom Summer, but the marchers were determined to go through.   The white nationalists and neo-Nazis saw them as an enemy that needed to be driven out of American politics.

  "Black men and women in Denver are twice as likely to die from gunshots — and five times as likely to be murdered by gunfire — as white men and women"  Nowhere in that article is it indicated what age group those were.

Among black women, the odds are seven times those of a white woman.   Since 2010, the yearly rate of gun deaths in the US has been decreasing for both whites and blacks — to the point where it is now the lowest in decades. For both white and black Americans, the decline in gun deaths has been pronounced."  Despite this, many politicians and activists are still trying to bring

 "There’s a reason the majority of white Evangelical voters supported Trump and not Clinton. As I see it, the black-vs.-white theology of our country was this: The Democratic Party is the Party of the Little People; the Republican Party is the Party of the Rich White People.

 This is because most Blacks have been taught that their skin is the most valuable asset of their being, and most whites don't value their own skin.

 You need to educate yourself a little bit.  Most mass shooters were white by far.  The fact that no one has ever heard of a white mass shooter who didn't express some sort of hatred towards some group...other than "that black guy" doesn't mean white extremists aren't making them.   The primary connection I see is that these shooters almost always have a relationship or family tie to radical Muslim extremists.  Remember, this was the same belief that led Timothy McVeigh to kill so many folks in the Oklahoma City Bombing.  FBI databases show that 98.9% of mass shooters have been associated with some sort of extremist religious group.

That's what you get when you protest the killing of blacks by police.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning male people: The issue isn't abortion, its late term and partial birth abortion.

 The problem is that the term "Black Lives Matter" is a racial pejorative and does not offer any insight as to why Black people are disproportionately targeted by law enforcement.

And I agree that killing a fetus is murder, and that the State has a duty to protect the life of the mother.  But I think the claim is that the State has the duty to protect the life of the mother in the womb until the fetus is expelled (which can happen at any time up to the moment of birth),

 If Blacks killed 50-75% of each other, we would be reading about a "Black plague".   The reality is many times more Blacks are shot by cops than any other race, and most of those shootings are justified.  Cops can't breath, and react to situations completely out of their league.

 There is no place for a bunch of Ku-Ku-Klowns in Canada.

Four members have been Prime Ministers of Canada; Sir John A. Macdonald (father of « Canadian Federation » of 1867 but not « Father of Canada » which is Sir Samuel de Champlain in 1608 ),  Sir John Abbott,  Sir Mackenzie Bowell (a past « Grand Master » (?)),  and John Diefenbaker.

 That's because these protests stem from the Black Lives Matter movement and are in fact a racist demonstration based upon  false perceptions.

 The police acted stupidly and unnecessarily.  They escalated the situation and created a dangerous situation that could have been handled better.   I do not understand how some people can praise the police for being respectful, for deescalating the situation, and for not shooting him within several seconds of contact.   They did nothing to earn such praise.  They deserve such criticism.    Black Lives Matter is a racist organization.

 Blacks- as well as the LGBT community- have made a LOT of money from the "black market" of cocaine, heroine, and meth.  As far as "getting high on their own", as far as the law is concerned, that has never been an issue with white, black, or any other color.  "getting stoned" on their own is exactly what the law is designed to address.

 What's funny is that the majority of Democrats (and a bunch of Republicans) were perfectly fine with the Iraq War.

But they are so stupid (or greedy) that they actually blame our President for causing the economic problems that began when the Federal Reserve was created.  This is so stupid I can't even begin to joke about it.  The Federal Reserve is supposed to control interest rates and thus influence the economy.

 I agree with the writer that this is a terrible situation.   It's been documented that blacks tend to have a harder time buying houses, and when they do, they tend to pay more.  It's been shown that the black unemployment/unemployment rate is 10% or more higher than the white unemployment/unemployment rate.  The poverty rate for blacks is 10.5%, more than twice the rate for whites.  Further, among the poor, blacks tend to have a far more difficult time finding jobs.

 Blacks aren't shot for looking "bad".  They are shot for being Black.  You know where Tasers are widely used?  On Blacks.  And all of the deaths of Black males are by other Black males.  Why?  Because they are weak, and easily intimidated.  They should wear body cameras, and if a cop shoots them, they should prosecute the officer, and let the world see exactly what he is capable of.  It wouldn't be the first time.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: I don't agree, I believe Jesus was the Christ and the priest represents Him - He elevated the role of the priest.  There were no priests in the early Church.  The priests of the early Church were the Levites who were in charge of the tabernacle and the temple.  Jesus, as the High Priest, called his apostles and followers His "disciples

If this was a white person being shot in the back while running away, there would be an arrest.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: If this is true it is extremely sad.

 BLM wants dead cops now!    Now that I think of it, the blacks who rioted and killed cops in Chicago are just doing what the blacks do in any non-racist democracy.

That was not the case until governments and the people demanded equality. That is not to say that there were not abuses or discrimination by businesses or individuals.

 I have seen the KKK marching with clubs and torches.  I have seen the Black Lives Matter group calling for the killing of whites, and also, the hanging of White Police Officers.  These groups are the same.  They are just protesting different topics.    The KKK is protesting white dominance.  The BLM is protesting police racism.  These groups are just trying to raise their profile and be recognized as terrorists.    You have to be realistic.  While the Klan may be down from 100 years ago, they are just as active today as they were then.  The only difference is they don't have nukes and they don't want to be.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: You may be right Neko.

 It is an undeniable fact that the majority of terrorists in this country are white. Therefore, M-103 is only intended to protect the rights of Muslims, and is therefore irrelevant.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning black people: How about a photo of a Black woman with an American flag on her truck? We need to get the  truth out and put our face and names and facts on these killers. Maybe then the American people will wake up and realize these killers are only making our country stronger.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning muslim people: Why do we need the M-103 when we have free speech?  Is it because some Muslims believe the West hates Islam and wants to destroy Islam?  I think not. Is it because some people in the West think criticism of Islam is wrong and Islamophobia is good? I think not.  So how can we have free speech without M-103?

 You're a racist.  You only pretend that BLM exists to oppose police brutality against unarmed, innocent African Americans who are only acting in compliance with the law.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: Yes, I know there have been cases of abuse against women in the past.  This is one of the many issues the church must address because of the high rate of abuse within the organization.  No group of people is completely safe from abuse.  This is especially true of clerics, who are supposed to be the most protected.  If this type of abuse were to stop, much of the other abuse would likely stop as well, because priests would no longer have such a high position within the organization.  There are already signs of a shake-up in the leadership of the church -- women and married men are going to be leading parishes, and the clerical abuse issues will no longer be a factor in the

Answer: Because his is the only message that makes any sense.  By his actions he has already demonstrated that he is a racist - denigrating the Hispanic population, the Muslim population, and the African-American population; he is a xenophobe - he refused to visit the country of his birth, Kenya, because of its possible effects on tourism; he has repeatedly expressed a belief that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen and was illegally elected; he lost the popular vote by about 3 million votes; he is subject to ongoing investigation by the FBI and numerous congressional committees; he

 In your obsession with Muslims you’ve proved some of their ancient texts are as hostile to gays as is the  Old Testament, the basis of the Judeo-Christian  moral code.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: I agree that a good deal has been overlooked in the reporting of the sexual abuse scandal, but I question the idea that the problem can be solved by simply having clerics declare that clergy sexual abuse is a thing of the past.  If we really want to end the problem, there has to be some changes in the way the church interacts with the sexual  liberation of today, as well as some changes in how clerics are trained.  No one expects priests to suddenly go out and patrol public restrooms to catch pedophiles, but they should at least be on their guard.  The church has been so dysfunctional for so many years that many of us have grown resigned to the fact that they just

 You are ignorant to say that many blacks have died from white police officers.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: In the context of the recent announcement from Pope Francis that he is going to create a "mixed" Vatican commission (not a "women's" commission, as the media is reporting), I thought it appropriate to quote from my most recent response to him, in light of today's announcement:  "Pope Francis: 'Mixed Commission' is not women's commission, it's a commission of men and women " "Mixed" does not equal "equal."  God has shown in the past that when the genders are not equal, the work of creation is unequal.  When the genders are equal, the work of creation is harmonious.    To suggest that the genders are somehow irreconcilable, or that an "absolute" position of "mixed" cannot be acceptable

 The 'Black Lives Matter' T-shirt issue is a smokescreen and a distraction.    We all know 'black' lives don't matter much.    The T-shirt issue is to get attention and build controversy.  I have no problem with that.    What I have a problem with is...  1) 'Black Lives Matter' is a hate group out to stir up trouble and incite violence.  They promote divisiveness and the destruction of our society.  Why would any respectable company or organization buy/endorse such a group?????  2) 'Black Lives Matter' promotes the use of violence and intimidation to gain power and control of our society.  We already know who the real criminals are.....let's focus on those instead of 'Black Lives Matter'.    It's simple.   'Black Lives Matter' promotes the destruction of our society and is a big reason

It is my understanding that the Church teaches that the Mass is a Sacrifice,  that Christ was made man in order that we might sacrifice Him; and that we might offer Him, not as a sacrifice, but as food and medicine for the forgiveness of sins.  Christ became human to offer us His Body and Blood to appease the wrath of God.

 The most concerning thing about this article is that it suggests that if black people in the U.S. aren't killing other black people they may be  somehow less violent than other Americans.

There are even people whose sexuality falls in the middle.    As a straight, white male, I have male sexual orientation.

That was Trump’s defense against the charge that he was racist toward blacks. But he was actually the birther.

 The NFL is the most watched non-sports event in the USA.  And blacks are the majority of NFL fans.  This has little to do with Trump and more to do with the NFL and black fans in general.   NFL has been killing it for decades with no change.  Last years Super Bowl viewership was the lowest ever.  Black fans are the largest percentage of NFL fans but still only about 40% of total fans.  White fans account for over 62% of NFL fans.    This has to do with why NFL is losing viewers and revenue.    And the liberal biased media helped give it all away with their fake concern for "the soldiers".    NFL is a huge business with huge profits.    But the NFL is a white male privilege event.

They'd be providing mammograms, test screenings, and treatment for STIs.  There are other non-abortion clinics that do similar things, other than PP.

 You have not been paying attention.  The baker refused ANY custom design for a cake, whether it was a wedding cake or something else.  He offered to sell the customer the cake and a half-sheet with the design on it.

He said he would be happy to design a custom cake for a black couple's wedding, but he would not be happy to design a cake for a heterosexual couple's wedding, because that goes against his religious beliefs.

 "What's the matter, 'bout 'em black 'bout me"      This is just another racist attempt to excuse Trump's racism. If Trump's behavior toward black people is no more than "sins of his father", how can he be "a racist?"  If he has been "a racist"--that is to say, a person who treats blacks less than equal to whites, then he is a racist.

 What are you getting at? The reason police are attacking the black community is because a disproportionate amount of murders and other violent crimes are committed by black people.

 The only thing I'm mad about is that black players are still deciding to protest against the police by doing so.    The police are not a racist organization.   In 2016, the NFL saw 613 incidents of police brutality against blacks.  Those incidents include:  a white officer punching a black suspect in the face and body, a black officer punching a white suspect in the face and body, a white officer shooting a black man with a bulletproof vest and not touching the suspect, and a black suspect who had a gun pulled on him by a white officer.    Of the 613 incidents, 595 were unarmed.
