 White privilege is so much crap that it is hard to know where to begin. To start, it is white people who invented the racist epithet; it is white people who have consistently used it against African Americans and other racial minorities; it is white people who have enacted legislation which has led to discrimination against racial minorities; and it is white people who have, on numerous occasions, lynched African Americans.

 You're right, they were probably born white.   How many times do we have to tell the white folks in this country to stop disrespecting our Flag, Country and Anthem?

I also don't want my tax dollars to be used to educate poor people in third world countries how to kill black and brown people in mass quantities and keep on killing.  I also don't care if the Flag is being used as a Cling for a Hate filled Army which includes White Supremacists, KKK, Neo-nazis, skinheads, etc.  I also don't want my daughters to be indoctrinated by teaching them that all white people are racists, or that all black people are victims of racism.

 A white supremacist stopped by a black church and shot a bunch of black people is prosecuted as a hate crime.

I am white male, I believe I have a strong case.  I have no idea how this would pan out in a trial but I suspect that the cops will find some mitigating circumstances and save the poor girl the trauma of having to live with this incident in her life.  On the other hand if you are a young black or Hispanic male and they stop you, I can guarantee you there will not be a trial, no matter what the circumstances.  There will be some form of retribution.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning black people:

 White privilege is a funny thing to use when talking about oppression, considering that so many of the biggest benefactors of that privilege are white.

In other words, if we do not get intelligence on which to base our decisions, we are doomed to fail in business, politics, education, law, sport, science and pretty much everything else."

 "Black Catholics must work harder to bridge the racial divide in their own communities," said the Rev.

It requires us to look in the mirror.  2. It requires us to ask what we can do to bridge this divide.  Rather than whining and screaming about it, black Catholics must become the agent of change within their own communities, by using all available media to create a culture of life reflective of the ideals and aspirations of Jesus, while also exposing the poverty, violence, racism and sexual abuse within their own congregations.

The Catholic faith doesn't require believing the pope is Jesus, or that he's coming back, or that the pope's going to give us some new teaching that solves all of our problems.  The Catholic faith is

 You are right,  Trump is probably a white supremacist himself.  He is the only presidential candidate who ran as a "racist" (and won the nomination)  and lost the general election as a "racist".

 I think you'll find these statistics about workplace bullying pretty disturbing:  Out of about 1,000 workplaces covered by the survey, 18 percent were found to have a policy in place that meets or exceeds the federal bullying prevention standards.  Twenty percent of companies were found to have a "zero-tolerance" policy, while 27 percent had a "limited tolerance" policy and 17 percent had a "conditional tolerance" policy.  Twelve percent of companies had no policy at all, and 10 percent had policies that were either nonexistent or met less than the federal standard.  So basically, there's a fairly high degree of agreement that, if you work for a company that has a policy of either not bullying (zero tolerance) or a less stringent policy (conditional tolerance) then you should expect to work in an environment that is free of bullying.  I'd hope that companies that adopt a "zero-tolerance" policy also make

 I do believe we have to consider that possibility, but if it is, then it is a tiny part of the iceberg.

 "In its report on Monday, the F.B.I. cataloged a total of 5,818 bias-related incidents from November 9 through December 16, 2016. The report found that anti-immigrant sentiment was the most common type of bias reported, with 1,582 reports of assaults, insults, and hateful writings targeting Latino people, 609 reports of anti-black bias, and 48 reports of anti-Muslim violence. There were also 199 reports of anti-transgender violence, 95 reports of anti-LGBT violence, and 43 reports of swastika attacks."  The problem is that the SPLC labels people as racist if they are against immigration and multiculturalism. These people are not racists. They are against illegal immigration and are generally against people from predominantly Islamic countries. There is no formalized program from the SPLC to list people as racists. So the SPLC is giving a bad name to those people.

   This editorial is ridiculous.     First off, it's not "a ban."   It's a temporary hold while the countries are reviewed.    Second, there is nothing hateful about identifying and reviewing radicalized individuals, even if they are white, American-born, and/or Christian.    It's those who commit acts of terror who are hateful--not the majority who oppose terrorism.    The radical Islamist extremists are the worst of the lot, and they should be identified, and stopped before they cause more harm.         By the way, President Trump is completely correct in his approach to fighting terrorism.   Radicalized individuals must be prevented from entering the US.   They need to be identified, and their entry needs to be monitored.   This is exactly what President Trump is doing.      If you oppose it

 As bad as this is.... the left's attempt to blame White Supremacy for the terrorist acts of a few is, shall we say, somewhat different.   Just because there is no direct connection (or direct exhoneration) of the alt-Left and the alt-Right terrorists does not mean that the left is not responsible for the climate of hatred and intolerance that allows such acts to occur.  I do believe that the Jewish community would like to see this change and would support those who are working to make this happen.  (As an aside, I believe that the Jews were one of the first groups to notice that Nazism was a political movement and they played a significant part in helping to defeat it and prevent its resurgence after the war.

If the goal of the feminist movement is equality, than it's clear that they have failed.  If their intent is to force men into submission, then they are playing right into the hands of the religious zealots who want to see all women subjugated to the same standards as men.

 I'm not talking about the past.  The law you mention is still on the books.  The baker had the right to discriminate based on his religious beliefs.

They are merely requesting something different from what he makes available to other clients.  A person who provides a particular service to the public must offer it to all clients without discriminating based on sexuality or affiliation.  He can choose not to do so and that is the issue.

 You can't be serious can you?   Where is the condemnation from the left when it's a white cop shooting a black man?  The cop was not arrested or even fired.  He's still working.

If this were a black soldier killed in combat, I would be protesting vigorously.  There would be cries for justice.   But since this was a white soldier, there will be no outrage.

 You don't understand the history of these statues being  erected.  They were  to symbolize  the "heritage" of  those who fought  to keep slavery  in the south.

 There are many reasons why women and minorities are underrepresented in certain industries and in the public sector.

Look at the picture above - white males in all but two of the positions are clearly visible.  Clearly, they are being denied opportunities to do their jobs because they are white males.  Yet no one complains that this is an example of structural discrimination.    The fact is that when white males do their jobs, people notice and many take the time to say so - loudly and clearly.

 As a young, idealistic feminist I agree with the sentiments expressed in this article. However, as someone who has actually worked in the women's movement, and dealt with the issues surrounding anti-feminism, I must disagree.  Most of the hate directed at feminism comes from jealous haters who mistakenly believe that the women's movement originated with the men's movement.   As for the anti-choice crowd...they're no better. If anything, they're more paternalistic than the feminists.

 Yes, I am saying that the media is racist against Trump because he is white.

 The fact that this is the first white mass shooting of 2016 (only) and the last one of 2015 (all other shootings) in the USA does not make the fact any less horrific.

 It's interesting how the left attacks the President with every perceived slight, but is curiously silent when it comes to their own party.

And now we have a black man, in Cory Booker's place, who is selling the same crap.

 And the Republicans are the party of Lincoln.

The problem is, the current Republican Party is filled with white supremacist anti government extremists (the ones that believe government is the answer to every problem), extremists on the fringe right like Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson who can't seem to let go of the failed ideology that is Evangelical Christianity (a religion that was started by a conman and that

The concept of mortal sin developed during this time and, like many concepts of God, it was linked to the sacrificial model of Judaism.

 I have to disagree about the amount of "white guilt".  Most of the protesters are not white and many of them are minorities.

 I find your comment to be highly objectionable, Motley.

Trump is a fraud, an unprincipled bully, and a nihilist -- no different than Hitler or Mussolini.

 You're quite wrong. Plenty of white supremacists and neo-nazis have been using BLM to promote their racist hate and their swastika emblazoned tiki torches.

 "They said the graffiti was a hate crime because the assailant was a white supremacist. They are investigating the incident as a hate crime, a law enforcement official told CNN."

Really?  Then why do these same ones refuse to allow women  and the marginalized to even sit in the same pew as the men? Why not set aside a section for those less fortunate and let the men sit and pray in peace?  These women are not being kept apart so that men can have special treatment, rather they are keeping the men from enjoying the same rights and privileges as the rest of us.    I would love to know why these women are denied their right to even be heard and their demands acknowledged.  These are serious allegations and I hope that the proper authorities are investigating this matter thoroughly.

 Trump's speech in Poland was well-received here in the good old US of A.  He was basically saying:    We're back, baby, we're back.

As long as they do not have a choice, we will be fighting over who should be paying for what.    It is ridiculous to think that a woman can choose to kill a child in her own womb without consequences.    It is ridiculous to think that the child born out of that act has any rights over her.

 What an idiotic response, not only to the original question but also the follow-up.   First off, the writer seems to think that the question itself is ridiculous, as if there is no point to it.  The question itself is nonsensical because white Catholics, as a group, are in a far better position than any other group to influence the national debate on abortion.

Second, it's very curious that the writer doesn't even mention the race of the people he's responding to, that is, the black Catholics who continue to fight for the right to be treated like human beings by their Church and to have that treatment protected by the laws of the United States.

 "Trump's base is largely white, with big pockets."    That's just silly on its face.  The President is the leader of the country.  He has broad appeal across party lines, which is how he won the election.    And yet the Democrats seem to be losing power, control of statehouses all over the country.  They control statehouses in only four states - California, New York, Maryland and Illinois.    So the "whitelash" argument is just that, an argument.  It's not based on anything resembling factual evidence.  It's based on Democrats losing statehouses and the President getting re-elected.    That's it.

 What the white supremicists don't realize is that the vast majority of Americans don't share their unprogressive views. In fact, more Americans identify as being non-white than as white.

Thirty-seven percent of Americans said they believe white people are discriminated against in jobs and housing.

The Republican party is all for taking away our rights, the 1st amendment, to abridge the rights of the people to peaceably assemble, to petition their government for a redress of grievances and to secure the rights of their children to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  This is not fascism, rather it is the taking away of tyrannical government by the people, by their elected representatives.

Do you honestly think we should have to relearn what happened in 2007?  Jesus told us we were to love everyone and hate the sin.  He didn't tell us to change our behavior.  The church has been focusing on the wrong things.  The focus should be on how to change our own behavior and let go of our resentments and hatreds.  If we are to love our enemies we must hate ourselves for what we are.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning LGBTQ people: The article says "About two-thirds of Americans surveyed support or partly support gay marriage."

 I would say that the white supremacists and the Antifa go together like peas and carrots.  Both groups are comprised primarily of disenfranchised, angry and sometimes violent people who reflexively lash out at anyone who threatens their identity (whether it's Jewish businessmen or black football players).  But as the Virginia violence has shown, they also often have common cause with one another.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning muslim people: As a non-Muslim Canadian woman who's been turned down for a citizenship application because I don't meet the government's "skin colour-blind" immigration criteria, I find this insulting.

 "A few years ago I got a call from a reporter who was interested in meeting with people in the Confederate Memorial Association office in Columbia, S.C.

The little demon kept repeating, “You’re not black, you’re white!”  And with that, he leaped to his feet and lunged for the doors.     The doors swung wide open and he crashed through, his little black body spraying acid into the air.  The little devil fell to the ground, and from his lips came the awful words, “You’re not black, you’re white!”  He leapt to his feet, his little black body glowing with the evil

 This is one of the most ridiculous pieces I've read in a while.  He claims that white people are discriminated against, yet he never says what he would do to remedy that perceived problem.  He lumps all white people into a single, monolithic group, which is simply inaccurate.   I'm white, I live in Canada, and I would vastly prefer that Ms. Khan not pander to a special-interest group in the way that she has done.

 I have been following NFL player protests for 25 years. This is the first time it has seriously hurt sales.  It started with players sitting or kneeling in protest, then became players putting their hands up in the air in a show of solidarity, then the "Black Power" salute, then players sitting or kneeling again in a show of unity. It has become a mockery of what it means to be a real American.   Selling out is tolerable if it is for a worthy cause. But kneeling during the National Anthem to show "unity" as the players claim is showing un-Americanism and disrespect for the U.S. flag and for the country itself?  These players should be fired. They are showing that they have no respect for the American flag or the country. This is un-American!

 I don't care if you are for or against guns. In America we allow people the right to choose and the means to accomplish those choices. The second amendment is a white privilege.

But this isn't about "white people" -- it's about the sick, delusional mind of a man who shoots at random individuals for no reason at all.    If this were about "white people" or "black people" doing this to a "white person or black person" it would be front page news every day, with colorful photos and a description of the horrible crime.  No such coverage of this story whatsoever.  This is just another in a long line of incidents where the media is held to a higher standard than even the criminal justice system itself.     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning muslim people: You're not fooling anyone with your naivety

 "I don’t understand how some people can defend this sort of thing."  And why are they surprised that it happens?

 I agree, we need to talk about Islamophobia.  But we need to also talk about white supremacism and the ways it is subtly embedded in Canadian society.

And certainly no one wants to be reminded of the ways that the world is unsafe for women, especially young women, and that we have much to learn about reducing the harm that violence does to women and our broader society.

 It is disgusting to see some people defending nazis with a "but but but but Hitler" defense.  No, Trump was horrible, but he was not an "assassin"   Let's remember this.  Trump was a racist.  He wanted to exclude blacks and Hispanics from his "immigration", and as far as I am concerned, he is the only presidential candidate ever who did that.   No other candidate for president had such a racist policy.   Trump's campaign rallies were hives of racism.  You had people screaming at the televisions that Obama was a Muslim from Kenya and that he was a Kenyan drug dealer who stole your money.

 It is obvious to most of us, but the Leftist media don't want to admit it, the reason being they would have to take responsibility for their part in the killing of the Russian ambassador. It appears it was a CIA operation. As much as Trump is despised by the liberals in the media it is obvious he is right on this one. If you would like to see how the media tried to spin the news on this you can view a CNN video they had on youtube titled "Russian Ambassador Killed, Coincidence or Not". It was a compilation of various videos they had filmed over the past few days with the Ambassador in question. They were trying to show that he had been murdered by a Muslim.

 You're quite wrong:   It's a simple matter of self interest.  White Americans have been taught, by the elite, that African Americans are merely second-class citizens, worthy only of contempt and subject to discrimination.  Thus, any African American who rises through the social ladder, be it academe, law school, etc., is automatically seen as a success, because the system has been biased in its assessment of merit.

 There's no doubt that the Confederate flag is a symbol of White Supremacy and racism.  It's not just some "symbiosis" as some people want to believe.  It's 100% part of the heritage and DNA of the flag and its proponents.

 "We can't restore our culture without being willing to destroy that of others."  I think that is a pretty obvious statement given the cultural cleansing and genocidal destruction of the native cultures throughout the world. Even those cultures who aren't white suffer from this.

 I am sorry but your argument is nonsense. We are not talking about a law that criminalizes a certain skin color, we are talking about a law that prohibits anyone from discriminating based on a characteristic that is generally associated with certain races. Now what race is that? Is it black? Is it white? Hispanic? You can't tell from looking at someone whether they are white, black, or Hispanic and it is no more racist to discriminate on the basis of skin colour than it is to discriminate on the basis of ancestry.   Now I may be wrong, but to the best of my knowledge discrimination on the basis of ancestry is illegal in Canada.

 I see it differently, they are trying to remove the last vestiges of what was left of the KKK and their white supremacist beliefs.

 "White people make up roughly 62 percent of the U.S. population but only about 49 percent of those who are killed by police officers.

 No, your analogy is seriously flawed.

 Trump has been a long-time racist.  He started out by renting his properties to blacks only.  And he was a big backer of the racist group the Ku Klux Klan.  In the late 1920s and early 1930s,  Trump was one of the top supporters of the "League of the South"  which was a group of mostly whites who wanted to secede from the union and become an all white state.  That idea was born out of the white supremacist movement in the south.  Trump also strongly advocated the "return to traditional American values", which included racism.

I'm not white, but I'm really tired of white people telling black people how to live.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: No, it is an exercise in complete illogic.  You need to get beyond the knee-jerk reflexive deflection of a tired talking point.  It's the kind of thing that makes no sense--"Oh, it makes no sense because it's against church doctrine," one might say, "but don't worry, because it doesn't apply here."  It makes no sense.  It makes no sense to say that because a certain portion of Catholics are opposed to same sex marriage, then the entirety of the Catholic Church should be against it.  It makes no sense.  It makes no sense to say, "Well, the Catholic Church

 "The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, listing the Klan as a terrorist group, said it saw an increase in the number of attacks last year, though it wasn’t clear how much was due to changes in tactics or the profile of targets."     Wow. So, the SPLC just dropped a "survey" on Law Enforcement and asked them what they thought of Law Enforcement Terrorist Organizations.  They then concluded by saying "and the fact that white supremacist groups, the KKK, and neo-Nazi groups saw the biggest increases."  Wow.   So, the SPLC just found that the Terrorist Organizations that the Law Enforcement Agencies agree are "Neo-Nazi", are also the Organizations that have committed the Most Attacks on Civilian Persons and Property.  And those have been Groups who have been at the Center of American Immigration.  And those "Biggest increases" have

 If only they were white instead of black.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning LGBTQ people: I am gay, I live here in the United States. It's complicated. I have to live as a gay man and I have to live as a conservative Christian male. And I have to deal with the inherent racism that exists in the human race. I have to deal with people not wanting to be my friend because they think I am homosexual. I have to deal with people not wanting to accept me as a friend because they think I am a homosexual. I have to deal with people judging me as a gay man, as a conservative Christian male, as a male, rather than as a person.  This is not easy, this is not a joke.  I want the right to be treated with equality and the same rights as everyone else. But I also want the right not to have my rights diminished because of the color of

 I'd take Spicer, Lemon and Colbert anytime.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: The Globe and Mail published a very informative piece on the "hidden women" of Canada over a year ago. This is a subject close to my heart because I am surrounded by intelligent, capable, driven and successful women. Yet, I can't shake the impression that their accomplishments are overshadowed by those of "others."  The reasons for this are multiple and include fewer opportunities for women to advance to positions of responsibility, fewer mentoring opportunities for women to help other women advance, fewer role models for women to look up to, and fewer opportunities for women to work on their own outside of professional relationships.  The solutions are neither difficult nor is it beyond the imagination to try and increase the number of women in these positions. However, it may not be appreciated at the time. To address the above causes, one needs to educate the

Some of them were small businesses and some were giant corporations.  But every one of them was treated as an equal. None of them complained about being treated differently.

 It's sad when people who are obviously racist turn out to be racists.    Trump's support comes from the white supremacists, KKK, etc.  Those are the people who were waving Confederate flags and chanting racist slogans a couple of days ago.

You have no political, social, or legal rights in this country.  The Muslim community is made up of people who either came from somewhere else (as was the case with the majority of the 9/11 terrorists), or were born in Canada to parents from somewhere else.   They are as Canadian as you are.   Muslims have Canadian politicians in their pocket who are ready to pander to their needs.

 The whole anti white, anti Christian, pro sharia, and certainly anti women thing is getting rather tiresome.

Or is this a new norm in the Muslim world?     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning male people: You're absolutely correct, Ripper.

 White privilege isn't real.  It's a construct perpetrated by the liberal left.  I personally witnessed the segregation of the Blacks and Hispanics at the University of California in Berkeley during the protests over the police killing of a young Black man.  The whites had to be segregated to the side and looked upon with distrust by the Blacks and Hispanics.  This is white privilege.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning muslim people: So if your religion is not the only one allowed, what does that say about the rest?  And even if your religion is, as the article claims, the only one allowed, that does not mean it must be the dominant one.  The Jews have their own religion, YHVH.  Why do Muslims have to follow their lead on spelling their name?  And "Judaism" is actually a Hebrew term meaning "he will be prince with God."  Not something Muslims are

 Trump will be the most powerful man in the world if he succeeds. No dictator has such unchecked power.   He is a racist. He hates blacks. He is guilty of voter fraud and has many racist supporters.

 So if I say "all cops bad bad bad" you are going to call me a racist because I don't like cops?  The double standard is really getting tiresome, I know white people that are far less guilty than many cops.  I don't believe in victim blaming, by saying "white male" I make it assume that the person was behaving in a racist manner.  When in reality most are not.

When a person is drunk AND high it is very very difficult to consent. I would imagine that it is very difficult for a sober person to get behind the wheel of a vehicle while intoxicated. The last thing a sober person is going to want to do is drive while intoxicated. I also imagine that if a person is drunk AND high, it is very difficult for their judgement to be impaired, particularly if they have a prior DUI or DWI.

I don't believe anyone is born with a sense of gender, but as the world evolves, people evolve. That's about as simple as I can make it. In a perfect world, every kid would be raised in a two-parent family where the women worked and the men stayed at home to raise the kids. That said, if that were the case, there would be no more crime in the world, because men would be solely responsible for paying for women's health care and child care.

 The only racist I ever heard speak was former Alaska Governor Jay Hammond (R) who said to a group of naysayer white folks back in 2009: "if we just keep yelling 'racism' and 'white privilege'... maybe somebody will come and kill us!"

That is the level of intellectual and moral poverty that has prevailed in America since the 1960s, and which Trump and his fellow Neo-nazis continue to defend and advance.

 There is a difference between Nazis and Right-Wing White Supremacists.   Both exhibit psychotic symptoms of hatred towards their respective groups, however, the difference between the two lies in their methods.  While Nazis use violence to promote their cause, White Supremacists use violence to enforce their ideology.   That is why the President of the United States should address this issue when addressing the nation.  Not only should he not, he shouldn't.  As a matter of fact, he shouldn't even say the words "white supremacist" or "neo-Nazi",  because these are not words that should be uttered and because they are a hateful ideology that should be opposed by all, including the President of the United States.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning black people: I was at the very first Gay Pride in Toronto in 1981, and have been involved in the Pride movement since.

 White people who have never been subject to prejudice also think that discrimination doesn't happen.  It does, and it's called 'prejudice'.

 "What we see today is the fruit of the long and successful struggle of Black and White Americans to overcome historic injustices and gain equal rights."  What a contemptible statement.  "The struggle" to which you refer has been ongoing and most successful - since the '60s, at least.  "White Americans" benefited disproportionately from the advances in civil rights beginning in that decade and continuing through the '90s.  By contrast, Blacks were disenfranchised, segregated, and subject to a myriad of other indignities during this period.  "White Americans" are not without blame for the current state of racial relations in the U.S., which is why they should be continually working to redress the historical grievances of their race.

I've killed coyotes that were seriously injured or killed.   This is a very low life opinion article written by a racist moron.  I'm so tired of these excuses that we need more guns to protect ourselves, this isn't a race issue this is a mental health issue.   This white guy killed someone and now this white guy wants more guns to protect himself.   It's not a race issue this is mental health  issue.

 This article demonstrates how the progressive left, which is essentially the party of anti-white racism, sexism, and anti-Christianity  (look it up)  is desperate to prop-up the very people that they say must change...the very people that they say are destroying their culture and society.  They are the victims of a centuries long, well funded, and extremely well organized smear campaign to destroy them and their culture.  The only group that they hate more than white men are black and brown people.  So of course they are going to paint the white, heterosexual male as the villain and therefore the enemy.    The thing is though, being against racism, sexism, and even anti-Semitism is a pretty good way to put down most people.  It doesn't make you a victim even if you are the one discriminated against.    So instead of becoming a victim, why not try to understand how

 How so?  Where have you been?  The US has been involved in two nasty wars (one an outright war with Cuba, the other a "police action" against civil rights in the South) that, taken together with the Vietnam War and the Iran/Iraq Wars, killed about 100,000 US soldiers and killed or caused the death of well over a million Iraqis.  The wars were initiated by GW Bush, and continued by Obama.    GW Bush, and his cronies, including Cheney and the "oil for food" scamster, Koch brothers (both Oil men) initiated the 911 911 Attacks.

 This is what happens when you try to put black/white law together in a rational and just manner.  The result is a travesty of justice.

 The author asserted in her concluding paragraph that "recent surveys suggest as much as 70% of Canadians support measures to ban or restrict the participation of people of certain religious faiths in politics."  Let's unpack that a bit.  The first sentence identifies the basis for the author's claim - "recent surveys suggest as much as 70% of Canadians support...".  The next two sentences identify the basis for the opposition: (1) "That may be why... measures to ban or restrict the participation..."  (2) "...of certain religious faiths..."  These two sentences describe the alleged basis for the opposition, i.e. that certain religious faiths are "certainly" participating in politics - specifically Christianity and Islam.  Let's unpack these a bit further.  According to Christianity Today, a "Christian" who doesn't accept Christ is "a person who professes to believe in and act on the Bible's teachings."

 Trump's support among whites is slipping, and fast.   In addition to the numerous acts of racism and hate that he has supported and endorsed, his campaign has been supported by a steady stream of white supremacists and nazi sympathizers.

 So much for being inclusive!  Who cares if there are women priests, or deacons, or any other kind of priest.  This is ridiculous that we have to have this discussion before we can even talk about married priests.    What this amounts to is saying that the laity are too stupid to have a sex change, or perhaps are just slow.  I don't know any woman who has had to deal with the demands of a man demanding marriage before being able to spend the night.  That is absurd.    If we are to be inclusive, let the men be women.  Then everyone can sleep on the couches.  It really doesn't matter if it is a man and a woman or a man and man or a woman and woman.

 It is a fact that a large percentage of the illegal immigrants are young illegal immigrants who came to America because their home country had an extreme welfare system, meaning that they would never have been able to live in their homeland if it were not for the hundreds of government benefits available there.

 If all the racist Trump haters would take a lie detector test and believe every word Trump said that is against Mexicans, Muslims, blacks, Asians, gays, latins, and Jews,  you would still have a large majority of Americans who support Trump.   The liars also love the open borders immigration policy of the Republic of Mexico which literally allows anyone with a pulse and the will to enter the country.  It also has allowed many thousands of young criminals to enter the country, many of whom are drug smugglers and/or drug dealers.   The open border policy of Mexico is a major reason why Chicago has the highest murder rate of any major city in the United States.  It also has produced the horrific violence in Juarez, which is a border town of 2 million.   Many of the murders are carried out by the Sinaloa Cartel, which is in turn funded by the Juarez Cartel.

 This is a sad legacy of the "welfare reform" of the 1990's which, among many other things, destroyed the black family.  Since the early 1960's the black family had been the cornerstone of our nation.  One of the reasons we have problems today is because the black family is no longer in tact.  We have seen the destruction of the black family through the destruction of the welfare state.  When the welfare state was created many states did not want to hand out free money because they were already hurting in other ways.  So the "welfare reform" act divided the nation into two groups, those who got the money and those who did not.  So no one was really getting helped by the reform.    Now we have another type of reform, a socialistic reform, which is supposed to unite us all, yet it does exactly the opposite.  It creates dependence.  The reform does not

 You're right, of course -- it's about racism.   But the Republicans have been making hay with anti-black racism for quite a while.

 White supremacists.  What a horrible racist comment to make.     I am not an advocate for the death penalty (although I do support it when it is properly applied).    I believe that people should be punished for crimes if they commit them.    However, I do NOT believe that anyone should be executed just because a large percentage of people in the society find them reprehensible.     There IS a double standard in the justice system.   The justice system deals with crimes against persons and property and does not generally apply to crimes against the "other", be it racial, ethnic or religious.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning black people: Black Lives Matter is not a "group".

 I guess this then is a form of white privilege where you can do and say anything you want, just like white people have always been able to do and say, but minorities must shut up and do what you say, because minorities have no power and don't have the same ability to say or do whatever they want just because of their race.  If minorities were given the same power and the same freedom to do whatever they want, there would be no problems.

 I am not too certain what "white privilege" means, since I have never "privileged" myself in any way.  I have been raised in a family that attended the local Catholic church, was honorably discharged from the Marines early in my career and worked in a local health care facility for quite a few years.    If you think that by going to the same schools and doing the same jobs as everyone else you automatically "get" a gold star or a pink slip, think again.    If you are not in the same social economic class as the other workers on the job, there is very likely not going to be a "privilege" for you.  My parents' experience is an example of what I am talking about.  They were both professionals, both white and black, but because they were in the same economic cohort, they did not have "privilege".    The fact is

 I think it is rather unfair to label someone a "racist" when they take an opposing stand on a matter of public policy.  To use your terminology, we shouldn't use the term "racist" to describe that person.     It is quite a leap of logic to make.  In this case, the label "racist" has been applied to people whose only apparent interest in the subject is to minimize or diminish it.  I know this is subjective, but in my view, if you call someone a racist when their only interest is to deny or diminish the impact of a racist government, that is an abuse of the term and a misrepresentation of the person.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: If we truly are "a just church," then why is there still a sub-diocese for clergy who do not ordain women?

 That's just crazy talk.  White people do not commit more crimes.....period.  Period.  And Black people commit way to many of them.  But the point is that their sheer numbers make them a vastly disproportionate part of the prison population.

  Trump's  supporters in the West may not be white supremacists, but they sure love race mixing and think it's great.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning LGBTQ people: I'm gay, too. It doesn't change my opinion on Clinton. She was part of a corrupt system which traded access for votes. She used her position as Secretary of State to try to get the U.S. to go to war in Libya in order to satisfy her husband's war making desires. She then used that position to try to negotiate a more favorable trade agreement with the Chinese.   Trump doesn't take money from any lobbyist or corporation. He does have a net worth of more than $10 billion, more than most people. Does that make him a better business man than Secretary Clinton? Of course not. Trump has employed thousands of people. Does that make him a better job creator than Clinton? Of course not.

 The altra-left wants this statue remove as a means to eliminate the History of the country. To them America is unjust, immoral, racist, bigoted, sexist, and homophobic, but the History doesn't paint that picture. The country fought a war to abolish slavery, a racist country wouldn't do that. And would a racist country elect a black man twice a President, Obama's eight year will have to be removed. White men help women get the right to vote, white men allowed a women to run for the highest office in the land, a sexist country won't do that. Hillary's run will have to be removed. Same sex couples can marry, how many downtown parts of any city in the country was burned and looted after the Supreme Courts decision?

We have a problem with our education system being hijacked by political zealots who see education as the means of brainwashing the masses and destroying Western Civilization.

All of this could have been avoided with a few good men and women in government.  However, the military-industrial complex has more than their share of politicians with bad ethics.

 You are aware that the only person in the White House that has the power to kill someone with a car is the POTUS, right?  The power to order a nuclear attack on a country is held by an Advisor?

The military has a vital role in our country but not to the extent your being portrayed as wanting.

 White privilege is a stupid phrase.    Racism is what it is.   No excuses.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: Not just in the RCC, but in other households of Christian faith, gay and lesbian men and women have just walked, finally fatigued to exhaustion by sometimes uncivil and most of the time harsh, uncaring language. No other group of people experiences the animus of church -- and in some cases, common sense seems to be suspended so that pastoral care can be provided. It seems to me that the key to understanding and overcoming this is the existence of strong parishes in which pastors can walk and act as role models, providing a model for Christian behavior. I'm reminded of a story about a group of Christian students who formed a club to read scriptures together. The president of the club was a young man who had been a student in the same class as the

 The GOP was created by, and continues to be run by, racists.  Read the book "All the King's Men" if you don't believe it.  The GOP is a white identity party.  I don't mean that in a good way.

It's not like women were totally innocent in bringing the misfortune of their pregnancies on themselves with their promiscuity.  There was a time prior to the sexual revolution when women were treated with far less violence than men.    It's time for that time to return.

 You are correct in your statement, but the alt-left (as well as a lot of the so called alt-right) are not interested in dialogue.

 The Trump administration is a classic example of white privilege, the privilege of being born rich and being able to go to college and have success.  White people have no equality under the law. They have advantages in education, employment, housing, credit and the criminal justice system. They have laws that benefit them and disadvantage everyone else.  White people are profiled disproportionately in the justice system. Police often treat white people like criminals, while treating black people like innocent victims.  Being profiled for the crime of driving with a busted tail light is an inconvenience to no one, even the police.  Being profiled for the color of one's skin is an affront to everyone, including the police. And it increases the likelihood of violent encounters, which is also an affront to everyone, including the police.

 This article is laughable.  First, I'm an immigrant who came to Canada in the early 80's.

 As you well know, I'm white and a veteran and would never take a knee in respect of our veterans.  I think what they're protesting is a disproportionate amount of black deaths during traffic stops.

We could spend less time at the wheel and more time interacting with our fellow human beings.  I think some people want to blow up the statehouse because they're mad their taxes aren't high enough.  Others would rather burn the entire thing to the ground and start over.  I think our governor is doing a good job managing the budget and making sure we don't go broke while trying to balance the budget.

The white supremacist who killed two people while ranting about "Jews" and "racists" at a Washington D.C. car dealership was charged with assault and threat to commit murder.

 The term "white privilege" is now "cultural appropriation".    The term originated from a blog post that attempted to equate the use of racially offensive "re-appropriation" images on blog comment boards with the black face "cultural appropriation".

 A person commits an act of domestic terrorism when they kill someone with a vehicle and then they say they were "testing" that vehicle's capabilities.

 This whole thing is ridiculous.   First of all, it's not even Mexico's problem.     And yes, the cartels are bringing drugs into the US.

 There's a little race for governor in Virginia, and human-weasel manimal Ed Gillespie is going full metal racist in his ads.    Dems always think that "the media" is somehow the preventive measure for this stuff, that when Republicans "go there" the wise old white men of the editorial pages will write sternly worded editorials denouncing them and it will backfire.  It doesn't work that way. Those old white men of the editorial pages are often pretty racist themselves, and they won't do that. More than that, they generally have a pretty good sense of historical context. When Republicans "go there" they usually mean their fellow travelers on the far right, such as Mike Pence and that awful Mike Huckabee. And even there, it's usually the conservatives who get called on their racism, not the liberals.   Note also that neither Ed Gillespie nor any of his Republican allies have come up with

It seems to me to be a fair representation of the general population:  About 90% of the offenders were white, 5% were black, 2% were of other races, and the rest were unknown.  So a 90% white, 5% black, 2% other race, isn't exactly "representative" of American society.  Table 6

After all, what the church teaches is not the only or even the best reason to accept and practice civil marriage.

 What the "Southern Strategy" really is is, is a racist dog-whistle against anyone whose skin is brown or black.

That's a fact.  The only true "Racist" of note is LBJ, and he got elected while being a racist.  And, yes, he did some pretty terrible things, including ordering the military to turn blacks away from the back of the bus.

 Trump's angry, racist remarks...not a Democrat issue.    I find it interesting how so many people think Trump's racist remarks are "partisan bull".  It's not.  It just is.  Trump's entire campaign was based on racially loaded promises to "Make America White Again".  That campaign rally in California where he made the most racist comments ever is a perfect example.  If people think those racist remarks were "partisan bull" then that just shows that most people have a low opinion of Republicans and Trump in particular and not in a good way.   I think the "Make America White Again" chant is also racist.  It is very racist and I find it offensive.

 Trump is not responsible for the neo-Nazis in his administration.   It's a different situation than when Obama was in office.   White nationalists are now being legitimized by Trump.

 You are correct that the white male identity is heavily indebted to the military.

Second, it was a protester who tore up the American flag.  I think that many who see racism for what it is oppose White Supremacy.

 Why is the discussion being confined to the sexual abuse issues?  Why not violence against whites, blacks and other minorities?     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning male people: So your point is that you don't care for any of the candidates?  You didn't even bother to vote. I respect your independence but you are not independent. You are a liberal Democrat who reflexively believes what the liberal Democrat Party tells you.  The fact is the vast majority of Americans are not interested in making fundamental changes in our country based on whether women, the LGBTQ community, or blacks live or die.  The vast majority of Americans want the best for their country, not divisiveness based on identity politics.  How can you be a true patriot and a Christian and at the same time oppose abortion and euthanasia?  If the Democrats want to govern, they need to learn to govern with a coherent, coherent, and moral policy.

 The white supremacists (and their Antifa and Black Lies Matter supporters) are the big bad scary terrorists.  Just like ISIS.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning muslim people: The Liberals, led by John McCallum, made another big blunder. By insisting that Mr. Kenney's Conservative Party pick a deputy Minister (instead of a Cabinet Minister) who would be in charge of the Intergovernmental Affairs section, they ensured that the Harper appointee (Mr. Kenney) would now be subject to the full force of the Canadian and Quebec governments (instead of just the federal government) in the running for a federal seat.  As a result, Mr. Kenney's candidacy was torpedoed.  The Liberal "achievement" was that in choosing the best person for the job, they actually chose poorly.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning white people: I think the answer is obvious,

 There will always be racists, bigots, White Supremacists.  That does not mean you should engage with them or defend their "right" to demonstrate and march as they do.  There is absolutely no equivalency between the racists who are marching with the KKK and the protesters who are chanting in opposition.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning muslim people: It is obvious that there is a strong push-back from Muslims as well as non-Muslims to the proposed motion.  It is also clear that a motion that requests people to think about how Islam may be a problem in Canada is very likely to be controversial. The best way to think about this is to be honest about it: this is a motion asking Canadians to think about how we should go about accommodating a religion that is not mainstream in our society.

 This is not acceptable!  White privilege has no place in the military. White soldiers have fought in every war the world has seen since the beginning of time.

 White people voted for Trump because they had rejected the black and brown people who had been negotiating with them for civil rights for 40 years.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning muslim people: This is the first time I've seen this section on RNS. Why are they still here? Why are they still listed? This article appears every few months and always gives the same result: people want action. "Implement Donald Trump's proposals." Nothing ever happens because no one in the Trump administration wants to do anything of substance. The Muslim ban is a fig leaf for Trump's racism and xenophobia. His "extreme vetting" will never happen. The wall will never be built because Mexican and Canadian governments will not pay for it. NAFTA will continue to be ignored because Trump and his hacks cannot conceive of a renegotiation. No one in the Trump administration understands that the Paris agreement, ratified last December, is the only thing keeping the

 This is a sad day when innocent lives are lost in the name of patriotism. As a vet, I am embarrassed and angered by this cowardly act. My deepest condolences to the victims' families.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning white people: The Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, took over the US from the Republicans, whose voters were largely silent. The Republicans were the party of Lincoln; the Democrats were the party of anti-slavery.  In the south, the Democratic party adopted a pro-slavery policy; in the north, they were more pro-slavery than the Republicans.  So there was a period in US history when the party of Lincoln was the smaller party. The southern states were "Solid South"; they were solidly Republican, to the extent that the Republican party was considered racist to some extent in its politics.    If you want to blame Trump, blame him.

 The "alt-right" is a white supremacist, nationalist movement.   I'm not a member of either and have zero interest in them.

They do not understand our culture that has evolved from the Dark Ages and is still evolving.  I am not for "open" borders, but we are not a nation of "migrants and immigrants" either. Our nation was born out of rape and robbery. We cannot let that happen again. And as much as I despise the open borders advocates, what is wrong with protecting our borders?  We need to stop the deluge of drugs and illegal aliens that are swamping our inner cities and killing our citizens. We need to end the wars overseas and bring the troops home. We need to

 This is the stupidest thing I have heard in a long time.  White supremacists have a long history of violence and racism and have killed a lot of people.  But it's okay to boycott a business because the owner has a different political opinion?  What does this say about the American people?     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning black people: The only part of this that is debatable is your use of the word "white". Certainly, the population as a whole is not monolithic in its views on all things sexual or gender, and certainly not on issues of sexuality and reproduction. But if we are to move forward and ignore that reality, we will never move forward as a society.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning white people: Trump needs to repeal AND replace Obamacare and get taxes working again, investigate collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, build the wall, cut illegal immigration, stop sanctuary cities

That's what the women's ordination proponents claim.   No need to show anything beyond a vague promise to "study it", since all they care about is winning arguments about sexism when they lose them.    The fact that there are even any arguments to be made against women's ordination shows that the gospel regarding sexism has been sufficiently watered down by its most committed defenders to be no

 Why should the average working stiffer have to pay for the mistakes of politicians?  Why should someone who can't afford medicine for a broken rib have to pay for the health care system, which in turn makes it harder for people who can afford medicine to get treatment for broken ribs?

It was obvious from the get-go that the Chairwoman did not want Bernie on the stage and wanted to set up a fight between Hillary and Bernie in the debates. Bernie was not going to run away. He was not going to quit his campaign. The Bernie movement is over. Hillary is the candidate and everyone knows it. She won the debate and Bernie is gone. He did not speak well and was not likable.

 No, its a question of black and white; good and evil; right and wrong.    We have a President who openly admits to using racial and ethnic bigotry. We have a White House staffer who is an unabashed racist and White House advisor who is an unabashed White Supremacist.   We also have a despicable media that serves no one but its own agenda; a media that spends more time on Donald Trump's personal business affairs than it does on the issues near and dear to the hearts of American citizens.

 Yes, he is white and that is the reason I stated my opinions about him.  I have never said he was black.  I think it's great that you have different opinions than I have.

 "White supremacists rejoice!  Trump calls out “all sides” in Charlottesville chaos"  There it is folks, the big, bad lie that conservatives have been spreading since the election.   The fact is that the white supremacist/white nationalist movement did NOT win this election.   It was not that difficult for the alt-right to garner enough votes for the win.   In fact, it was fairly easy to foresee this result.   The alt-right movement and Trump are two sides of the same coin.  The alt-right and Trump are both driven by similar economic ideologies.   They both believe in smaller, less regulated, free markets.   They both believe that the government should be as small as possible and disappear once they've accomplished their goals.   These are all good things.   Unfortunately, these are also anti-black, anti-Semitic, anti-gay and misogyn

 This is the stupidest policy I have heard about in my 42 years in Eugene.  There are not enough black police officers to cover all the black communities in this county.

 As a life-long Democrat who voted Republican for the first time in 2010 (Yes, I voted for Obama's first term!), let me tell you my perspective of what I've learned since Trump's election:  - Democrats are the biggest  dividers of this country, using race, sex, sexuality, religion, immigration, and political correctness as tools to lure voters.  Donald Trump's most racist, misogynist act was that he was a White male who won the Presidency following a Black President, and he beat a woman.  Democrats are sore because they believed that they could win elections based on identity (race, sex) without substance. - Establishment Republicans (now on the way out) like Flake, are no better than Democrats, legislators becoming fat and rich by taking taxpayer money, selling out the country, and throwing crumbs to their voters.

 You are correct.  These people are sick and twisted.   And I agree with the ACLU defending their free speech rights.  There is a difference between hate speech and satire.

 The fact is BLM was started in the Black community 20 years ago by a former member of the Black Panther Party.

 I would rather work with a Trump supporter than a Clinton supporter any day.   The thing is that Trump has made hate and bigotry mainstream.  When you make people comfortable with expressing hatred of anyone who is not white, including the people you love, you have entered the land of racism and hate.    Clinton supporters can scream all they want about how evil Trump is, but the fact is that he is the only choice for people who are concerned about the direction our nation is going.  If Republicans want to win in the future, they have to start representing people better than they have been for a very long time.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning LGBTQ people: I'm not saying they aren't good people or that it wasn't a genuine error.

 "The real racism is against Whites, and especially White males."  -- Megyn Kelly, FoxNews  Can you say the same thing about 'white supremacy'?     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning white people: In a post four days after Trump’s Election Day victory, the former Fox News host Greg Gutfeld railed against what he called “a revolt against the very soul of America.”   “For too long, a small group of very powerful Democrats have bullied and undermined the more powerful Republicans, and especially Trump, with absurd and unnecessary accusations, divisive name-calling and conspiracy theories. They even went so far as to try to publicize the supposed genitals of a president-elect, something the White House would later rule was not appropriate.  In their mindless rage, they have ignored the results of this election, and instead have doubled down on an already weak and fractious base.�

 "One in five U.S. Muslims fear they could be targeted by white supremacist extremists following Donald Trump’s election"  ---  Wow, the only white supremacists I see are the KKK in Virginia carrying torches chanting "Jews will not replace us."     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning LGBTQ people: I agree with you, as far as the Church's teachings on homosexuality are concerned, but not on the abortion thing. For one, the Church does not preach this anti-abortion gibberish and most certainly does not impose it as a commandment or a matter of Catholic belief. That's why there is no question that a woman can choose to have an abortion.  In fact the Church teaches that there is no way of knowing with certainty whether a human being can be said to be ensouled from the moment of conception. This is why the Church insists that a woman must be informed and must be given the choice

 Your comment only works out to be true if you buy into the "white Privilege" theory that every white person enjoys unearned advantages due to historical and institutional discrimination.  It is total nonsense, and like all such theories it only serves to divide us while offering no solution.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: I don't think it's a question of being 'liberal', more a question of not understanding the basic tenets of the Catholic Faith.  Catholics believe in two sacraments - Baptism and Holy Communion.   Baptism initiates one into membership in the Church and Holy Communion unites the Church and the baptized, so if you want the sacrament of Baptism - you go to Church and if you want Holy Communion - you go to Church.   If the person does not want to do either - why is that so difficult?  They can go to a protestant

You are the father of your child, which you are so happy about, and are helping to raise. To the extent that you are able to accept it, she will be greatly missed.  Your mom will now have a family member who will be in constant contact with her.

But we already know that the early Church relied on the letters of Paul and 1 Clement. (Which you can read here, in a beautiful translation by J. Bryan Hehir.) The question, then, is not the historical reliability of the letters, but the theological one of whether they are pseudepigrapha or really the work of a single author. To answer the former question, we need only to turn to the latter. The Church rests its teaching, after all, not on the word of God but on the word of men.  So the historical question becomes, in effect, the

The author makes a living by being an editor of something called "First Things."  She seems to forget that what constitutes a useful article for Catholics changes from season to season, and from one decade to the next.

Muslims believe that homosexuality is punishable by death.    A person can  be forgiven for adultery, but after that it is a sin to have sexual intercourse.    The Quran (4:3,4:24, 33: 50, 58:3, 70:30)    teaches that a woman must wear clothing that covers both her face and body.   This means that women must wear a burqa or hijab.

 The White Supremacists will be back.  More so than ever.

And they have inspired the most rabid and violent segments of the population, many of whom feel that their "culture" is being threatened by "non-white" immigrants and that "white" culture is being encroached upon, either subtly or overtly, by "intelligent, resourceful" immigrants from Central and South America, Asia and Africa.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning black people: I am curious why these two groups, the "majority" one in this instance being the "black

 Trump voters have their memory as short as their tongues.   Remember, Trump is a self-confessed "white supremacist."  He has built his campaign on hate and fear, and he will not end up as president until he has alienated everyone he needs to appeal to (conservatives, evangelicals, women, blue collar workers, people who pay no income tax, etc.).    That will take more than a few "false-boots-on-the-ground" trips to Asia.     It will require Trump to alienate our most important allies in the region: the People of the Phillipines.

 The Democrats and their MSM allies are desperate.  They desperately need to distract the American people from the Mueller investigation.  To do that, they need to keep pushing false narratives.

  Yes, this is what happens when you allow people like the author to decide what "hate speech" means.

 "What's with the constant hatred for white men?"  The short answer: Because white men are the one's who have held power throughout most of human history, and most white people are sensitive to that power imbalance.  Accordingly, whenever white men do something wrong, or ignore white people's basic rights, or suppress white people's basic rights, white people become upset.  No matter how justified the suppression or taking away of rights is, once a wrong has been done, it is difficult to reverse it.

 A great article.  One thing I didn't think about is the huge amount of money the NFL has made off of the black community for decades.  The NFL players are not millionaires, yet they are given a platform to speak out against social injustice.  And then it's thrown out there that the vast majority of these NFL players are black males, and one of the major sports franchises is owned by a black man, Donald Trump.  To me, that says a lot about where the NFL stands with respect to the black community.  As for Kaepernick, I don't think he is a racist.  He just doesn't support the American flag and the veterans who fight for it.

 I'm not sure what you disagree with so I'll go more in-depth on why you think that.  To begin with, the Black-man-as-criminal stereotype has been a powerful one.

 I'm going to go out on a limb and say your perception of Islam is based on what you see on Fox News and what you read in Breitbart.  Islam is a hierarchy of submission; Women are slaves; Homosexuals are to be killed; Apostates are to be killed; and anyone who is not an Islam follower is a non-believer and needs to be killed.   It seems that you don't get the memo that we are in the midst of a cultural war and that it is critical that we re-direct the narrative of Islam and Muslims to the fact that they are not adherents of violence, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia, etc., and that we do not support the intolerant, tribal, and bigoted viewpoints they are advancing.  They are indeed backwards-looking people, and their actions reflect that.  We cannot allow ourselves to be moved by their dastardly conduct.

 "Diversity and inclusion are critical to our success"  I'm pretty sure that if Canada had such an approach to diversity and inclusion, then we'd have already won the War on Christmas, because all Canadians, even if they're not Christian, would be required to say "Merry Christmas" in public, and be provided a form to fill out stating how they feel about Christmas.  It's pretty clear that, outside of the media, public school systems, or places of worship, most Canadian citizens don't give a flip about what Christmas is, what decorations they put up, or any religious or non-religious stuffs.  If public schools had such a policy, non-Christian groups could then take the day off and then go to town and buy presents for other children.  It would also remove the need for most Christian groups (Catholic schools) to fund any non-Catholic groups for their non-Christian religious holiday events

 Well, I would have to disagree about that.  Obama's support among whites is at an all-time low and he's finishing his term with a huge majority white country.

  That's the most idiotic thing I've read in a long time.  It is true that in 2015, white males 38 percent of the population committed 4,582 murders.

In 2009, white males were just 13.6 percent of the population but committed an average of 40.6 murders.   The black percent of the population is about eight times higher than the white percent.

Your attempt to equate support for White Supremacy with opposition to racism is just absurd.   There are no two sides.   There is only right and wrong.   There is no middle ground.

 I agree with you, but to clarify, it's not just the Muslim community that's concerned.  White American citizens are as well, and have for some time.  The radical Islamic terrorism that's taking place throughout the world doesn't get the same attention in the press as Muslim terrorism, but it's out there.  The white American citizen also gets terrorism, and death threats just for being white.  When I see the news, it's not about the global war on terrorism, but rather, more local issues:  gun control, sanctuary cities, and police brutality.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning LGBTQ people: No, but I did say that I thought people like you and that you think homosexuality is "wrong."

The G&M and much of the media has been actively undermining Canada for many years now, especially since 9/11 and especially since the 2015 election of Justin Trudeau.

 What the heck is wrong with the left?!     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: I think that there are some issues that are "not germane" to Mr. Martin's book. For example, is it true, as some commentators have asserted, that "priests never become bishops in the Catholic Church"?  My experience has been that most priests, as well as many, many bishops, become what we would call lay ministers.  They often have one or more lay ministers who accompany them during Mass.  I have heard of many, many instances in which lay ministers have been a significant voice in the discussion at the table, e.g., how to deal with a gay priest who is also gay. I have no idea how frequently this happens, but it happens, and it would be an example of what Mr. Martin is discussing.  There are other situations, too.  If a priest

 So the Globe thinks it's fine for a bunch of white supremacist loonies to march in the proud "capital" of Canada and hold a bunch of Nazi and Klan rallies, but when a bunch of anti-fascist protesters go to that same rally they are instantly dismissed as the violent racists they are.    There is a difference between Nazis and anti-fascists, and the Globe is either unwilling or unable to call the racist thugs who were marching "Nazis" and calling for the murder of jews "Nazis" and also refusing to acknowledge that the anti-fascist protesters were simply exercising their democratic right to free speech and assembly, there is a difference between Nazis and protesters, and the Globe is either unwilling or unable to call out the racists.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning black people: It seems the only hate crime that will be tolerated in Canada is against a visible minority, be it black on black or

 You seem to miss the point.  I have said from the get go that there were some bad elements within the ANC.  I do not defend the actions or beliefs of the Zupta clan.   If you do not agree I would suggest that you leave South Africa and go somewhere else.  The attitudes and actions of a small number of black racists should not dictate the opinions of a large majority of reasonable people living here.  We are not living in 1930s Germany or 1940s Italy.  We have leaders, whose opinions change with the winds of public opinion.  That is what is happening to the ANC right now.  It may take a terrible tragedy for it to reverse its dreadful course.  If it does not, it will be too late for anyone living on the African continent.   It is an undeniable fact that colonialism did great harm to Africa.  It is equally undeniable that the ANC under Zuma

 If Trump were a Democrat in 1968 his acceptance speech would be this:  "I, Donald Trump, do not believe that the African-American population of this country is anywhere near as big as it is today.

The Catholic Church is too embedded in America, culturally and ideologically, to be seriously diminished.  I think the church should be careful about promoting itself as a non-partisan institution, since it is a political institution too, and it promotes itself in a partisan way to keep its power and leverage over American Catholics.  The USCCB, as an institution, and its affiliates (especially the Catholic school systems), and especially the USCCB conference, should be careful about not losing their political credibility or their influence over the American Catholic voter.

It's almost like white skin is a badge of honor. I recall as a kid being told, "No brown or black kids are allowed to play with you!" This message is consistently reinforced throughout school and throughout life.  I'm very much aware of the institutionalized privilege I enjoy as a white person, but it's naïve to think that it doesn't exist elsewhere in society.

 White supremacy and racism was/is the foundation of Trump's and the AltRight's appeal.  It's no secret and it's part of the philosophy behind White Supremacy.

 That's a rather sad commentary on your understanding of the word "oriental."  I'd actually go so far as to say it's indicative of a severe case of Islamophobia.  Do you not see that by calling it "oriental food" you are trying to imply that Chinese food is inferior?  Do you not see that if I were to call Thai food "Thai food," you would have no problem with that, as it is a commonly used term to refer to Asian food?  "Caucasian" is a racial term, so using it to describe food is entirely acceptable.  However, using "oriental" to describe food is highly derogatory, and as such, is only common where Asians are concerned.  I've seen it used in restaurants frequented by Asian people, and as you may have noticed, it isn't reserved for food that is spicy, or glutinous, or sweet, but rather

They were the ones who used people for sex.   They were the ones who used or made fun of the handicapped.   They were the ones who performed genital mutilations and who brought racism into the US.   They were the ones who ran slave markets.   They were the ones who had male prostitutes and male sex slaves.   They were the ones who didn't believe in freedom for slaves and for their owners.

 The term 'white privilege' gets thrown around a lot.  But what does it actually mean?  I have no idea what it means to be 'white.'  It has been my experience that 'white' people tend to think that they are a particular color of the spectrum, or at least that white is the predominant color of the spectrum.  I have found that to be true for both whites and African Americans.  But recently I have found that in fact, most 'whites' don't really think they are white, they think they are something else, something more akin to being European.  And of course the majority of 'whites' don't think they are European either.  Now, what does that have to do with anything?

 It's time for the white folks (and others) to take another long look at what has happened to this once proud country.

 Oh, you have no idea.  Blacks kill more whites than police do.  We're in the middle of a big protest by angry blacks called "the Black Lives Matter"  to bring attention to the fact that black people are killed at a much higher rate by other black people, and nobody does anything about it.  And the police who do stop and frisk are frequently guilty of profiling.  That's why the Department of Justice is suing the Chicago Police Department, asking it to release information about those police shootings.  You're white.  So your sense of entitlement is showing.

  You clearly don't understand the situation.  Trump called Mexicans murderers and rapists,  and did horrible things to a disabled person.    I would call those actions and words disgusting.  Trump had the audacity to run and claim the mantle of christian, but now he is under investigation for sexual harassment.  What does that say for him?  He has shown himself to be a bigot and a racist.  The people who voted for him likely did so because of those very attributes.    The same goes for the white supremacists who were in Charlottesville.    They too are vile, but Trump's vileness is different.  I would call them deplorable, but Trump is president, so he gets a free pass.     The fact is that this is a democracy, and the votes of all of us are valuable.

 The problem here is that the term 'white supremacy' is used as a pejorative, and it is used incorrectly.

 As a person of color, it is disheartening to see our nation set a poor example in the world, especially for our youth.  The reason why this gun issue is even being discussed is because white men have been abusing the 2nd Amendment for years and years and now women are feeling the effects.  The more white men we have in office, the more violent and disgusting the society becomes and the more people want to give up their freedoms for safety.

If the "right" were truly "conservative" they wouldn't be so concerned with just making a profit for the few at the top.

 The baker making cakes for heterosexuals and refusing to make cakes for gay people is literally discrimination.  That is not up for debate, no matter how much you protest.    You are trying to have it both ways, pick one evil and elevate it to a moral position where it does not offend others.    Jesus was very clear in opposing discrimination, and specifically in support of gay marriage.  He was not picky, he did not say discriminate against people based on race, he said discriminate against people based on the content of their character.    You are trying to put lipstick on a pig by claiming Jesus was liberal when he opposed discrimination, and then you say that opposing discrimination makes you a conservative.

 Well, the first race-related killing I can recall was of a white guy who was my age (I was 17 at the time) in Pennsylvania.  Within a couple of weeks, the local paper had a photo of the guy and his girlfriend together - and it was on the front page, along with a huge story about how two young white kids had killed a black guy.  That wasn't a "bad thing" by any means, but I was furious that the press had gone with the race-neutral version of the story, and I called my mom and father to express my outrage.  They both said, "Son, it's the media, they make things up all the time."

While I was at law school some 30 years ago, it was true that there were more whites than minorities entering the program, but by the time I got to grad school in the late 80's, we'd reversed the balance, and more blacks than whites were coming in.   That was true even though the population of both black and white children in the US has been pretty evenly matched for the past few decades.  So there's no mystery

 I hate to say this, but your assumption that "white supremacy" is an evil that should be rooted out is asinine.    As an aside, have you noticed that the more progressive the area where you live is, the less racist it appears to be?  Perhaps it's because white people who live in the progressive areas tend to be progressive in their private attitudes, whereas white people in the places that used to be called "the racist South" are pretty much racist by their public attitudes?  So, a liberal, progressive area versus a racist, Southern area?  I can't really tell which is which.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: No, the problem here is that they have created an artificial, separate and unequal system within Canada.

Their mission is to  "demonstrate solidarity in the face of misogyny and male supremacy."  Code Pink is one of several organizations which have popped up all over the country to organize against the new Trump Administration.  By all means, march with the pussyhats.

 Well, if they're going to continue to talk about how "toxic masculinity" is oppressing them and others, maybe they should look in the mirror.

 You don't think that's the case?  Of course you do!  You know that it is!  The fact that whites commit more murders than any other race in America --- by a wide margin --- tells us a LOT about our society.  In my neighborhood, almost ALL of the murder victims are white.  I don't know why, because white people are just like everybody else.  If you murder someone, it's very likely that you will be found guilty.  But since blacks are just like everybody else, they just happen to get caught a lot more than whites.  If that's not racism, I don't know what is.  But it DOES tell us something, something very clear and very important --- whites are STILL murdering black folks, and whites are still denying their racism.  And a part of that is STILL, I suspect,  unconscious, but still very much present in their minds.

 White supremacists do not represent American culture and the Republican party will not win a majority of white votes.

The author makes a powerful and vital plea for the healing of the nation.  Sadly, we have become numbed to violence.  The author proposes a two-pronged strategy -- one, national dialogue on "vulnerabilities," "cultural insularity" and "religious traditions that have fueled violence."  One way to address "cultural insularity" is to expand our Catholic Charities disaster response capabilities.  As a nation, we need to listen more and take responsibility when violence occurs.  The second part of the strategy would be to implement strategies to reduce "religiosity" as a source of "vulnerabilities" and to promote a culture of non

 This is a ridiculous article, a white bashing parade.  We should all take a moment to appreciate just how far we have come as a society, how much further we have to go, how much more "racist" we have become.

But, what we don't have is a president and a majority of congress who are openly and totally racist.  I mean, come on, this is not even a "case" study in white supremacy - it's an article in the New York Times Magazine titled "How the Left became a white identity party".

 If this was a black on white crime spree, the RG would be all over it.  Instead, the white media only gives us a story in which the perp is an African American.  Why are the Africans getting the short end of the stick, you ask.  Because the white media doesn't want to give the impression that African Americans are doing the bulk of the crime in this country.  That would conflict with the narrative that this is a country which honors black lives.  Therefore, they only ever report the crimes by African Americans, to help them get ahead in the race game.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning white people: I agree and would add that the "white working" class, the blue-collar proletariat is just that, a proletariat.

 As an aside, when one considers the numbers killed by cops versus the numbers killed by terrorists, you begin to see a picture that is mostly the opposite of what you presented.    You might look at it this way.    If you're a white, law-abiding American male who is mentally stable, you're relatively safe from the threats of terrorism.    But be of the opinion that most Muslims are terrorists?   Then you're an ISIS supporter, or an anti-Muslim bigot, or both.   And there's more.   So if you're of the opinion that most Muslims are terrorists, you're at least a sympathizer, and more likely a supporter, of ISIS.    And for all you know, you could be an ISIS sympathizer who never even heard of the terrorist organization until last November.

So by definition, if a black person is attacked, it's a hate crime.  It really is that simple.  But unlike crime, there's no punishment for hate crimes.

 White privilege is the idea that white people enjoy unearned advantages due to their race.  For example, white folks get a free education because they are white.  Asians are not expected to do well in school, even though they represent a higher percentage of university students.  White folks are also given unearned police contacts, speeding tickets,  and citations for minor infractions when in fact they are not at fault.  Asian Americans, on the other hands, experience much less racial profiling and police contact.  I'm white, and I get profiled.  No big deal.  Asian Americans have to deal with profilers incessantly.  I'm sure it's frustrating, but not as stressful as being profiled while driving.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning muslim people: Trump can and should do more.

 "Black and White" thinking is not limited to the political right.  It can be found throughout Western society.    I notice that few people are pointing out the hypocrisy of the Black Lives Matter movement.   Where is the outrage over the tens of billions of dollars the U.S. government has given to Black causes over the past few decades?  Or the way that Black-run corporations are allowed to steal most of the profits from their respective industries?  Or the way that government regulations, laws and court rulings stack the deck against Whites, even when they are behaving in morally reprehensible ways?   If we are to focus on racism, why aren't we also highlighting the racism within our own communities?   For instance, it has been revealed that Peel Region Schools are trying to block White students from applying to attend Peel District School Board schools.  http://news.nationalpost.com/news/can

 "If we are truly compassionate, if we are truly 'human' –if we believe that all life is sacred – then we cannot indiscriminately murder innocent, unborn babies.

If the numbers were reversed, and African Americans were the target, the number of homicides of African Americans would be 67 percent higher and the number of deaths would be almost entirely within the target population:  about 475 African American deaths versus about 220 white deaths.

In Canada, we were very religious.  But now, with a lot of immigration, we're seeing secular growth, and Muslim immigration has not caught up.  That makes me believe that what we're seeing is a natural evolution.  Islam may well become less of an issue as

 So then it's OK for white supremacists to parade around with tiki torches, chanting "Jews will not replace us" and "blood and soil"?  It's OK for them to brandish firearms and threaten and occasionally kill?    What has this "many sides" nonsense done to anyone, other than fan the flames of hatred?    Has it blinded anyone to the sheer viciousness and ferocity of the alt-right?   Have they come to the realization that, as one of their number said at that same rally, "we don't want to live in a white society"?  Have they come to the realization that their identity as white Europeans is in jeopardy?   If the answer to those questions is no, then maybe there is something to be learned from them.

 This is not surprising, but then again, Trump has made a career out of scamming the gullible, and this latest scam is no different. Trump promised that he would not raise their premiums. He lied.  What's even more shocking is that he will lie about how many people are affected.  According to the WaPo, over 20 million people could lose health coverage. That is more than 20% of the population. If even half of those people turn out to be white, that would make it the largest demographic to lose coverage.   That is where the scam stops being a scam.

 It is interesting to compare Trump to Neville Chamberlain.

Neville Chamberlain would have come up with something like "Never Again!"  "Never Again!"  means Never Again!  That is a lie, like "Never Again!" meaning "Never Trust Bankers!"

 How does this comment advance the discussion?    Trump won the election.  Hillary lost.  Maybe some people don't like Trump.  Maybe a large chunk of the country didn't vote for him.

We'll have to agree to disagree on that point, and maybe agree that some people like the president are a-holes.  I think, though, that many people appreciate the president for doing his damnedest to keep his campaign promises, for seeking to create and improve jobs, for reducing the size and scope of government, and most of all for acting with uncommon calmness and leadership in attempting to straighten out a country that, a year ago, was heading down a dangerous road with racial tensions reaching a boiling point.

But what about the rest of the abused? How are they "treated" after they leave the Church? How about the children? Are they ever allowed to see their parents again?

 I'm not surprised, Harper played on Canada's fears and prejudices to win, what else would you expect.

 I don't have to read much into Trump's words, actions, and appointments to know that his priority is to divide our country and create racial and social tensions.    His appointments to high level positions in his administration are clear indicators of this.    He hates blacks, Hispanics, women, and gays; and does everything in his power to make life miserable for anyone who is not white, male, straight, Christian, and gun-toting.

 Why does everyone have to "get off their high horse" so soon? Trump is a racist. Period. There's no debate to be had.

 You are correct.  Those white folks that Trump found so objectionable would have voted for McCain or Romney, or left the Democratic Party entirely.  Trump found them and drove them away.

 "A former state prosecutor who once represented white-collar criminals testified Tuesday that “the black population has grown enormously in that time,” and called white-collar crime “the most insidious, underreported, insidious problem in the United States.” "  I wonder how much of that growth is due to non-whites marrying whites and non-whites moving into white neighborhoods.

 A very interesting article.  As a middle aged, mostly white male from a Christian family I can say many things about the current situation in the USA.  Many people have a false perception of who is a "victim" in a conflict.  My father taught me that if someone attacks you, then you are a "victim".  You can not control anothers actions, only control what YOU are responsible for.  As an example, if I walk into a liquor store and find a gun, I am legally and morally responsible for the gun in my possession.  I had a gun in my possession and it's in the police evidence bag because I chose to have a gun in MY possession when I knew I wasn't safe.

 If the shooter was Muslim or Black, then Trump would call it an act of terrorism. If the shooter was white, then the term is bigotry.

 There are a number of posts on this forum demonstrating the ignorance and arrogance of the white man.  Perhaps you should educate yourself a little bit.  The indigenous people have no rights under the UN.  Their lands and resources belong to them.

When the white man goes to the store the store owner has the right to call the police and have the white man removed from the property.

 The "Alt-Right" is a white supremacist term created to attempt to create the appearance of a movement independent of traditional white racism.  I've been critical of that terminology, and in fact the term was coined by white supremacists, so it's not accurate in representing the vast majority of Americans.    There is in fact a vast left-wing conspiracy seeking to destroy the country, and it's important to recognize it.    The Democrats have been losing the House and Senate for some time, and it's pretty obvious why.

 "If you are a young black or brown person in the U.S., especially in the cities, and you are on the corners dealing drugs, you are probably a target for police.  It has been that way since the beginning of time."  True, that has always been the case.

 Trump has nothing to worry about except for his white supremacy.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: I can see the logic of this move.  If the Church were to recognize female sacramental ministers (and I hope it does), this would open a flood gate to married heterosexual priests.  After all, we ordain married men, right?  So there's no reason not to accommodate the custom of married heterosexually males being priests.  After all, it's the custom in the past, so it must be the custom now.  After all, there were married female presbyters (albeit now with deacons instead of priests) in the past, so this is no surprise.  I would love to see this happen, but I'm a bit concerned that the Pope might not be able to back it up.  I have read that before, that there have been cases where a pope

 You are incorrect in your statement.  The "N" word is used like crazy nowadays in movies, tv, etc.  The movie "12 Years a Slave" was a really good example.  The main character, Mr. Chiwet, uses the N word a lot.  I don't know if it was the white people or black people that were saying that the N word was a racial slur, but it sure wasn't the white people.  In the movie, the N word is used by Chiwet and his black partner to describe the whites who are keeping them down.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning muslim people: When Trump refused to call out Nazis and white supremacists even after a domestic terrorist killed one woman and maimed more in Charlottesville, Virginia—and then averred that “very fine people” were marching under Confederate flags—the extremists recognized the signal.

My idea of equality is that everyone should be treated the same and no one should be discriminated against. So if white people are discriminated against because they have white skin I'd take action to remedy that. It's not like discrimination against white people is something new and exclusive to them. It's been around for a very long time. So while I may not have personally experienced discrimination against white people, I've seen and heard enough to know that it is definitely something

 "If we accept the premises of this motion, we are doomed. The arc of Islamic terror – whether “inspired” by the Wahhabi/Salafist form of Islam which is prevalent in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, or the more radical Wahhabi form of Islam that exists in Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Da'esh (ISIS) – has historically been about using violence and intimidation to spread a political and social agenda through the use of “martyrdom” (a term used by Muslims to describe those who die as a result of attacking or resisting an aggressor). This has primarily been about using violence to undermine traditional liberal secular governments and religious pluralism."  That's a very brief statement but it really captures the issue.

 The only reason white males are doing poorly in education and employment is that we have a system that is biased against them.  Every other group does better in education and employment.

The fact that some of these people support Trump in spite of his bragging about sexual assault, his refusal to disavow the KKK, his support for the "alt-right" (whatever that is), and his open racism and bigotry, show support for the alt-right but that does not make white Christians in general, or Christians in any demographic, Trump supporters.  Trump won because people were tired of political correctness and believing whatever the PC police force the population to believe.  They were tired of being politically correct, of not being able to insult minorities, of not being able to criticize Muslims without being called a racist, and being constantly offended by anything non-white.  When minorities can't even insult white

 That's the problem with so-called "alt-right" white supremacists:  They have no values of their own, and will always blame others for their own stupidity and moral failures, rather than take responsibility for their own actions.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: In the meantime, we're being told, over and over, to just ignore the fact that the church hierarchs have been engaging in massive, decades-long cover-ups of the sexual abuse of children by their priests.  So we ignore it and say "who cares?"  And then we are supposed to go sit in judgment on other people for doing the same.

Adam and Eve (and some of their descendants) were deceived and brought into sin by the lying tongue of Satan, and there was only death in that world. But as some of the descendants of those who were deceived rose up and repented, Satan was hurled back to the earth whence he came. And the great sin of the world was accomplished. There was nothing left for God to do but to make an atonement and offer mercy to the descendants of the people of the Lie.

 You are the kind of racist who blames the victim.  White people are not being beaten and murdered by "white" people because "white" people are responsible for institutionalized racism. White people are being beaten and murdered because "white" people are responsible for institutionalized racism.   By the same token, it's racist to paint all cops as bad.  Bad cops don't beat and murder innocent people.   The problem with racism is that racism is systemic.  It's not like individual racist cops don't exist.  However, the kind of racist we have in the United States is more powerful than individual racists because it is backed by the state.  White people are still racist.  Black people are still racist.  And police are still racist.  But the state has now built up a program of using science to eliminate racism.  It starts with the DNA study that excludes white people.     <BOS>

 You've hit one of several bull's-eyes on this matter.  First, while the shooter was ostensibly Muslim, and had expressed sympathy with Muslim terrorists, that doesn't mean a thing.

He was a Muslim terrorist.  Period.    Second, it is NOT "her religion that is under attack," it's "her race."

 I find this article incredibly offensive.

 Why on EARTH would anyone want to identify with a bunch of white supremacist Nazi's.   I do understand that part of the 'alt-right' is neo-Nazis but that does not give white supremacists the right to be more racist than anyone else, especially in this country.    As far as I am concerned, if people are going to support and defend the words and actions of white supremacists, then they have to make a stand to say that racism will not be tolerated.    Otherwise white supremacists have the 'right' to show up with all the accoutrements of the Nazi's, KKK and all the other white supremacy groups, and protest the removal of Confederate statues.    This is not the same as showing up in uniform to protest or demonstrate against something.  We do not want racism to be allowed to hide in plain sight.   I think it goes too far to say that

 "white supremacist" is a political tool used by those wanting to marginalize and eliminate opposition to their political and social views.    The simple truth is that there is far more hatred and evil being spewed from the white supremacist side than the opposition.    Yes, there are also communists, socialists, greens, anarchists, liberals, etc. who espouse anti-white racism and anti-America, but the amount of hatred and evil coming from the white supremacist community is, by a very large margin, much higher.

 You are correct, but there is a major problem with your logic.  Your argument assumes that all whites are equally racist, which is clearly false.

 This article demonstrates the complete absurdity of the "White Privilege" narrative.  The author, who obviously hails from a privileged background, laments the lack of "privilege" for visible minorities, but possesses no such privilege herself.  Given that her life and career path have been determined by those in positions of power throughout her entire career, one would naturally assume that she sees herself as a victim of discrimination.  Instead, her life and career accomplishments have been earned by her, not by those in positions of discrimination and prejudice.  Aside from the obvious insult to visible minorities, this article showcases the utter fallacy of the "White Privilege" narrative.  People like the author, who constantly decry "White Privilege", do not understand that they actually do not have any white privilege to speak of.  They may very well have achieved their positions based on merit, but that does not automatically mean they have white privilege.

 I am glad you are offended by my post.  That is the kind of poster I want to see and hear.  That person should be fired.  What the post is trying to say is that I believe that whites are superior to other races and that we should be able to deport anyone who we find to be superior to us.  That is not racist or bigoted at all.  You did not answer my question.  Why would you think that a poster would be honest if their response to my post was "Why do you think my post is racist"?  That response indicates that the poster has an agenda that is more about promoting their own bigotry than answering a question posed by a poster who identified herself as a black woman.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: Why does this story continually make the rounds?

 I think I speak for most sane persons when I state that the people who think the white supremacist nonsense has some sort of intellectual basis are, for the most part, simpleminded imbeciles.   But let's be honest, most of them are as dumb as they come.    The one thing these white supremacists do seem to understand is that the white race is, at the very least, threatened by a non-white population that is, in significant part, being driven by white people, many of them Trump supporters, who are, at the very least, racist to a truly insane degree.

 I don't care about his "private life".  What I find offensive is that his wife of 8 years kept his 6-Yr-Old son in a 1 bedroom trailer in the dead of winter.  The trailer is heated.

When she didn't show up for court, the authorities arrested the boy (who's now 19) on a bogus charge, then later dropped the case when there was no physical evidence to support the charge.

 White privilege is absolute nonsense.  There is no such thing as "white" privilege.

 That's your opinion, isn't it?  To the contrary, I am suggesting that it is more probable that these crimes are committed by non-blacks, as these crimes have been consistently and repeatedly reported as occurring in the predominantly black neighborhoods, and because these crimes have been consistently and repeatedly reported in these neighborhoods.  Furthermore, in a majority of these cases the perp is black, which further strengthens the case that these are not "anti-white" crimes, but are in fact, simply random acts of violence by otherwise law-abiding black citizens against other unarmed black citizens.

But, being the racist buffoon that he is, he thinks that the racist buffoon that he is, is actually bigger than the USA, and goes out of his way to prove it every chance he gets.  He has absolutely no idea how small and petty his little act of hate actually is, and how much bigger he and his followers are for him than they actually are.  And he knows it.  He has a small, pathetic ego, and a grandiose, self serving goal to prove it to the world.  It's all about the ego and ego needs of a small child, wanting to be better than his father, and wanting to prove that he knows how to do the "evil" thing.    He is a child, and a very stupid child at that.

 This is really quite embarrassing, Dung, especially the way the paper has handled this issue.  We do not need a White Supremacist to point out that the Black Lives Matter movement is racist.

We do not need a White Supremacist to say that BLM is using racist tactics.   Yes, there is bad on both sides.  But neither the BLM extremists, nor Trump, nor the Republican extremists, or the editorial board of this paper is suggesting that there is anything even remotely connected to racism on the part of BLM, or that the only way to counter racism is to oppose racism.

 You are wrong.  There is a difference.  White Supremacist groups like the KKK and American NAZI Party are violent and racist.  ISIS and Al Quada are not.  ISIS is a terrorist group.

 You are absolutely correct,  Leonard Pitts.  These monuments were erected long after the civil war to promote and support the idea of white superiority.

 I agree with you ATF.  But I also strongly disagree with the notion that white males are the most likely to be the 'victims' of crime.  Those numbers prove nothing as crime rates vary widely by race, ethnicity, socio economic status, and other factors.

 The author is not looking at this from the right perspective.  Black men, especially in the black community, are often portrayed as a threat by police, and indeed there have been a few high-profile deaths of African-Americans at the hands of police.    What's happening here is that this "protests" are largely being driven by African-Americans and other minorities in the US, but they are not demonstrating that they are actually unhappy with the police and the way they are often treated.  They are simply using this incident as an opportunity to demonstrate their unhappiness.  What has happened in Europe - where police are actually hated - is that the police now fear for their lives.  There have been a number of high-profile attacks on police in Europe, and police are no longer able to go to work as they did before the terrorist attacks in France and Belgium.

 This article shows yet again that Eugene, OR is run by idiots who cannot think, and those idiots are liberals.  A large number of Eugene liberals that I have met through out my years in Eugene have stated that if you were to give them a thousand dollars, they would either vote for Hillary Clinton (which I did), or they would vote for Donald Trump.  That is just unacceptable to most conservatives, and those liberals should be sent packing in 2020.  What the liberals fail to realize, is that Trump only won the election because of the overwhelming support that we received from Oregon's large number of registered Independents, and the fact that so many Oregonians were fed-up with the liberal government's attitude of disrespect towards our U.S. Constitution, and its' protection of the individual rights contained therein.  The Trump victory has shown that the U.S. voting public, does not appreciate the disrespect that the liberal government

 The most important thing, as always, is to keep one's friends close and one's enemy closer.

 This is a sad legacy of the feminism of the 70s.  All the stupid political correctness has led to this.  Universities are now completely segregated by gender.

 You are correct.  White folks are mostly silent about the cops killing unarmed minorities  While many blacks, especially young black males, are shot and killed by cops....still far fewer blacks are shot and killed by cops than are young whites.  It is true that most cop shootings are of black people.  And it is true that most whites are killed by cops, too.  But the two facts are not the same.  If blacks were killed by cops at the rate they are killed by cops, we would still have a higher rate of black deaths than any other race.  That is according to the FBI.  White people are significantly more likely to be killed by cops than are blacks or other races.  That is according to the Washington Post.

 Oh. My. T. Gosh how I long for some good old fashioned white guilt trips and general resentment towards "others".    For those of you who have never experienced the slightest bit of racism, let me share a bit of my life. Growing up in a mostly-white small town in Oregon, I had few black friends. At the time, it wasn't uncommon for white folks to think that black people smelled, and thought they were, different. That it was an affront to their sense of self-worth.   So when I ventured out on my own, I was often mistaken for a "local" by other white folks. They offered to help me find work, or give me advice on how to get started. Of course, the most valuable gift they could give me was their tacit agreement that I was "one of them".  I guess I should have been grateful, but I was embarrassed

 Trump is not just a liar and a racist - he is a fascist.  A white nationalist.  You can be as anti-racist as you like, but that does not make it true.  Fascism is a political ideology, not a religion (although it lacks many of the characteristics of a religion).  It is a system of oppression that is carried out by authoritarian leaders, often against their own nation's ethnic or religious minorities.  It is most often used to build a nation, but can also be used to carry out foreign policy.   Fascism is not exclusively a right-wing political ideology, although all right-wing political ideologies are implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) fascist.

 The problem is, most of the liberals don't realize this.

 No, I am stating that it is not true that most murders in the US are committed by whites.

 Oh my...you can't even state the obvious.  The shooter was a 64 year old black man who used a 9 mm pistol.  He specifically chose that pistol and type of weapon to carry within arm's reach of the officers at the scene.  He chose that pistol and type of weapon in order to kill as many people as possible.

The Southern Baptist religion, with its focus on the Bible, provided the perfect venue for the rise of white supremacy, along with the related Protestant ideas of self-sufficiency and self-will.

 White people are the only group in history that have tried to wipe out all the other groups and replace them with themselves.

 It's easy to talk about "white privilege" when you, yourself, are of white privilege.  As a straight, white, male living in a pretty city in a relatively well-to-do town I can go to almost any place in western society and as Louis C.K. put it: I'll be greeted with "Why, we have a table right here for you sir". I have virtually no chances to interact with people of non-white races and I know that I have white privilege for reasons that are not purely economic. The dominant culture in western societies is one that is constantly telling people: "You are not very good a you are not very important". That message is perpetuated and reinforced by the state and media on a daily basis. For people who have not been taught to believe that black people are a specific and distinct minority from white people, it can be very difficult to understand why a police officer is suspicious

 As someone who is not white, but has European blood running through my veins, it astounds me how ignorant some people can be.

 There is much controversy around the definition of 'hate speech'.  The key issue is whether a statement is an incitement to violence or hatred.  Some will say 'well this incites violence, therefore it is hate speech.'  Others will say 'well this is not hate speech, it is just a criticism of the ideology and people in this ideology, therefore it is not a crime.'   Ultimately the Supreme Court will apply a test that balances the competing interests involved.  It will either find that the statement in and of itself is hate speech, or it will find that it is not a crime but it does raise First Amendment concerns.

 You need to brush up on your history. The Confederacy WAS all about slavery. As the war progressed, the north realized they could win the war without the support of the southern states.

The south didn't want to be part of a government that looked like the Constitution of the United States.  They didn't want to lose the South to the north.

 I've noticed that too. The last two popes have been extremely homophobic and have even had the gall to refer to gays as 'disordered', which makes them even worse than Trump, who is a closet racist.

I have to say that I think the answer to that question is a resounding yes. I am not saying that we cannot have a discussion at all, but time is not on our side.  The other problem that I see is that the progressive wing of the church does not seem to be interested in having that conversation.

Islam is a totalitarian political ideology, and accordingly, the secular state has an interest in regulating it as such.

 "White men were the primary beneficiaries of affirmative action."  --  Any statistical analysis of statistics must be accompanied by an explanation of why the statistician chose the particular statistic to present.

When those white men were compared with white men without college degrees, those without college degrees were more likely to be employed in professions with lower wages.

 The point is that the vast MAJORITY of terrorist shootings/bombings etc. in this country since 9/11 were perpetrated by RIGHT WING "Christian" extremists.   That's a fact.

 I believe that these monuments were put up to rewrite the history of the genocides against Native Americans by the white man.

These monuments were put up to rewrite the history so that Indians were bad.  These monuments were put up to rewrite the history so that Indians were saints.

 You are correct that most whites have not been tainted by Apartheid - but most blacks were. Many whites are ignorant of the "facts".  I remember the "30 Years War" (1865-1872) in which the British slaughtered about 10 million blacks (or about 1% of the total population) in the North and South-West. About 2% of the black population was left alive.  Most were slaves. About 2% of German territory in WWI was occupied by the black tribes and about 1% by the Slavs. Blacks were particularly targeted because they made up about 30% of the population.  In WW2, only 6% of German territory was left uninhabited.   About 1.3 million people - including 400,000 blacks - were deported by the Allies to the North American continent as slaves.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: Why do the bishops persist in

In Ferguson, there was a Black Councilman with the power to order the police to stand down and the people who came to protest were so angry at the way Michael was treated that they didn't know what to do, so they just kept showing up in force, which was stupid.

 As I said, the point is that there are large numbers of whites who support Trump who deny they are racists.   Racism is about believing your own race is superior to others.

 White people are responsible for the privilege we carry, part of which is due to discrimination.  Black people and brown people have the power to do good, but we often fail to recognize the value in what they are able to accomplish.

Not all who were "promoted" did so because of skin color, but it's still an interesting phenomena.

 Trump won the election despite white supremacy and the help of Russia.     Why?

 You are correct.  White Americans have been using "racism" as an excuse to be bigots since the Civil War.

  It was inevitable that the first black president would unsettle a lot of people.

Obama's successes in the private sector (he worked for a time at a Wall Street firm) and in his political career have shown that he can function fairly well in a capitalist environment.

 "It's hard to find a better symbol of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Republican Party establishment than white supremacists," Walter Shaub, head of the USCCB Office of Corporate Relations, said in a statement.

This has been a tradition here going back to when the U.S. Supreme Court decided in favor of segregation in Brown v. the Board.  All the right wing, religious, corporate, media, law makers and most of the elected officials have their fingers on the scales, so to speak, to decide what we face next.

 Your premise is ridiculous on the face of it.  How could a person who has never experienced prejudice be qualified to assess the degree of prejudice someone else may have experienced?  The fact is that black people experience prejudice (to different degrees) just like white people, and if you're black and get into a confrontation with the police, the odds are not in your favour.  The same is true for LGBT folks: if you're gay and get into a confrontation with the police, the odds are not in your favour.

Gender equality and freedom of expression are essential to any respect of fundamental justice, and to effective societies. Canada has already seen the deleterious effects of political Islam in our society, most notably with the wearing of the Niqab, where women are treated as second class citizens. More recently, we have seen the practice of men only being allowed to join certain student organizations, while female students are outright banned from participating. We must

 Trump was elected by and large because of white people who saw in him a reliable vote against the excesses of political correctness and what they assumed would be a continuation of President Obama's agenda.  Trump is the ultimate "throw away" candidate - a political lightweight who would not be standing if John McCain, the chosen Republican candidate, were the Democrat candidate.  Trump's candidacy was not helped by the fact that he is an obnoxious, loud-mouthed, showman who treats women like pieces of meat.

 I have to laugh at you. First of all, I do read Breitbart. You have probably read their articles more than once.  Second off, your claim that racism doesn't exist is laughable.

 You seem to be forgetting that it was the Dems that blocked black and latino judges from nomination and sitting on the bench when Reagan came into office.

He is one of the best, and probably the only, Justice on the Court that actually knows how to listen to arguments on both sides of an issue.  He will write the opinion for sure, but I have complete faith in his ability to reach out and find common ground.  He is NOT a ideologue.  The fact that Democrats blocked Garland from being nominated is not exactly a proud moment for them.

 The GOP wants the White Supremacist vote.  They are playing the race card.     I would vote the White Supremacists out of office, if there was a sufficient turnout.

 It is so very simple. White people, especially white men, like to feel powerful, especially when it comes to asserting their dominance over others. They are particularly prone to feeling powerful around Black people, whom they assume to be weak and foolish, despite the clear strength they exude around their own kind.  This is why so many white people want to put down Black people, and it is why so many Black people want to put down white people, particularly white men. This is why so many cop shootings of Black men are justified, even when the men were not aggressive towards the police.  This is why so many Americans are confused about what has actually happened in Charlottesville, and why so many are calling for a more 'racial' approach to racial issues.

 "What exactly do you disagree with?"

Your insistence on casting yourself as a victim is quite telling, as is your insistence that refusing to condemn the violence perpetuated by hate groups is somehow a courageous "stand."  You remind me of the racist segregationists who used the "N-word" during sit-ins at lunch counters in the South.  You remind me of the white racists who wore hoods and burned crosses while shouting "Jews will not replace us!"  Your insistence on casting yourself as a victim is not without its parallels in white nationalism, the KKK, and neo-Nazism.  Gary Crum

 This is the most dumbest, most offensive, most tone deaf article I have read in quite some time.  The writer is incapable of relating the horrific killings of innocent, defenseless Black men and boys (and men) to everyday violence.  It is the same mentality that preys on poor, minority women - they are the 'easy' targets, they have nothing to lose, and so they flaunt the laws of our nation to commit their crimes.  The sad thing is, the victims of these senseless killings are mostly, if not all, Black and/or Hispanic males.     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning muslim people: I am not in favor of that, but there is no good answer, since Trump's base is largely white and lower middle class (the true America).

So, if a person of color steals a $300 dollar bill from a mostly white store and uses it to buy an expensive item, is that brown privilege?

 There's a difference between feeling mildly peeved, and actually being subjected to violence, which is what white supremacists in the USA are doing to people of color right now.

 The author has not been paying attention.  Not since the Clinton v. Jones Supreme Court has so much hate been spewed from the liberal mouths.

Were those views just words on a piece of paper or should he be held to the same standards as any other politician?

 I agree.  If we want to stop white supremecists and their enablers, the first step is to acknowledge white privilege.  When white people behave as expected, the civil world is a peaceful place.

Exactly, Lynn, and I think it's mostly the former.  For some reason women (and men) don't like to be perceived as brainless and soulless, or uneducated, or unhinged.  If they can avoid it, they'll try to avoid anything that might give the appearance that they're not what they appear to be.  Women especially seem to really want to fit in, and if they look or act non-aggressive, cool, and collected, they feel they'll fit in better.

 Well, Mr. Trump does business in the black community.   He's not there to listen to them whine and complain.  He's there to listen to them buy his products.  I can see you've made your point.

The simple answer is because their countries aren't functioning properly and the Canadian government thinks they may bring their backward culture with them. In addition, there are reports that many of these immigrants are having a problem with their women getting pregnant.     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning black people: You really need to look up the meaning of racist. It has a completely different connotation today than it did in 1968. Most people realize that African Americans were profiled in the 1960s because they were viewed as a threat to white privilege. In 2016, a Muslim immigrant threatened the American president elect with violence and killed a couple of his security detail. There was never any fear that a Latino or Muslim immigrant would do likewise. The American Latino community was instrumental in electing Obama and, more importantly, in helping to restore some measure of racial equality. There is no reason to believe that they will

 The baker in question discriminated against this guy and you are whining over a $3 cake?

It is about a police officer(police were on vacation at the time) using his Taser unnecessarily against a person who was passively resisting arrest and who posed no threat to the cop whatsoever.   The officer should have been removed from the scene and then arrested for excessive force.    The use of the Taser was absolutely egregious.    Had the person been actively resisting arrest and there was the potential for death, I believe the officer would have been properly trained and the case would have ended there.    A few months ago in Texas a police officer was videotaped punching a woman in the face and kneeing her in the chest.  It

 Well if that is the case there is more to the story than what the article tells us .

 The author is correct:  Trump has appealed to the worst elements of society.  The fact that his followers "seemingly can't tell the difference" between racist and anti-Semitic remarks demonstrates the vacuity of their thinking.  This has always been true of Trump, but it is now overt:  His rhetoric is racist, anti-semitic, misogynist.    I don't believe that Trump is personally responsible for the violence that has occurred:  the fault rests with those who support him, those who encourage his racist, misogynist views, and those who are physically violent toward those who espouse values counter to those of the Trumpster.

You were a good man, but I think your wife knew you were cheating on her."  The Republicans have been imploding for a year now. Trump has been leading a group of fools.

 What you fail to realize is that the reason people don't trust the MSM anymore is because they are constantly slandered and libeled by them.  The MSM will say anything to slag or smear a politician, company or person, and they do it because if they say something wrong about someone or something they own, they can get someone or something to take action against them.  They will make up whatever there is to make themselves look or act good, because they know that is all that matters.  If you were to actually look at what the MSM is reporting about Trump with regards to his links to Russia and other places, they report nothing but slag.  Trump's son-in-law is a criminal from Russia.

 I would love to see Donald Trump denounce these groups...but he won't. He needs their votes...and their support.  These groups support him because he spits on the norms of American political discourse (as does every person on this thread).    These groups were offended by the black president because he used logic (the scientific method) to understand complex issues. They deny the scientific method because they don't like the fact that modern science is based on fact.  They hate that fact.  They don't like the fact that America is a meritocratic society. They hate that fact.  They don't like the fact that a black man (for example) can get elected to lead this country.  They hate those very things.

For example, the concept of "patriarchy" was created by men, in response to the idea that women were not equally endowed with the ability to lead.

 White people do not understand prejudice because they do not experience it against themselves. When you are white you are never questioned about your honesty, your morality, or your intelligence. You are not suspected of being deceptive, or of lacking integrity because you are white. Your honesty, your morality, and your intelligence are never in question.   When you are black, on the other hand, those things you accomplish are subject to suspicion and debate. You are always suspect of being dishonest, of cheating, of not being faithful. Your intellect and your honesty are constantly called into question. You are presumed to possess less integrity and intelligence than a white person. You are not really welcomed as part of the black community.

 You have it backwards, the protest of the white supremacists is to have government recognition of their "history", by their very own choice.  The "protesters" are now trying to make the white supremacy movement go away, by making it more "palatable", by trying to make it more mainstream.

 You might be right, but I think it's the fact that Hillary doesn't believe white America is guilty of the systemic discrimination that she believes white men are.

Just because someone says something offensive to you, doesn't make it less offensive to others.    Calling out bigotry is about more than just being offended.

 "If whites really want to be treated equal to everyone else, then they should try to be more like one another—there’s no need to see if they’re white or black."  Really? If that is their honest view of the situation, then they should move to Africa and live off the land.

 I think most of us can agree that racism is evil, and the more of it we see the better.

 I'm with you.  But I think there's more to the story.  For years, SNAP has been under attack by its own board and chief counsel.  In addition, lawyers working for SNAP threatened to sue unless their clients were removed from the lawsuit against the Catholic Church.    This is how SNAP came to be:  A lawsuit by its own board and its lawyers.  If SNAP was a secular organization, it wouldn't be under attack, and it wouldn't have needed its own lawyers to protect itself from being sued by its own clients.  The fact that it's run by Catholics shows the bias of the organization, and its self-destructive power.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning white people: So what if muslims become the majority?

 The author seems to be of the same mind as those who call for violence against those who disagree with them.  These people want to eliminate free speech.  And free speech is the foundation of Western Civilization.  To give violent protesters the same rights as the KKK would severely erode our democratic institutions.  For example, the group might DEMAND that the White race must give up all of their properties.  The White race must also give up all weapons and all genealogy.  They must also learn to hate completely.  Hate does not mean to hate black, white, brown, yellow, green, or any other.  Hating just means to hate.  All humans, except those of the White race, are guilty of sin.  Every human, except those of the White race, should hate, since they are guilty of sin.  Those who are guilty of the most heinous sins should be hated, and punished accordingly

 Trump did not explicitly endorse white supremacy.   That's not true.  He implicitly endorsed white supremacy.  That's why the white supremacists see him as their champion.

 I would say that your analogy fails as does your argument.  No one marching with NAZI's or white supremacists says "I like their thinking just as much as the Trumpies."

 The sad truth is many Americans are so misinformed they actually believe the myth that all conservatives are KKK members.  In addition, there is a large sub-culture of white trash America and Trump is their cultural messiah.

No.  If the mental illness of a mass shooter is ignored, then do you feel more secure knowing that he had access to guns that are readily available to civilians in this country?  Yes, I do.  If the majority of mass shooters have mental health issues, then why do we have so many gun shows in this country?

 I find the assertion of "all lives matter" and the associated slogan offensive.  I find the phrase "black lives matter more" equally objectionable.

 The most glaring problem for me is that we no longer have a national goal for reducing the number of gun deaths. We seem to be fighting about the details. For example, one gun death might be "too many" if it happens near my house, but "not enough" if it happens in some distant part of town. As long as we are so focused on "me me me" instead of "we've got to work on reducing the number of guns so that the majority of gun deaths aren't going to happen," we won't make any progress at all.  The second problem is that we have so many people with guns that we are now at war with a lot of people. There have been mass shootings in at least 4 states so far this year. In the past month, 12 people in the US have been killed by guns. If someone in Chicago gets shot, it's all over the national news, but if a

 I'm going to ignore "white monopoly capital" and "crony capitalists" and go straight to what I think is the main issue causing this problem...

There are many, many more wealthy and powerful people living in SA than there are in any other country in the world.  They all have business to run.  So why doesn't SA's government just allow all businesses to operate as they please and raise the taxes they need to to make up the difference and then distribute the money to every single white man, woman and child?

 This is a very sad commentary on the state of a nation that was founded on the concept of disparate peoples coming together.  What has happened to that concept, and to the idea that we as a nation can rise above our inveterate differences and work to become one as a people?  The Republican Party is the most divisive and racist organization ever to enter national politics.  It is a cruel and sad thing to see these statues, which have stood for hundreds of years, suddenly torn down in the shadow of Trump's presidency.    These monuments were put up during the period of Jim Crow laws, and before that, the lynchings of black Americans for all sorts of alleged offenses.  Some of these monuments were erected during the days of Strom Thurmond, a most undemocratic and immoral politician to ever hold national office.  I'm ashamed that so many Americans have come to such a pass.

 As usual, RD is so busy writing pseudo-books about sex that he doesn't have time to study his own church.  I have heard countless times that celibacy is God's plan for marriage.  I am sure that many are proud to claim that celibacy is the 'natural' way for married people to be sexual.  But, like the hierarchy, they conveniently forget that sex is intended for procreation.  God made us physically capable and able to reproduce, but not capable of being sexually motivated forever.  Sex is just that - a physical act intended for a purpose.  When we are growing physically, emotionally, intellectually, etc., it is our bodies that attract us sexually.  Once we outgrow our physical attraction to girls/women, we are no longer sexually motivated.  That is biological fact.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: My point is, it was OK

This is no mere allegation.  As a matter of fact, Trump himself has repeatedly incited white supremacists.  He retweeted a post from a neo-Nazi who praised the president for his “unpresidential” behavior; he retweeted a post from a racist that showed a group of mostly young men sitting behind a platform that was covered in confederate flags; and he retweeted a post from a neo-Nazi that called for his assassination.  The president himself has not disavowed those figures, including the KKK leader who helped him get elected.  Trump is responsible for all hate.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people:

 You're a racist and a bigot. I'll make this simple. If a black person kills a white man, I don't mourn the death of the white man. I mourn the death of  ANY human being who would kill in the name of bigotry and racism.   And you offer no evidence for your assertion that "a black man killing a white man" has ever occurred.   Are you suggesting that a black man having a gun prevents him from being shot by a black man?  You're saying that a gun is the only thing that prevents a black man from being shot by a black man?   In 2012, 27% of black men aged 15-34 were killed by other black men.   That same year, black men were just 3.5% of the population but murdered 17% of the time by other black men.

 It's time for white people to take a hard stand. We are not in any war to let the Mexicans or anyone else come to our country. We want to let the people of this country stay and become like themselves. This is not a white privilege thing. This is our culture and traditions. To become like other countries you need to become like us. That means you assimilate to us not the other way around. White people have to learn to like the brown skinned people and become one of them. This will never happen if we keep allowing non-whites to come in and change our culture and traditions. We need to secure the borders and kick out the criminal illegal aliens.

 I agree with you 100%.  We should not be importing people that hate us, want to kill us, want to change our society to the point where they are superior to us.  We have enough of those already.  And yes, there are probably a few "rogue" racists that sneak into our small cities and towns to breed.  But, the vast majority of immigrants that come to this country do so legally, seek to escape poverty, oppressive regimes, violence, and strife.  The fact is that Muslim immigration to the west will outstrip white immigration because those who can best assimilate into our Western societies are the most desirable immigrants.  The immigrants that we should be most concerned with are the ones that have the desire to do so.  The Muslims that want to kill us are already here; they are called terrorists.  We should be looking for the criminals, the murderers, the kidnapers, the extortioners

 Why do you assume that the people you are talking to "do not believe in freedom of speech" and instead want to silence anyone who makes racist remarks?  There is a difference between racist remarks and rational commentary that takes the facts into account and expresses opinions about them.

That doesn't mean I think African Americans are better or worse than whites, it just means I don't think they are running around murdering white folks.  Similarly, I can analyze what we know about Muslims and terrorism and come to the conclusion that radical Islam is a serious problem, but that there are other causes as well, e.g. poor policy choices by governments all over the world.

 Well, I'm not.  I believe that the police are trying their hardest to catch killers, murderers.    How can anyone say that police are racist without having some evidence?

I'm not blaming the cops, because I've not been able to find any, nor is that the point.

 "Trump’s most provocative statements have come when he has tried to distinguish between “us” — individuals who share his values — and “the other —” immigrants, Muslims, Latinos, Asians and Africans.

 It's a question of priorities. If a terrorist is black and attacks whites, that's a priority for the authorities.  If a terrorist is white and attacks blacks, that's a priority for the authorities.   If a terrorist is brown and attacks whites, that's a priority for the authorities.   If a terrorist is white and attacks blacks or other whites, that's a civil rights issue, and the authorities have every right to discuss it.   This discussion should take place after the police have taken all possible steps to determine who was responsible for the crime.   A police investigation doesn't necessarily imply guilt.   But if the authorities are convinced that the guy is responsible, that means that they have determined that he's not a racist, is not mentally ill, and isn't a threat to the community.   To the contrary, we have every right to ask what he was thinking and why.

 What is truly hilarious is that white liberals, who usually cannot bring themselves to criticize anything made by or for white people, will do all they can to praise anything made by or for the LGBTQ community, while never once criticizing anything made by or for the black or brown community.

Which is why you will rarely see any mainstream media commentator criticize the black lives matter movement for its endemic racism or embrace the fact that black lives matter most.  If the black lives matter movement would just leave us alone, we would most certainly appreciate it.  But since they want us to know that they and BLM are the bad guys, we must not criticize them.

These are not ideas that anyone with a sane mind would ever advocate, especially for white men."  This statement is ridiculous.

 I think you miss the point.  Trump's election is  the rejection of the Political Correctness dogma that has held the US in thrall for the past 50+ years.  Trump's ascendancy is not due to some kind of right wing backlash, it is due to the American people rising up to the challenge of a system that was designed to protect the 1% at the expense of everyone else.  America is once again a force to be reckoned with, and its people are far more enlightened and ethical than our political leaders would have us believe.  The idea that Trump's election is a "blow against political correctness" is absurd, the blow was rather to the psyche of the American people who saw their hard-fought liberties being eroded by the excesses of Political Correctness, something the left has been attempting to bring to the fore for some time now.

 I'm not a big fan of trump but what he said....was in context with the rest of what he said.   In other words if a black guy sees another black guy in a police uniform standing around in street clothes, and that cop is smoking a cig, and that black guy says f@*k you, that's a racist tirade right in my book.   The context really should have been that this cop is a douchebag and has to go.  I have no problem with the cops getting "reassigned" or getting fired.   What I have a problem with are the few that have shown they are completely unworthy of the uniform and having to pretend to do their jobs while doing something completely different.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: I think I'm just going to go ahead and say for the record that I am not a member of any organized religion.

 I don't like how this article and the responses to it are going so far as to equate being white with being a racist, or bigoted.  While undoubtedly many white people benefit from affirmative action and have white privilege, there is no equivalency in how white people are treated and how black and brown people are treated.  There are many things white folks can do to be more accepting of others, and there are many black and brown organizations and communities that would love to have more whites join their gatherings.  To suggest that all white people are racists is both ignorant and offensive.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: I agree there's no way to have an open and honest discussion about this, but I will say that your definition of toxic is very much a minority one.

 "Trump's angry, racist remarks can be explained by three facts.   First, he is a product of American society, raised in a society that prized whiteness above almost everything else.   Second, he has a staff and advisers that are as white as his hair.   And third, he has encouraged and played to these prejudices.   I'm willing to bet that if a stranger walked into his office, sat down, and began spewing racist and anti-Semitic insults, the first reaction of his staff and advisers would be to try to shut the person down, not welcome them to represent the values on which the country is based.

 As an aside, I've noticed that the bulk of the hate directed towards Muslims seems to come from the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant population in general. There appears to be a latent anti-Muslim sentiment amongst that group. I don't think it's conscious, but it's there and it's there in large enough numbers to influence public policy.   In terms of violence, the left has had its fair share from right wing extremists (Bannon, anyone?).

 Your narrative is a lie.  The vast majority of terrorists in this country are white Americans. We have never been safer.

 "Why do only white men have to give up all but 100k of their salary? That is more than any woman, minority, or immigrant needs to give up."  Well if it is that simple, there would be no need for the "give up" part.   The "give up" part comes from the realization that the white man is on top, and he is not going to give up any of his wealth to help others.  In fact, he will likely throw some of his wealth to help, but only a fraction of what he really thinks is his.    Most white men feel like they are entitled, and they are not going to give anything up that does not benefit them.  For example, take a black man and put him in charge of all of the land surrounding his home.  What would happen if a bunch of racist white people refused to allow him to build a fence or to follow

 If Trump fires Mueller, we'll see a lot of Democrats crying out for Trump to be put on trial for firing the special counsel.   Mueller is investigating Trump for obstruction of justice.

 How can any rational, reasonable person say anything good about the Democratic Party in the US?   Ever?

 There is a major problem with "white privilege".    It's that the term is used to divide people, instead of uniting us.    For example, many white people have no problem with young black males protesting against police brutality, yet when a white senior citizen does the same, the protests quickly devolves into a discussion of "white privilege".

 Trump’s most hateful act was his callous dismissal of the widow of a soldier killed in action. But if the “alt-left” is to be taken seriously, it must also condemn the violence from its most racist members.

Hate flourishes when bigots feel empowered to speak their racist truths.

 You've hit one of several bull's-eyes on this matter.

 There are a whole host of issues here which don't have a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer.

 I agree with the sentiments in this editorial, but it seems to me that the terminology 'white supremacy' is a bit over the top.

More than 80% of mass-shooters and much more of child molesters and terrorists are white. Worldwide, white people are responsible for around 50% of violent crimes against humanity.

 It is hard to imagine a more discriminatory tax policy than this.    Whites pay more in taxes than they receive in federal grants.  Blacks and Hispanics get far more in federal grants than they pay in taxes.  This is redistributing wealth from one group to another.    It is inequitable and it perpetuates racial distinctions.  White men paid 20% less in federal taxes than black men in 2012.  If Jeff Sessions had his way, that number would have been cut in half.

 I agree with much of what you say here, but I think "white supremacy" gets in the way of the issues raised by BLM.  When BLM raises issues like police brutality and systemic racism, they are viewed by many as just another black protest group seeking attention.    There is a significant difference between black protest and white supremacy.  While some white people do exhibit racist behavior, most of us don't.  The issue is that many blacks believe they are superior to other races and will defend anything to preserve that belief.  When that belief is interfered with, there will be a backlash from the black community, which is why some blacks advocate "black power" but only when it's in the service of maintaining white supremacy.     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning black people: You are correct.

 I hate to break it to you snowflakes, but you're wrong.  It's about sexual assault, plain and simple.    It's not "white male privilege" that gives men the power to commit sexual assault, it's male power.    I could be wrong, but I think the best explanation for this is that male sexual assault is, in fact, far more common than female sexual assault.    If that's the case, then the solution isn't to take away from male victims the right to seek redress for their assault, the solution is to make it impossible for males to commit sexual assault.   To do that, simply providing male victims with the same rights and protections that female victims have would be enough.

But, because of their numbers, they are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system. Over 85% of people arrested for simple possession of drugs (including drugs sold on the street), are African American.  What we have here is a de facto segregation of the American criminal class based on color. And it's gotten this far, largely because black people are systematically targeted for discrimination, systematic and persistent, as are other racial minorities.

 A few more tips:  -This tactic is the opposite of what social justice activists are using to call public attention to racism. It is a tactic of white supremacy.  -Do not be fooled by the use of the term "alt-right."

 I would say that this is more about the fact that many Americans, including many who claim to be "christian," worship false idols. The golden calves they worship, are wealth, celebrity, and guns.

 It is not "my" government that is bringing this on, "my" government is trying to protect its citizens from a rapidly changing environment, by any means necessary.  This is not the first time that white peoples have been scapegoated for problems that they have created.  The history of the last several centuries is one of genocide, colonialism and imperialism, with every race hated.  Now we are being asked to accept that our race is the scapegoat for all the world's ills, that we have no other choice but to accept that we as a race are a cancer on the planet, that we are worthy only of destruction.  I reject that nonsense.  I believe in self determination of my actions, that I am the master of my destiny, and I will make my own way.

 So glad to see you back on topic.  My point, which was not mentioned by you, is that it is not true that "Catholics" as a group believe abortion to be a sin.  Far from it.  You stated:  "I would expect many of the white Catholic voters who supported Trump would see their position as morally indefensible, and they would have every right to feel that way. But it doesn't change the fact that for many, many years, Catholics played a very substantial role in American politics, and played a far more prominent role than black Catholics or Muslims."  What part of "played a far more prominent role" do you not see grasp?  In the 2016 Presidential election, Catholic voters made up 21% of the electorate, making them the largest Catholic voting block.  In 2012, they made up 17%.

 "Black lives matter" is a hate group out to stir up trouble.  They don't care if the President is black or white, so why should they care if he is racist or not?

 The sad truth is that the majority of the GOP base (white, black, brown, red, or whatever color) simply doesn't give a rip about democracy or the nation.  They are racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, homophobes.  Trump is their rock, their savior.  The problem is that they are ignorant to a point of idiocy.  They refuse to take the advice that a president gives.  They don't care that he was elected 7 times.  They don't care that he is almost guaranteed to lose in the first year.  They don't care that he is a climate change denier.  They don't care that he has no idea what he is doing.

 I can certainly understand the outrage among African Americans.    What I cannot fathom is the total lack of outrage from this group over the black cop that killed the African American man last week.  This cop was not stopped for a broken tail light or an outstanding traffic warrant.  The cop was driving erratically and then tried to run over an innocent African American man.  The African American man was reaching for his wallet as directed by the policeman.  The policeman then turned and shot him twice in the back as he lay helpless on the ground.  The policeman then fleed the scene.    The only explanation I can think of for the complete lack of outrage is that the African American men have been thoroughly indoctrinated in their "black victimization" role in American society. This is the role that their parents have taught them and this is the role that the media has reinforced over the years.  If young black men

 White privilege is a misnomer.  Black Americans have a legitimate complaint about racial discrimination.  When I was visiting relatives in Chicago I had to wear a jacket in the winter,  not because I was "white",  but because it was 40 below zero and I would be literally froze to death in that weather.  When I look at crime statistics and compare white and black America I see very stark racial differences in who is affected by crime.  Statistics are clear that black Americans suffer a recurrence rate far higher than white Americans,  especially if they are poor.  The economic insecurity and lack of good schools that are the foundation of much of black poverty starts early.  When I was young we taught our black children to "walk the talk".  To "give back".  That meant teaching them how to get a job, how to get a regular education, how to get their own house in order.  White liberals

I am only referring to the accusations made by many against him, and those of many prominent liberals.  By far the majority of sexual harassment complaints made to HR are made by women.   The HR departments of major companies are overwhelmingly staffed by women.

 What a load of Crap.  You obviously don't know the first thing about Black Codes or any other type of government Interference.  The Black Code was a list of things that the whites wanted to do to the Blacks that they believed were detrimental to the community.

White owned businesses were forced to give jobs to the Blacks that were not demeaned in any way.  Rape was just one of the many things that the government demanded of the Blacks.

 I was going to say what I think; I have always believed and still believe that most people who commit violent acts are deeply disturbed individuals.

If the goal is to end violence toward women, then we must start by acknowledging the roots of that violence - including the teaching of Islam in our schools.    If we are serious about reducing violence, then we must stop identifying Islam as the source of it, and start to question the very reason Islam was adopted as a faith in the first place.  Until we do that, any violence toward women can only be considered a response to Islam.

 Well, the only way out from the ditch into which President-elect Trump has driven the Republican Party is to join it, and that requires not only repudiation of the President-elect's policies, but also an embrace of the very things he advocated during his campaign: a ban on all Muslims, the building of a wall on the Mexican border, a 45% tariff on all products imported from Asia, etc.    The fact that these ideas have the support of a majority of the Republicans in the Senate only shows that those in leadership do not have the courage of their convictions.

Apparently, he's a racist who couldn't care less about the color of someone's skin but finds an "inner city" black man to advance his racist agenda.

 The point is: if we are to have a discussion about the origins and nature of Islamophobia - and it has to start somewhere - then we have to have the discussion.

All the science on these voters is inconclusive, but there is reason to believe that this core group of voters will remain a solid base for the GOP for decades to come.

 You obviously have no clue how the political climate works.   There is a big difference between having some form of hate towards someone (e.g. Nazis) and actually having that hate and wanting to incite violence against that person.    You don't really think that some black person hates white people, do you?  Hate is defined differently depending upon the ideology and the target.    There is no doubt that young black males are overwhelmingly radicalized and that radicalization is the driving force behind a lot of these violent outbursts.

 The fact that you don't believe me is irrelevant. Your comment is insipid.   The reason I am against anti-white hate speech is precisely because of the incitements to violence and annihilation that are often part of the vocabulary of these haters.

And it's well-known that whites, on average, have MUCH MORE sex than blacks and Latinos.  So yeah, it’s a matter of scale.  The numbers just aren’t there.  And it’s a fact that the media is only now beginning to examine this issue because, quite simply, it’s the new racist weapon in the democrat arsenal.  All these years of calling Republicans racist simply because they oppose abortion and homosexual marriage has turned out to be nothing more than cheap propaganda.  And the latest data shows that almost 83% of black children are born out of wedlock.  You can’t deal with this issue while pretending that it doesn’t exist.  It will come back to

 It is amazing to see how the media has turned a blind eye to this violence while constantly calling for gun control laws.   This is the United States of America, a country founded on the idea that all men are created equal.  When one group of people is constantly denied rights and subject to violence, it is obvious that their message is that their country is full of haters.  As a country founded on that idea, it's hard to argue that we shouldn't make efforts to control guns.   But there's a huge distinction between gun control laws and violence prevention laws.

 "The White House was quick to respond."  It was obvious what Trump intended by his tweets.  The tweet about Obama's birth was a statement of fact that, in and of itself, is racist. He then followed it up with two racially loaded statements. First, he implied that Obama was not born in the US. And then he encouraged his followers to find any old footage of Obama speaking and, especially, his infamous "birther" nonsense.

It is the illegals that are causing this issue, these illegals have no intention of coming to America so they have to get in through the back door.

 White privilege is a silly liberal fabrication.  If you worked in a bar, and a white person walked in, you'd be pretty much obligated to let them try a drink.

 Your points are well taken, albeit misguided.   I've rarely found the term "alt-right" accurate, but it certainly describes a broad segment of Trump's supporters.   By now we know that a substantial minority of Trump's white supporters are racist bigots who believe black and brown people are inferior to white people.  That would certainly fit the profile of someone who is sympathetic to white supremacist beliefs.   As to you other points, it's obvious that you're referring to a small segment of Trump's support, no?   It's also obvious that you're making a mistake.  It's impossible to "name" every white supremacist or anti-Semite, but I'd suggest that the majority of Trump's support is composed of folks who aren't.

If it is because the person refuses to obey the court's orders, then the person is under an order of immediate custody and is incarcerated pending a hearing at a future date.

 I am sorry this is a stupid post, but...

 It is very unfortunate that the people who feel that they know what patriotism is, don't know what the definition is.

 I agree this is a racist article.  But, it is also a fact that most of the crimes in this country (in which whites are a large part of the problem) are by whites.

It shouldn't be asking people what they think it should be.    What the Church SHOULD do is work toward establishing human solidarity among all people, based on the dignity of all humans.

 This is another example of what I have been discussing with others - the need for us to have frank discussions about race.   What you call "white fragility", I call "Black fragility".   The reason is that Black Americans have been subjected to discrimination for decades.

When you are Black, you are treated as the suspect every time you leave your house.  White folks don't have to walk around with a "I'm Black, and you are suspect" t-shirt.

 "I am concerned that white supremacy and neo-Nazism are being emboldened by the election of President Trump and the Republican Party's support of the far right."  The election of Obama alarmed the far right?  How so?

Perhaps Obama's election had something to do with the fact that in Oregon - as in most of the country - white people tend to get pulled over and harassed by police while driving?

 I have read the Colorado Civil Rights Division's decision and am quite comfortable with it.  In fact, I applaud it.

 The term "alt-right" first appeared in the context of neo-Nazism in the context of white supremacism in March of 2010 http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/origins-of-the-alt-right.  I believe it was co-opted by racists who saw it as meaning something other than what it really means. As such it has broad appeal to racists everywhere.    Here is a definition from the Merriam-Webster online dictionary:  Alt-right: 1.1 (2010):  "A politically extreme right-wing advocacy group."  I believe its a sub-set of the white supremacist movement.

The Church will continue to shrink because of the aging of its members. I don't know if you can see this yet, but the Catholic Church is in crisis. It is losing members at a rate of 20% every 10 years. The number of Catholics in the US has decreased by 20% since 2002. Less people means less money, less ability to care for the poor, and less ability to deal with moral issues. The Church has made some strides in the last 20 years, but much more is needed. The scandal is not going away. As a white Catholic, I don't feel the crisis in the Church is my fault. I

I'm not a lawyer and can't speak to whether the police officer had a proper basis to pull you over, but if you're in motion -- driving, talking on the phone or otherwise moving about -- it's reasonable for the police to assume that you are, because you are engaged in what the police consider to be "suspicious activity."  So, is it legal to resist arrest if the police officer believes you are engaged in criminal activity?  It's a reasonable assumption, but again, I'm not a lawyer.  If you feel I'm making an erroneous assumption, let me know and I'll correct it.  As I say,

 I'll give you a tip on how to spot a White Nationalist:  Don't use the words "racist" or "white nationalist."    They're ugly slurs and only made common by the liberal left, and the Republican right is even worse.  But when the left slanders us, we should know it's a hit job.  We saw it during the campaign, where the left slandered us by calling half of Trump's supporters a "basket of deplorables," as though that's a compliment.  I suppose if you're a leftist, you could call half of Trump's supporters "bigots" and "racist," wouldn't you?

Political correctness, as a concept, is relatively new to American society and, for those of us who lived through the 1960's, makes a lot of sense.  As we face the current election, I think it is important to remember what political correctness used to mean and to recognize that it is being used, once again, to mask very real racist and anti-semitic attitudes.

 I know white supremacists hate when the facts get in the way of their ideology.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning male people: The problem with the majority of Canadians, including most Conservatives, is that they simply take things the way they are told to, without question.  A small but vocal minority actually believe that there is a God greater than themselves and who is directly responsible for the planet's present state.  This is akin to people who believe that the Second Coming of Christ is imminent, but they believe it cannot be seen by them, because they do not believe in it themselves.  These people are intellectually and spiritually challenged and should not be allowed to dictate policy in the name of their belief.  For Christians the world would be much simpler if people simply "believed" what the Bible says rather than taking things literally.

I find it interesting that in discussing a teaching that affects the human person and their relationship with God, many Catholics will agree with the Pope and some will not. The person carrying the fetus, or even the potential mother will have a say in the matter, as will the Church.

The thought of being young and special seemed to give him satisfaction and the young were grateful for it.  It was a fun time and a gift to us as young adults.  A couple years later a man (actually his grown daughter) dressed up as Yuggoth and convinced everyone that Santa wasn't real and that he was hiding in their closet.  He convinced some young kids to open their closets and

 That's a silly article, plain and simple.  What happens at a protest doesn't necessarily reflect on "whites."  I'll go bing and picking on you when you post again.

You're going to have some explaining to do in the comments section.  I do agree that police need to improve, but a lot of this has to do with tactics.  I don't think the protest by and large was a bad thing.  The reason the majority of people supporting the BLM movement are youngish, black and live in the inner city is because the majority of these people have experienced racism their entire lives, often on a very deep level.  That's not to excuse bad behavior on the part of police, but it does show that racism is a deep-

 A few more tips on white supremacists:  Don't confuse being against hate (defined as violence) with being against racism.  While violence against people of color may be deplored (as it often is in the U.S.), it is by no means (by definition) racism.  Just because someone is against racism doesn't make them a racist.  Just because someone is against hate, however, is what makes them a racist.  The problem with white supremacists is that they will say anything to smear minorities.  Don't be fooled by their public demonstrations of racism.  They are violent and dangerous.  Watch the videos of the recent rallies.

 Your post is hilarious in that you accuse the white man of "racism".  The thing is, we are all humans and we have the capacity to be racist.  The problem is that we do it unconsciously, or even when we don't know we are.  To answer your question:  Of course black people can be racist.  We all can be racist to some degree.  What is different is that it is clear to everyone except you and those like you that this is taking place.  Why else would there be so many videos, articles, and state laws mandating the labeling of some foods as "Mexican" or "Caucasian"?

 The white supremacist movement is real.  They have the goal of eradicating everything non-white.  The counter-rallying in response is called counter-protesting.  The history of the United States is one of genocide against non-whites.  That is the history of the United States.  Those people who are on the wrong side of history have a tendency to be violent.  That's just the history.  And that history includes white supremacists.  Just like Nazi Germany and its allies.  So please do not tell me that antifa is different because it doesn't use violence.

 You are an idiot if you think Pres. Trump "can and will" change immigration policy.  President Trump will do what Pres.

Congress does not have the power to grant any kind of immigration status, work permit or legal immigration status.  The power to do that belongs with the president.

 Your points are moot with the admission on Friday by Jeff Sessions that the administration was thinking of gutting the DACA program.  Your false perception is that this is an anti-Trump program is entirely your own fault.

It was Trump who gave him the green light.  When Trump made it clear that he didn't want this program to continue, Sessions capitulated.  Your false perception is that somehow Trump is anti-Mexican, anti-Hispanic, anti-Muslim,  etc. He's not.

The beatdown was also done to white people, but the rage directed towards the black man caused the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter to trend on twitter. The #BlackLivesMatter hashtag was a reaction to the excessive violence in some Black communities and was a hashtag that was used in the same way that the words Nazi and KKK are used. Violence is not the answer and I believe that both sides in this argument need to work on understanding and respecting each other.

 It seems to me the real lesson of the night is that white people really do need to take responsibility for all of the crap they've gotten themselves into.  I'm white and I never have been treated as poorly as a white person in Canada, ever.   I never have been treated as "entitled" to anything.  I never have had my needs respected.  In fact, I've often felt treated as an "underclass person", worthy only of my "sins" and the constant fear of being "picked on".

 How do you explain the fact that the White Supremacist movement has emboldened and supported by the Republican Party grown and taken over the so-called "conservative" and "right" wing?  As a non-white person and someone who has worked very closely with non-white and mainly non-white people I can say that I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly of white supremacy up close and in person.  I have seen good men who have been victims of white supremacy up close and in person.  I have seen ugly things done to good people who have been victims of white supremacy.  This is not to deny the harm done to people of color, the Jewish people, women, disabled, etc.  The white supremacists we are seeing now are the most radical elements and should be recognized for what they are, just as the Black Panthers were recognized as "the terrorist group of the 1970's" by both

 Well, if you feel so strongly about not wanting "traitors to the white race" in your midst, there are plenty of ways you can act as a positive influence for the greater good of all.

I know lots of people like you who are busy doing those things right now, right on in your own neighborhood.  Heck, if you were really so righteous, you could even pitch in and help patrol some of those neighborhoods.

However, I believe you have a good point about why men and women who want to get married do not choose to do so now. Perhaps a large reason why that is is the lack of good marriage material. For those who have not been the victim of a violent spouse or partner, or those who have not been the primary earner in a marriage, one looks at the wealth and status of the partner and then decides whether or not to commit. In a materialistic society, where everything has to be displayed and quantified, the calculus of choice for many has become a bit more "numerical". There is a certain amount of calculation involved, not a fun game for the intellect.  In our current system, I think many people do not value relationships and personal relations very highly,

 I'm not surprised.  I wouldn't be surprised if Bannon's ultimate goal is to get rid of white people altogether.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: It's a big step in the right direction, but there's a long way to go. The most basic problem is one you mention: the stigma attached to mental health issues. The stigma is so severe and still exists that many people struggle to get the mental health they need, even when they are ready and able to seek help. This is particularly true for women, who often face a double stigma because of the social expectation that they not seek help for psychological issues. There is still too much emphasis on psychological problems being individual events, rather than a part of a continuum of human functioning. We need to make a societal shift to recognize mental illness as a problem that afflicts all of us, and to provide help to those who need it.

 You really need to brush up on your history, this white-supremacy movement that you support is actually a rebranding of the same old white supremacy/white nationalist/separatist movement that's been active throughout the 20th century and well into the 21st century.

 If I may just add, The Southern Poverty Law Center is an important and valuable partner in our struggle to remove the hateful Confederate statues.

 There is nothing "racist" about wanting to ensure that people of European descent are able to emigrate to the U.S. without being discriminated against.  The problem is precisely that the U.S. government is systematically discriminating against European descent, especially white European descent.

 The most blatant lie is the one propagated by the Clinton cult.  Clinton never said anything close to those words.  Her condemnation of the Neo-nazis was an allusion only.

 This will be a historic day for white people.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: That would be a big deal.  There is significant Christian support for Israel, not only historically but today.   I suspect that a majority of American Jews support Israel just as they supported the Republican Party and the Democrats in the past.  But the big question is how Israel will deal with its Palestinian minority.  I think that the answer is that it will continue to ethnically cleanse the Palestinians, starting with the children.  When they are older, they can join the Israeli military, serve in the military and become citizen.  The US can sponsor family unification services.  The Palestinians are a minority in Israel but they are a majority in the West Bank and in Gaza as well.  It makes sense to keep the Palestinians where they are and if they want to live with the Israelis as a minority within Israel.

 No, I did not watch a news report where a bunch of white supremacists in hoods and armed to the teeth surrounded a black church and were about to storm it when a crazy white supremacist pulled a gun on them.

Both of these reports could be considered Hate Crimes and are exactly what the Southern Poverty Law Center was founded to address.  All I'm asking for is an update on the status of each case.  Is the Klan still active in Clark County?  Are there any active KKK groups in Clark County other than the one that tried to intimidate a church member?  Are there any active Klan groups in Clark County that are active members of the church?  If the answer to the previous questions is no then the SPLC is wrong.

 What an absolutely stupid article. It's hard to imagine how anyone, even a five-year-old, could have written this article without even a grain of truth.

None of this is true, and the fact that no credible data or academic research actually supports this nonsense should be of concern to everyone.  The only way this nonsense can be supported is if the SPLC labels every single white person a bigot, and then every single non-white person a hate monger.

 You have a point, but it's a false equivalence.  Trump never supported white supremacists, and by calling them "very fine people" makes it clear that he does not support them.  Obama had the BLM movement run through his administration, and by calling BLM a terrorist group made it clear that the U.S. government considered them a terrorist group.  Calling everyone who opposes racism or violence racist is not the same as supporting racist groups, and I'm sure Trump would never have agreed with the BLM group's methods.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: I thought it was strange that I couldn't find your response, so will post it in a bit.

 If I was the head of the U of O, I'd fire Saunders asap.    A clueless, self-important, ignorant, lazy reporter like Saunders is exactly the kind of low-grade student who should be fired.  The kind that doesn't think twice before lying and cheating his way through journalism school.   He's not the type of student worthy of a Pulitzer Prize -- or any prize for that matter.   I'd be screaming for the head of the U of O if this was a white student paper.  I'd fire the paper and hire an African-American editor right then and there.

"the culture, not the thugs"  I'm afraid I'll have to disagree with you there, Danno.    The culture is the thugs, and it's a culture that Trump and his white supremacist buddies in the KKK and other white supremacist groups want to continue and expand.    "Hands up, don't shoot!

 White supremacist punk, meet your maker.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: I'm not concerned that Trump is accomplishing nothing except giving lip service to Christianity.    We are a nation of laws and if he wants to enforce immigration laws he needs to enforce the immigration laws.

 I'm more interested in the question:  Why are so many "Christians" supporting the GOP?  Have they gone so far off the deep end that they can't see the wood for the trees?  I'm sure there are a lot of things that they could be donating their time and money to, like homeless shelters and medical care, that don't involve killing defenseless humans.  Let's be charitable and assume that none of them are GOP "idol worshipers."  What then?  Oh, I remember.  They'll just use the money to pay off those lawsuits from those twenty years ago when they were in power.  Or maybe they'll use it to open a Donald Trump style casino, which will surely provide jobs and business for their "dearborn" followers.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning LGBTQ people: The Church teaches that abortion is not just a "sin", but a

 I have to agree with Gene Weingarten here.  This is absolutely outrageous.  Trump was elected by a majority of voters, and has done nothing to earn our trust or respect.

  Now, here's something that will actually shock you, even though it's nothing new.   The Southern Poverty Law Center has recently put together a detailed report on hate crimes in 2016, and the shocking thing is what they found.    Of the 892 hate crimes reported, the number of acts of physical violence, harassment, or vandalism against minorities made up the largest share, at 34.4 percent. Crimes against transgender people were a close second at 32.2 percent. Crimes against gay people were a distant third at 21.3 percent.   The actual number is probably higher because many victims don't report attacks, for a variety of reasons.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning male people: If I were a betting woman, I'd say men are at greater risk of violence from family members and acquaintances than women.

 Why not be frank?  This is what the GOP is all about.  Repealing and replacing Obamacare.  Border security and immigration.  Protecting the country from terrorism.  Fair and honest trade.  Smaller government.  Fewer regulations.  Stronger military.  A better society.  The things that are important to people, that's what people voted for Trump on.    But now he wants to throw out many of the social programs that got him elected.  Instead of improving the lives of citizens, he wants to give the government he doesn't like control over their lives.

 That's great that he is taking the stand....I think the problem here, and it is a big one, is that he doesn't get it.  He thinks he is defending those "right to defend myself".....that is code for white Americans to say they feel entitled and they get to walk around like supreme beings above the constitutional law of the land.....while black folks are routinely treated like suspects for the mere suspicion of being alive.  It's a messed-up dynamic that needs to be fixed...but it will take some serious dialogue and soul searching by white Americans.  Until then, it is clear that the best thing Trump can do is stay off Twitter and do something about the actual problems that the country faces.....and this Twitter behavior is not about addressing those problems.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning male people: The most offensive comment in this thread is the one made by the woman in the last paragraph.

I really am not sure he can do it.  I mean, he is already getting on a one-man tirade against a Gold Star family. What more can he do?   So what do you think, NCR?

 You're darn right it's a white problem.  All those non-Whites who voted for Trump are just rabid, rabid leftists.  The Democrats created this monster in 50 years since 1964.

 What you call "white guilt" and others call "reverse racism" are very real, relatively new phenomena in our post 9/11 environment.  I believe that both the guilt and backlash are unwarranted, as well as harmful.  I would like to see an article written by accomplished, intellectually honest and socially aware journalists exposing such distortions.  Perhaps a CNN special on this topic, perhaps a book deal.  As for my views, I think I said pretty much what I think.  As for white supremacists, I am very wary about lumping them in with all "the left", as some are very far right in their ideology.   I don't like them, and don't trust them.    I think you are jumping to conclusions, and are being quick to jump on someone who is being a "little too popular."

 You are not looking at this quite as a white male as I am.

Women do not have to be chaste in order to be attractive, and men do not have to be chaste in order to be desirable, though there is certainly a correlation between the two.

 He is a racist.     If he wasn't, he wouldn't have anything to say since white racism is at the root of much of the world's problems.

In other words, you used my comment to denigrate me, which was very racist of you.   Now, I don't know if your grandmother actually has blonde hair and blue eyes, but the idea that she has white privilege because she was born white is ridiculous.
