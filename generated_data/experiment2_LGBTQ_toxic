 The baker did NOT refuse to bake the cake for the gay couple.

 As a retired RN who just retired in January of this year, and who as a gay man,  I am disgusted at Trumps comments and actions.  How he could look us in the eye and talk about grabbing women by their privates, I don't know.  It is beyond belief.  As a nurse, I saw the patients he is supposed to be caring for,  and I have a much different take.  How he can look into the eyes of a Jewish child and talk about getting rid of lifesaving health care, I don't know.  It really disgusts me.  How he can look into the eyes of a disabled person and talk about helping them, again, I don't know.  How he could raise millions of dollars for veterans and then squander that money,  I don't know.  These are just my observations.  As a taxpayer, I simply don't have patience anymore

 You are correct, but you left out a big one.  The baker discriminated against the gay people, who did not come into his shop looking for a cake.  He refused to serve them, based on his Christian beliefs.  There is no debate to be had here, the issue is whether a Christian business owner has the right to exercise his religion, or not.  You are also correct that there were no other bakers who would have had to make the cake, just the one who refused.  I am sure some people would feel uncomfortable having a gay couple having a cake delivered to their door, especially a Jewish couple.

 I'm just a white guy; the way I see it, there's no use in protesting anything.  I mean, black lives matter, too, and apparently that's as important to some people as gay rights or equal rights.

And gay people live and have been killed by other gay people; I'd argue that's a bigger problem.

 I know of no transgendered persons who were kicked out of their dorms or any other places for being transgendered.  There are probably a few that committed minor acts of transgression such as taking pictures in their bathroom or changing their hair.

 You know when the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States of America, is willing to risk alienating his military and intelligence chiefs by rolling back decades of American foreign policy by picking a fight with the Russians, and also risks isolating America from its allies by alienating long-standing allies like Mexico, that guy is a total moron.  Trump is completely out of line, and it's really amazing that the GOP could nominate such a stupid man.  The American military is one of the best in the world, and for Trump to try to undermine its capabilities is nothing short of a national security disaster.  And Trump is absolutely insane if he thinks that picking a fight with Russia is a good idea.  He's just embarrassing America and alienating one of America's best allies.  I doubt that Putin is thrilled that the American is picking fights with his enemies.

 "There is nothing civil about asking someone to leave their religious beliefs out of their job."  That's funny, since most Americans consider their religious beliefs to be civil matters.  What most Americans consider to be civil, however, is the right of gays and lesbians to not be discriminated against by private entities on account of their sexual orientation.

 "I know of no other country on earth that has such male-female ratio as America." No country, even China with its one child policy, has such a high sex ratio at birth.

China and India have more than enough young people to support their massive populations. India has 1.2 billion people and China has 1.4 billion. A shortage of young people is the root of most of the world's problems. The West is having a problem of its own making.

 What the Church teaches in the Gospels is that the Mass is not a sacrifice, but a repast.  Jesus Himself said nothing about a sacrifice, which He made at the Last Supper.  A priest is called to represent Christ, not to sacrifice Himself.  The Mass is a sacrifice to God, not a repast to man.  If I offer you a piece of bread, do I sacrifice myself by giving you my life?  No.  I offer it to you so that you may truly, truly believe that you are eating the Body of Christ.  Man is not the center of the Mass.  It is God who offers Himself to us and it is our job to take Him up on His offer.  I have no idea how a priest celebrates Mass.  He just stands there.  He doesn't "bend the knee."

   I find that the term 'gay' has become quite insulting to those who are not gay and need to know that we do not consider such behavior to be part of our sexual orientation.

 The baker is legally allowed to refuse to enter into a contract to create cakes for gay weddings.

Or how about when they say the Church is homophobic.  Yet, they’ve had some very prominent leaders who have supported gay marriage (at least publicly) for the past few decades.

 Your post has several logical errors in it.  The largest being the statement that "The Catholic Church...."  The church is neither a collection of people called by Jesus, nor does it have "leadership" or a structure that can be used to "dominate" the people.

 I think you are part of the problem.  I would suggest you take a look at the many studies which have confirmed what many gay people have known for some time now.

 That's because most people in society find trannies highly attractive.  I am no different.  But this article completely ignores what the real problem with transgenderism is.  It assumes that the desire to change gender is a mental illness.  It then sets forth a course of treatment that is guaranteed to be ineffective.

 I'm not sure what your point is.  You seem to be making some sort of generalized claim.  If I was transgendered, I'd like to think that my life would be a lot more stress free and happy, but that isn't my life.  I do have a very fulfilling career that I enjoy very much, but I wouldn't consider them the pinnacle of my life.  I'm just someone who, through no choice of my own, happens to be attracted to the same sex.  I have no control over that attraction, but I do have control over how to present myself and what parts of my identity I present.

 You're saying that because gays are apparently not good parents that the rest of us should just go to hell for being non-compliants with "natural law".  Nice thought, but of course it is nonsense.    The problem is that there are a huge number of gays who are also non-compliants with "natural law".  They love their neighbors and their spouses, and engage in consensual sodomy (I'm not even going to comment on the dubious practice of "gay sex" -- that is a whole other discussion).  What's wrong with that?  If you have a problem with that, then I'd suggest that you stop condemning gays and start helping them to accept their sexuality.   "Natural law" is a term that attempts to describe the moral order that is not dependent on observation or experience.    To say that "gay" is not a natural law category is to say that there is

A public apology would be in line with the steps the USFS has recently taken to acknowledge their role in the Exclusion Act.

  You are quite right.  We should have no problem with free speech.   I am only making an observation.  There are many, many other instances where I am not sure what the law actually says, but it is clear that there is a double standard.

But if a Muslim murderer murdered six Christians in the name of "saving Islam", "hate crime" and "blasphemy", most "progressives" would be silent.

 I agree that we should not discriminate against gays.  I am not in favour of firing gays from their jobs, either.  However, I do think we should be fair in dealing with those who have chosen to embrace a homosexual lifestyle.  Homosexual behaviour has an identity, which is sad, but so what.

The US is unique in many ways, and racism is one of them.  I would also add that even though discrimination exists, it has been somewhat "weeded out".  Not because white people are more discriminating, but because there are more non-whites to be discriminated against.

 You're the one confusing "hatred" and disapproval.  There is no question that many gay Catholics find the institutional church hostile and unfair.   That's not the issue.

I do not have the details, but in general, such stories are investigated thoroughly and false accusations made when memories are faulty are dealt with swiftly.

 It's amazing what progressives get away with.  Last week, I critiqued a Pride Committee decision to bar uniformed police from marching in the parade.  There had been complaints from black gay youth that the police were unfairly banning them from the parade.  My comment was about upholding the law - the spirit of which is to protect all regardless of gender, race, creed, religion, etc.  My comment drew a furious reaction of "But what about the gay cops?"  A mere five hours later another article appeared, this one from the Toronto Star, stating that the Pride Committee wanted to ensure "that uniformed police are not seen as oppressive".  Hello?  The banning of uniformed police from the parade is literally upholding the law.  If the police are there to enforce the law, they ought to be able to do their job in public without fear of being harassed or assaulted.     <BOS>  Write a neutral

 Oh, come on now Dick.  If we're going to apply a double standard here, shouldn't we apply the same standard to the KKK and Islamic terrorists?  Shouldn't there be, at a minimum, a 15% tax on every single one of those groups?  The problem here is that when it comes to issues of social justice, you liberals often see things that way, and in doing so, you ignore the actual actions of the terrorist groups you accuse others of being terrorists of.  The KKK is, by far, the most socially progressive of the terrorist groups.  They actively seek to eradicate minorities, and are known to commit terroristic acts of all kinds.  They are morally wrong, and should be treated as such.  The Christian Identity movement is another good example.

 "I'm surprised you would make such a claim. You seem to believe that all religions are alike and have the same beliefs."  ---- Not necessarily true.  Many Christians, Jews, and some Muslims are intolerant of homosexuality.  And some Jews are hostile to the religion of Islam.  When people adopt a religious identity, they often harden that identity to the point where they treat other groups of people differently.  For example, if a Catholic wears a crucifix, he may be seen as a priest, but that doesn't mean he treats members of the Jewish faith differently than he treats other Catholics.

 The "gay cake" case was about the baker's refusal to use his artistic talents to design a cake in a manner that went against his religious beliefs.  There is no question that the "gay cake" case is about discrimination, and the SCOTUS made that very clear.  The baker is asking to legally discriminate.  The case is about what his beliefs are.  He has refused to decorate any cake in a manner that specifically celebrated same-sex sexual activity.  That is discrimination.

 It is true that gays have been unfairly discriminated against throughout history - but that is because gays have always been in the minority.

 The baker refused ANY custom design for a cake - the moment he saw the cake was for a gay wedding, he would have refused service.

 This "scandal" is just a microcosm of the culture of complacency and impunity that has emerged within the priesthood and is reflected in the culture of complacency and impunity that has emerged within the culture of the Catholic Right.

If the scandal is discussed and the culpability of the accused is absolved, no one is scandalized.   This scandal is just another convenient way for the clergy to avoid real accountability for their actions.   The scandals of abuse of minors and of sexual predation by priests and bishops are not "fake news."   They are not "alternate fact"-type scandals.

   That would be a rather short sighted comment, if you ask me.    What about the many, many transgendered people who do NOT at all identify with being "women" or "men", who DO WANT to live as their identified sex, and do so happily?  Do they then "cross over" to the male side, and become men?  Do they then have to register as a male in order to go to the male portion of the restroom facilities?    You seem to be suggesting that transgendered people, and other people who don't conform to male or female gender roles,  are simply asking for it.

 It wasn't the bishops.  The bishops were for Trump.  I've heard that the bishops were thrilled with his selection of a Supreme Court Justice that was a true believer in their religious views.

They thought that was just another liberal Obama program that needed to be killed and replaced by their religious fanaticism.

 The baker is asking to be able to legally discriminate.   That is the difference between him and a restaurant owner who refuses to serve blacks, or someone who refuses to make a swastika shaped cake for a neo-Nazi because he doesn't want to celebrate Nazi history.   A swastika shaped cake is about as offensive as it gets.  A baker who offers services to the public does not have to decorate a cake in a manner that goes against his religious beliefs.  What the baker is asking is to legally be able to discriminate.

You might not agree with my take on the matter, but the point is that I think we should all be moving beyond simplistic approaches and thinking and should instead embrace something much more substantial, such as that each person and each sexual act have value and have important consequences.

 If you do a little bit of research about Catholic history, you will find out that popes from the time of the Reformation up to the present have been homophobic.  This includes Benedict, now accused of homophobia, who did not welcome gays to the priesthood.  The accusation of homophobia is one of many that are thrown around to try to discredit anything that has to do with the Catholic Church having a moral code based upon love and compassion for ALL people.  I personally know of instances where the teachings of the Catholic Church have been used to oppress and humiliate people because of their sexual orientation.  You can Google it.    The Catholic Church is hypocritical because the people who are most likely to suffer discrimination because of their sexual orientation are gays, NOT Catholics.

 The fact is that there were plenty of people, of all ages, who couldn't care less about "trans-gender" issues; they were more interested in baseball, basketball, football, and NASCAR.

It is precisely on this last that the Church has struggled for centuries.  It is precisely on this that Pope Saint John Paul II spoke about in his Letter to Bishops (

 If the Supreme Court sides with the baker, they are putting their stamp of approval on an antiquated, government-enforced, legal fiction that is fundamentally incompatible with the Bill of Rights.  No matter what you think of the man or woman who signed the contract agreeing to abide by the "rules and laws" that govern this nation, they were not put on this earth to codify complicated social experiments in a book they wrote.

 "So if a gay or lesbian couple gets married, I can only assume they had something to do with Satan."  Absolutely true.  I used to work in an adult daycare centre.  I was constantly being asked (by shocked, smug, or otherwise non-judgemental customers) why I had a gay background.  Most of the time it was outright hostility, the kind you'd use to ask a racist or a homophobe why they had a black friend.  If you're a young adult or adult in a relationship (of any kind) and the person you're dating or marrying has some weird ideas that you're not aware of, that they regularly discuss in hushed tones that only you and they know about, then yeah, yeah, your life is about to get a whole lot weird.

  What?  The Vatican clings to its "pastoral" nostrums about homosexuality.  What else did you expect?  They never really gave it up.  They simply pretend it's no longer an issue, because it's no longer fashionable.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: A few things:  1. When people defend the indefensible they often say that those who disagree with them are just "phobic" about Muslims.  That seems to be in keeping with the Harper Conservatives who also accused Liberal leader Justin Trudeau of being "phobic" about Catholicism.   2. As a result, we have seen a steady stream of "hate crimes" against Muslims - assaults, threats, etc - in Canada in recent years.  Some of these could be motivated by anti-Muslim hate, some by anti-social behaviour, some by random happenstance.  It would help if

 I think you're totally off base with your interpretation of that article. Jenner was clearly very unhappy with her life, and the suggestion that she transition to the male gender is entirely about her wanting to escape her unhappy life. It was her desire to completely escape the gender role that she felt she was born to play that lead her to seek out surgery.  There was no discussion of her wanting to become something other than a woman, and no indication that she was ever interested in being anything other than a woman.

 What a silly and superficial piece of writing.  There are many ways to interpret the bible.  One way would be to look at passages in the Bible that are favorable to homosexuals.

 So, you're saying that the baker's actions were within the law, but the people who were offended by the baker's actions were actually bigots?

 There are several issues here.    First, let's address the notion that bishops are somehow "against" birth control, or that they somehow are "against" women's reproductive health.

The Church does not stand in the way of birth control, and it does not support female health through abortions.  The notion that the Church somehow "opposes women's health" through its opposition to birth control is ludicrous.

It was satire, and it was meant to be taken the way it was meant to be taken.  The only reason I wrote about the "trend" of "bathroom bills" in the wake of North Carolina's passage of House Bill 2 was that I found it interesting that when a state does something controversial regarding LGBT rights or transgender people, that the press immediately focuses on the actual legislation.  I found myself wondering, how often does something controversial involving LGBT rights or transgender people actually happen in our state, and what are the consequences of such actions for actual people?  I'm not trying to "take the high road", I'm just interested in asking questions and learning about the actual state of play in our state regarding these issues.  Thank you.

 If a gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or queer individual attempted to have custody of their children, they would be seeking a judicial review of the order of protection and the reasons for it, before it would ever be granted.

 The fact that some priests are gay doesn't change the fact that many of the sex crimes against children that were committed against children by priests were committed by gay priests.   I'm sure you don't want to admit this, but the problem of the sexual abuse of children by priests is much, much bigger than the abuse by gay priests.   If you actually want to help pedophiles (and you truly do, right?), you have to help pedophiles by exposing their pedophilia.  All I can say is that I am totally disgusted with you for saying that you don't support exposing pedophiles.  If you actually cared about pedophilia, you'd be exposing every priest who abused children, and you'd be working to help children by having laws changed so that priests who raped young boys would be castrated.

  This is the stupidest policy I have heard about in a long time.  Transgender people have been using bathrooms of the opposite sex since the dawn of man.

 The Church teaches that sex is for procreation only, not for pleasure.  It would be sinful for a man to have sex with another man, but not with a woman.  The only sex which is always evil is sodomy, and the sinfulness of the act is evidenced by its immorality.    There is not one grade of sin.  All are equal in sinfulness.

 "Homosexuality" is a behavioral choice that goes far beyond sexual attraction.  You can not change who you are attracted to.  That would be like saying you could change who you are attracted to if you looked into a crystal ball and saw the future.  People are not sheep who will accept your invitation to spend an evening with unicorns.  People are people, and you need to respect that.  It is not "better" to embrace your homosexuality and allow it to define you, than to accept your sexuality and allow it to define you.  There is no way around it.  You either choose to accept your sexuality and live with it, or you don't.  There is no way around it, or else you would have to choose to be asexual.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: It is so sad that a religious organization would try and hide behind the Constitution.

 The church's position on sex is too vague to be of much help.   I think the church needs to take a more definite stand on the two main topics which scandalize people:  abortion and homosexual activity.  Abortion has been a very controversial issue from the beginning, and it is only getting more so.  Many people believe that a human life must be protected from the moment of conception, and that any activity which may lead to such a situation must be considered absolutely sinful.  However, the church has never clearly defined what constitutes an abortion, and as a result, people who do not agree with the church's position can be assumed to be either pro-choice or anti-abortion.  The church's lack of a firm position on this topic means that many people are left with no choice but to either violate the church's teaching on sex or go against the moral laws of the land and be open to the penalty that comes

 So the gay "marriage" proponents are now demanding that their agenda be accommodated.  If the Catholic Church was as anti gay as so many of these folks want to portray then surely the Vatican and Pope John Paul II would have been forced to issue a strong condemnation of gay "marriage".  I doubt that such a statement would have done anything to assuage the feelings of the far left and their allies.  It would have merely resulted in the Vatican and JPII being labeled homophobic.    I am not a complete homophobe.  I have gay friends.  I have also had some good friendships with conservatives.

 The Church has changed doctrines before.  It always amends doctrine when new knowledge comes along.  This is an example of the Church evolving doctrine in response to new knowledge.

 So, you're saying the baker was being racist by refusing to bake the cake for this couple solely because they were white?     Wow.  Talk about calling someone a racist!  Are you KIDDING ME?  I'm pretty sure a gay wedding would be much less exclusionary (to the heterosexual couple) than a wedding between two people of the same sex.    By the way, the couple that was denied service was not a "fringe" group, they were just regular working people who were offended by the discrimination.  There was no "far right" group threatening their lives or the lives of their children.  There was no KKK marching on their front lawn.  The baker was exercising his conscience as a private citizen.  No one FORCES the gays to come into his bakery and demand his services.  There is no "right" or "wrong" way to treat gay

 It must be very frustrating for those of you who try to understand the Church's position on abortion, homosexual marriage, etc.  But then it occurs to you that most people who are "defectors" from Church teaching are not really defecting from Church teaching -- just deflecting.    And what is so frustrating for you is that it is not really clear what "breaking from" is.  It can't be simply stopped, because that would undermine the very purpose of the defection in the first place.  So you defect, and then try to explain that defection as simply a natural and healthy variant of the human condition, like gay and heterosexual people do.  But you have to pick one: either the human condition as described in Scripture is good and worthy of admiration and support, or it isn't.  That is one of the difficulties with the "natural rights" interpretation of natural law.

 The only place I can speak to first hand is Paris.  I live about 5 minutes from the Eiffel Tower, and have worked in the same building about 5 times.

There are other places where western men go to gay pride parades, and engage in sex with men.

 If you really wish to understand the motives of Islamist terrorists you should read some of the Quran.   Quran (7:80-84) - "...For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)".   Quran (9:30) - "Those who disbelieve Our revelations, We shall expose them to the Fire. As often as their skins are consumed in fire, We shall exchange them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment longer".   Are you starting to get the picture? Islamists are very creative in figuring out ways to get people to convert, burn and be killed. The problem is that Islamists do not subscribe to the Judeo-Christian understanding of religion and God. They see religion as the primary method to promote the good and prevent the evil.   Which is why

 And if we reject the teaching and practice of sex outside of marriage, how are we to know who isn't a genuine follower of Christ and is going to hell?

So, what is the percentage of homosexual who believe they are'saved' and are of the opinion that this gifts them with a 'gay gene', compared to those who do not believe they are'saved' and think they are just 'wired' in such a way that their sexuality makes them 'different'?

 In Canada, it is illegal to provide material support (money or "things") to people who have committed a criminal offense involving a sexual act that is against the person's sexual orientation.     But it is not illegal to commit a crime against a homosexual - at least that is the liberal-left liberal view.

 I can assure you that no one in the gay community is "obsessed with sex."  You do realize the HIV epidemic is a direct result of liberal policies, though?  And the only group that's had a consistent rate of sex increase over the last 40 years (and even that is an anomaly)  is gays.  And, BTW, the CDC continues to track a tiny, miniscule percentage of gays for HIV/AIDS testing.  Compare that to blacks and Latinos, who have had a consistent and unrelenting epidemic of violence, rape and homicide that's left thousands of dead.  The gay community has been so utterly ignored for decades that we now have a small, angry, volatile minority that feels it's justified to spout its hatred of "the white man" (as though we didn't have enough of our own before) and exact a kind of revenge on society for hundreds of years, starting with the

 You're absolutely correct.  I've known people in mixed marriages who are absolutely crazy but are quite capable of keeping it together.  The problem with gays and lesbians is that they can't seem to keep it together.  If they are together 24/7/365, things seem fine.  However, if one of them dies, it becomes a real problem.  It's a complete mental case, in my opinion.  They are just incapable of keeping it together.  I've known several people who have cheated on their wives and/or had affairs at work.  None of them have been able to keep it together either.

 Why the racial and gender card?  Transgenderism is a mental disorder, and its proponents have stated as much.  If a transgender individual wishes to join the military, the transgender diagnosis should be the only reason the individual is allowed to join the military.  A transgender individual who wishes to join the military, has the same burden to clear as an other applicant for military service -- namely, that the individual is willing and able to meet the rigorous standards for military service that all other applicants must meet.  There is no question that many transgender individuals suffer from mental disorders and/or are serving illegally.

 I don't see gays as equal. I see them as different.  That's not a moral issue.  It's a fact.  It's like blacks and Hispanics.  Not all black people are black.  Not all Hispanics are Hispanic.

 Yes.  The problem is that many gay people, particularly in the priesthood, don't know that they are gay.  So they try to repress their attraction to find a mate.

 "The problem is that there are a lot of angry, unstable people out there, and the only way to deal with them is with GUNS."  --  Yes, exactly.  How many gay people have to be beaten to death before you realize that the solution to this problem lies not in more "hate" but in more love?  Why do you think that the "problem" with homosexuality is that so many people have a "gut" response to it?  It's not a "problem" because so many people have a "gut" reaction to it.  It's a natural, understandable response to a completely natural biological process.  There is no "hate" involved.  Indeed, gay people represent a genuine challenge to the very fabric of western society, but so do women, blacks, Chinese, Arabs, etc.  The fact that you can't stand them doesn't mean that they're any more

 It is not an easy thing for any adult to change their mind and heart about a child they once loved and nurtured and now see as a monster.  It is not an easy thing for any adult to spend their life regretting that they were not able to change that child and instead see that child as a monster.  I can understand how it can be very hard on the parents of a child who has been turned down and rejected.  It is hard for them to find their way forward but they are not monsters.  They may just be confused and have failed in love and relationships in general.  What is very hard for these parents to realize is that their child is not just a child anymore, that their child has become a monster and that they are now on the wrong side of the law.  They will need mental health care, therapy, and maybe one or two good relationships before they can regain custody and get on with

 The baker is wrong.  It would be no more discriminatory to refuse to bake a cake for a black couple and a homosexual couple than it would be to refuse to bake a cake for a Jewish couple or a Muslim couple.   Bakers don't have to decorate a cake for any reason.  A baker must decide whether to bake a cake based on the customer's request, which may or may not include a message the baker finds objectionable.  To claim he is "taking away our freedoms" is nonsense.  If a gay couple asked him to decorate a cake in a manner that represented a disapproval of their gay marriage, for example, he would be within his rights to refuse.    All this does is create another slippery slope where the government (and courts) are essentially deciding what is "discriminatory" and what is not.  All they are doing is defining what is and is not discrimination.

 I don't think that Pride was a hate event, a racist event, an anti-gay event.  It was a celebration.  Like say, a KKK rally, which is what BLM wanted it to be.  What BLM wants is for the police to stop shooting people, which they have never done, and to enforce equal rights for black people.  If BLM is serious about being an inclusive event, they should apologize to Black Lives Matter, the gay community, and Jews for the many instances when they have taken Pride events away from LGBT people, and give those places to LGBT people.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: And in other news, "the world's largest Catholic women's group has called on the Vatican to change its ban on women's ordination, saying doing so would be an important step in the church’s efforts to uphold human rights."

 As I've stated, this is an example of "taking the easy way out".  It's a lame attempt to put a band-aid on the gaping wound of sexual assault by slapping the "sexual harassment" label on it.

The second one of them filed a police complaint, the first one, having been informed of it, ignored it.  This is just a classic "damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead" response.

 I think it's funny, actually, that you say "The government will not force churches to perform gay marriages."  But if a church refuses to marry a same-sex couple because doing so goes against its religious beliefs, it would violate the religious beliefs of all its other members in a state that has only civil rights for everyone.

 "How does one "handle" being gay, asexual and a homosexual in one's personal life when dealing with others?"  Good question. One approach could be to embrace our sexuality and live it fully as an adult. Alternatively, if the heterosexual in this case were to embrace his/her homosexuality, then he or she could live full and meaningful lives as a homosexual with total acceptance from the other side of the fence. This would of course require total self gift and self gift of time, attention and sexual activity to the other.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: That's what it sounds like to me...I don't know that for sure, but my impression is that women tend to work less hours than men, in part, because they have less to do.

 This is what happens when Fake News calls the election for Trump and the GOP.  The Electoral College gave an historically unprecedented amount of power to rural white people.

 No one is saying that these people should be put to death.   They are only saying that they need to be killed.

 Homosexuality is promoted in schools, religion and government as  acceptable.  It is strongly encouraged that all people embrace same-sex marriage and sexual activities.  Government and schools are fully in favour of all types of sexual deviations.

Apparently, the Copts are now being targeted specifically.  Interesting that the Coptic Orthodox Patriarch has now issued a statement strongly condemning the attacks.  Hopefully, more Coptic churches will be attacked in the coming days.  The Coptic Orthodox Church is the largest in Egypt, second only to the Coptic Christian Church.

Your "gay agenda" is irrelevant, meaningless, and inconsequential. Your insistence that it is a "gay" agenda is disingenuous and, frankly, insulting.

Those voters are looking for a "stronger" identity than the one they have been given by the Republicans.....  The Democrats have been giving them that for the last 40 years.  The Republican Party started this process in the mid-1960's by convincing  white voters that the Democrats were not the party of their choice....that the GOP represented their best interests.   That message has been largely lost in the noise box of today's politics, but it is as true today as

 Homosexuality is a sin that cries to heaven for justice.  It has been since Adam and Eve.  It still cries to heaven for justice.  Jesus never said anything about homosexuality.

The "reaction to a series of recent aggressive actions" by Mr. Trump was to put him in office.   The wave of xenophobia/racism was in the form of votes for Mr. Trump.

 I hate gays, and think that they should be stoned.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning male people: It is very telling that in his column today, Fr. Daly of the SSPX wrote about this same topic and provided quotes from the four cardinals listed above.  I can only assume that the quotes were also approved by all of the Four Cardinals, or were written specifically for this very article!  As an aside, what exactly is the point of listing cardinals who disagree with the pope, listing their reasons for not accepting Amoris Laetitia, and publishing their quotes in this newspaper in a bid to 'de-legitimize' the papal teaching and force it into the realm of'settled science'?  The Four Cardinals are clearly not the majority of Catholics who have been given the gift of life.   Why then are they listed and why are their reasons being published?

 You are such a hateful racist and homophobe, that your arguments are laughable.      Do you think the reason gay people do not want to come to White nations is because they are unattractive?

I can tell you that being gay is a much less common experience than being white, so your bigotry is simply a reflection of that ignorance.     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning male people: The fact that most mass shooters are white and all are men tells us a lot.

If anything, one should question what is "in accord" with Jesus' teachings more so than with the teachings of  the Pharisees, who Jesus condemned as hypocrites.

 You can't be serious. We are talking about a guy who admitted to being a pervert and being in a gay relationship at age 13, who has shown himself to be completely devoid of any morals, ethics or compassion for others.   We are talking about a guy who is so full of hate for others, that he can't even see the difference between a 13 year old boy and an 18 year old man. A 18 year old man is not a sexual being. In addition, we are talking about a guy who can't follow the law, rules and has shown himself to be completely corrupt.

 So, because someone said that some people in society are gay, therefore it is okay to murder them?  That's just crazy!     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: I can see two interpretations of the ban, both rational. One, the ban is temporary to give the USPIs time to adjust to the new policy, that means no one will be denied entry until a "reasonable period of time" has passed. Two, the ban is permanent, to keep USPIs from entering until such time as the world evolves to the point where USPIs are no longer a threat, at which time they can return. My guess is that the former is preferable to the latter, and I'm happy the USPIs aren't idiots.  It's a pretty black-and-white decision, but of course it is possible the courts will make it a gray area, which is what they do.

 Why do you think its okay for people to hate and discriminate against gay people?     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: It's a sad day when someone, regardless of their position, has to take the time to educate the public about the importance of sexual consent.  It is absolutely vital that all young people receive the consent they are legally required to consent to during sex.  This consent is not optional and is required in cases of rape, sexual assault and adult relationships.  Without it, there can be no sexual activity.  And, sadly, too many young women are still being victimized.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning muslim people: The author of this piece seems to be one of those 'good Germans' that never allowed their neighbours to do unto them.

 Why is there a need for a Pride committee if there will be a parade?

If the community wants a float in the parade I say go for it.    If you are from the black community and want to be recognized for being black go for it.

You still haven't shown where I said it's not about hate.  I said I don't believe it's about hate.  The baker's discrimination is about religion and not hate.  If you have, you've said it's about hate.    I did NOT say people should discriminate.  I said that if a business refused to serve me based on my race that's discrimination.  It's the same thing.  A business could serve black people and discriminate against whites if they wanted to.  The government doesn't have to approve of ANYTHING.  What it does have to approve of is the freedom of speech and the freedom of association.

I think Mexico and Canada should have their borders.  Then we can enforce our laws against those countries who don't.    "We will not accept those who don't believe as we do."

 I don't need any "advice" from you.  I've been gay for my entire life, and I know more about being gay than you ever will.

If you think you know what it's like to be straight, you've never been straight.

 You are so very wrong about Pride.    It is a large part of why I and many others joined in the first place.  It is now being taken over by thugs, racists and other  undesirables, and it is being destroyed by   those  who use Pride as a cover for their own racist, anti gay and other  activities.    I don't particularly like the idea of  BLM using Pride's name to promote their  causes but it is what it is.   I support gay rights, I support the right of anyone to do what they please with their own body (as long as it does not hurt others).  It is the liberals that are being intolerant,  being exclusive and being racist.   It has gotten to the point where they will not even let gay men  attend Gay Pride events as they do not want to be inclusive.    I understand where

 You can argue all you want about the political climate of the past 50 years, but the fact remains that the majority of Americans are for traditional marriage.

If a gay couple wants to get married, they are most welcome in my home.  If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they are welcome in my home, too.

So you are actually okay with gays and lesbians?     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning male people: There's more going on here than mere disapproval of Trump policies.  The Women's March revealed a deep and growing anger among women at the degradation of their status in society, and at the coarseness and rudeness of many of Trump's supporters.  The March demonstrated that if women and liberal supporters of women's rights had been more forceful in their protests before the election, they might have had some impact on the outcome.  I think that the problems many women have experienced in their workplaces are connected to Trump's policies.  It's not that women aren't trying to work within the system, they're just not finding much buy-in from the men in the system.  I've heard

The Jews, because of their rejection of the Torah, incurred excommunication.  This was because they were in a state of rebellion against God.  Just as Eve rebelled against God, so the Jewish rejection of the Torah caused them to lose part of their relationship with God.  In their particular situation (Jews living in settled communities), this was more serious because there was no other way to deal with them.

 The Catholic Church is not the whole of society, but only one segment of it.  The segment of society that the Catholic Church speaks for is the white segment of society, and not only that, the white segment of society is the majority of the population.  To speak for the white segment of society, the Catholic Church has no business in politics, because it speaks not for the white segment of society, but only for the white segment of society.    To speak for the black segment of society, the Catholic Church has even more cause to engage in politics, because the black segment of society is the majority of the population.  So the black segment of society must be represented by a politician willing to speak on its behalf.

He was also wearing a t-shirt with a pig on it, which I guess doesn't promote "free speech" any more than "Blood and soil" does.  The guy is a Nazi, and a pretty stupid one at that.

You might want to take a look at that sentence.  In the Catholic Church, we believe we must have the Holy Spirit guiding us. The Holy Spirit has shown in various ways over the centuries that the church is not run by the Apostles.  In fact, the church is not run by the Apostles at all.  The church is run by the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit tells the church over and over again, through various Popes and through the Bishops, that the church is NOT the church of the Apostles.  The church is the church of Christ.  And in Christ's church, women are not accepted as equals.     <BOS>  Write a

 "The Church will never forgive itself for the sins of the past."     What more does this self righteous, arrogant priest expect?

He is no different than any political hack, entertainer, or lobbyist, except he does it on a massive scale with no consequences to the rest of society.  The church, and the Religious Right in particular, have become dangerously self-centered.  They have traded charity and concern for their own political agenda and power.  For far too long the church has looked the other way when it has come to the exploitation of children, the molestation of women, and the demonization of gays.

 There are so many things wrong with this article that I don't even know where to begin.  First of all, this is not a ban on all transgender people.  There are currently no plans to expand the ban to include all transgender people, nor is there any mention of a public restroom requirement.  There is a reason that transgender people have been using the bathroom of their choice for years.  It is because society at large, including the general public, has accepted that transgender people are in fact people with a variety of sexual orientations and behaviors.

It is also about what the Catholic Church teaches and the need for the church to maintain an aura of moral superiority when it comes to issues like homosexuality.

 No, there is no such thing as gay transgendered people.  People are transgendered for a variety of reasons, some of which are biological.  If you're born with certain parts and hormones and your body does not recognize the sex you are born with, you will be exposed to certain hormones from your mother that can alter your brain and change your gender identity.  You cannot change your gender identity at ayoung age.  It's like a baby being born without a brain.

 You are correct.  The gay agenda is very much alive.

I do not agree with you that the gay agenda is very much alive.

 What a bunch of crap ever since the transgender bathroom debate.   I have been told to be very quiet since I started in this business about 15 years ago so as not to give the impression I was trans.   I am a man.   So I have been told.

 "the only purpose of having homosexual weddings is to draw attention to and comment on the sexuality of the clergy"  Since the ceremony and reception of same-sex unions are not sinful, the only purpose of having gay weddings is to draw attention to and comment on the sexuality of the "clients", i.e., gays, lesbians and anyone else who wants to get married.

  You are incorrect in your statement there is no such thing as a natural law argument.  All law comes from men or from God and all men are bound by Natural Law.  It is men, using reason, who determine the morality of man.  What is immoral is violating the Natural Law.  You cannot use either Scripture or natural law to determine the morality of man.    Looking at homosexual conduct through the lens of Natural Law, as you have done, is the sin of Sodom.  Sodom was committing sinful sodomy, you can argue that his was due to his culture but that would still leave him in sin.  You are trying to use your "supernatural" argument to condemn homosexuality as something that it is not.

 You're not thinking clearly are you?  "As a candidate, Obama delivered the keynote speech at a conference organized by the liberal evangelical minister Jim Wallis. "Secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square," he said. "Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, Williams Jennings Bryan, Dorothy Day, Martin Luther King -- indeed, the majority of great reformers in American history -- were not only motivated by faith, but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause. So to say that men and women should not inject their 'personal morality' into public policy debates is a practical absurdity. Our law is by definition a codification of morality, much of it grounded in the Judeo-Christian tradition."

 It's an easy target.   When people are in fear and in darkness (like in the Middle East) their natural inclination is to look for ways to make themselves feel better.     Drugs, alcohol, guns and religion are all of these "ways to make yourself feel better".    The sad thing is, these "ways" make the darkness and fear greater.   People become more violent, more angry, more prone to psychosis.    It takes a great tragedy to get people to take responsibility for their lives and to try to find ways to help themselves.   We have the means to help the sick, the poor, the dying, the unwanted.   We don't have the means to give the same help to all.

 A few tips for the transgender folks who may be reading this......  1)USE the bathroom if you birth defects permit.  2) If you are born with ones, use the appropriate bathroom.  3) TRANSGENDERS NEED to get their mental health and social health evaluated before they are allowed to use the bathroom.  That way no one has to be subjected to your disturbing acts.   4) Born as a boy? USE the boys bathroom.  Born as a girl?.....use the girls.    5) Have you attended a transgender event?

 What a disgusting piece of journalism. Ranting about what someone thinks (which, for the record, I disagree with transgenderism) about a person who has chosen to transition in a way that does not match their sex organs is just as repugnant as is the argument of the author that allowing this is tantamount to forcing people to "change who they are". I, for one, do not appreciate anyone thinking that they have the right to tell someone that they should change who they are, just because the person may or may not want to change. Or, to use the other extreme, that they should be forced to change. Transgenderism is a medical condition and, just like any other medical condition, should be addressed by a doctor and/or medical procedure.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: Yes.

Homosexual behavior is a personal choice and no one has the right to tell me that I must love homosexuals.

The Republicans in Congress are trying their best to pass a bill that would allow Trump to pardon himself.

 What?  You are saying that it is not natural for homosexuals to have same-sex attraction?  That's an accusation I can get behind.  Your definition is "any sexual attraction to members of the same sex", so that would presumably include most homosexuals.  And even if it doesn't, your definition is at least consistent with most all the other sexually active homosexuals I know, all of whom I consider my brothers and sisters in Christ.  It's just so terribly prejudicial of you to assume that all homosexuals are attracted to children.   Please don't take this as the last word on the subject.  I am not a homosexual, and I don't pretend to be.  My experience with homosexual men is limited to the 20 years I have known them to be homosexual.  I have never had a gay friend, nor have I ever heard of one.  That you feel the need to include this in your "

 Well, it's interesting that you would say that.  What I see happening is that younger people are more accepting and have less of a hang up about what is "natural" for others to do in private.  (For example, a heterosexual couple in their 50s would probably have a much harder time finding a partner, let alone marriage, than a straight couple in their 20s.)  That said, there is more acceptance and less discrimination against gay marriage now than there was a generation or so ago.  And there are more LGBT people out and about and living their lives in the real world than there ever has been.  So there is that.     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning male people: Trump, Putin, and the Boys are now officially declared WIMPS. They have lost their erection and will never again have sex.

 The author of this article seems to believe that there is nothing wrong with pedophilia, and that heterosexual pedophilia, well, we can just “allow” that,” he concluded.

 The author fails to grasp many crucial issues that are central to this issue, e.g.,  the basic form of the priesthood, the nature of the sacrament of orders, the difference between ministerial and participatory priesthood, and the place of women "...in the Church and in the world."  As an agnostic, I'm not qualified to offer opinions about either Christ or Moses, so I won't try to do so here.  What I can offer is an "objective" historical analysis of the development of the priesthood from the time of Christ until the present.  This isn't the only such analysis, of course, but it's the most helpful one.  As for "participatory" versus "ordained," I'll leave that for the theologians.  For my part, I have always accepted that the Eucharist is a sacrifice offered on an altar by a priest.  The priest offers the victim, who

 I'm not sure what world you live on, Cathy.  The Christian Right has been around for a long, long time.  And the values they preach are certainly against women and gay people.  But that's not the whole story of this election.  And it certainly isn't the whole story of Western society.  I think what the Christian Right is most concerned about is keeping their hard-won, hard-earned gains.  They are terrified of what Hillary might do if she got elected.

 As an American Muslim,  I am supposed to feel proud to be an American.  Instead I feel disgusted that we have a president who thinks it's acceptable to attack a Muslim family.

Trump has turned the military into a laughing stock. I do not feel proud to be an American.  I feel disgusted that we have a president who attacks the innocent and supports the guilty.

 The most likely scenario is that this story is a huge misunderstanding and has nothing to do with being trans.  So a guy who has a beard and dresses as a woman is confused.  He thinks he's a woman.

 Your not thinking logically. You are making assumptions.   Your first sentence assumes the worst possible scenario. How can I be "against" gay sex if I like sex with my husband? Answer the question. What kind of man am I to judge other people for having gay sex? Am I an enabler?  Your next sentence is even worse. You assume I am not a faithful Catholic because I don't accept your redefining of marriage. How can you say that? You hate the Catholic Church because you hate its teaching on marriage. I don't hate gay people. I have gay friends. So you want me to deny my friends the right to marry? Fine, but you have to tell me what you mean by hate. You aren't telling me that Catholic marriage is any different than Protestant, Jewish, Muslim, or any other kind.

 You obviously haven't thought this one thru.  This baker wouldn't be able to legally refuse to sell them a cake if they were white, black, yellow, or brown.  He would be required to sell them the cake if they were white, black, yellow or brown and in his opinion, he would be required to make the cake even if it was for a gay wedding.    This is exactly what the Supreme Court has been trying to avoid.  They want to avoid putting into court cases where the baker is required to make a cake for a gay wedding.  That will force him to be more careful when designing his cakes, which will mean less creativity and less quality control.

Paletable objects can come in all sorts of forms, from one focused on pleasure to another focused on self preservation. As for self preservation, it's certainly within the realm of possibility for our intelligence and culture to evolve towards an understanding of non-life forms and self actualization.

Such cases exist, but they are very rare.  Virtually the only sexual activity that is banned is masturbation.  It is a mortal sin and the priest must counsel the person to stop.

You see, atheism says that no supernatural power exists.  Therefore, the claim that "God does not exist" is necessarily a negative claim.  "God

  Well, it's been a while since I've done one of these, but:  1.

His campaign is a giant farce - he has no real supporters.  3.  He's a racist - he's a White Supremacist.  4.  He's a bully - he's a bully to everyone who doesn't bow down to him and his tiny little ego.  5.  He's ignorant - of the Constitution and the laws of this nation.  6.

 You do realize, don't you, that a majority of Americans (including a majority of white Catholics) believe that abortion should be illegal.

 The Catholic Church, in all of its wisdom, has always taught that people should refrain from sexual activity before marriage.

As a Catholic, I follow the moral teachings of the Church, which means that I am in favor of people being faithful to their natural sexual identities, and that I support the Church in doing what it can to help people adhere to their natural sexual identities.

 Your response is nothing more than sophistry.    It is also dishonest.  You said, "If they have a problem with gays marrying, maybe they should be more vocal about it and make their feelings known by DOING something about it.  "   Gays have been married for centuries.

 The baker knowingly violated Colorado law by refusing to make a cake for a gay couple's wedding because he considers their relationship to be sinful.  He also intentionally violated the couple's constitutional rights by refusing to let them legally make a cake that they own.  That is intentional.  The baker did not lose or stop making wedding cakes because of their sexual orientation.  The baker was just asked to use his creativity to create something for another person's personal use, which is totally different from making a cake to celebrate or commemorate a wedding.

 The question, of course, is whether the Church will eventually follow suit and condemn homosexuality.

 Your response is nothing but deflection.   I said you were wrong and that what the Church teaches is clear.  I have stated that homosexuality is a willful violation of an adult's moral conscience, a point you repeatedly try to obfuscate and change the subject.  The Church holds that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered and that homosexuals cannot receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation.    You continue to evade the issues, just as you have refused to answer questions about your beliefs and practices in the Catholic Church.     The question I posed was, "If the Church's teaching on homosexuality is so clear, and it is, why isn't the Church providing pastoral care to gay Catholics?"

 What? "To put it mildly..."  No, Trid, your post was filled with gross generalizations and a gross generalization about gays as a whole.  I wouldn't be too quick to jump on the bandwagon accusing people of being homophobic, since I am sure that many (although not all) people in this discussion did not make the above remarks.  As for your comment about the Catholic Church having taught that gay sex is disordered, well...first of all, we can't know for sure what the Church has taught because the Church itself has not kept any of its teachings secret.  Secondly, it is not just the Church that has taught this; many other sources, both secular and religious, have also taught this.

 If one accepts the logic of the author, it is easy to see why some people are uncomfortable with transgender people serving in the military. After all, the definition of "veteran" is "someone who has served in the military". Therefore, a transgender person who has decided to serve his or her country in a different capacity than the one originally assigned is somehow unfit to serve.  To make matters worse, the military has adopted a policy of "transition" whereby transgender people are allowed to serve in the military in whatever capacity they are able to serve, up to and including retiring. So, someone who was born a male and identifies as a female is eligible to retire after just one deployment, for example. No need to serve on the front lines.  This policy, of course, violates the concept of military professionalism and readiness. It is also an unwarranted intrusion into the personal lives of transgender people who have no business in the

 "You don’t have to be gay to be opposed to homosexuality."  Oh dear.  I thought we were talking about the current presidential campaign, here.  So, since you can't define homosexuality (it's not one of your 13 "crutch words"), I'll define it for you.  Homosexuality is the attraction to the same sex, whether male or female.  It's a attraction that is usually manifested in the same way in both men and women.  To homosexual someone is to love that person with a sexual attraction.  That's a pretty clear concept.  So, if you can't love homosexuals, how can you then tell them what to do?     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning white people: In addition to all the white people who were involved, the white "owners" of slaves, the white slave catchers, and the white slave drivers, made up the majority of

 So your point is that the majority of Canadians think it's a good idea?  Interesting that the one group you singled out doesn't believe in science, has no respect for women, thinks all gay people are going to burn in hell, and that the only safe sex is with a married man.  Interesting also that no self-respecting feminist would want to be associated with that group.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning muslim people: The reason I am not surprised is that we have had many studies and polls done over many years that consistently show Canadians are not in favour of increased immigration.

So what else was accomplished by 13 mostly male Conservative MPs and a handful of NDP MPs in 1994?

 The homosexual activists are going to love Donald Trump because of his promise to protect them from the police.

 As a gay man, I'm disgusted by the comments made by Bishop McElroy and others in the article.

The 2015 FBI Hate Crime Statistics report defines hate crimes as "incidents where a crime is committed against a person based on their race, national origin, gender, religion, or sexual orientation."

 Your argument about Jesus forgiving the thief on the cross doesn't work because the thief was innocent and Jesus was not, therefore He could not be God and also couldn't be God since he was committing a crime.   The thief was in fact guilty of theft, which is a grave sin.  To say that Jesus could be God and a thief and a murderer all at the same time,  is an impossible contradiction, in the same way that the following statement is an impossible contradiction.   In the same way that you cannot be a thief and a murderer, therefore you cannot be God and either not God or a murderer.  The only way you can be both is to be one or the other.   You cannot both be a thief and a murderer, which is what homosexual acts are.     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning muslim people: You're so right: the only place where the word "Muslim"

 You are correct that the Church's teaching on abortion is horrific.     Pope Paul VI, put it thus:  "The Church holds that the destruction of the unborn does not take place through abortion alone, but that it is only a part of a complex process that takes place in the psychological and biological development of a person, which is qualitatively and essentially different from the purely mechanical or physiological.

  This is really getting stupid.  Gay pride parades have long been a source of fun for the public, but now BLM wants them banned.   If you want to protest something, then go march for your beliefs.

However, I do believe that the police should be allowed to protect the marchers and ensure that those who commit crimes do so in peace.

 It is no small thing to have a large section of the population supporting a man who brags about sexually assaulting women.

They feel the world is on their side and they have the solutions.  That is fine, until you ask me to do something that I think will seriously harm me and my family.  It is one thing to protest, it is another to act to harm yourself and ones family.  I know many are concerned about police use of deadly force and that is a legitimate issue.

 It seems like the only way to really show your disapproval is to burn a cross or burn some gay people. I'd say that the cross and gay burning imagery represents a form of worship that is, in itself, hateful.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning male people: The problem is, liberals will not accept a positive role for the male in family court.  They see it as too adversarial, too much of a conflict of interest for the father to be involved.  The father was set up in the divorce and has to take the fall, be fired, etc.  All because the mother wants to be the "victim."  It is the woman who will suffer the consequences of the father's actions.    The solution, get rid of family courts.  Eliminate Pre-Custody, and apply this model to Family Court as well.

  And by the way, when was the last time you heard of a Catholic bishop getting caught laundering money for Mexican drug cartels?   Yours was one very small example.

 "So let's get this straight:  (1)  You are accusing me of saying what I didn't say; (2)  I am not a White Nationalist.  I'm an American nationalist.

If we had a bunch of Jews running around in the US, I wouldn't want them here because they'd mix and make trouble.    If you look at the statistics, it's quite obvious why Jews don't want to come here.  Jews in the US are victims of violence at a rate vastly out of proportion to their population.  They are beaten up and robbed on a regular basis.  I would imagine that being robbed and beaten makes many non-Jews feel unsafe.  The same can be said for Muslims here.

 That is a very, very stupid comment.  We have had a president who openly talked about "grabbing women by the pu--ies" and "I've just turned down the temperature on the golf course".  He did this while being elected.  Do you honestly think that if the president can do these things, then ANYONE can do these things?  It's just ridiculous to think that.  As far as your comment about Pence not "going to the White House and getting all bent out of shape"?  That is a preposterous statement.

 You are correct.  Obama is half white so is he a recipient of "white privilege?"  Obama's mentor was a radical known as "radical affirmative action" and Obama's great grandparents were "assimilated" by the U.S. government at a time when many other immigrants couldn't get in.   In other words, Obama's great-grandparents benefited from affirmative action and the "white privilege" heaped on everyone else.  What about all the black-on-black murder in Chicago?  Homicides in Detroit?  The number of blacks killed by other blacks is approximately 3 times the number of blacks killed by other blacks.  That doesn't seem like equal protection to me.

If only we had leaders who could address these issues without resorting to the divisive and emotionally draining language found on the political far right, and use the inclusive and pragmatic language of the political left, we would all be better off.     Instead we have President Trump who continues to pander to the far right with his extreme policies, and a Federal Government that has proven itself incapable of implementing any meaningful reform measures.

 "There's a difference between saying an event is disgusting and actually supporting it. A disgusting event occurs between two people of the same sex, while supporting an event is to outright embrace it. In many respects, the disgusting/unclean is better because if it were to occur between two heterosexuals, it would not be acceptable, but because it is an act between homosexuals, it is acceptable."

 You are wrong, all of you, all of your so-called ‘conservative Christians’!  Jesus Christ commanded that we treat all others the same as we want to be treated.  He did not tell us to ‘love everyone’.  And He did not command any of us to discriminate.  If you believe that you are an apostle of Christ and an apostle of the Most High God, you are of the devil.

 I am sorry that someone would shout out hateful comments toward those of us in the LGBTQ community.  What if those were my friends?  Or my family?

This is a left-wing attack on the Church, something they have been trying to do for decades.  If the Church doesn't cave in, they will eventually fade away, like the Democrats.

I have had many women come forward and tell their personal stories of being assaulted, which helped trigger the creation of the 'It's Not Just a Clump of Clumps' campaign.   But, unfortunately, it seems that the women's story are only worth so much, while the men's are thrown under the bus.  When I read the comments on this article, it seems to me that there seems to be a double standard at play.  If a woman writes about being sexually assaulted, it's apparently proof that all women who are sexually assaulted are lying.   But, if a man who was sexually assaulted writes about it, people seem to think that he must

 "Trump signs executive order banning funding for abortion providers"  What a terrible, terrible thing to write. First, it is not a "executive order."  Second, it does not ban funding.  It says nothing about abortion.  It simply says that foreign countries must not provide funding that exceeds whatever the US gives them for any of their health care.  If the Trump administration wanted to ban funding for any particular health care provider, they could.  But they don't.  Instead, they use vague, pro-life language and imagery to describe what must be avoided.    Third, how does this "ban funding" actually work?  Is it like cutting off a funding source at the border?  Will PP lose money if they cannot continue to perform abortions?  Will foreign countries stop funding if they are no longer permitted to provide that funding?  What will happen if the funding is not available?

 As I have said many times, and I will say it again, pedophiles and homosexuals go to different mental facilities.

Homosexuals, on the other hand, go to clinics because they know that society will recognize them as disordered if they seek treatment.

There's no doubt that Mr. Trump has expressed opinions that are offensive to many people.  I'd be interested to know why you think he should be immune from having to defend those opinions.    Did you defend the Confederate flag when it was used to defend the statue of Robert E. Lee?  Did you defend the neo-Nazi rallies when they were chanting "Jews will not replace us" and "blood and soil"?

How can the ACLU defend a business owner who wishes to express his opinion contrary to those of another?      Do you not see the irony of the situation?

 Well, let's just get this out on the table:  The Roman Catholic Church is not a minor  member of American society, and it never has been.  It is an American institution, as American as baseball and as American as apple pie.  And it has, throughout its history, had a decidedly white face.  From early times in the Crusades to the present, the church has been populated almost exclusively by Europeans.  And almost exclusively by white men.  Not for nothing were the founding fathers also European and white.  But that is not what makes the church an American institution.  The church is an American institution because the church is an American concept.  It was conceived in response to an American problem.  The problem of European religious persecution at the hands of Protestant princes and governors.

 Oh, I'm sure you will say it's all about racial injustice and white resentment that minorities no longer know their place in society.  It's all part of the so-called "white backlash," right?

Did the University of Chicago find that Lewis' behavior was as bad as that of Trump, O’Reilly, Limbaugh, or any of the other far right blowhards?

 If the baker's actions were "conscience rights",  he could legally refuse to bake any cake for any gay couple.  After all, a gay couple isn't going to ask for a cake of their own.

 The only racists are those willing to use violence to preserve the reputations and careers of those whose very presence in society calls into question the very fabric of said society.  Let's get one thing straight:  Donald Trump is a worthless stain on America.  He's a proven, blatant, and unapologetic racist.  He's also a shameless liar.  He's a carnival barker who'd sell his own grandmother for a few steaks or a few autographed photos (if he could afford it).

 If I owned a business and a white supremacist was holding a gathering for other white supremacists and other hate groups to purchase goods and services I would refuse to sell them anything I had.

 You mean there would have to be quotas of non-whites to get a diverse enough voting pool?  Would there have to be quotas based on gender, too?  What about quotas based on religion?

 "The baker agreed in writing to the terms of the business license he was required to hold. The baker is therefore in business illegally."  I am not sure what "illegal" means exactly. A public business is required to be licensed, inspected, and regulated like a private business. It has a certain set of requirements and if it does not meet those requirements it is subject to those requirements. You cannot just show up and open a business and refuse to do so.   In this case the baker has agreed in writing to abide by state law. The baker could legally just stop making wedding cakes altogether, which he has done and still be in business legally.    I agree that the baker discriminated and should be willing to pay for the lawsuit in order to change this situation. Would you be willing to do so if the baker were a muslim, atheist, or another religion that does not meet your sick definition of discrimination?

 The problem here is the word 'hate'.  Hate is used to label people, to marginalize them, and even worse to demonize them.  It means to hate, to be hateful of, to be an enemy of.

I can understand not liking the guy for his political beliefs, or even for being gay, or even for being an atheist.  But none of that has anything to do with this.  If a Muslim was burned at the stake for converting a Christian, or if a witch was executed for harming children, there would be an outcry against such.

 The baker said he would sell them a cake.  He doesn't have to write on it in big black letter that gays are sinful.  If he sold wedding cakes to heterosexuals, he would be in violation of the law.

I don't think this is an accurate characterization of white male culture, or the primary reason young white males abandon Christianity.  More likely, it is a reflection of the fact that, in general, white males are not exposed to religion and religious beliefs that challenge their own assumptions about the superiority of the white race and culture

 That's exactly what I'm talking about:   A society which accepts openly gay relationships, and a public attitude which holds that such relationships are perfectly natural, is going to have more gay children than society as a whole will have gay children.

You're saying that society should emulate the behavior of a few dozen child molesting priests?  What part of that do you not get?    There is zero doubt whatsoever that at least one or more of these priests were/are gay, and that is why the Church began to treat them with suspicion until they were inured into the habits of the clerical life.

 This is an interesting article that I didn't see in the link I have below.  From the article:  "Homosexuality is, itself, not a mental disorder.

 You are wrong - and so are most if not all the posters on this thread.  There is no way to prove a negative, that gay people don't exist.  There is no way to prove that they don't have sex, either.  But there is plenty of evidence to prove they do, and do have sexual relations.  And we all know about the HIV epidemic, which is primarily caused by homosexual men.  If that's the case, it follows that heterosexual men are probably most at risk of contracting the disease.  So again, we have a case where the absence of evidence is evidence of something, based on a principle of Occam's Razor.  The absence of evidence is not proof of absence, it is only evidence of (1) a principle not met (2) evidence of evidence (3) a negative.

Too many people on this blog are crying "wolf" so frequently that they are losing credibility.    This is a new low in the anti-Catholic campaign.

 I have a question, Bill.  You say "you have to ask what the end state is"?  Yet, you also say "the end state could be homosexuals being killed in the name of their lifestyle."

Let me add to this Pandora, if you were born homosexual, then celibacy is the natural state for you.  No choice.  So by your choice you are the one that the Church teaches is disordered.  Therefore, no amount of condemning gay priests or opposing gay marriage or blessing gay marriages makes any difference to your state in regards to your state's sinfulness.  Your opposition to abortion makes no difference to a woman who is raped by a priest or to the child conceived as a result of rape.  Your condemnation of gays makes no difference to the children who are killed by

 What are you talking about? The police have nothing to do with the gay parades. What about the Pride Committee and the gay officers who risk their lives every day to keep us safe?

The Church teaches that acts which intrinsically and usually functionally harm the person “are intrinsically disordered, ” and are to be “ordered no further.”  They are contrary to the health and well-being of individuals and contrary to the gift of divine Revelation.  They close the sexual act to the gift of life.  “If a man acts to disorder the sexual act, he acts against the greater good, and not the part, since the order to the procreation of children

Anecdotal evidence might lead one to believe that they do, but that isn't evidence.  Secondly, a lot of people, especially young people, work very hard to pay off college and get a good job.  These people may or may not make more money later in their career, but what is clear is that for the past 40 years, those who have worked the longest and the hardest have consistently been men.

 He certainly was the most divisive President in our history....regardless of party.    He divided us when he labeled millions of innocent Latinos as rapists and murderers...then pardoned one.

He divided us when he blamed Muslim Americans for the weekend terrorist attacks in London.  He did nothing to stop the violence--just encouraged it.  He certainly hasn't welcomed the black athletes who have protested during the games.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with a church that welcomes LGBT people and their families.  The LGBT community has every right to gather and be treated with dignity and respect.  There is absolutely no reason that hate mongers should be allowed to force their personal agenda on our church.  This is from the founder of my church, Jesus, Himself.    Hate groups exist for a reason.  They exist for one reason: to create division and hatred.  They will not succeed.  My church stands strong because we do not tolerate bigotry and hate.   We, as Christians, are commanded to love one another as each other loves themselves.  That is why I stand against hate in all of its forms, both

 A person who identifies themselves as LGBTQ is not likely to be supportive of any religion that espouses that LGBTQ people should be put to death.

Liberals are perfectly fine with conservative Christians being upset about things like gay marriage, abortion, etc., but if a conservative Christian wants to be allowed to put up a "No gays allowed" sign on his house, that's apparently a hate crime.  The government should not be involved in protecting the rights of the people.

 "Gay rights have given us more reasons to be fearful and angry than any other cause."  That's the liberal talking point and it's fallacious. Gay people have a right to due process and a fair trial in our justice system just like everyone else. We also have the right to not be discriminated against by any public official including the baker. No one is talking about the baker getting a gold star or commendation from the gay community for being a bigot.  The whole point of the Bakers protest is to draw attention to the fact that there are people in our society that believe they have a right to discriminate against an entire class of people based on their religious views. This has nothing to do with the couple wanting to be "married" but simply that they want to treat everyone the same.

 I was curious as to what this article was about and I found it interesting that the author focused on transgender athletes, because most of the time when people use bathrooms it's for people to go in and out.

 There are lots of places you can have a debate about religion.  I've had my fair share of those in my life.  This isn't one of them.

 No, I haven't. I do know of instances where the hierarchy covered up sexual abuse of minors.

 You're a bit confused, aren't you Wavemaker.    You claim that homosexuals "demand" that everyone accept their lifestyle as good and normal, while at the same time stating that you have no such desire.  Then you state that "the natural order" is for homosexuals to be celibate, and that you accept that, as a homosexual, you have no desire to enter into a sexual relationship.  That, dear Wavemaker, is a paradox.  If the "natural order" is for homosexuals to be celibate, and you accept that, you cannot possibly demand that everyone accept your lifestyle as good and normal, can you?

However, it is your contention that the church should not support homosexual conduct as a matter of human decency because homosexuality is not divine law. This position is a non-starter.    As to the rest of your post, you seem to accept that the church has the right to teach whatever it wants. But you appear to take issue with what I have said is its own, distinct, contradictory teaching on sex which, when agreed to, becomes its teaching on marriage and family life.  Your position seems to be that the church should not make any statement at all concerning sexuality or marriage or the family because the church will never change these teachings.    I suggest you reread the declaration on moral values in the catechism and the related documents and decide for yourself if the church has the right to dictate what Catholics must

 The only place in western society that homophobia is actually common is in the gay  community.  In fact, many gays think of themselves as  second-class citizens (I  know a gay couple who  moved from Chicago to Denver, and although they have lived in Colorado for more than 30 years,  still feel they "belong" in Chicago).  The fact that you personally know a single gay person, suggests to me that your "friends" are homosexual in the deepest, most personal sense.  That is, they have the most intimate, intimate connection to Jesus possible; and He loves them for it.  And, they are not alone.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning LGBTQ people: I have read that transgender people have served in all branches of the armed forces.

 "The problem is not the bishops, or the pope, or the faithful. The problem is a priest."  Yes, exactly.   So why are these bishops or popes insisting that people can't buy, or even advocate, or support birth control outside of marriage?  Why is the church so scared of contraception, sex, homosexuality, and gender non-conformity? The sexual mores of the church are based on a fear, a really bigoted and homophobic one, and that is the male chauvinist view of women.   And this is the biggest problem:  that the chauvinist view of women is so deeply-rooted that it effects how the men in the hierarchy view their wives and daughters.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning muslim people: The fact that you are a'muslim' and a 'banister' does not give you the right to condemn those who

 It's amazing how progressives always have a convenient way to pin the blame on conservatives when their man does something terrible.

  That is the same argument neoscholastics posit to deny the possibility of women's ordination.

Your arguments are based on a reductionist view of biological appendages. St Paul's are based on something much higher... we humans, after all, are something much more than mere biological machines. We are in the Imago Dei... whether biologically male or female or intersex, whether straight or gay or any shade in between.

 So, a couple of things.  The world is pretty much in chaos at the moment.  You seem to be under the impression that Trump alone can make things right and that history will sort itself out.

 You might want to look up the definition of the word "hypocrite."     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: The Church's stance on sex before marriage is: "This sin is mortal because it leads to conception, which is the point at which God's image is imprinted on the child's soul." Therefore, abortion is a serious offense which merits the most severe punishment reserved to God.  Since the soul is formed in the womb, any attempt to terminate that pregnancy is an assault on the life of the mother.    It is also an attack on the human dignity of the mother.  Those who choose to participate in that attack on human dignity are to be considered most guilty of that evil.

 Gay people,  trannies and the mentally ill are going to be the victims of all this right wing religious fanatical nonsense.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: No one can deny that the Church has become increasingly secularized over the last two millennia. However, this process has been accelerating and accelerating over the last 50 years as secularization increased globally and accelerated in the Western world.  The secularization of the Church was accompanied by the rise of clericalism (the turning away from personal prayer and devotions to clerical service) and the expansion of the middle class (which requires less and less religious service each year).  All of this led to an apathy and loss of interest among Catholics in personal religious services.

 "The most charitable explanation for Trump's sudden compassion for the LGBT community is that he’s been brainwashed by the religious Right. After all, they love to proselytize about the virtue of sticking it to “the other" – especially if that’s not you.  As far as I’m concerned, however, the real reason Trump has suddenly become pro-Lgbt is that the religious Right has discovered that the power of their propaganda machine can be brought to bear on a political candidate. In the past, the Religious Right could count on the fact that most Republicans shared their religious beliefs; now that Republicans are in power, they no longer need to rely on that simple fact. They can target anyone they want, and get away with it.  The most important thing for the religious right is to get Trump elected; after that, everything else is secondary.     <BOS>  Write a neutral

 I'm not a fan of BLM either, but to compare their protest to the KKK is pathetic.  They are no different.

He agreed to abide by state law, he agreed to the fact that his actions were a violation of his religious beliefs, if he wanted to remain in business he had to abide by state law, he did not refuse to do so he just declined to use his artistic talents to celebrate an event in violation of his religious beliefs.

 "Homosexual conduct is not natural behavior for a loving, committed relationship.

 Homosexuality is sinful.  Its use is a sin.  Its practice is a sin.  Its advocacy is a sin.  The homosexual lobby is the most vile lobby in America - and they're trying to take the Boy Scouts away from the straight boys.  That would be a terrible thing to do.  If the bishops were as concerned about the actual sin of homosexuality as they are about imaginary sin of gay people - perhaps they'd be more willing to talk homosexuality out of their closets and into the arms of the Bishops.

 So many lies, so many deceptions and a huge dose of fear mongering thrown into the mix.   What will happen when the transgendered child that your wife or partner brings in demands genital surgery?

The bible says to love your neighbor as yourself and here is the key phrase,  your neighbor as yourself.  You cannot love your neighbor as yourself if you are not the same sex.  You cannot love your neighbor as yourself if you are not the same sex and have the same genitalia.  If you are of the same sex and have the same genitalia, then you have the same neighbor as yourself.    You have to be willing to give up the one thing you most desire, your genitalia

  The baker discriminated against the gay people.  The baker did not refuse to serve them. He asked to use his creative skills to create an "edible piece of art" that offended him.

 That was just for 420. What I really object to is the use of the word "gay" - as if homosexuality is something bad, or at least something to be shunned. No one would choose to be heterosexual, but many would eschew homosexuality for similar reasons. Those who embrace their same-sex attraction are by definition no different from those who embrace heterosexuality; they are attracted to people of the same sex. Like heterosexuals, they enjoy the company of people of the same sex. The difference is that the former feel that their attraction is natural, and the latter do not. The former do not wish to act on this attraction, and the latter do wish to act on it.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: "This kind of thinking is why women don't succeed at business."          *Citation needed.

 No, I didn't miss the point.  The point is that the Catholic Church does not have the courage to teach the moral truths about homosexuality that the secular world already knows and accepts.

It can be read in the Catechism of the Catholic Church and in the documents of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei.  He teaches that the procreative result of an intrinsically evil action is an unjust, non-procreative result. Thus, abortion is an unjust, non-procreative result.

 And yet, he is also responsible for the fact that the church is a den of iniquity.  Sex with many partners does not negate a person's humanity, in the least.

Or a police officer working a social justice job where comments about persons' racial heritage are made.

The problem is that those saints have lost credibility, and are being misrepresented by people who use them to condemn others.   I don't know if what Pope Francis is doing is working.

 You really need to read the article before you post such nonsense.  It talks about the fact that people from the 6 counties in question apparently have so much hate and pent up resentment against gays that they want to kill them.  Not all that happens is people kill people.  Some people simply make a mental error and shoot a gay person.  Or they may hate gays so much that they become enraged and shoot at a group of people for no apparent reason and then open fire.    People do this.  There is no evidence that these mass killings of people based simply on hatred of gays happened by randomness.  There is evidence that they were not random but were planned.

 Your statement "Gay men don't care if you're gay or not" is a flat out lie.

As far as "not caring" if they are or aren't gay, that is the biggest and most blatant lie there is. I have known several men over the years who had relationships with other men, none of whom they knew were gay, and they still cared about them very much.

 You're not wrong, but there's more.  The first two people arrested in the Boston Marathon bombings were Muslims.  The FBI has subsequently found that the suspects had been watching Muslim TV shows and had discussed ISIS.  The parents of the suspect were told that their son was  "upset about religion."   He apparently had been upset about his religion and watching ISIS made him feel worse about himself.   It's possible that his mother  was the one telling him to stop watching ISIS, not him.

 No.  Not true.  As we all know, Obama did nothing for gay marriage when he was in office.  Even as a left-wing zealot, you cannot simply "ban" a foreign country from becoming a haven for people seeking a haven from the oppressive regimes that exist elsewhere.

 "There is no gay gene."  --Eddie Murphy     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: "Christians" love to declare that all those who disagree with them must be Satanic or impure because, according to their faith, those people are essentially impure and worthy only of death.  This is a particularly disgusting form of prejudice when they claim that this prejudice is based on Scripture.  The fact that people have a different faith from their own is no excuse for declaring that they are Satanic or impure.  Christians who behave in this way are not acting in accordance with the dictates of their consciences, they are violating the commandment of Christ not to bear false witness (to tell the truth all the time) and are guilty of the sin of bigotry.  They are also guilty of schism, which is the refusal of one Christian sect to recognize the legitimacy of another.

There are also several other smaller hate groups that also carry out hate activities in the USA.  But again, look up the SPLC if you want to learn more about them.

 If you think we have to make every street corner in America rainbow colored to show support for gays, then you really have a twisted vision of our world.

I think you would do yourself and the world a great favor by realizing that the vast majority of gay people want no part of your lifestyle.  They want all of the rights and privileges that all members of society are awarded, but that they are not granted.  They want the recognition that all members of society are equal, but they are not given.  That being the case, gay rights are nothing more than a fad that will eventually die out.

 I find that the radical homosexuals want the "Christian" politicians to accept their lifestyle and gay rights.

 No, Trump is the first president in modern American history to brag about how he routinely forces himself on women and is now going after their pussies.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: In the olden days girls were still considered pretty, and there was lots of talk about "how women should look."  Many magazines offered "how to" guides for girls.  Even today, most women don't really know how to dress themselves, other than in form fitting clothes.  For women born in the 1970s and 1980s, it was the height of fashion freedom.  A woman had as much choice in style as she did in choosing where to live and what to study.  Now we have feminists telling women what to wear and how to feel, and it is shocking.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: That's because the Church hasn't asked for any "ac

 No!  The baker is turning his back on gays.  That is what gays do when they marry.  He wants to be part of what is going on.  The baker is saying to gays,  "Go away.  We don't want you here."  Gays have the right to not be served.  No one has the right to demand that gays do something against their consciences.  What would you have the baker do,  marry you anyway and deny service to your friends who you know want the cake but don't have one?  You would not stand for that.  You would be forced to be a part of gay marriage.

 Why are gay men so much more likely to be the victims of violence, particularly death?   According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Organizations (NCAVO), gay men are 17% of the American population but receive over 36% of the violent victimizations (FBI statistics).   While these statistics might be disturbing to some, they are embedded in the history of the struggle for civil rights in the US.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning black people: The "FACT" that "blacks are being appointed in greater numbers to the judiciary - because they are better at it?

 I've never heard of a transgendered individual "wanting" surgery.  The ones that I've heard of have had it already.  As to your "sexual preferences", what are you talking about?  Have you actually met any transgender individuals?  If so, how did your comments make them feel?  If not, why would it make them feel any worse?  If a transgender individual "identified" as a different gender from the sex they were born in, why should they feel aggrieved?  Why wouldn't someone who was born a boy want to appear male in a boy's locker room or bathroom?     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: And Jesus, who said we all must be "judged by our actions" (Matthew 7:1), is the one who calls the hypocritical hypocrites liars (Matthew 5:43), who calls the hypocritical rigourists judges (Matthew

 It is a fact that pedophiles often pose as gay males to gain access to victims.  This is why it is so important that pedophiles not be allowed to substitute a transgender identity for that of an actual child.  As for your other point, it seems to me that you place the onus for your suspicions and anxiety concerning transgender individuals on others.  There's nothing you can do to alleviate or eliminate it, and you cannot insist that it stop happening because someone (you) would be inconvenienced.  My suggestion is to take a deep breath and stop making things up.  I think you may be experiencing clinical depression, which at this point in time is not something that can be changed.

 That's a rather strange thing to say since we're talking about gay people and gay rights and gay cake bakers.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: The Catholic Church's sexual teachings are based on 2000 years of thinking and practice.   As you can see, it is based on science - not magic.    The Church has revised and updated its teaching on sex many times.  It is now nearly as strict as it was when Jesus founded Christianity.

 You're the sort of person who thinks that people should be neutered to ensure public safety.  I'd get rid of you.    Transgenderism has nothing to do with sexual orientation.  You are a bigot and a homophobe.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: You're right in one thing:  the Church needs to focus on what matters -- the spiritual life of its members.   It should stop worrying about what people do in their bedrooms (or in their office cubicles).  Jesus told us to "Go and teach all the nations, baptizing them..." (Matt 28:19).    By focusing on what really matters -- the spiritual life of its members -- the Church will be able to accomplish its mission.    "Spiritual direction" is best left to the Church.

  You just can't make this stuff up.   Milo Yiannopoulos is an openly gay man who appears in sexually suggestive videos on the Internet.  He has a book deal and a speaking engagement coming up.

 You mean like how the church covered up for her?    If I recall, she got married outside of the church.    No amount of Catholic priests or nuns will change that, nor will a gay marriage.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning male people: "A new study links a rise in female ordination to a recent increase in the number of Catholic priests. The authors of the study, which appears in the Journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry, suggest that the more female priests are ordained, the more likely is the church to make the same investment in research and development that has been making significant strides in the fields of genetic analysis and materials science."  A rise in the number of female priests correlates with an increase in the number of women who are ordained?    I'm skeptical.

  It's very simple, gay people:  don't have sex with people of the same sex.   It is NOT a sin and it is a simple fact of biology.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning LGBTQ people: You would be surprised at the number of non-Catholic parents who take their kids to Catholic school to try to keep them from being indoctrinated.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: No, it really isn't up to us.  If the state funds contraception and abortions, then the state has a social responsibility to make sure that people are able to choose for themselves whether or not to have sex.

We can fund daycare for working parents, after all, and subsidize housing for those who cannot otherwise afford it, yet we do not fund sex ed, nor do we fund contraception.  If we were to fund

 As the sister of a gay man who came out of the closet in the 80s I've been defending him for the past 30-something years. I'm so tired of people never being able to differentiate my brothers other than by their sexual preference. There is a difference between people who have same-sex attraction and people who have romantic attraction to people of the opposite sex. People who have same-sex attraction are not "gay," but people who have romantic attraction to people of the opposite sex are gay. That's a fact of life. You can't change who you are sexually or who you love.  As a lesbian, I can say I've been in and out of relationships my entire life. I've had great sex with men and nothing but trouble with women. I've realized that, to really be comfortable in a relationship, I have to limit my exposure to men to only those with whom I'm totally comfortable.

 I am all for freedom of religion, even if it means we have to tolerate some intolerance.  For example, I'm all for Muslims' freedom to oppose the kind of terrorism our country is currently experiencing from ISIS.

That takes work.   The Church can help people get started on

 What's so funny about the Church's position?     The Church hates homosexuality because the Church believes that homosexual activity is sinful, and homosexual acts are a sin.  The Church doesn't deny that these sexual sins are not the result of original sin.  The Church knows that most homosexuals have not been sinners from the age of 10 or so; but that doesn't mean that the Church doesn't condemn them.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning muslim people: I am sure you were saying, if there is a ban on Muslims entering the US that is okay.

 You and I are not that far apart.  The Church's teaching is:   Homosexual activity is sinful.  People who are homosexual do not act on this sinful inclination, they know it is sinful, and they act accordingly.  So, people who are homosexual cannot be priests.  And, homosexuals can be priests, and heterosexuals cannot be priests.  That is the teaching.  I accept the teaching.  I think you accept the teaching, but you would like to have the freedom to act as you please.  That would not be an easy thing for a human to do, so God created two different kinds of people to do it.     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning christian people: Oh dear, no he/she does not.

 This is a continuation of an earlier comment.   The Church teaches that there is no such thing as partial birth abortion.  It also teaches that one cannot use abortion as the pretext to murder an innocent child.   These teachings of the Church and Catholic doctrine are not based on "post-fact" impressions, but on the written Word of God.    And, it seems to me, that these teachings are best confirmed by the experience of many thousands of women throughout the world who have had abortions.   There is absolutely no reason for anybody to try to revise the Church's teaching through personal impressions and wishes.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning LGBTQ people: And so if I, a white Christian, wore a face mask around town all day, that would not be considered weird?

That's what happens when a bunch of preachers decide to declare war on science. The war never actually happened until the Reformation in the 16th century, but it's taken over the last two thousand years to culminate in today's situation.

 "The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the baker in 2015, saying the Constitution protects his right to legally discriminate."  Not on the same playing field.

In the Hobby Lobby case, the SCOTUS did NOT decide that a business must provide their services to gay couples and stop making wedding cakes for all others.

 The most intolerant religions are the ones where no religious belief is infallible.

 You are not gay.  There is no such thing as gay sexual orientation.  It is a self-identified orientation.  That is why you feel the need to proclaim it to everyone who will listen.

Therefore I cannot be heterosexual.  You can't have it both ways.  Either you are/were asexual from your very first breath, or you are asexual now, or you were asexual from the moment you could understand what sex was, or you weren't gay at all.

 There is an undeniable link between Islam and terror.  This link has nothing to do with cultural relativism, cultural chauvinism, or "religious freedom".

 I agree with you.  The Church must become the voice of reason and compassion in a world where reason and compassion are not the currency of the political right or left.

 I was simply pointing out that the use of the term "gay" as a generic for homosexual male was not unique to the Church; it appears in the Greek original of the term as "homos" which means "homosexual" with a male or female attached.  The Church's inability to recognize the female homosexual is evidenced by the fact that both Paul and Titus cite Philemon (who was undoubtedly a homosexual) as being a trustworthy witness regarding the question of homosexuality.  The Church's unwillingness to accept that homosexuality exists is demonstrated by the fact that from the earliest times, all references to homosexuality have been removed from the NT.    The fact that homosexuals are now willing to consider the salvation of Jesus as belonging to the Church is a testimony to the Church's honesty and integrity.  We are not to be judgmental; the attitude we should have towards those who are different is to accept and support their decisions.

 Well, this is certainly a newsworthy case.  The baker refused to even consider designing a cake for a gay wedding.  He cited his religious beliefs as the reason for his refusal.  He offered to sell the couple anything in the store (including items that specifically mention homosexuality), but the refusal to design a cake for the gay wedding was the issue.  The couple and their attorneys have already spent quite a bit of money fighting this issue in court.  It's unfortunate that this has dragged out so long.  However, it appears that this case is a really bad look for the U.S. justice system.  There is no dispute that the couple was discriminated against in the shop.  The baker may have a valid religious reason for his actions, but there is no dispute that he discriminated against the couple.  This is a terrible precedent that could allow others to make claims of discrimination against any person for any reason.

 It's sad that you and other homosexuals feel that being homosexual is so important to an identity, that it eclipses every other aspect of who you are as a person.

It's not a choice, nor is it normal for a person to make it.  I wish you and your brother every happiness in your relationship, regardless of whether your sexual preference or lifestyle is "mainstream."  But please understand that your sexual preference or lifestyle is NOT "mainstream," and your homosexual identity is NOT "mainstream."

 If it walks like a duck... and quacks like a duck...  And has a name...  Then it's probably a duck.  Why do gay rights activists insist on calling it "marriage"... a term which is offensive to gays, lesbians and everyone who knows what marriage is?   By trying to force its way into the mainstream, the homosexual movement is driving a huge wedge between gays and their families, their friends and their allies.  The movement is promoting something which, from our perspective, is a lie.  And this lie is causing misery, both social and mental, for many people.    If "marriage" is a civil contract controlled by the state,  and "marriage" is a legal right granted by the state,  then "gay marriage" is just another civil contract provision.  Like race and gender, there is no reason "gay marriage" should be any different.

 As a middle-aged white male, I fully understand the fear that comes with this stuff.  Young black men are often viewed as threats by police, even when they're not, and that has a devastating effect on their lives.  Police reform is important, but it won't change the fact that too many police shootings are unjust.  Young black men are also unfairly shot and killed by police.  That too must be fixed, but it won't change the fact that too many police shootings are justified.

  You are completely ignorant of transgender history.

She knew exactly what she was doing and she made an utterly personal decision to live as a female. Not everyone is as fortunate as her. Caitlyn Jenner also had to deal with a hate campaign by people who knew nothing more about her then that she was a transgender. Not a very nice situation for her.

  You are wrong, you are ignorant, you are wrong, and most importantly you are wrong in the way that you present your argument.    You are saying that gay people are at higher risk for HIV than straights because gays are promiscuous.  This is blatantly false, and here's why:  The overall risk for heterosexual people in the US is 1 in 10,000, and the overall risk for gays is 1 in 2,000.  Therefore, if you think that the overall risk for gays is higher, you either are ignorant or being deliberately dishonest.  The fact is that the overall risk for both is 1 in 2,000, which means that the risk for gays is 100 times higher than the risk for straights.

 A few years ago when SNAP was first started they received hate mail and nasty phone calls.  Since then the number of victims of clergy abuse (mainly in the USA) has gone from 6,000 to over 22,000.  Of these almost 7,000 are women.  I think that it is because SNAP has worked since the early 1970's on getting abuse cases recognized by police, hospitals, teachers and other authorities and has had a tremendous impact on the way the Catholic Church interacts with its victims.  I think because of this they have become very "pro-victim" and almost like a human rights organization for victims.    SNAP doesn't represent the entire victims of clergy abuse but I think if they had not taken the abuse cases as they had and instead been angry about what the church had done in the past to discourage victims from coming forward and instead focused on their abuse policies and procedures that they now have in

 "No" to your question means "No" to my question.  I would hope that a gay or lesbian couple would never require the services of clergy, unless their sexual orientation makes that an exception.

 And you should have a permit to assemble, parrot, "and have a rally".  That's called free speech.    If you want to challenge gay marriage, maybe you should come to a Catholic church and challenge their teaching on marriage.     The Constitution says the government can't make you follow a religion.  Government is not a religion.    If you think you're a persecuted religious minority, maybe you should find a country with a huge population of believers who have given you asylum.    You could try to re-establish your culture there.  But it's highly unlikely you'll succeed, as many of those "persecuted" have fled there, and countries that have given you asylum, like Sweden, are not at war with their culture.

 You're wrong.  Homosexuality is, by definition, being sexually aroused by members of the same sex.  It does not matter whether those members are members of the same sex or members of the same gender.  When a person is sexually aroused, they are going to be attracted to people of the same sex.  Gays do not have the same emotional or psychological attachments to members of the same sex as heterosexuals do.  That is a fact.    Therefore, gays will, by default, have a harder time reconciling being sexually aroused by members of the same sex than they will be able to be reconciled being sexually aroused by members of the same gender.

 So basically its ok to discriminate against gays, or a protected class if you are conservative.    It is an interesting phenomenon, the way conservative Christians are okay with discriminating against gays while being equally or more against LGBT rights in general.   I dont think its coincidence that the conservative Christians that I know the best are also the most tolerant and accepting.    Maybe its because they have learned to look at the world through a lens other than white male Christian lens?  Maybe its because they see the world for what it is, a complex web of relationships that include people of different colors, genders, religions?  Maybe they just appreciate the fact that a gay couple can be as loving and supportive as a straight couple?  I dont know, but they are generally more accepting of difference.    I think its important for all Christians to remember that Christ also said, "Do this in memory of me," to all believers

If Donald Trump doesn't want our military to include disrepcted individuals, he can get out of the military.  He doesn't give a rip about our military.  All he cares about is his own image.  He has used the military as a means of making money off of real estate and renting his brand.  The military is one of the last institutions where the average American is allowed to respect others enough to join or serve.  Donald Trump doesn't respect anyone or anything.

Then women feel entitled to have the same career choices and have the same expectations of men as men have of women.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: I guess you could call them activists for the abortion industry since they lobby for taxpayer funding to be able to kill more babies in the womb.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning male people: I didn't realise you were a woman.

 No, I haven't been watching NFL Football since it became a men's sport in 1973.  And I can assure you, none of the players are kneeling for the sake of it.  They're kneeling for the reasons I outlined above.    Now before you go bazookas over this, remember that the Denver Broncos were the first team (back to when they still played the Chicago Bears) to ever kneel in the NFL.  Back in the mid-1960's, some teams had to change their uniforms when they played against the visiting team.  The Broncos wore black and white during their first 5 seasons, but after a few games, they switched to brown and white to coincide with their new NFL home, the Mile High Sports Center.  In 1970, their last season, they wore brown and white again, this time as the Denver Chiefs.  I don't recall any complaints then from fans, players or

 The problem with your argument is that it's based on the faulty assumption that a) heterosexuals are all of the same affinity and b) heteros are of the same affinity.

  I think you missed the point entirely.   As I said, this baker was not being denied a right to legally discriminate.

 "In a post-truth environment, false perceptions can hurt us all."  Really?  Think about the statistics on mass shootings.  The vast majority -- not all, but a vast majority -- of the mass shooters have been white.  The statistic that most people know is that most mass shooters were white.  Yet the left, in an effort to appear reasonable and inclusive, has made the claim that the shooter was not "a white male".  Yet, the shooter was a white male.  How can this be?  Simply because a crowd of people was present does not make it "a public gathering".  The "a gathering" part means that it was a public gathering.

 "The fact that Trump was able to draw support from the KKK and neo-Nazis by manipulating them into doing his bidding reveals a dark side of the president that the public has yet to see.

 Yes, but what does it matter?  It's not like you could have chosen any other profession.  You're a gay man trapped in the body of a straight man.  It's a mind game, and like all mind games, you need to know the rules before you play.  The rules about homosexuals are no different than the rules about any other class of society's members:  we make fun of those who are rich, famous, healthy, etc., but we don't make fun of the homeless, mentally ill, drug addicts, etc.  Some people think that homosexuality is a choice, like heterosexuality is a choice.

 A few things to remember about this: 1) The shooter was a Muslim born in Uzbekistan who moved to the United States with his parents as a small child. He had been a law-abiding, upstanding member of his community & nothing at all about him indicated that he was about to commit any violence.  2) A year or two ago, Muslim leaders in the United States and Canada received a very loud and clear message from their Imams that their fellow Muslims living in the West should prepare to face attacks by "lone wolves." 3) The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and just trying to earn a living like everyone else. But every year thousands of Muslim men and women are brutally murdered in terrorist attacks in the United States and Canada. And we're not allowed to talk about it. 4) The Muslim community in Quebec was very welcoming to the new immigrants and would have been supportive and appreciative of the extra security.

Their inability to put in place a simple rule of "No Media" has made the already bad situation in the GOP much, much worse.  The Republican party has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at them in an effort to "shake up" the race with a less racist but fitter, more economically viable candidate in Trump.   It hasn't worked.  While I fully understand their pain, there is only so much they can do to right the ship before it capsizes completely.

 "But what the bishops do have control over is how Catholics vote. Since the mid-1960s, the Catholic vote has generally been moving in line with the GOP.

And this from a columnist at the NYT.    Here's an idea:  Let the bishops actually write articles about issues, and stop forcing their political beliefs down our throats.    We don't have to like their political agenda, and we don't have to agree with everything they say, but maybe they could stop trying to shout their ideas down our ears.

 It seems that we are still living in the 60's, where women were dressing like sluts, walking around the city on the streets wearing provocative clothing, and being totally exposed.

 This "guiding principle" reminds me of the old saying, "Those who can afford to have sex without protection, should have sex."  How can you not see the inherent contradiction in that statement?

 "The baker refused to discuss the specifics of how he would apply his beliefs to a gay couple entering his shop to have a wedding cake. He instead offered to sell them a cake and a service to have a homosexual wedding."  No, the baker refused to design a cake that supported or promoted something he did not agree with.  There is no debate that homosexuals do not have a right to privacy.  No where in the Constitution is there any mention of sexual orientation.  The baker would be within his rights to stop making wedding cakes if he owned a bakery and decided to discriminate based on sexual orientation.  I would venture to guess that there are many bakers who would sell their services to a heterosexual couple wanting a cake decorated to say "gay wedding" instead of "Christian wedding."  The couple that requested the cake and the baker must now decide if they will move forward with their lawsuit.    I hope they do.

 I believe that homophobia is defined more as a prejudicial attitude towards persons who are LGBT.  For example, I think that people who think that homosexuality should be illegal because "it's a choice", and also people who think that LGBT people are mentally ill or defective are homophobic.  However, I have no idea whether these people actually believe these things or not.   For this reason, I understand where Paprocki is coming from in his disapproval of homosexual actions.  It may very well be that he sincerely believes these things, but that does not make them right.     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning christian people: The US is a nation of laws and a nation of constitutionally mandated, enumerated rights.

 No, that's not what I said. I said that the Church teaches that sex is reserved for married men and women because sex is how babies are created.

 I agree with you that the government should not be involved in telling people what to wear.  However, as a Catholic, I can't abide by a dress code that excludes women from participating equally in liturgy.  Our church, as an institution, has moved too far away from the gospel.  Decades ago, our priests were barefoot and didn't wear clerical collars.  Now, our priests must wear them and be bound by church regulations that, in most cases, conflict with the natural law.

 What a load of revisionist crap.  The word 'transgenderism' was coined in the late 1800's,  by a guy who felt that men and women were intrinsically different and shouldn't be lumped together under the label'male' or 'female'.  That guy, was a pedophile.    And although he was a gay man, he specifically advocated for the rights of gay people to have sex with children.  He didn't need to say anything about sexual orientation, because the activists he was working for at the time didn't regard sexuality as a relevant topic for discussion.    You can keep changing the label, but the thing is, it's not a real term, it's a tool used by activists to try to legitimize the wrong-think that they are trying to promote.     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning LGBTQ people: I just can't stand back and not reply to

 It would be easier if the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, instead of their being so tightly bound by tradition, actually had the courage of their convictions and openly and completely denounced the moral chaos and chaos of the sexual anarchy, sodomy, and promiscuity that they have embraced.

 I am not sure why you are referring to the Church in the third person.

 No.  "Gay Pride" began in the early 1980's  as a  protest march against the very  notion that  "Gay" meant simply  "Gay" or "homosexual".

 I hate to tell you this but being gay isn't a behavior.  If it was,  society would be in a state of complete social regression.

 No, I'm not gay.  I would much rather have women priests than any straight men.    But since you brought up the pervasiveness of sexual abuse...  Yes, the Catholic Church has a horrific history with pedophilia.  But the problem faced by the Church today is the opposite of that.  Child rape has fallen out of favor among the laity, and while it is still often found in the upper levels, is not as prevalent as it was before the sexual revolution.    Additionally, while the Church may have been more tolerant of homosexuality back in the 1950's and 60's, that has changed over the past 25 years.

 This is another ridiculous article from a gay newspaper that tries to normalize same-sex marriage.  The reality is that there is no difference between male and female humans.  There are anatomical differences, but they are minor.  If someone is born with a male body, that doesn't mean that person will be attracted to other males.  Males and females are both attracted to people of their own gender.  This is a cultural issue, not a biological one.  As long as we are discussing cultural differences, we must also be fair about biological differences.  If someone is born with a female body, that doesn't mean that person will be attracted to other females.  Indeed, it is the opposite!

 The homosexual lobby has spent years trying to make gay sex acceptable to mainstream America.   In 1994, they won by convincing the world that homosexuals should be considered part of "normal" society.   This is the same tactic that is being used to convince Americans to legalize marijuana.     When we give in to these people, we are agreeing that their lifestyle is "normal."   What a ridiculous thing to say.    It is a falsehood to say that people can't be harmed by drugs.  Marijuana harms no one, but people can and do smoke it and get addicted.   That is a fact.  Addiction is a fact.   People who use marijuana are not harmed by it in the same way that a heroin addict is harmed.   They can't physically harm anyone, but they can mentally harm anyone with their use of it.   That is a fact as well.

As a matter of fact in some areas you could have a very good income in one area and a pittance in another. How many other jobs can you really move to another area and still get paid the same or better.

If you read the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in the Oka decision, there is a clear statement that public demonstrations in such cases must be kept smaller.  So there's your answer.

A good solution would be to have victims of abuse by clergy undergo a psychosexual exam to determine if they are likely to develop phobias or other psychological issues from the abuse.  Any priest who abuses such a test should be removed from active ministry immediately.

 The Church has been trying to "work out" its relationship with the homosexual culture for a long, long time.

 This is an interesting topic, and it's easy to get caught up in the rhetoric.

But, if one of us goes off and does something really stupid, we will deal with it seriously.  If we want to be Catholic and not Protestant, then we have to get serious about the nature of our differences and how they impact our relationship with God

 I find that the "gay agenda" is promoted by homosexuals, who have convinced society and their ilk that homosexuality is normal and beneficial, and that this is somehow not a conspiracy against them.       You can't tell me that heterosexuals haven't had their basements raided by closeted homosexuals, who are promoting their "gay agenda", which is nothing but a ploy to have us throw away our morality, which as we all know, isn't a very important part of being human anymore.  I find that the homosexuals are using "gay" as a derogatory label, as if they were frigid or sick.      Homosexuality was originally a sexual perversion that was embraced by persons of low morals and early education.  That is why they are in the closet.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning muslim people: I think we both agree there is a problem that needs

 It's a homosexual hate crime.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning female people: Not necessarily. As I've said before, the Church is losing members at a very high rate and there's no real indication that this rate will slow down in the future. Youth who are not in the Church are not necessarily staying away because they aren't Catholic - quite the opposite, in fact, many young people who are non-Catholic are leaving the Church due to a dissatisfaction with the way the Church is today.  If you're not Catholic why are you staying? It may not be because you're sinful, but there are many other more important issues affecting your spiritual life.

They do not have rights under the law that apply in equal measure to every other citizen, including women.   The US is an intensely racist country, probably the most thoroughly white supremacist society on earth.

We are socialized to want "things" for no other reason than they are "nice" and "not want for anything".   Society gives women no voice, no say and no power. That is by design.

   The real travesty here, though, is that the Obama administration will not even use the term "radical Islam" to describe the enemy.    Sure, the religious component is there, but you would think that a country with over 1.7 billion Muslims, many of them well educated and prosperous,  would be more likely to have found a way to work together than this.  Sadly, the US seems intent on finding enemies where there are none.    The US seems to have swallowed the idea that, rather than face squarely the threat of radical Islam, we can focus on the many bad actors that are, well, only "individuals."    Let's face it, there are plenty of them.   And they pose a grave danger to US citizens, both of them law abiding and those who would not be.

However, if I were to suddenly start celebrating Mass at noon on a Sunday, people would either ignore me or be angry at me.  I understand that people have their own ideas and beliefs about how rituals should happen and when they should happen, but most people don't celebrate Mass on a Sunday unless they are very, very sick.  I guess my point is that for the most part, it's not a big deal for most people to celebrate Mass once in a while.    But it IS for the people who are so upset about the change that it is affecting their lives to suddenly start celebrating Mass on

 No, I am not gay nor do I have same-sex attraction.  What the Church teaches about homosexuals is beyond dispute.  The Church condemns homosexual acts as contrary to the natural law.  The homosexual act is intrinsically disordered and the failure to rectify it is a willful violation of the primary purpose of the sexual act, which is the creation of new life.

 Oh, I'm sure we can all agree with this.  The fact that the vast majority of the sexual acts  among homosexuals are  voluntary,  and that they would not engage in sexual activity if they did not feel it was permitted by the Church,  makes it all but impossible for us to view their actions as objectively sinful.  Of course,  they could be committing sinful acts with no apparent concern for their own actions.

 So you believe that the Church should change teaching based on whims and trends?  That is no different than saying that the Church should change teaching based on the whims and trends of pop culture?  Both are ridiculous.  The Church is not a secular humanist organization.

 What an astonishingly idiotic editorial.  No wonder North America is consumed with a culture of "us versus them", of racial animosity fueled by the demonization of "whiteness".  The editorial fails to note that Canada has by and large been an island of social peace and relative racial harmony since the 1960s.  Other than a brief moment of racial hatred during the referendum campaign, a mere 18 months ago, there has been no generalized fear or hatred directed at the "white" population of Canada.

 A good half of the anti-abortion protesters are women, and a good half of them wear a niqab.   They are practicing Muslims, but not jihadist Muslims.  The practice of Islam, unlike that of Christianity and Judaism, is to offer compassion and acceptance of differences.  Instead of using laws and threats to try to force tolerance, Muslims instead practice love and dialogue, like the Qu'ran.

 It is very much a choice now.  I think many gay Catholic men and women would appreciate it if the Church would allow them to marry in the same way that straight Catholics are allowed to.

Gay people are denied the sacrament of Matrimony,    Women are treated as second class citizens, denied access to all 7 sacraments, etc.   And there are gay people who are attracted to members of the same sex.     The Church doesn't help with this by labeling gay people as "intrinsically disordered" and "intrinsically immoral."    By not supporting gay marriage, the Church is helping to perpetuate this injustice and the hate that drives it.    The hate isn't Jesus.   It's those who would deny justice to others because of religious beliefs.     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning muslim people: The problem isn't Islam.  It's the radicals.

 So in other words, you approve of gay men having sex with other men.

 I think the baker's case is really about religious liberty and the right of the individual to be free from government control and coercion.

I am curious what religious group the couple thinks is the largest religious group in the US?   I can also assume that they do not think that their religious beliefs are the majority in the country, so they are willing to sacrifice their freedom to accommodate the majority in order to gain a few votes.

 The problem is he is mixing it with other forms of hate and is encouraging others to join in.

You're arguing for a system where speech that offends, denigrates or makes fun of someone's belief system is criminal.  This isn't about freedom of speech.

 In my humble opinion, any priest who advocates for or participates in the celebration of homosexual unions is a grave evil and totally unworthy to function as a priest.

 The Church does teach that homosexual acts are sinful.  That is the teaching of the Church.  It does not follow that the teaching is to be considered settled science.  That is a false equivalence.    As to the fertilization issue,  again the Church does not teach that the sex act is required for life.  Life is derived from two parent parents.  Biologically that is male and female.  Therefore,  the question is not the anatomical fact of whether two life forms can become one.

Now we have them pushing in the School of Religion, where the homosexuals want to be able to force their views and violate the privacy of our children in the name of religious freedom.  It is clear this is all about sexual freedom for homosexuals.  How in the world can a person believe in a moral cause for the poor, sick and oppressed if they are in fact harming and humiliating those same people?     <BOS>  Write a toxic comment mentioning white people: This writer is a hypocrite.

 I have to say that there is a certain dark comedy in that subset of conservatives who  claim that gay sex is so bad because it leads to AIDS, which in turn will destroy our nation's civilization.  Seriously, what is the point of trying to prevent AIDS when it will ultimately be cured anyway?     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: I'm with you.  It seems to me that the Church can get people to stop procreating by just pointing out that sex is bad and that people who are responsible and committed to keeping themselves from getting pregnant are good, and people who aren't responsible and committed to not getting pregnant are bad, and that the former are all sinners because they choose to be responsible and committed to avoiding pregnancy, while the latter choose to be irresponsible and not avoid getting pregnant.  This isn't a difficult message to deliver and I suspect the message gets through.  The problem is that there

 You think that what happened to TG people is bad?   Have you watched TG people in combat?   They are the most marginalized in our society.

 It is a safe bet that no one has ever shot a person in the back while running away, the fact that no one has likely shot at all in the last 50 years says it all, your paranoia is comical.

I don't want to be misunderstood, but I am a staunch supporter of the 2nd Amendment.  Yes, it limits the power of certain individuals but it also protects the rest of us from tyrannical government.     Your claim that people in the US need to lose their sleep over the issue is a bit disingenuous, it is actually the leftists who are obsessed with losing the right to own semi-automatic rifles that were designed to kill many many people very quickly.

To the contrary, I said that I thought it possible--indeed highly probable--that there are some who think the Catechism of the Catholic Church is in error.  I never wrote that the Church was perfect. Far from it. My point is this: that, while the Church's teaching on contraception is regrettable, the Church's teaching about sex in general is sound. That is, there is nothing in the teaching that is obviously false or absurd, and so we should trust the teaching.  And you're absolutely correct that the Church's teaching on artificial contraception is a matter of the internal forum.

 So glad to hear of your "family's" acceptance and tolerance.    Not a word about the gay-hating religious nutjobs who shot 50 gay people in the gay nightclub in Orlando last month.

They all think gays are sinful, and their main argument against gay marriage is that it will destroy our culture.

 Homosexuality and transgenderism is a perverted sin against nature, just like heterosexuality and idolatry.

 This editorial by the G&M is ridiculous.  Why is it that so many posters here insist on using the m-word when referring to Trudeau (and other males)?  I think it's because the m-word is an extremely confrontational word and it is used by people who are overly aggressive.  Perhaps it's because many of these people were raised by people who constantly told them, "You're stupid. Your opinion doesn't matter.  Stop complaining.  It's pathetic."  I think this is a symptom of the disease afflicting the Western world - a disease which is a direct result of the decline of the Catholic Church and the influx of immigrants from countries which have no concept of the concept of the separation of Church and State.

 So you think Jesus was a homophobe (or was that  the Pharisees)?  I've often thought that religious conservatives (like those in the Catholic Church) have a kind of Stockholm syndrome when it comes to their own sexual practices.  They think that being gay or transgender means that you are sinful, even when your sexual attraction is strong enough to resist the attraction.  The Church has never taught that being a gay or transgender means that a person is incapable of having an active homosexual or transgender attraction.  The Church's approach to these matters has been and continues to be the same -- treat everyone fairly, with love and compassion, while at the same time, living the moral teachings of the Church.

 Well, at least there are fewer and fewer priests left in the United States and other western countries to provide Mass.  The Holy See is shrinking by about 1/3rd every decade, and is shrinking by about 1/4rd every decade as it loses most of its Catholic population, which is what the priests left behind.   I think if the Vatican were to get serious about the poor, it would stop hemorrhaging money from it's religious coffers, stop selling indulgences and be serious about helping the poor.  And what is it that it does with the money it is receiving from the USCCB?  Other than continuing to buy indulgences in the millions and giving it to the rich, the answer is 'nothing.'  The money goes to the Vatican's bank, the bank that is used for buying indulgences -- and the rich people who have the money to buy all the indulgences.

 I've been reading about this gay pedophile scandal for a couple of years now, it is getting worse by the day and it could have a massive effect on Canada's tourism industry (more than just gay pedophile tourists).     The Catholic church was very slow to get on the case, very reluctant to speak out, and now these 2 men (that Pope Francis knew about 2 years ago) are the tip of the iceberg, pedophiles in the church being protected and emboldened by the catholic government and many in the catholic media.     There are 2 options here: either the catholic church can show it is not corrupt by cleaning house and firing all it's pedophile priests and bishops, and making them appear as martyrs, or it can show it is corrupt and still protect these pedophiles by keeping the abusers out of the civil system, using it as a means to keep quiet about their crimes

That said, the desire to have sex with multiple partners at a single venue is a temptation that seems to predate our existence.  I think it goes beyond "lust", although it is certainly a component.

However, for those with an intrinsic need to use sex as a tool to power or status, it can be a powerful force that can blind us to other's needs.

 This is all very well, except for the part where the article says that 70% of Canadians are in support of some kind of  immigration reform.   Why 70%?

They just want to go shopping, get their fill of TV propaganda and then go home to their comfortable beds at night.    A 70% majority, a pretty good idea of what Canadians think, yet they're completely oblivious to the reality of the situation.  A 60% majority, not so good.

 It is quite clear that the Democratic Party is in the thrall ( literally ) of  Antifa, a violent anarchist collective dedicated to violence and social chaos.    Consider the source.

No, it is the left, marching with a group of violent anarchists dedicated to promoting anarchy and mayhem, chanting "Jews will not replace us", and spewing vitriol against millions of their fellow Americans because they happen to be white.

There is so much hatred out there, it is not reasonable to expect a homosexual clergy member to be protected.  It seems like a very large firing offense to go against their religion in order to keep their job.    I've known priests who have had to turn in their clerical garb to work at par

 Your post is a bit misleading, in my opinion.  Yes, it's true that in the past priests used contraception.  But the Church has never had a ban on using contraception.  As for gay priests, the Pontifical Commission in 1976 determined that "the number of gay priests is negligible, if any." The Pontifical Secret prohibits such discussion, so there's that.  What is not true, and is being widely repeated by anti-Catholic bigots, is that the Church teaches that all sex outside of a man and woman committed with consenting partners is intrinsically evil.  This is an integral part of the Church's teaching on human sexuality, which is based on the human dignity of every person.  This teaching doesn't change with the times.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning white people: I'm pretty sure that most "progressives" have absolutely no problem with white supremacist ideologies and racism.

 The baker who is asking to legally discriminate, and the gay couple he is asking to be legally discriminated against, have the same right as anyone else to refuse service.

 The gay agenda must be really, really hard to follow sometimes.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: The problem here is that the Church regards homosexuality as a "lifestyle" choice, something that many people consider an affront to their own dignity. In doing so, the Church is acting like a pharisee, judging people for their personal choices and lifestyles, and imposing her values and beliefs on them.  If Catholics want a Church that is accepting and supportive of their choices, than they need to seriously reconsider their ideas of what it means to be a Catholic, and whether or not the Catholic Church really has any place in the private lives of its members.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning christian people: As a life-long Democrat who voted Republican for the first time in 2010 (Yes, I voted for Obama's first term!), let me tell you my perspective of where we are

 You might be right about some of it, but I seriously doubt that the majority of the homeless are gay men.    If they are, we have a serious problem.   It's also possible that the majority of the violence may actually come from the fringe gay community.     It is also likely true that a large percentage of the homeless are those with mental health issues, and that these often manifest in a variety of ways.   It's also true that many of the people engaging in illegal activity are frequently marginal and/or deeply spiritual.    The reality is that there is a serious homeless problem and that the main solutions lie in the prevention of homelessness, which means a reduction in the number of people living on the street and in emergency shelters.   If you want to help a gay homeless person, go help them find a apartment, or a house through an agency such as Catholic Community Services.

 You're right. The church should ordain only men.  That way, if any women were to be ordained, the whole church would be required to pay any costs associated with her ministry, and her livelihood, for as long as she wants to continue ministry.

 Yes, the bishops, and the Trump administration, and the folks in the American Psychological Association who are pushing this BS, all need to get a grip.

These people should be getting the psychological help they need to get better.   By insisting on a medical model for defining what is "a sickness" - in this case trans people as a group are being used as human experiments.  There is no doubt that the trans people involved in this controversy feel they are being used, but so do all the straight people who are not "sick."

 "The bishops of the Catholic Church are indeed negligent in failing to speak out against the rampant sexual abuses of the clergy by priests and bishops."  Absolutely true and what is worse, is that most bishops do nothing about it because they are part of the clergy union which protects the clerical predator class.  If the pope said nothing, then he is just as much a part of the clergy union as the rest of them.  The only way for the catholic church to truly clean house would be for the laity to act on their anger and boycott the church until they get their just desserts.

 If you think the bishops and other Catholic clerics are dumb enough to give the Republican party an inch on abortion, you are equally dumb and arrogant to think the bishops will suddenly start caring about the poor. As far as the rest of your comment:  Abortion is the easy (and, in most cases, morally justifiable) target for the "culture war."  After all, killing a baby doesn't really affect society at large, especially if the baby is dead.  Killing an unborn baby does, however, affect society and its inhabitants directly and immediately.  This is true no matter which "culture" you argue exists in a particular society.

 The bishops aren't stupid.  They know full well what a joke transgenderism is.  And they'd love to get rid of it, but they know first hand what a pain it is to do so.  So they use the "politically correct" argument:  if a transgender guy is born female, he must be allowed to join the military.  But a female who is born male cannot join the military -- no exception.      The contradiction is so glaringly obvious, the bishops actually said it themselves:  "A transgender person is eligible to join the military if he or she was born a female and now identifies as a male."  http://tinyurl.com/lv6amzn  So the real question is not "Do we allow transgender military members?"

 You can't really blame him for not knowing the background. The baker is operating in the dark, and he is just guessing.

But because politics is involved?  It is so much easier to just embrace bigotry. No one is asking the baker to bake a cake for a white supremacists rally, nor are they making cakes for Muslim or Buddhist or atheist or any of the other myriad of contingents for which the baker might be asked to decorate a cake.

 This is just another in the long line of lies, deceit and deceit to try and garner public support for the homosexual agenda.

 No, you are wrong about what is a "gay cake".  It is a wedding cake.

 You don't see it because you are so immersed in the progressive world view.  But for me, it is very clear.  Homosexuality, for instance, has a very clear genetic basis.  People who engage in acts which are intrinsically disordered will not have sex unless their motivation is to experience pleasure.  That is why they engage in acts which are disordered.  People who engage in acts which are intrinsically good will not have sex unless their motivation is to experience good pleasure.    Two men or two women really aren't going to engage in sodomy to get their rocks off - at most they will roll around on the grass and exchange a few meaningless kisses.  But that only occurs if they have not yet entered into a sexual relationship.    One can easily see how that can lead to many situations where it is not healthy for either person, and can even lead to disease and even death.

If she is the victim, then her assailant must also be the victim, and vice versa. In this case, both the girl and the guy are equally at fault. They are both drunk, and neither of them knew how to honor the consent of their partner. Neither one of them should be drinking if they are going to have sex, let alone with someone they don't know. When have they ever been accused of rape? Never.   Why do we keep blaming the victim? As a man, I would never rape a woman that I know, but if I had, and I could, then I would, too. Not to minimize the harm a woman can do to a man, but if you don't know what you're doing, then

 It is so sad that the gay lobby feels so entitled to redefine what is normal and what is not.

Canada did not become a secular society overnight. In fact the religion played a minor role until the middle of the 19th century. At that time a few Christian churches in Canada offered service in local communities, mostly to French and English immigrants but also to many Catholics and members of many other religions. A few Muslims also found a niche although it was not so well served by the larger churches. As time went on the churches began to close their doors to new immigrants as well as accommodate those who had been previously excluded.     <BOS>  Write a neutral comment mentioning white people: I don't understand the comment "if we stop offending people

 So a gay priest is just like any other priest, except that he isn't gay?   That explains a lot.    I'm not against gay weddings at all.  I'm not a hater.

Why not just set up shop in the public sector and be paid for doing what they do?  Oh, I guess it's because I'm not a hypocrite.  I don't celebrate mass;  I attend weekly for about an hour.

Are you trying to make the case for more men being abused, by making the ludicrous claim that women are always the victims?  Do you think men are helpless, or naive, or that they cannot say no to unwanted advances?  Men are not sheep.  We do not always listen when women tell us to stop something.   We have a conscience, and we do not always follow the commands of our Church.  Yes, some men do abuse women.  That is as it should be.  However, to assert that all men are abusers, or all men are helpless, or all men are naive, is an insult to men

It is disgusting that people in Western countries want to discriminate against those who do not follow their particular beliefs.  This is not the free-market, we are not a secular state, people are not free to chose according to their beliefs, and no one is forced to do anything.

 You're right.  It's about time someone called out the hypocrisy of the church.  No, we gays are not welcome in the church.

For those with a physical or mental disability, it can be very helpful.  For those with the opposite condition, or those who are just plain scared, it can be a horrible and terrifying book.

 No, I am not gay.  The point is that heterosexuals should not have sex unless they want to get impregnated.  That is a function of personal responsibility and not some kind of divine right on God's part.    The Church has a lot of explaining to do regarding why it thinks sex is a right that heterosexuals should have and how it can justify violating that right on a daily basis.  It is ridiculous to claim that sex is a gift from the gods and it is ridiculous to claim that people have a right to it that is unearned.    There is a natural order to the sexual act that people are called to.    It is nature, not immaturity, which makes sex a gift to the person who has sex.      Sex is something that heterosexuals can choose to enjoy or not, but not because of some call from the gods.
